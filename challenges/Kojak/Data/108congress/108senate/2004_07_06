Mr. President, I do want to welcome everyone back \nfollowing the Fourth of July recess. Today, we return to business for a \nrelatively brief, under-3-week legislative period, but what I know will \nbe a very productive legislative period. This morning we will proceed \nto executive session and the consideration of J. Leon Holmes to be a \nU.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas. Pursuant to \nthe agreement reached prior to adjourning, there will be up to 6 hours \nof debate today before the vote on the confirmation of this nomination. \nI anticipate that vote occurring sometime around 5:30 today, and that \nwill be the first vote of the day.\n  We also expect to consider additional judicial nominations throughout \nthis period prior to the August recess, and we will be scheduling those \nnominations as they become available.\n  Following the vote on the Holmes nomination, we will begin \nconsideration of the class action fairness legislation, and that debate \nwill begin after the vote and continue tonight. This class action bill \nis a bipartisan bill, and I hope we will be able to consider it in a \nfair and expeditious way. As I mentioned, this is an abbreviated \nlegislative period due to the respective party conventions which begin \nlater this month. There is a lot of work to do over the next 3 weeks, \nincluding consideration of the appropriations bills.\n  The best way for us to ensure we complete the class action measure is \nfor the Senate to focus on related amendments on that bill. The issue \nhas been before this body previously; therefore, I hope we can consider \nrelevant amendments and ultimately pass this legislation with a large \nbipartisan vote. If this bill becomes a vehicle for every unrelated \nissue that is stored in people's desks and in their minds, I am afraid \nthis abbreviated schedule will not make it possible to do that. And if \nwe insist upon offering a lot of unrelated amendments, the ultimate \nconsideration of the bill clearly will be impossible because of the \ntime involved.\n  Having said that, I will be working with the Democratic leadership to \nsee if we can finish this bill in a reasonable period of time. Again, I \nwelcome back all of my colleagues. It will be a very busy session over \nthe next 3 weeks. I ask in advance for everyone's patience and \ncooperation during this period.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if the majority leader will yield?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me welcome him back and express the hope that we can \nwork together on a number of issues this work period. Could the \nmajority leader give us some indication as to what we might expect once \nthe class action bill has been completed? What other issues do you \nexpect to take during this 3-week period and in what order of sequence? \nIf the majority leader could share that with us, it would be helpful as \nwell.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as we get back and do our planning over the \ncourse of the next several hours and\n\n[[Page S7530]]\n\ndays, we will do just that. As I mentioned, we have the class action \nbill. Once we complete that, we have appropriations bills. We are, at \nsome juncture, going to consider the Federal marriage amendment, and \nthere will be a number of other issues. But as they come forward, I \nwould be happy to discuss it with the leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/06/senate-section/article/S7530-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              LEON HOLMES\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes on what the \nSenate will be addressing over the next several hours. That is the \nconsideration of the nomination of Leon Holmes to be a Federal district \ncourt judge in the Eastern District of Arkansas. His nomination has \nbeen languishing since January 2003. It is long past time that the \nSenate give Mr. Holmes the up-or-down vote he deserves.\n  Mr. Holmes is known in his home State of Arkansas as a brilliant and \nimpartial jurist who follows the law. His nomination has brought \nsubstantial opposition from some liberal activists in Washington. But \nin Arkansas, he has earned respect and support from liberals and \nconservatives alike.\n  These supporters include Kent Rubens, who led the fight to strike \ndown Arkansas's pro-life laws in the wake of Roe v. Wade. Rubens writes \nin a letter to Chairman Hatch and Senator Leahy on March 21, 2003:\n\n       I cannot think of anyone who is better qualified to serve . \n     . . As someone who has represented the pro-choice view, I ask \n     that you urge your members to support this confirmation.\n\n  Or you can listen to this letter from Ellen Woods Harrison to \nChairman Hatch and Senator Leahy:\n\n       I am a female attorney in Little Rock, Arkansas. I am a \n     life-long Democrat and am also pro-choice . . . I commend Mr. \n     Holmes to you. He is a brilliant man, a great lawyer and a \n     fine person.\n\n  And the editorial board of the Arkansas Democrat Gazette supports Mr. \nHolmes' nomination. They write:\n\n       What distinguishes Mr. Holmes is the rare blend \n     of qualities he brings to the law--intellect, scholarship, \n     conviction, and detachment . . . He would not only bring \n     distinction to the bench, but a promise of greatness.\n\n  I should also note that Arkansas's Democratic Senators, Mark Pryor \nand Blanche Lincoln, strongly support Leon Holmes.\n  In light of this broad support for Mr. Holmes, one wonders if some \nactivists in Washington are more interested in a witch hunt than in \nfairness. This body should not erect religious tests for judges. One's \npersonal religious beliefs--in Leon Holmes' case, his Catholic \nbeliefs--should not disqualify anyone from serving on the bench. I fear \nthat the arguments put forth by some of my colleagues may lead to the \ndisqualification of judicial nominees who are Catholic or Baptist or \nwho hold deeply held religious views.\n  Nominees should be judged on their temperament and their ability to \nimpartially uphold the law. The Framers of the Constitution wisely \nrejected religious tests for officeholders. I would hate to see this \nbody try to upend that wise judgment of our Founders.\n  A judge should know how to separate his personal views from those of \nthe law, and Leon Holmes' record of impartiality speaks for itself.\n  Mr. Holmes finished law school at the top of his class. He was \ninducted into Phi Beta Kappa while a doctoral student at Duke \nUniversity. His doctoral dissertation discusses the political \nphilosophies of W.E.B. DuBois and Booker T. Washington, and it analyzes \nthe effort Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. made to reconcile their \ndivergent views. Mr. Holmes was habeas counsel for death row inmate \nRicky Ray Rector, a mentally retarded man whose execution then-Governor \nClinton refused to commute during the 1992 Presidential election.\n  Clearly, his record speaks of a man who is compassionate, thoughtful, \nand fairminded. Taken together, I believe Leon Holmes will be a just \nand impartial jurist. He deserves the Senate's support, and I trust \nthat my colleagues will join me in voting to confirm him later today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/06/senate-section/article/S7530-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we hear a lot these days about how \nessential optimism is to economic growth and progress. These \ndiscussions remind me of that old saying that ``an optimist is someone \nwho believes we're living in the best of all possible worlds, and a \npessimist is someone who fears this may be true.'' By those \ndefinitions, there are probably very few optimists or pessimists in \nAmerica because we all know that America's economy today is not the \nbest possible.\n  This morning, I want to say a few words about how we can strengthen \nour economy and create new jobs and a brighter future for hard-working \nmiddle-class families in America.\n  We are all relieved that the economy has finally started adding more \njobs each month than it is shedding. After 2\\1/2\\ years in which our \neconomy lost jobs every month, these new jobs are good news--especially \nfor the millions of Americans who are looking for work. But there are \nstill over a million fewer jobs in America today than there were 4 \nyears ago. In addition, the latest job-growth figures, released last \nFriday, were considerably weaker than most analysts had predicted. That \ndisappointing news reminds us that optimism alone is not a national \neconomic policy. What we need is realism.\n  Many proposals have been introduced in this Senate to create jobs and \nto help people who have lost jobs find new ones. We owe it to the \nAmerican people to consider a variety of ideas. And in weighing our \neconomic options, the question we ought to ask ourselves is not whether \nan idea is optimistic or pessimistic. The question we should ask about \nevery proposal is: Does it do right by America? Will it lead to the \nkind of economic growth that benefits all Americans, not just the \nfortunate few? Does it provide incentives to encourage companies to \ncreate jobs in America--rather than encouraging companies to ship \nAmerican jobs overseas? Does it help the people and communities that \nhave lost jobs these last 4 years? Does it give them the tools and the \nopportunities to replace those lost jobs with better jobs? Or does it \njust write them off? Does it do right by the millions of middle-class \nfamilies who are working harder every year but are still losing ground \neconomically? Optimism alone can't stretch a paycheck, or pay a \nmortgage, or put your children through college.\n  Some people point to the fact that the economy has finally started to \ncreate jobs as proof that we have solved the jobs problem. They say \nthat all we have to do now is stay the course and be patient. I wish \nthe people who say that would come to North Sioux City, SD, and some of \nthe communities that surround it. Until very recently, North Sioux City \nwas the headquarters for Gateway computers, one of the largest private \nemployers in South Dakota. Four years ago, Gateway employed 6,000 \npeople in the Siouxland area around North Sioux City. But the recession \nand the shakeout in the technology sector hit Gateway hard, as it did \nmany tech companies. Today, only 1,700 people work for Gateway in the \nNorth Sioux City area.\n  I am not sure if it is a blessing or a curse, but the job losses at \nGateway didn't come in one crushing blow. They came instead as a steady \nstream of layoffs. While none was large enough to grab national media \nattention, the cumulative impact of these layoffs on the families and \ncommunities in the Siouxland area around North Sioux City has been \ndevastating. Some of the laid-off workers received severance packages. \nSome have found new jobs that pay less. Many are still looking for \nwork. There are many more good workers today in the Siouxland area than \nthere are good jobs.\n  These times are tough even for many people who are working. Over the \npast year, real weekly earnings actually fell for the average worker, \naccording to the Department of Labor. In South Dakota and across \nAmerica, workers are earning less than they did a year ago, but they \nare paying more--for gas, health care, tuition, and other basic \nnecessities.\n  Even with the recent easing of prices, gas still costs 30 cents a \ngallon more in South Dakota today than it did a year ago.\n\n[[Page S7531]]\n\n  Health care costs continue to rise by double digits every year. More \nemployers are being forced to scale back the health care benefits they \noffer their workers; others are dropping health care coverage \naltogether. According to a new report by Families USA, 27 percent of \nSouth Dakotans today have no health insurance. Across America, 44 \nmillion people are in that category. And most of the people who are \nuninsured get up and go to work every day. They work hard. Some of them \nwork two and three jobs to support their families. But they can't \nafford health insurance. You don't have to be an optimist to believe \nthat we can do better than that.\n  Last week, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first \ntime in 4 years as protection against inflation. Most analysts predict \nthat we will see additional rate hikes in the future. And the enormous \nbudget deficits built up these last 4 years will put even more pressure \non interest rates, making it harder and more expensive for families to \nborrow money and to pay off mortgages, loans and credit card balances.\n  The Gateway workers who have lost their jobs, and middle-class \nfamilies across South Dakota and across America, don't lack for \noptimism. But it is not easy to be patient when you have lost your job \nand your unemployment benefits, and your savings are getting low. It is \nnot easy when you are working harder every year and getting deeper in \ndebt.\n  Middle-class families across America are getting squeezed between \nstagnant wages and rising costs. They are being hurt by an economy that \nis creating jobs too slowly to fill the demand, and by the fact that \nthe new jobs pay, on average, 21 percent less than the jobs they \nreplaced.\n  The choices we make must do right by these families. Middle-class \nfamilies need more--and deserve more--than soothing words of optimism. \nThey deserve action from the Federal Government--smart, sustained, \nrealistic, bipartisan action to help people who have lost jobs find new \nones and to make sure that American companies and workers can compete \nfor, and win, the jobs of the future.\n\n  One of the fastest, easiest ways we can reduce the economic squeeze \non middle-class families is by protecting overtime pay. The Senate \nvoted overwhelmingly last year to reject the administration's \noutrageous effort to deny overtime pay to millions of workers, and we \nrejected that misguided proposal again this year when we passed the \nSenate version of the FSC bill. Overtime pay isn't extra money; it is \nessential family income and protecting it is doing right by America. We \nneed to continue to stand together and make sure that the final FSC \nbill Congress sends to the President preserves overtime protections.\n  When it comes to helping workers whose jobs have disappeared or been \nshipped overseas, we don't need to create a new government bureaucracy. \nWe just need to invest in solutions that we know work.\n  The Commerce Department's Trade Adjustment Assistance program is one \nexample. It helps manufacturing workers who have lost jobs because of \nglobalization get back on their feet. Among other things, it provides \naccess to community college so workers can learn new job skills and it \nhelps workers maintain their health coverage until they can find work.\n  The Trade Adjustment Assistance program is a good program. The only \nproblem is, it doesn't cover service-sector workers, who are among the \nworkers hardest hit by ``outsourcing'' and ``offshoring.'' During the \ndebate on the FSC bill, the Senate considered a bipartisan proposal to \nexpand the Trade Adjustment Assistance program to help service-sector \nworkers whose jobs are being shipped to India and other low-wage \ncountries. Not only did the administration oppose our efforts to help \nthese workers get back on their feet, it continues to encourage \ncompanies to ship more jobs overseas.\n  Turning our backs on workers who are being displaced by this economic \ntransition isn't optimism. And it isn't doing right by America. We can \ndo better--by expanding the Trade Adjustment Assistance program to \nmatch the realities of today's economy and help more laid-off workers \nget back on their feet.\n  We should also extend Federal unemployment benefits for those workers \nwho have exhausted their State benefits and still can't find work. It \nis the sensible thing to do. It is the decent thing to do. It is right \nfor America. And with the average length of unemployment at a 20-year \nhigh, we need to do it now.\n  We can also do a better job of helping businesses create new jobs. \nTax cuts are one tool. But they do not, by themselves, create jobs. \nSmall businesses and start-ups need access to capital. They need \ntechnical advice. They need help developing marketing plans. In other \nwords, they need the kind of help that is provided by innovative \nprograms such as the Small Business Administration's lending and \ntechnical assistance programs, and the Treasury Department's Community \nDevelopment Financial Institutions Fund. Both of these programs have \nachieved wonderful results with limited resources. Yet the President's \nproposed budget for next year drastically reduces or eliminates funding \nfor many of their efforts. That is a mistake, and we should fix it.\n\n  Finally, EDA, the Economic Development Administration, which is part \nof the Commerce Department, was created specifically to ``alleviate \nconditions of substantial and persistent unemployment and \nunderemployment in economically distressed areas and regions.'' I have \nseen how EDA seed money can grow into real jobs in rural areas, on \nIndian reservations and in other communities in South Dakota where \nprivate lenders weren't as optimistic as the EDA about the community's \nfuture. If we are looking to reward hard work and optimism, we need to \nmake sure EDA has the resources to carry out its mission wherever it is \nneeded.\n  Around the country there must be hundreds, if not thousands, of \ncommunities like North Sioux City, where well-equipped factories stand \nidle and well-trained, highly skilled workers are waiting for an \nopportunity. Even though they have had a tough time these last few \nyears, these workers are not pessimistic about America. They believe in \nAmerica. They believe the future can be better than the past and \nthey're willing to work hard to make that happen.\n  Let's work together to show these workers that America believes in \nthem. Optimistic words are not enough. We need a comprehensive economic \nplan that does right by all Americans. We need to reduce the squeeze on \nmiddle-class families and make sure that every American worker is able \nto find work that allows them to care for their family and live in \ndignity. We have done it before. Working together, we can do it again.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/06/senate-section/article/S7531-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

One: Is the nominee \nqualified? Two: Does the nominee have the necessary experience for the \npost? Three: Will the nominee, once he or she is on the bench, be fair \nand impartial? And the fourth criteria is more of a catchall: Are there \nother circumstances--maybe his or her temperament or maybe he or she \nhas an agenda--is there something in their background that might \nprevent this person from serving?\n  Clearly, Leon Holmes is a qualified nominee. There is no doubt about \nthat. Also, clearly he has the necessary experience to serve as a \ndistrict judge in the Eastern District of Arkansas. Rightly so, people \ncan ask and should ask: Can he be fair and impartial?\n  There is no question about the fact that Leon Holmes has been a \nstrong advocate when it comes to the issue of life and choice. He is \nstrongly on the pro-life side. He has been very clear about that point. \nFor over two decades now, there is no question, there is no doubt about \nwhere Mr. Holmes stands on that important issue facing our Nation \ntoday.\n  Let's look at that issue and let's look at some statements he made \nand some things we have learned about Mr. Holmes during this nomination \nprocess.\n  First, let me say, I was attorney general in Arkansas for 4 years \nbefore I came to the Senate. As such, I can think, in 4 years of \npractice, of only one case of which I am aware that either my office or \nanybody else in the State of Arkansas handled relating to abortion and \nthat was directly on point. The fact that he would be a judge for the \nEastern District of Arkansas--we have two districts--probably would \nmean, given the number of Federal judges we have, given his age, it \nwould be very unlikely for him to ever have an abortion case.\n  Second, even if he did have an abortion case, Mr. Holmes has \nrepresented every pro-life group in the State of Arkansas--I cannot \nspeak to all of his clients, but he has represented them and has been \nvery involved with them. So undoubtedly he would have a conflict if any \nof those cases ever came before him as a judge.\n  Mr. Holmes has a very deep conviction and a genuine passion about the \nissue of when life begins and whether this country should allow women \nthe right to choose under any circumstance. It is a position that is \nbased on much thought and much reason and even much prayer.\n  I can say this: After reviewing his record very thoroughly in the \nlast year--by the way, this nomination has been pending in the Senate \nfor over a year--he has made a number of inflammatory statements, and I \nthought what I would do is read through a few of those very briefly so \nmy colleagues will understand what the controversy with Mr. Holmes is \nall about.\n  At one point, he wrote:\n\n       Concern for rape victims is a red herring because \n     conceptions from rape occur with the same frequency as \n     snow in Miami.\n\n  I could go through a series of statements he made. Let me read a \ncouple more. He, in effect, compared the pro-choice movement to some \nthings that were going on in Nazi Germany. I think that is a fair \nstatement without trying to get into the long background and quote on \nthat point.\n  Another item which has been controversial is that he wrote a piece \nfor a Catholic newspaper in Arkansas. He also cowrote it with his wife. \nIn this piece it says that a wife has the obligation to ``subordinate \nherself to her husband'' and ``to place herself under the authority of \nthe man.'' Here, again, this is a reflection of Catholic doctrine. It \nis a teaching that is found in the New Testament. It is something in \nwhich Mr. Holmes and his wife both participate. When we hear statements \nsuch as that, naturally questions are raised and people ask: Is this \nthe kind of person we want on the Federal bench?\n  If we look at most of the statements he has made about abortion and \nother subjects, not every single one, but most are at least 15 years \nold. He has apologized during the course of this nomination process, \nand, for all I know, he has already apologized for this, but he has \napologized on many occasions for some of the statements he has written \nand said.\n  In fact, if I can read some excerpts of the responses from his \nquestionnaire he answered before the Judiciary Committee. I am not \ngoing to try to read all this because there are way too many of them \nand way too long. Let me take selected excerpts.\n  At one point he said:\n\n       The sentence about rape victims--\n\n  Which I just quoted--\n\n     which was made in a letter to the editor in 1980 is \n     particularly troublesome to me from the distance of 23 years. \n     Regardless of the merits of the issue, the articulation in \n     that sentence reflects an insensitivity for which there is no \n     excuse and for which I apologize.\n\n  He goes on to say in another paragraph:\n\n       Let me be clear that Roe v. Wade, as affirmed by Casey, is \n     the law of the land. As a district judge, I would be bound to \n     follow it and would do so.\n\n  In another response about when it comes time for him to consider \nwhether he should recuse in cases, he said:\n\n       I would follow 28 U.S.C. 455 and the Code of Conduct for \n     United States Judges when making recusal decisions.\n\n  He goes on to say in another paragraph:\n\n       Roe v. Wade is the law of the land. As a judge, I would be \n     bound by oath to follow that law. I do not see how a judge \n     could follow the law but restrict the rights established by \n     the law.\n\n  In other words, he is committing over and over he is going to follow \nthe law of the land.\n  Again, in answer to another question:\n\n       I recognize the binding force of the court's holding in \n     Griswold and Eizenstat recognizing the right to privacy.\n\n  Once again, people can have a legitimate, genuine concern and can ask \nquestions about this point, but time and again he answers his critics.\n  He says later:\n\n       Roe v. Wade establishes that the constitutional right to \n     privacy includes a woman's right to have an abortion.\n\n  In another section he says:\n\n       I do not understand that the Court in Roe v. Wade contended \n     that the decision there was mandated by strict construction \n     as the term is defined above.\n\n  He is talking about this phrase in the question.\n\n       I recognize these decisions are, once again, the law of the \n     land. They are binding precedent on all courts. If I am \n     confirmed, I will do my utmost to follow these and all other \n     precedents of the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\n  Then the last couple of excerpts I would like to read are these. Here \nagain he is talking about Roe v. Wade:\n\n       As a judge, I would follow every decision of the Supreme \n     Court that has not been subsequently overruled.\n\n  How many times does he have to say that? How many times does he have \nto say he is going to follow the law?\n  I know Leon personally. Lawyers in Arkansas have worked with him, and \nthey know him personally. We have a high degree of confidence that he \nwill follow the law.\n  Something that comes through over and over with Mr. Holmes is he has \nan incredibly strong reputation for high ethical standards.\n  In fact, as a demonstration of this, at one point during the process \nhe met with Senator Lincoln and they talked about a number of issues. \nIf we know Senator Lincoln, we know she asked a\n\n[[Page S7533]]\n\nlot of hard questions and she expected clear and definitive answers, \nwhich she got.\n  At some point during the process, other things came to light he had \nnot told Senator Lincoln about or that he felt, in fairness to her and \nout of respect for her, she should know about.\n  So on his own volition, without being prompted by anyone or anything, \non April 11, 2003--this was over a year ago because this has been \npending over a year--he voluntarily wrote Senator Lincoln a letter \ntalking about some of these statements that had come out. He says in \nthe 1980s he wrote letters to the editors in newspaper columns \nregarding the abortion issue using strident and harsh rhetoric. He goes \non to say almost all of these are over 15 years old. He says, in a \nlater paragraph:\n\n       As I stated in response to written questions from Senator \n     Durbin, I am especially troubled by the sentence about rape \n     victims in a 1980 letter to the editor regarding the proposed \n     Human Life Amendment; and as I said there, regardless of the \n     merits of the issue, the articulation of that sentence \n     reflects an insensitivity for which there is no excuse and \n     for which I apologize. . . .\n\n  Here again, he is talking about something he had written over 24 \nyears ago. If we were to apply that same standard to us, if we could \nthink back 24 years before we ever were in office or even 24 years ago \nfor any of us, we would probably look back on some of our statements \nand not be real pleased with some of the things we said.\n  He goes on when he talks about a 1987 effort, when he was president \nof Arkansas Right to Life, and he says he asked a rhetorical question \nin the context of some columns and things that had been written and he \nmentioned Nazi Germany. One thing he says to Senator Leahy is: ``I did \nnot intend to say that supporters of abortion rights should be equated \nwith Nazis,'' and he spends a whole paragraph talking about this, \ntrying to clarify and give the context for what he had said.\n  He also in his letter to Senator Lincoln wrote about this article he \nhad written in his church newspaper. He says that ``the marital \nrelationship symbolizes the relationship between Christ and the \nchurch.'' He stated:\n\n     . . . My wife and I believe that this teaching ennobles and \n     dignifies marriage and both partners in it. We do not believe \n     that this teaching demeans either the husband or the wife but \n     that it elevates both. It involves a mutual self-giving and \n     self-forgetting, a reciprocal gift of self. This teaching is \n     not inconsistent with the equality of all persons, male and \n     female . . .\n\n  Then he goes on to talk about that. So when we look back at these \nstatements he made 17 years ago, 23 years ago, 24 years ago in one \ncase, Leon Holmes, by his own words, comes to this conclusion in the \nlast paragraph of his letter. He says:\n\n       Some of the criticisms directed at things I wrote years ago \n     are just; some of them are not. I hope that my legal career \n     as a whole, spanning the years 1982 through 2003, evidences \n     that I am now ready to assume the responsibility of a United \n     States District Court Judge. I certainly was not ready in \n1980, nor for many years thereafter, and I do not claim that I was. . . \n.\n\n  In other words, he is admitting he had maybe crossed a line and there \nare some things he wished he had not said or wished he had said \ndifferently.\n  I will tell my colleagues about Leon Holmes. He is a very fine \nperson. He is a very serious and very sincere Christian man. He is a \nhusband, he is a father, and he is a lawyer. He is a man of very deep \nfaith. In fact, his faith permeates every aspect of his life. I say \nthat very sincerely because I know Leon. Some people might hear those \nwords and say, listen, that means he has this rightwing agenda that \nwhen he gets on the bench he is going to do certain things and hold \ncertain ways.\n  Well, Leon is much deeper than that. His agenda is justice. The \nhallmark that really distinguishes Leon from so many other people is \nintegrity. He is a great example of integrity.\n  I have 23 letters. I promise I am not going to read them all. There \nare dozens more I could have brought with me. There is a saying in the \nBible that if we do not testify about it the stones will cry out. Well, \nwhat we found in Arkansas is a swelling where the stones are crying \nout, except in this case they are not stones, they are people who have \npracticed with Leon and people who have practiced against Leon.\n  I have personally talked with dozens and dozens of lawyers in the \nState of Arkansas. I have asked them: Would Leon Holmes make a good \nFederal judge? In almost every single conversation, there is an \nunequivocal yes, he would be an outstanding Federal judge.\n  I will read some of these excerpts. Then I would like to turn this \nover to my colleague, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. One \nexcerpt is from a Federal district judge, Bill Wilson. I actually asked \nhim to write this letter because I asked him about whether he thought \nLeon Holmes could be fair and impartial. As part of the explanation, \nJudge Wilson says before Leon was nominated and chosen for the bench, \nhe was ``a New Deal, new frontier, great society Democrat, and \nunabashedly so.'' He goes on to talk about how Leon Holmes will have a \ndetached objectivity, that he will set a standard all judges would be \nproud of. He concludes by saying:\n\n       I have seen Leon Holmes in action on several other \n     occasions, and he is a top-flight lawyer with the nicest \n     sense of personal honor. I believe this to be his reputation \n     with almost all the legal profession in Arkansas.\n\n  That is my impression as well.\n  Here is a letter from Philip Anderson. Philip Anderson may not be a \nhousehold name, but Philip Anderson is the former president of the \nAmerican Bar Association. He writes this paragraph:\n\n       I practiced law with Mr. Holmes for many years until he \n     withdrew from our firm two years ago. I believe that he is \n     superbly qualified for the position for which he has been \n     nominated. He is a scholar first, and he has had broad \n     experience in Federal court. He is a person of rock-solid \n     integrity and sterling character. He is compassionate and \n     even-handed. He has an innate sense of fairness. He is \n     temperamentally suited for the bench. He works with dispatch. \n     In short, he has all of the qualities that one would hope to \n     find in a Federal judge, and seldom are they found in a \n     person so amiable and with his degree of genuine humility.\n\n  In fact, I know Philip Anderson is a Democrat and was his law partner \nfor a number of years.\n  Here is another one. This one is from Kristine Baker of Little Rock. \nShe is a lawyer. She goes out of her way to point out she is a \nDemocrat. She says: I do not always see eye to eye but I respect him \nand trust his judgment. Above all, he is fair.\n  She talks about his respect and his dignity, his intellect, his \ndemeanor, his temperament, and his ability.\n  Here we have another letter. This one is actually from Tulsa, OK. It \nis from a lawyer named Dana Baldwin who used to practice in Little \nRock. She is a native Arkansan. She said:\n\n       Despite occasional differences in my and Mr. Holmes' views \n     on social and political issues, I can speak highly of his \n     integrity and compassion for the law. . . .\n\n  She talks about his impartiality. She talks about his commitment to \nfollow the law.\n  This letter is from Robin Carroll, who is a lawyer down in El Dorado, \nAR.\n  Robin happens to be the legal counsel for the Democratic Party of \nArkansas. He calls Mr. Holmes:\n\n     . . . a brilliant and ethical lawyer.\n\n  He would be a fair and impartial judge. He would be fair and \nimpartial on every issue.\n  Bear in mind, Mr. Carroll and Mr. Holmes have done battle in the \ncourtroom before on election issues, and other party-type issues.\n  Here is another one, Nate Coulter. Nate is a very fine lawyer from \nLittle Rock. He has been on the statewide ballot twice as a Democrat. \nHe says:\n\n     . . . I am writing to endorse enthusiastically Mr. Holmes' \n     nomination to the federal district court.\n\n  He says his political views and party affiliations differ, but those:\n\n     . . . do not affect my very high regard for his character and \n     professionalism.\n\n  He says they have been opposite each other in at least six lawsuits. \nMr. Coulter talks about Mr. Holmes' intellectual fitness and integrity \nand once again, Nate has done battle with him in the courtroom.\n  Also now we have a letter from Beth Deere. She again goes out of her \nway to talk about how she is a Democrat and how they do disagree on a \nnumber of issues. But she talks about his bright legal mind. Once \nagain, she mentions the word ``integrity.'' That comes through over and \nover and over in these letters.\n  Margaret Dobson says:\n\n       I have met no man who respects women more.\n\n\n[[Page S7534]]\n\n\n  She talks about the respect she has for Leon and Leon has for others. \nShe says he is the partner who had most supported her career growth and \nher rise to the level of partner.\n  Here again she talks about Leon's political views and hers. They may \ndisagree, but he is:\n\n     . . . fair and honest and diligent.\n\n  He has a commitment to follow the law. He has:\n\n     . . . impeccable morals, unquestionable ethics, and supreme \n     intelligence.\n\n  She talks about how respected he is in the legal community in \nArkansas.\n  Here is one from Stephen Engstrom, who is a lawyer in Little Rock. He \nsays:\n\n       He is an outstanding lawyer and a man of excellent \n     character.\n\n  Once again, he says:\n\n       Leon Holmes and I differ on political and personal issues \n     such as pro-choice/anti-abortion. [In fact he says] I am a \n     past board member of our local Planned Parenthood chapter. . \n     . .\n\n  But he goes on to say:\n\n     . . . I am confident that Leon Holmes will do his duty as the \n     law and facts of any given case require.\n\n  Here again, I am only reading short excerpts from a few of the \nletters we have received on Mr. Holmes.\n  Here is one from David Grace, who is a lawyer in Little Rock and \npractices in downtown. He has a very fine reputation. He says that he \nand I have had several cases. Some of these have been with him and some \nagainst him.\n\n     . . . Leon has a powerful mind and excellent judgment. He is \n     able to be honestly objective. . . .\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n     . . . he is among the very best and most respected lawyers in \n     Arkansas.\n\n  Once again, he goes out of his way to say he disagrees strongly with \nsome of Leon's political or social views, but they have not:\n\n     . . . affected his analysis of a legal problem or his \n     performance as an attorney.\n\n  We have a law professor from the University of Arkansas Law School, \nwhere Leon was a student. This is Howard Brill. In fact, he was one of \nmy law professors. He says:\n\n       I have no doubt that he is scrupulously fair and will be so \n     on the bench--fair to all individuals, to all groups, to all \n     political persuasions, to all viewpoints on the issues that \n     divide Americans. In his judicial role and temperament, he is \n     not a partisan.\n\n  Here is a letter from a lawyer, Field K. Wassen, Jr., who was \nGovernor Bill Clinton's legal counsel. He says Leon Holmes has \n``unquestioned integrity.''\n  Here is another one from a plaintiff's lawyer in the State. Her name \nis Eileen Woods Harrison. Her father was a Federal judge and she is a \nlifelong Democrat. In fact, at one point she was on the State Workers \nCompensation Commission and she was released from that post because she \nwas considered to be too liberal on some of the issues. And lo and \nbehold, who was hired to represent the State against her when she sued \nthe State? Leon Holmes. She goes on in this letter to say, even though \nhe was ``on the other side,'' he:\n\n     . . . conducted himself in the most professional and ethical \n     manner throughout my case. I gained a great respect for him \n     throughout the course of the litigation.\n\n  This isn't a lawyer who is on the other side, this is a litigant. \nThis is a party and he is the lawyer for the other side. In fact, she \ncloses with a Bible verse and says:\n\n       ``Let Justice run down like waters, and righteousness like \n     a mighty stream.'' It is my firm belief that Mr. Holmes is a \n     just and righteous man who deserves the appointment to the \n     Federal Bench.\n\n  Here is one from Bradley Jesson, from Fort Smith, a very fine lawyer \nwho was for a short time Chief Justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court \nand a Democrat. He says:\n\n       My opinion is this is one of the best judicial selections \n     that President Bush has made.\n\n  He says he has been with Leon in a number of cases.\n\n       In some we are on the same side. In others we are on \n     opposing sides. . . . [He's] one of the best prepared lawyers \n     around and most courteous and most professional. . . . His \n     legal work is among the very best I observed. . . . Leon and \n     I frankly disagree about some issues . . .\n\n  But Brad Jesson is convinced Leon will follow the law.\n  Here is one from Jack Lavey. He is a great lawyer in the State of \nArkansas. In fact, he is one of the founding members of the State \nchapter of the ACLU. He calls himself, in this letter, a liberal \nDemocrat. He talks about Leon Holmes and he says:\n\n     . . . his professional reputation is outstanding. He is very \n     bright . . . and he's a very ethical lawyer. He is very \n     honest. . . . he has always been very professional and very \n     ethical.\n\n  He says he is honest and fair. He says also he will follow the law. \nHe says:\n\n       If a Roe v. Wade issue comes before Mr. Holmes, if he is \n     appointed as a federal district court judge, he will follow \n     the Supreme Court's decision in that case. If I thought \n     otherwise, I would not be writing this letter to you.\n\n  He goes on to talk about him and uses words like ``fairly,'' \n``honestly,'' ``ethically,'' ``in accordance with established law.''\n  He says:\n\n       To conclude, I consider it a privilege to highly recommend \n     to the United States Senate the appointment of Mr. Holmes as \n     a federal district judge for the Eastern District of \n     Arkansas.\n\n  Here is one from Sandy McMath. He uses words like ``integrity,'' \n``compassion,'' ``scholarship.'' He says:\n\n       . . . he's an honorable and upright lawyer.\n\n  He goes on to say they have opposed each other vigorously in a case \ninvolving ERISA, but he was at all times compassionate toward the other \nside's client. He treated the other client with tremendous respect.\n  Once again, Sandy McMath, like most of these others, talks about how \nthey are on opposite sides of the political fence, but he is confident \nLeon Holmes will make a good judge.\n  Also, here is one from Elizabeth Murray. She is with the largest law \nfirm in Arkansas, does a lot of defense work, probably insurance \ndefense work mostly, and corporate law work. She talks about his \nintelligence, his integrity, and his respect for the law. She says she \ndoes not share his opinions on a variety of issues, but nonetheless she \nthinks he would be a good Federal judge.\n  Jeff Rosenzweig offers his ``wholehearted support.'' He is a criminal \ndefense lawyer. He calls himself a libertarian Democrat. I am not even \nsure exactly what that is, but that probably does sum up his political \nviews. But he says:\n\n       He's a person of the highest character, intelligence and \n     judgment. He's been an outstanding advocate and if confirmed \n     will be an outstanding judge. If there is any person in the \n     world who will apply the law without regard to what his \n     personal beliefs might be, that person is Leon Holmes.\n\n  Time and time and time again we see that. Here is a letter from \nCharles Schlumberger, a great lawyer in Little Rock and a good friend \nof mine. He says:\n\n       I am a Democrat, I am pro-choice, and I support gender \n     equality.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       If ever there was an individual fully qualified to serve on \n     the federal bench, it is Mr. Holmes.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I am confident that Mr. Holmes will uphold his duty as \n     jurist to follow the rule of law, without bias or deference \n     to his personal convictions.\n\n  We hear from a lawyer who now lives in Naples, FL, but used to \npractice in Little Rock, Jeanne Seewald. She gives her wholehearted \nendorsement. She talks about how respectful, courteous, and supportive \nhe was of her personally at their old law firm when they practiced \ntogether. She says Leon is a gentleman and a scholar.\n\n       He has been a faithful mentor over the years. His ethics \n     are beyond reproach.\n\n  She talks about his thoughtful and brilliant analysis of issues.\n  I could read a couple of paragraphs out of that letter because she \nsays so many glowing things about him.\n  Here is one from Steven Shults who is, again, a lawyer in Little \nRock--a very fine lawyer with a great reputation. He talks about how \nthey have been on opposite sides of many lawsuits, but ``Mr. Holmes is \none of the finest lawyers in Arkansas and a premier appellate \nadvocate.''\n  He talks about his integrity. There is that word again, \n``integrity.'' It comes through time and time again.\n  He talks about his ``integrity, judgment, courage, compassion, \nintellect, dedication, patience, and intellectual honesty.''\n  Here again, Steven Shults is on the other side of some of these \nissues, but, nonetheless, he thinks he would be a very good judge.\n\n[[Page S7535]]\n\n  Here is one from Luther Sutter, who is a civil rights lawyer in \nArkansas. In fact, he may have the largest civil rights practice in the \nState. I am not sure, but he is definitely among the largest. He talks \nabout Leon Holmes being the consummate professional. He says:\n\n       I assure you that in my eight years of practice, I have \n     learned to identify ideologues who are also lawyers. Such \n     lawyers routinely put their personal and philosophical \n     interests ahead of what I consider to be their clients' best \n     interests. Mr. Holmes never did that.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I recommend Leon Holmes to the Federal bench, with a full \n     understanding of his politics. Personally, I do not agree \n     with some of his political views.\n\n  He goes on to talk about how he heartily recommends Leon Holmes.\n  This is the last letter I will read. I promise because I know I am \ntrying the patience of everyone in the Chamber right now. But this is a \nletter that the majority leader referred to a few moments ago from Kent \nRubens who is a very good lawyer from West Memphis, AK, which is right \nacross the Mississippi River from Memphis, TN. Kent Rubens has been a \npillar of that legal community in this part of the State for a long, \nlong time. He says:\n\n       I cannot think of anyone who is better qualified legally or \n     ethically to so serve.\n\n  He uses a funny phrase that I have heard in Arkansas a few times. He \nsays, ``I will shoot dice with him over the telephone.''\n  He talks about his honesty and how much integrity he has.\n  Let me give one little bit of background. He goes on in this letter \nto say:\n\n       I was privileged to represent a litigant who struck down \n     the abortion statutes here in Arkansas after Roe and Doe were \n     decided. There is no one who will argue that my views are \n     anything other than pro-choice.\n\n  This is the lawyer who actually litigated the cases in Arkansas right \nafter Roe v. Wade and decided to strike down Arkansas' laws on \nabortion. He is unabashedly pro-choice, and he is unabashedly in \nsupport of Leon Holmes for this position.\n  He says in conclusion:\n\n       As someone who has represented the pro-choice view and \n     holds the pro-choice view, I ask that you urge your Members \n     to support his confirmation.\n\n  I have read these letters and I think I have tried everyone's \npatience. But I will tell you this: From the people who know him best, \nfrom the people who practice with him and practice against him, from \nthe people who have seen him up close and know him and have had \npersonal contacts and personal interactions and years of affiliation \nwith him in one way or another, they wholeheartedly endorse him to be \non the Federal bench.\n  Going back to my criteria, is he qualified? Yes. There is no doubt \nabout it. Does he have the necessary experience? Yes, no question. You \ncan look at his resume. It is not even close. He easily has the \nexperience you want to see. Will he be fair and impartial? Is there \nanything else in his background that might raise questions such as his \ntemperament? Does he have an agenda? Clearly, from his contemporaries \nand from his peers, the answer is yes to those questions.\n  He has the attitude of being fair and impartial, and there is nothing \nin his background--no circumstance, even though he has been a staunch \nadvocate on the pro-life side, he still has the respect and the \nveneration of his peers in Arkansas and even around the country from \nother States.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to give him strong consideration, to wade \nthrough some of the rhetoric and look back on this with the perspective \nthat most of these inflammatory things were written at least 10 years \nago, and some as long ago as 24 years ago.\n  I appreciate his conviction on the issue of abortion. I appreciate \nhis compassion and his moral certitude on that question.\n  In many cases, people do not always agree with Leon but they have a \nlot of respect for him. They think he would be a good judge in \nArkansas. They would be proud to have him on the Federal bench.\n  With that, I yield the floor and turn this over to my wonderful \ncolleague from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the \nextensive and good remarks of the distinguished Senator from Arkansas, \nMr. Pryor regarding the nomination of J. Leon Holmes to be a United \nStates District Court judge. Mr. Pryor comes from the State. He knows \nthe man. He practiced law with him. He has read newspaper editorials in \nsupport of this man. He has read a number of letters--a wide variety of \nletters--from Democrats as well as Republicans in the State who say \nthis man would make an excellent judge.\n  Having known Mr. Holmes personally, he vouched for his integrity and \nhis qualifications, and I think we should pay attention to the \ndistinguished Senator.\n  Of course, Senator Lincoln as well is strongly in favor of Leon \nHolmes for this Federal district judgeship.\n  In addition, this man has the highest rating by the American Bar \nAssociation that you can have--a ``well-qualified'' rating--which means \nhe is placed among the higher echelon of great lawyers in this country.\n  I think we should heed Senator Pryor's views.\n  Of course, I think Senator Pryor makes an overwhelming case that this \nman deserves to sit on the Federal district court bench. So I rise \ntoday to express my support for the confirmation of J. Leon Holmes of \nArkansas who has been nominated to be U.S. District Judge for the \nEastern District of Arkansas.\n  Mr. Holmes is widely respected for his intelligence, his legal \nskills, and his commitment to the rule of law. Leon Holmes knows the \nvalue of hard work. He came from humble roots and is the only one among \nhis seven siblings to attend college. He worked his way through college \nand finished law school at night while working a full-time day job in \norder to support his family.\n  Anyone would know how difficult that is to do.\n  Leon Holmes is an accomplished scholar and has displayed a wide-\nranging academic interest. He is a distinguished graduate of Duke \nUniversity, where he received a doctorate in political science, and the \nUniversity of Arkansas law school. Mr. Holmes finished law school at \nthe top of his class, was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa while a doctoral \nstudent at Duke University, and was named Outstanding Political Science \nStudent upon graduation from college.\n  He has pretty terrific credentials.\n  Mr. Holmes is currently a partner with the Little Rock firm of \nQuattlebaum Grooms Tull & Burrow, specializing in complex business \nlitigation, torts, and appellate practice. He has practiced commercial \nlitigation at the trial and appellate level in State and Federal court \nfor many years, and has acquired significant courtroom experience. Leon \nHolmes is well respected by the Arkansas Bar and is one of the finest \nappellate lawyers in Arkansas. In 2001, the Arkansas Bar Association \nbestowed its Writing Excellence award on Mr. Holmes.\n  In addition, Leon Holmes has been an active participant in the \nArkansas Bar. He has taught continuing legal education courses to the \nbar on numerous occasions. He has been awarded the State bar's Best CLE \naward four times. He sits on the Board of Advisors to the Arkansas Bar \nAssociation's magazine and has chaired the editorial board for the \nbar's publication of Handling Appeals in Arkansas.\n  Mr. Holmes sits on the judicial nominations committee for the \nArkansas State courts, which recommends attorneys to the Governor for \njudicial appointment in Supreme Court cases where one or more justices \nmust recuse themselves. On two occasions, he himself has been appointed \nto serve as a special judge of the Arkansas Supreme Court. This is a \ngreat honor for a practicing attorney, and the justices praised Mr. \nHolmes for his service in those cases.\n  As a person who took advantage of the opportunities presented to him, \nMr. Holmes believes in giving back to the community. He is committed to \nproviding legal services to all, and has given approximately 200 hours \nof pro bono services during each of the last 3 or 4 years.\n  Among other cases, he has represented, on a pro bono basis, a \nterminally ill Laotian immigrant woman denied Medicaid coverage for a \nliver\n\n[[Page S7536]]\n\ntransplant; an indigent man with a history of drug felony convictions; \nand a woman who lost custody of her children to her ex-husband.\n  He represented Ricky Rector, a mentally retarded Arkansas man whose \nexecution then-Governor Bill Clinton refused to commute in 1992. He \nrepresents Clay Ford, who has been sentenced to life in prison for \nshooting at pointblank range and killing a police officer in 1981. He \ndefended on appeal the largest jury verdict in Arkansas history, which \ninvolves a nursing home resident who allegedly died from neglect. Her \nfamily won a $78 million judgment.\n  Leon Holmes has given back to his community in areas outside the law \nas well. He was a houseparent for the Elon Home for Children while a \ngraduate student in North Carolina. He also served as the director of \nthe Florence Crittenton Home of Little Rock in 1986 and 1987, helping \nyoung women cope with teen pregnancy.\n  Those who work with and personally know Leon Holmes strongly support \nhis nomination, as we have already heard from Senator Pryor, the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas, and expect to hear from Senator \nLincoln before the day is out. I certainly appreciate their \nendorsements of Mr. Holmes in his nomination hearing last year.\n  Let me address some of the arguments that are being put forward by \nMr. Holmes' opponents: that he is extreme in his views on abortion, \nthat he is anti-woman, and that he is insensitive on matters of race. \nThose are the major arguments that have been brought forth, and I \nbelieve based upon all of nothing. A full reading of Mr. Holmes' \nwritings and, more importantly, a review of his actions in these \nmatters, I think, will set the record straight.\n  There is no question that Mr. Holmes has been a pro-life activist. He \nserved as president of Arkansas Right to Life. He was president from \n1986 to 1987. He also served as secretary of the Arkansas Unborn Child \nAmendment Committee in 1984. Some of the statements he has made in the \ncourse of his activism he admits have been insensitive, and he has \nexpressed regret for such remarks, but in almost every case they are \ndecades ago when he was a much younger man.\n  For example, in a 1980 letter--think about that; it was 24 years \nago--to the editor, Mr. Holmes criticized the argument that abortion \nshould be available to rape victims as a red herring because \n``conceptions from rape occur with approximately the same frequency as \nsnowfall in Miami.'' Mr. Holmes has clearly apologized for this remark, \nwhich he made almost 24 years ago.\n  In response to a written question from Senator Durbin, he wrote:\n\n       I have to acknowledge that my own rhetoric, particularly \n     when I first became involved in the issue [of abortion] in \n     1980 and perhaps some years thereafter, sometimes has been \n     unduly strident and inflammatory. The sentence about rape \n     victims which was made in a letter to an editor in 1980 is \n     particularly troublesome to me from a distance of 23 years \n     later. Regardless of the merits of the issue, the \n     articulation in that sentence reflects an insensitivity for \n     which there is no excuse and for which I apologize.\n\n  I believe all of us have made statements in the past that we wish we \ncould apologize for. Many of us have apologized for statements we have \nmade in earnest and extreme ways. He is no different. He made some \nmistakes and says that he was insensitive at the time, but he \napologizes for them. You have to look at his overall career and realize \nthis man has a great reputation in that State and among his people and \namong his peers. If he is like the rest of us, and apparently on \noccasion has been, he is going to make some statements for which he has \nto apologize. We all have to do that from time to time. There may be \nsome perfect in this body who do not have to, but I, for one, have had \nto apologize from time to time myself.\n  In a different editorial, Mr. Holmes compared abortion to the \nHolocaust. On another occasion, he wrote:\n\n       The abortion issue is the simplest issue this country has \n     faced since slavery was made unconstitutional, and it \n     deserves the same response.\n\n  In an April 11, 2003, letter to Senator Lincoln, Mr. Holmes \nexplained:\n\n       In the 1980's--\n\n  Twenty-four years ago; at least two decades ago--\n\n     I wrote letters to the editor and newspaper columns regarding \n     the abortion issue using strident and harsh rhetoric. I am a \n     good bit older now and, I hope, more mature than I was at the \n     time. As the years passed, I came to realize that one cannot \n     convey a message about the dignity of the human person, which \n     is the message I intended to convey, using that kind of \n     rhetoric in public discussion.\n\n  Again, referring to his 1980 ``snow in Miami'' remark, Mr. Holmes \nwrote:\n\n       I do not propose to defend that sentence, and I would not \n     expect you or anyone else to do so.\n\n  Based upon this letter, Senator Lincoln reaffirmed her belief that \nMr. Holmes would be a fair judge.\n  The fact is, regardless of any personal views, Mr. Holmes will abide \nby the rule of law. He understands that principle, and he is committed \nto it. He understands that his personal views play no role in his duty \nas a judge to honor stare decisis, or prior precedents, and to \nfaithfully follow the precedents of the Supreme Court and the Eighth \nCircuit, within which he lives and practices.\n  Pro-choice attorneys and others in Arkansas who work with him have \nwritten to the committee in support of Mr. Holmes' nomination. Those \nwho know him well strongly believe that, despite his personal views, \nMr. Holmes will fairly adjudicate any abortion cases that may come \nbefore him. His supporters include Robin J. Carroll, legal counsel to \nthe Democratic Party of Arkansas; Philip S. Anderson, a former \npresident of the American Bar Association and a leading Arkansas trial \nattorney; and Stephen Engstrom, former Little Rock Planned Parenthood \nchapter board member.\n  Mr. Engstrom wrote:\n\n       I heartily commend Mr. Holmes to you. He is an outstanding \n     lawyer and a man of excellent character. Leon Holmes and I \n     differ on political and personal issues such as pro-choice/\n     anti-abortion. I am a past board member of our local Planned \n     Parenthood chapter and have been a trial lawyer in Arkansas \n     for over twenty-five years. Regardless of our personal \n     differences on some issue[s], I am confident that Leon Holmes \n     will do his duty as the law and facts of any given case \n     require.\n\n  Trial attorney Kent J. Rubens, a pro-choice attorney who successfully \nbrought a lawsuit to strike down Arkansas' abortion statutes after Roe \nv. Wade was decided wrote: Q02\n       I cannot think of anyone who is better qualified to serve. \n     . . . As someone who has represented the pro-choice view, I \n     ask that you urge your members to support his confirmation.\n\n  Eileen Woods Harrison sent this letter to the committee:\n\n       I am a female attorney in Little Rock, Arkansas. I am a \n     lifelong Democrat and am also pro-choice . . . I commend Mr. \n     Holmes to you. He is a brilliant man, a great lawyer and a \n     fine person.\n\n  Another letter, this one from Cathleen V. Compton, states:\n\n       I heartily recommend Mr. Holmes to you. He is an \n     outstanding lawyer and a fine person. While he and I differ \n     dramatically on the pro-choice/pro-life issue, I am fully \n     confident he will do his duty as the law and facts of a given \n     case require.\n\n  Beth M. Deere wrote the following:\n\n       I am proud to be a Democrat. I am also proud to recommend \n     Leon Holmes as a federal district judge for the Eastern \n     District of Arkansas, even though he and I disagree on \n     issues, including a woman's right to choose whether to \n     bear a child. . . . I support Leon Holmes because he is \n     not only a bright legal mind, but also because he is a \n     good person who believes that our nation will be judged by \n     the care it affords to the least and the littlest in our \n     society. I am not troubled that he is personally opposed \n     to abortion. Mr. Holmes is shot through with integrity. He \n     will, I believe, uphold and apply the law with the utmost \n     care and diligence.\n\n  Another issue which opponents have distorted is that of gender \nequality. Mr. Holmes cowrote an article with his wife entitled ``Gender \nNeutral Language.'' Let's get it straight: he wrote this article with \nhis wife. It was for a Catholic newspaper. This article, which appeared \nin a religious newspaper of his faith, stated: ``The wife is to \nsubordinate herself to her husband'' and, ``The woman is to place \nherself under the authority of the man.'' Mr. Holmes' opponents believe \nthese statements indicate he will not be fair to women appearing before \nhim.\n  However, let me point out those statements are derived from the New \nTestament in Ephesians, the 5th chapter, verses 22 through 25, and \nrepresent the orthodox teachings of his religion. Although I do not \nhave the same\n\n[[Page S7537]]\n\nversion of the Bible, I believe it would read very much the same. But \nif you turn to Ephesians, the 5th chapter, it is interesting because \nstarting with verse 21 it says--well, let's start with verse 20\n\n       Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father \n     in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;\n       Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.\n\n  Husband and wife. Then it says:\n\n       Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto \n     the Lord.\n       For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is \n     the head of the church: and he is the Saviour of the body.\n       Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the \n     wives be to their own husbands in every thing.\n\n  But then Saint Paul goes on to say:\n\n       Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the \n     church, and gave himself for it. . . .\n\n  I do not think anybody can read this without understanding that the \nhusbands have tremendously positive and important obligations in order \nto have the respect of the wives.\n  I don't think you could read it without understanding that Paul is \ncomparing the husband to the head of the family, even as Christ is head \nof the church, more on the priesthood level than anything else. And the \narticle seems to say that.\n  It says:\n\n       Husbands love your wives, even as Christ also loved the \n     church and gave himself for it;\n       That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of \n     water by the word;\n       That he might present it to himself, a glorious church, not \n     having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it \n     should be holy and without blemish.\n       So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He \n     that loveth his wife loveth himself.\n\n  It gets pretty bad around here when people misconstrue what somebody \nquotes in an article written for a church publication of the person's \nown faith, where the person and his wife quote St. Paul. You might \ndisagree with St. Paul, but there are hundreds of millions of people \nwho agree with St. Paul and who understand that he was trying to make \nthe analogy between the church and Christ and between a husband and \nwife to show how important and sanctified the relationship of marriage \nis.\n  This article contains other statements, as I have said, supporting \nthe equality of men and women such as:\n\n       All of us, male and female, are equally sons of God and, \n     therefore, brothers of one another.\n       The distinction between male and female in ordination has \n     nothing to do with the dignity or worth of male compared to \n     female.\n       Men and women are equal in their dignity and value.\n\n  These are quotes within the article. The article, to me, was clearly \ntrying to state why the men in the Catholic Church have the priesthood, \nbut the women have the family. And you might have written it \ndifferently, but the fact is, they quoted St. Paul, and St. Paul \ndeserves the dignity of respect by this great body whether you believe \nin the New Testament of the Bible or not. I firmly believe in the New \nTestament. What Leon Holmes and his wife were doing was writing about \ntraditional Catholic values and beliefs with which I think millions of \npeople will agree. It hardly places him outside the mainstream and \ncertainly places him in the mainstream as a religious believer and as \nsomebody who loves his faith and his church and his wife, by the way.\n  Mr. Holmes' wife wrote to the committee to explain that the article \nin question was specifically written for the readership of members of \ntheir faith, persons who would be familiar with the New Testament \npassages being referenced with regard to the relationship between \nhusband and wife. It is just terrible to distort their writings as \nhusband and wife. If you read the whole article, you can hardly think \nMr. Holmes is anti-woman. Furthermore, Mr. Holmes' actions support the \ntruth he fully believes that men and women are equals.\n  He has supported women in the legal profession and represented women \nas clients. Mr. Holmes' past and present female colleagues in Arkansas \nsupport his nomination to this position.\n  Jeanne Seewald wrote this letter to the committee:\n\n       Leon was a strong proponent of my election to the \n     partnership and, subsequently, encouraged and supported my \n     career advancement, as well as the advancement of other women \n     within the firm. . . . As a colleague, Leon treated me in an \n     equitable and respectful manner. I always have found him \n     supportive of my career and believe he is very supportive of \n     women in general. Leon and I have different political views; \n     however, I know him to be a fair and just person and have \n     complete trust in his ability to put aside any personal \n     political views and apply the law in a thoughtful and \n     equitable manner.\n\n  Another co-worker, Kristine Baker, wrote the following:\n\n       Leon has trained me in the practice of law and now, as my \n     partner, works with me on several matters. His office has \n     been next to mine at the firm for approximately two years. \n     During that time, I worked with Leon as an expectant mother \n     and now work with him as a new mother. Leon's daughters \n     babysit my eleven-month-old son. I value Leon's input, not \n     only on work-related matters but also on personal matters. I \n     have sought him out for advice on a number of issues. \n     Although Leon and I do not always see eye-to-eye, I respect \n     him and trust his judgment. Above all, he is fair. While \n     working with Leon, I have observed him interact with various \n     people. He treats all people, regardless of gender, station \n     in life or circumstance, with the same respect and dignity. \n     He has always been supportive of me in my law practice, as \n     well as supportive of the other women in our firm. Gender has \n     never been an issue in any decision in the firm.\n\n  Lastly, with regard to issues of race, Mr. Holmes has been criticized \nfor defending and endorsing Booker T. Washington's view that slavery \nwas a consequence of divine providence designed to teach white people \nhow to be more Christ-like. Some have alleged--but I hope we don't hear \nthis misinformed view repeated during this debate--that Holmes has said \nthat ``the Almighty said that slavery was a good thing or that he \nbelieves slavery is a good institution.'' In fact, nowhere has Mr. \nHolmes said he endorses slavery or that he believes slavery was a good \ninstitution.\n  The article at issue, written for a Christian audience, was an \nexpression of his belief, shared by Washington, that God could bring \ngood out of evil. So while Washington certainly condemned slavery as \nevil, having experienced it first-hand, he held a belief that ultimate \ngood could come out of it. Mr. Holmes's article similarly expressed the \nview that good can come out of evil and that we are called upon to love \nall men and women.\n  Mr. Holmes also wrote his doctoral dissertation on the political \nphilosophies of three major African-American thinkers and activists, \nW.E.B. DuBois, Booker T. Washington, and Martin Luther King, Jr. He \nargued that King attempted a synthesis of militant nonviolence, \nultimately unsuccessful, of DuBois's advocacy of political agitation \nand Washington's advocacy of a Christian persuasion as means to achieve \nequality for black Americans.\n  However, Mr. Holmes left no doubt that he admired Dr. King's \nachievements in helping to integrate buses, schools, parks, \nplaygrounds, lunch counters, and marriages. He noted the progress made \nin terms of the expansion of rights and opportunities for all \nAmericans, stating:\n\n       Considering both the extent of the privileged status of \n     Southern whites that has been relinquished and the amount of \n     hate and prejudice that confronted desegregation twenty-five \n     years ago, the accomplishment [of social change] is \n     incredible.\n\n  Although Dr. King's vision has not been completely realized, Holmes \nwrote, ``in light of the unexpected changes in the past ten years, who \ncan say that King's dreams will not all come true and `justice will \nroll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream?' '' Mr. \nHolmes concluded by urging the reader not to dismiss Dr. King's vision \nof a promised land, quoting the last words of King's final speech \nbefore he was assassinated.\n  Those who know Leon Holmes know he will be an outstanding jurist. The \nArkansas Democrat-Gazette, Mr. Holmes' hometown paper that knows his \nrecord best, strongly supports his candidacy. The paper, writing while \nhis candidacy was being considered, indicated that Holmes was a well \nqualified, mainstream nominee:\n\n       What distinguishes Mr. Holmes is the rare blend of \n     qualities he brings to the law--intellect, scholarship, \n     conviction, and detachment. A reverence not just for the law \n     but for ideas, for the life of the mind. All of that would \n     shine through the clutter of argument that awaits any judge. \n     . . . He would not only bring distinction to the bench but \n     promise. . . . In choosing Leon Holmes, [the President] could \n     bequeath a promise of greatness.\n\n  That is a pretty good editorial from the local Democrat Gazette.\n\n[[Page S7538]]\n\n  Considering the total record of Mr. Holmes, a record of distinction \nin academics, of excellence in practice, and of distinction in his \ncommunity, it is not surprising that the American Bar Association gave \nMr. Holmes their highest rating, a ``well-qualified'' rating. Almost \neveryone around here has called that the gold standard, but especially \nour colleagues on the other side of the Senate floor. If you get a \n``well-qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association, you are \nqualified. Yet we have had some who have misconstrued his writings and \nhave indicated they will vote against him.\n  I hope they will listen to what we have had to say and look at the \nreal record. There is no way that anybody who really understands that \nrecord would vote against this man.\n  My colleagues should know--and most of them will agree--that Mr. \nHolmes is a well-qualified nominee and will make a fine jurist. I urge \nthe Senate to join me, as well as both Democratic home State Senators, \nBlanche Lincoln and Mark Pryor, who strongly support Leon Holmes' \nnomination, to confirm this outstanding candidate for the Federal \nbench.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's side has 152 minutes remaining. \nThe other side has 144 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, as the senior Senator from Arkansas, I \nam proud to come to the floor and join my colleague Senator Mark Pryor \ntoday to introduce Leon Holmes to my colleagues here in the Senate and \nexpress my support for his nomination.\n  Mr. Holmes is a native of Hazen, AR, in Prairie County, which is not \ntoo far from my hometown of Helena. He is the fourth of seven children \nand the first in his family to go to college. He has been married to \nhis wife Susan Holmes for 32 years, and he is the proud father of five \nchildren and has seven grandchildren.\n  Most of us having been home not only working during the Fourth of \nJuly recess but hopefully spending some time with our families \nunderstand how important our families and our children and future \ngenerations are to all of us. I know Mr. Holmes has certainly expressed \nthat to me.\n  After high school, Leon graduated with special distinction from \nArkansas State University in 1973. He continued his education by \nearning a law degree from the University of Arkansas where he graduated \nfirst in his class.\n  Mr. Holmes later received a master's degree in political philosophy \nfrom Northern Illinois University and a doctorate in political science \nfrom Duke University where he was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa.\n  Leon's professional career is equally impressive. In addition to \nbeing named a partner in the law firm of Quattlebaum, Grooms, Tull, and \nBurrow in Little Rock, Mr. Holmes has held a variety of positions, \nincluding law clerk for Justice Frank Holt on the Arkansas Supreme \nCourt, assistant professor at Augustana College in Rock Island, IL, and \nadjunct faculty member of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock \nSchool of Law.\n  As an attorney in private practice, Leon has had a wide-ranging legal \npractice, representing large corporations, small businesses, and \nindividual litigants, and although I am not a part of the legal \ncommunity in my home State of Arkansas as a lawyer like my colleague \nSenator Pryor is, I have heard from a number of practicing lawyers, \njudges, and others throughout our State who have worked with Leon and \nhave the utmost confidence in his ability to administer the rule of \nlaw.\n  But Leon has not spent his whole life in the library or at a law \nfirm. As you well know, Mr. President, that certainly is something that \nis important to me. You may be interested to know that in his youth, \nLeon actually chopped and picked cotton over in our part of the State \nin eastern Arkansas. He worked as a farm laborer in the fields of \nPrairie County and served as a carpenter's helper. While pursuing his \neducation, he worked as a door-to-door salesman and as a newspaper \ncarrier to help make ends meet.\n  In short, during his academic and professional career, Leon has \ndistinguished himself as a scholar and an accomplished lawyer. In the \nprocess, he has earned the trust, admiration, and respect of his \nfriends and colleagues with whom he has lived and worked.\n  As a farmer's daughter from eastern Arkansas, I believe the fact that \nMr. Holmes knows the value of an honest day's work both as a lawyer and \na laborer is a good indication that he has the life experience required \nto administer the law in a very fair and impartial manner, regardless \nof who the litigants are before him.\n\n  If that were the only part of the record before us, the debate we are \nhaving today would be a very short one. As some of my colleagues have \nsaid or will say during the consideration of this nomination, Leon is \nalso a devoutly religious man who has written articles and made \nstatements that are a reflection of his faith, but they are also \nsomewhat controversial. We all know that for many of us our faith is \nvery important. It is important for us to have an opportunity to \nexpress our faith, to talk about it, to speak about it, to live it in a \nway that is very important to us and reflective of our own ministry.\n  There is no doubt I have been troubled by some of the statements \nattributed to Mr. Holmes, particularly one regarding the role of a \nwoman in a marital relationship. As a mother and a wife, I can assure \nyou, I consider myself equal in every way to my husband. Our marriage \nis based on mutual love and respect, which sustains our union as a man \nand a wife.\n  I think it is so important in this day and age as we talk about \nmarriage and its importance to our family, to our children, to the \nstability of the fabric of this great country, that we understand \nmarriage does not just happen; it has to be those two individuals who \ncome together, a man and a woman, working equally as hard at making \nsure that union is strong and that it is working.\n  However, I fully respect the right of Mr. Holmes to practice and \nexpress his religious beliefs freely, even those with which I may not \nagree, just as I expect others to respect my right to do the same.\n  Mr. Holmes also made a comment 20-plus years ago about how women who \nwere raped do not get pregnant, which I think most would agree was \ninappropriate and offensive. But Mr. Holmes has apologized for that \ncomment. He has acknowledged it was wrong and said he regrets saying \nit. We have all said things we should not and wished we had not said in \nour lives and I, for one, accept his apology. I do believe it is very \ncritical we understand the complications, the emotions, and everything \nelse that are wrapped up in the circumstances when women find \nthemselves in those circumstances of rape or incest or being abused. \nAgain, I do accept Mr. Holmes' apology.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Leon Holmes \nto me apologizing for this remark and responding to the criticism of \nother statements be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Quattlebaum, Grooms,\n\n\n                                                Tull & Burrow,\n\n                                  Little Rock, AR, April 11, 2003.\n     Hon. Blanche Lincoln,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lincoln: Certain issues have surfaced about my \n     nomination since we met, and because they have arisen since \n     we met, you and I have not had the opportunity to discuss \n     them personally. Out of respect for you personally, and out \n     of respect for the important constitutional role of the \n     Senate in the appointment process for federal\n\n[[Page S7539]]\n\n     judges, I wanted to write to you this letter to address some \n     of these issues.\n       In the 1980's I wrote letters to the editor and newspaper \n     columns regarding the abortion issue using strident and harsh \n     rhetoric. I am a good bit older now and, I hope more mature \n     than I was at that time. As the years passed, I came to \n     realize that one cannot convey a message about the dignity of \n     the human person, which is the message I intended to convey, \n     using that kind of rhetoric in public discussion. While I \n     cannot speak for those who raise these issues, my impression \n     is that my statements about the abortion issue that they \n     criticize are all more than fifteen years old.\n       As I stated in response to written questions from Senator \n     Durbin, I am especially troubled by the sentence about rape \n     victims in a 1980 letter to the editor regarding the proposed \n     Human Life Amendment; and, as I said there, regardless of the \n     merits of the issue, the articulation of that sentence \n     reflects an insensitivity for which there is no excuse and \n     for which I apologize. I do not propose to defend that \n     sentence, and I would not expect you or anyone else to do so. \n     My impression is that, in fulfilling your responsibilities in \n     this matter, you have spoken with or heard from many \n     Arkansans, male and female, who know me well. I hope, and I \n     believe, that their comments have and will give your \n     assurance that this 23 year old sentence is not indicative of \n     how I have conducted myself in the past several years and not \n     indicative of how I would conduct myself as a judge.\n       In 1987, when I was President of Arkansas Right to Life, \n     that organization was attacked in a guest column in a \n     newspaper on the ground that its members allegedly defined \n     life too narrowly and were, as I read the column, hypocrites. \n     That same column stated that abortion involves a taking of \n     human life. In response, I wrote that, if the author believed \n     that abortion takes a human life, he should start his own \n     pro-life organization but should not use our defects as a \n     reason not to act on his beliefs. In that context, I asked \n     rhetorical question, what if someone had advanced such a \n     basis as a reason not save lives during the holocaust? I did \n     not intend to say that supporters of abortion rights should \n     be equated with Nazis. I have never intended anything that I \n     said to give that impression, and I do not think my comments, \n     which now are criticized, were taken to mean that when they \n     were written. From 1983 through 1988, when I was active in \n     pro-life activity and was writing most of the columns that \n     are now criticized, I was an associate at a large law firm, \n     and I worked for and with many lawyers who are pro-choice. \n     Since then, most of my partners have been pro-choice. I have \n     had many cases with and against lawyers who are pro-choice. \n     No one raised this concern at that time nor at any time prior \n     to the past two weeks. I believe that no one raised this \n     concern because everyone who knows me recognizes that I did \n     not intend such a thing. The letters written on my behalf by \n     pro-choice colleagues are strong testimony of their \n     confidence in me.\n       While I expected that my past activities relating to the \n     abortion issue would draw scrutiny, and properly so, I did \n     not expect that my religious beliefs would draw similar \n     scrutiny, but they have. I am aware that some concern has \n     been expressed about a 1997 column co-authored by my wife and \n     me for our local Catholic newspaper or historic teachings of \n     the Catholic Church. The Catholic faith is pervaded with the \n     view that the visible things symbolize aspects of the \n     spiritual realm. This pervasive element of the faith is \n     manifest in the teaching that the marital relationship \n     symbolizes the relationship between Christ and the Church. My \n     wife and I believe that this teaching ennobles and dignifies \n     marriage and both partners in it. We do not believe that this \n     teaching demeans either the husband or the wife but that it \n     elevates both. It involves a mutual self-giving and self-\n     forgetting, a reciprocal gift of self. This teaching is not \n     inconsistent with the equality of all persons, male and \n     female, and, in fact, in that column we say, ``[a]ll of us, \n     male and female, are equally sons of God and therefore \n     brothers of one another.'' This aspect of my faith--the \n     teaching that male and female have equal dignity and are \n     equal in the sight of God--has been manifest, I believe, in \n     my dealings with my female colleagues in our firm and in the \n     profession as a whole. While I am not at all ashamed of my \n     faith, or any part of it, I do not believe that the historic \n     Catholic teaching that the martial relationship symbolizes \n     Christ and the Church is or has been relevant to my conduct \n     in my professional life, nor would it affect my conduct as a \n     judge, should I be fortunate enough to be confirmed.\n       Another aspect of my faith is that God brings good out of \n     evil. I wrote about this belief, as taught by Booker T. \n     Washington, in the context of a 1981 article in a religious \n     magazine. Washington taught that God could and would bring \n     good out of evil. Washington, who was born in slavery, \n     recognized it as evil, not only in theory but as part of his \n     earliest experience. Yet, his faith was so great that he \n     believed that God could bring good from that evil; and his \n     love was so great that he hoped that those of his race would \n     become a beacon of God's love to their oppressors. My article \n     combines his view of providence--that God brings good out of \n     evil--with his view that we all are called to love one \n     another. This teaching can be criticized only if it is \n     misunderstood.\n       Some of the criticisms directed at things I wrote years ago \n     are just; some of them are not. I hope that my legal career \n     as a whole, spanning the years 1982 through 2003, evidences \n     that I am now ready to assume the responsibility of a United \n     States District Court Judge. I certainly was not ready in \n     1980, nor for many years thereafter, and I do not claim that \n     I was. My impression is that my colleagues in the Arkansas \n     bar--those who know me well and who represent clients in \n     federal court--believe that my legal career as a whole \n     manifests a readiness to assume the responsibilities of a \n     district court judge, and I hope that you believe so as well.\n       With best wishes and warmest regards, I am\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                   J. Leon Holmes.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. In making my decision to support Mr. Holmes' \nnomination, I have considered many factors. There is no question he has \nthe necessary legal skills and intellect to perform the duties of the \nposition. More importantly, I have been impressed with the overwhelming \nsupport Leon has received from his friends, coworkers, and colleagues \nin Arkansas' legal community who have firsthand knowledge of his \ntemperament, his character, and abilities as a lawyer. I have received \ncountless letters, e-mails, and phone calls from all over the State \nexpressing strong support for Leon's nomination. Many of these contacts \nare from people I know personally and several, if not most, are from \nvery active, self-described, very strong Democrats.\n  Those from Arkansas who have contacted me and the Judiciary Committee \nin support of this nomination include a past president of the American \nBar Association, a former president of the Arkansas Trial Lawyers \nAssociation, a founder of the Arkansas affiliate of the ACLU, sitting \nFederal judges who are familiar with Leon's work, female attorneys who \nhave argued cases with and against Leon, and many others.\n  One letter from a self-described liberal Democrat who is also \ndecidedly pro-choice summed up how Mr. Holmes is viewed in Arkansas' \nlegal community when he wrote that after litigating ``with and against \nLeon for a number of years'' he had so much faith and trust in him that \nhe would ``shoot dice with him over the telephone.'' Now that might not \nsound too common to folks up here, but in Arkansas it is a pretty good \nsaying, and it certainly indicates a great deal of trust on that \ngentleman's part of the gentleman with whom he was dealing, and that \nwas Mr. Leon Holmes.\n  In conclusion, I do not determine my support or opposition to a \nnominee based solely on whether we share the same philosophy, ideology, \nor beliefs. Fundamentally, I am interested in knowing a judicial \nnominee can fulfill his or her responsibility under the Constitution to \napply the law fairly without political favor or personal bias.\n  I am satisfied Mr. Leon Holmes has met that standard based on the \nstrong support he has received from those who know him the best and his \nassurances to me when we met personally. He assured me personally he is \nwilling and able to set aside his personal beliefs to fulfill his \nduties as a Federal district court judge.\n  Senator Pryor and I are here to support Leon Holmes. He has done a \ngood job in Arkansas.\n  He is a good man, a good friend, and a well-trusted lawyer among his \ncolleagues. We encourage our colleagues in the Senate to look at the \nevidence we have presented and certainly judge this man on the basis of \nall of these incredible character witnesses, as well as his own \ntestimony, in being sure that we can all have the confidence that Mr. \nHolmes will, without a doubt, implement the law, the rule of law, \naccording to the rule of law, and not based on his own personal views.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, let me first congratulate both Senators \nfrom Arkansas for their eloquent statements and their strong defense of \nMr. Holmes. It speaks volumes of the qualifications and credibility of \nthis nominee that these two Senators would step forward and speak as \nstraightforwardly as they have and to reflect the values of the people \nin Arkansas who know him best. This is a man who has strong support \nfrom across the ideological spectrum in Arkansas, again, from the \npeople who know him.\n  I have had the privilege of standing before the Senate in the last 3 \nyears to\n\n[[Page S7540]]\n\nspeak on behalf of 20 nominees from Pennsylvania who we have moved \nthrough here and into confirmation. I have seen many of these men and \nwomen come under assault through this judicial process. It has become \nincreasingly contentious, personal, and is reaching a point where we \nalmost have a situation where people are now unwilling to step forward \nand enter into this arena of judicial nominations because of this \nattitude that has crept up in the Senate over the last few years.\n  I have seen really good people, who obviously otherwise would not be \nnominated for the Federal bench, come under assault for things they \nhave said years and years ago, things they may have done years and \nyears ago. I have pored through FBI records, as many members of the \nJudiciary Committee have, and seen blemishes, indiscretions of youth \nthat have disqualified people from this office that heretofore would \nnever have disqualified some of them.\n  This is a pretty tough place to put your name in nomination these \ndays. One person who has gone through probably as much as anyone over \nthe past year has been Leon Holmes. His nomination has been out there \nfor well over a year. He is someone who has had a lot of challenges \nmade about things he has said and positions he has held. He has stood \nfirm in defense of statements that were defensible and apologized for \nthose that were not. That sounds to me like a pretty balanced way of \napproaching things. When you believe you were right in saying what you \nwere saying, you stand by the feelings you articulated, and when you \nbelieve you made a mistake and were in error, you have the courage to \nstand up and say you were wrong. I don't think we could ask for any \nmore out of someone.\n\n  In the case of Leon Holmes, specifically where he said he was wrong, \nas referred to by the Senator from Arkansas a minute ago, was his \ncomments about rape and pregnancy. He was in error. He made a mistake. \nI would argue that he has paid dearly over the past year for that \nstatement. However, that is not what he believes and he has not \nbelieved that for quite a long time. The statement was made over 20 \nyears ago.\n  Again, I remind the Senate how we need to look at the whole person, \nnot a statement made 20-plus years ago for which the person has \nsubsequently apologized, not just to this body but has said over the \nyears that that was a statement in error. We want to look at the whole \nperson, as the Senators from Arkansas, Senator Hatch, our leader, has \ndescribed, the whole person, with whom I had a chance to meet a few \nmonths ago, someone who is a very impressive man, a man who is \nobviously very gifted as a lawyer, a man who is a strong family person, \nbelieves in the centrality of the family, the importance of his role as \na husband and father.\n  He understands his role in the community. He is someone who gives to \nthe community and is an active person in the community as well as in \nthe bar, in his profession, and has earned the respect of people \nthroughout his community for the tremendous effort he gives and the \nequanimity with which he deals with difficult situations.\n  The one thing that struck me when meeting him was--everyone has \nvisions of when you meet someone what they are going to look like and \nwhat they will sound like. He was just a very gentle, kind, \nknowledgeable, professional lawyer, someone with whom I would have felt \ncomfortable representing me because I don't share necessarily all those \nqualities. He would be a nice complement to someone representing me in \nthe courtroom. This was someone I thought: If I had to appear before a \njudge, I sort of would like to appear with someone who had these kinds \nof qualities and temperament. So he fits in very nicely with what has \nbeen described by the Senators from Arkansas, at least from my personal \nmeeting.\n  So what is the problem? You have the two home State Senators of the \nopposite party in support of him. You have the Arkansas Bar and all of \nhis colleagues who have come out and been supportive. People who are \nliberal Democrats have said some of the most flattering things I have \never heard about people on the floor of the Senate. So what is the \nproblem? Is it a statement he made 20-plus years ago? Do you think that \ncould cause the defeat of a man who has a record and a distinguished \ncareer and service to his community and faithfulness to his family and \na good father? Does that one statement 24 years ago disqualify him from \nbeing a judge?\n  I don't think that is it. What else is out there? There are only two \nissues I have heard of that are out there. The second was an article he \nwrote, an article he wrote with his wife for his diocese, for his \nchurch, the Roman Catholic Church in Arkansas. It was an article about \na particular passage in one of Paul's letters discussing marriage and \nthe role of husbands and wives. He simply went through with his wife \nand described what you would see described in reading any text \ndescribing and explaining those verses from the Bible. You would see it \ndescribed in any Vatican text, any text that is in line with the \nteaching of the Catholic Church that would use the same arguments and \nsay the same things that Leon Holmes and his wife said in this article. \nWhat he gave was the orthodox Catholic interpretation of those sections \nof the Bible.\n  It is what I have heard in many a Sunday sermon. When that section of \nthe Bible has been read and the priest would get up and talk about it, \nhe would give almost chapter and verse the explanation that Leon Holmes \nand his wife gave in that dissertation. So was Leon Holmes expressing \nhis opinion? Yes. In some respects he was. But as a believing Catholic, \nhe was expressing the opinion of the church. As a believing Catholic, \nhe was merely reflecting the teachings that he has been taught over the \nyears from the church.\n  Now, if this were a writing by an individual who took this passage of \nScripture and took it off in a different direction--something alien to \nthe church--then you might be able to say you can criticize him for not \nbeing a faithful Catholic. You could say, look, this is a man who has \nhis own ideas; he wants to reinterpret Scripture to mean something that \nis potentially degrading to men, or women, or both. But that is not \nwhat he did. What he did--and I didn't ask him this, but I suspect that \nhe did what I would have done, which is, as a Catholic, if I am going \nto look at interpreting Scripture, I am going to look at what the \nchurch says about these writings in the Bible, because the Catholic \nChurch has a very rich history of interpreting the Bible. So what I \nwould do is go back and look and see what the church has said about \nthis and how it interprets these passages and then reflect that in what \nI was going to write, because to me that is what the role of a Catholic \nis.\n  Again, that is what the Catholic Church teaches; that is what I \nbelieve. That is what the Catholic Church teaches; that is what Leon \nHolmes believes.\n  Now, what he is being criticized for is for holding these beliefs--\nbeliefs shared by a billion people. You can say that may be out of the \nmainstream. I don't know. But it is shared by a billion people. It is \nan interpretation that has been around for a couple thousand years. If \nyou say, because you hold these beliefs that are central to the faith, \nthat you are disqualified for writing an article for your church--not \nwriting a political article, not writing a judicial opinion, not \nwriting in a secular magazine, but writing an article about Scriptural \ninterpretation for your church, that if you do that and it is not \npolitically correct, it is not seen as being within the mainstream of \npolitical dialog today, you cannot be a Federal judge. I find that to \nbe rather chilling.\n  There was an article in the Washington Times. I have the quote:\n\n       I will tell you, as a person with a Catholic background, \n     that these are troubling statements for him to make.\n\n  This is regarding the statements I talked about on the role of women \nand men in marriage.\n\n       Mr. Holmes' statements reflect a narrow view of Catholic \n     theology and do not embody contemporary standards that would \n     be followed by any Federal judge in any State.\n\n  Think about that. Because of his Catholic faith, because he holds \nthese beliefs that the Catholic Church teaches, he cannot be a Federal \njudge. Is that what freedom of religion means in our Constitution? Is \nthat what the term ``free exercise of religion'' means in our \nConstitution--that we are going to eliminate anybody who is nominated \nfor a Federal judgeship who actually\n\n[[Page S7541]]\n\nexercises their religious beliefs and states them for his own church, \nand that now disqualifies them? Let's start to take sandpaper out and \nscratch out ``in God we trust'' over there; let's start sanitizing this \nplace of any faith that is not politically correct or of contemporary \nstandards. Isn't that what faith is about, contemporary standards? It \nchanges. If your faith doesn't change, you are out. If your faith \ndoesn't adapt to the contemporary mores of today in America, you are \ndisqualified.\n  Mr. President, that is what is being said here today. If you hold a \ntraditional religion and stand by it, live it, practice it, espouse it, \nyou need not apply, because your religion hasn't adapted to \ncontemporary standards and, therefore, you cannot be a judge.\n\n  Imagine what our Founders would be doing right now. Imagine. Free \nexercise of religion. What does ``exercise'' mean? Does it mean sitting \nhere like this? Is that exercise? How about going to church on Sunday, \nsitting in the pew, or staying at home and reading your Bible; is that \nexercise? We all know what exercise means. It means to get out and do \nit. They used an active word here. What was Leon Holmes doing? He was \nsimply exercising his fundamental constitutional right to express his \nbeliefs--not as a member of the legal community, not as a citizen of \nthe State of Arkansas, but as a faithful Catholic to other Catholics in \nhis Catholic community. And for that we say he cannot be a judge?\n  Some in this body today will vote against this man because he had the \naudacity to practice his faith. So we now understand the religious \nlitmus test. If you belong to a religion that has not ``adapted,'' has \nnot stayed with the times, if you are one of these old-fashioned \nreligions who believes the truth was actually laid out and the truth \ndoesn't change, and we actually have people who believe--incredibly, to \nsome in this body--that God laid out certain truths, communicated them, \nand they have not changed because God has not changed. But if you feel \nthat way, you are out. You are out because the narrow views that do not \nembody contemporary standards--God's ``narrow view''--at least some \nbelieve that, and I argue they have the right to believe in these \n``narrow views'' that have been around for a couple thousand years, but \nthey are narrow views. That is right, the path is narrow. Maybe now it \nis too narrow to get you through the Senate. Imagine. Imagine that here \nin a country that professes, as one of its highest ideals, the freedom \nof religion, in a country that, as we try to build a republic and a \ndemocracy in Iraq, that we had letters signed by people on both sides \nof the aisle in large numbers encouraging religious pluralism in Iraq, \nthat we now say religious pluralism doesn't necessarily apply here \nanymore in the Senate.\n  This is a dangerous moment for us in the Senate. It is a dangerous \nmoment, where a man may not become a judge simply because he holds \nreligious tenets that have not kept up with contemporary mores.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 109\\1/2\\ minutes on the majority \nside, and 110 minutes on the minority side, with time expiring for the \nnoon recess.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I conclude by saying this is an important vote. This \nis not just a vote to confirm a district judge in Arkansas. I know that \ndoes not sound like a big deal to people who are hearing my voice. It \nis a district court, a small court, Arkansas. It is not Washington, DC, \nor New York City. It is not a glamourous place to serve, just like \nwestern Pennsylvania and central Pennsylvania are not glamourous places \nto serve. But we do justice in these communities because we get good \npeople who are from the community, who are good, decent, moral people, \nwho live their faith as they are allowed to do by our Constitution.\n  If we send a message out today that living your faith, espousing your \nfaith, exercising your religion is now cause for defeat on the floor of \nthe Senate, if we send the word out today that unless your religious \nbeliefs are contemporary or have been contemporized, unless you have \nadapted the popular culture into your faith, you are no longer suitable \nto hold that office, then I think we make a dangerous statement, not \njust to people in this country, but to the world.\n  This is a big vote. Anybody who thinks this is not a big vote, let me \nassure them, I will remind people here for quite some time how big a \nvote this was. This is a vote about religious freedom. This is a vote \nabout the free exercise of religion, and this is a vote about \ntolerance.\n  We hear so much from the other side about tolerance--tolerance, \ntolerance, tolerance. Where is the tolerance of people who want to \nbelieve what has been taught for 2,000 years as truth. You have a right \nto disagree with that teaching. You have a right to adapt your \ncontemporary mores to that teaching. But where is the tolerance of \npeople who choose to keep that faith?\n  We will have a vote on Judge Leon Holmes, but it will be a bigger \nvote than just on that judge. It will be a vote on the soul of the free \nexercise of religion clause and of tolerance to religion.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/06/senate-section/article/S7541-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are under controlled time. The Senator from \nVermont controls 110 minutes, and the Senator from Utah has 106 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, wishes to \nspeak on a matter of personal concern to her State. I believe she \nmentioned this to the Senator from Utah. I ask unanimous consent that \nshe be yielded 8 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from California is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Boxer are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may need.\n  I welcome the distinguished Presiding Officer back from his break, \nand I hope he enjoyed his as much as I did, being in Vermont. In fact, \nI must say I hated to leave Vermont today; it was so nice.\n  But as the Senate resumes our deliberations for this session, I would \nlike to make note of some matters that occurred on this floor as we \nwere adjourning for the recess. The Senate confirmed six more judicial \nnominees. That brings to 197 the total confirmations since President \nBush took office.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer and others may recall, we only \nhad one roll call vote on a judicial nominations that week. At the \nrequest of the distinguished majority leader, I agreed to have five \njudicial confirmation votes done by a voice vote. As often happens when \nwe consider the judges by voice vote, I think the public, many \nSenators, and the press have little opportunity to take note of our \nactions or, as in this case, the extraordinary achievement. I say \nextraordinary because, when the Republicans controlled the Senate in \nthe 1996 session, the last year of President Clinton's first term, they \nallowed only 17 judges to be confirmed that whole session and they \nrefused to allow any circuit court nominees to be confirmed that entire \ntime. If one Republican Senator objected, it was in effect a filibuster \nof the whole Republican caucus. They would not allow any circuit court \nnominees to go through during the 1996 session, not one. I mention that \nbecause that was the most recent year, besides this year, in which a \nPresident was seeking reelection.\n  Of course, this year alone, by the end of June, we far exceeded the \nnumber of judicial nominees confirmed, including circuit judges, for \nthis President. We\n\n[[Page S7542]]\n\nconfirmed 28 of President Bush's judicial nominees by the end of June, \nincluding 5 to the circuit courts. Again, I note that--notwithstanding \nthe more than 60 judicial nominees who were blocked by the Republican \nleadership under President Clinton and the fact they allowed only 17 \njudges during the 1996 session in his reelection year, and not a single \ncircuit court judge--we have so far confirmed 28 judicial nominees of \nPresident Bush, including 5 circuit court nominees.\n  In fact, the Senate has confirmed nearly 200 judicial nominees of \nPresident Bush. In this Congress alone, the Senate has confirmed more \nFederal judges than were confirmed during the 2 full years, 1995 and \n1996, when Republicans first controlled the Senate and President \nClinton was in the White House. We also exceeded the 2-year total at \nthe end of the Clinton administration when Republicans held the Senate \nmajority in 1999 to 2000.\n  While the Republican-controlled Senate, during its 25 months in the \nmajority, has not confirmed quite as many as the 100 nominees the \nDemocrat-led Senate confirmed in our 17 months, the total of 197 is \nstill the fourth highest 4-year total in American history.\n  I am actually saying this to compliment the work of my Republican \ncolleagues for this Republican President. During their 25 months in the \nmajority, 97 of the judicial nominees of President Bush have been \nconfirmed. During the 17 months Democrats lead the Senate, we confirmed \n100 judicial nominees of President Bush.\n  In all, we have confirmed more lifetime appointees for this President \nthan were allowed to be confirmed in the most recent 4-year \nPresidential term, that of President Clinton, from 1997 to 2000. We \nhave actually confirmed more judicial nominees of this President than \nthe first President Bush had confirmed by the Senate from 1989 through \n1992, and we have confirmed more of President George W. Bush's judicial \nnominees than were confirmed during President Reagan's entire first \nterm from 1981 through 1984, when he had a Republican majority in the \nSenate. One can't help but think that maybe if he had a Democratic \nmajority part of the time he may have had even more confirmations.\n  I would also note that the five circuit court nominees of President \nBush confirmed this year are five more than Republicans allowed to be \nconfirmed during President Clinton's reelection year.\n  These may seem like just numbers, but I think Democratic Senators did \nwhat I said we would do when I became chairman of the committee: that \nwe would work to lower the partisan divide by treating President Bush's \njudicial nominees more fairly than Republicans treated President \nClinton's nominees, by working harder to fill vacancies in the federal \ncourts. Under the leadership of Tom Daschle who at that time was the \nSenate majority leader, we confirmed 100 judicial nominees in 17 \nmonths, a much faster pace than the previous period of Republican \ncontrol of the Senate.\n  The number of Federal judicial vacancies for the whole country is \nonly 27, the lowest it has been in decades. I mention that because when \nyou look at the period from 1995 to 2001 when the Republicans \ncontrolled the Senate with the Democrats in the White House, vacancies \non the federal courts reached over 100 and through systematic blocking \nof nearly two dozen circuit court nominees of President Clinton, \ncircuit vacancies more than doubled. Despite additional retirements \nsince then, after 197 judicial nominees of President Bush have been \nconfirmed there are now little more than two dozen vacant seats left in \nthe federal judiciary.\n  A second development was the statement of the Democratic leader \nurging bipartisan communications and cooperation. Senator Daschle's \nproposal to seek a politics of common ground should be commended. It \nshould be built upon by both sides. I think many Republican partisans \ntreated Senator Daschle most unfairly during his years as the \nDemocratic leader. It is a measure of that good man and a reflection of \nhis understanding of the Senate that he has sought out common ground. \nIt is a reflection of Senator Daschle's understanding and love for our \nsystem of Government that he disdains bitterness and rejects \nretaliation. Instead, he advocates counsel, cooperation, and respect. I \ncommend my friend, the senior Senator from South Dakota, for that.\n  Many in this Chamber might also recall that one of President \nClinton's first acts upon reelection was to bestow the Presidential \nMedal of Freedom on his political opponent, Senator Bob Dole. I \nconsider myself very fortunate to be one of the Senators who Senator \nDole invited to the White House for that ceremony. I remember the grace \nshown both by Senator Dole and by President Clinton.\n  We would also do well to remember Senator Bob Dole's address to \nMembers of the Senate as part of the leadership series of speeches in \nthe Old Senate Chamber. In that address, he observed the Senate should \nproceed through bipartisanship.\n  Democrats have acted with bipartisanship toward judicial nominations \nand a record number of this President's judicial nominations have been \nconfirmed. A few have not. Some of the nominations the President has \nproposed for lifetime seats on the federal bench have been extremely \ncontroversial, extremely troubling. Today the Senate is debating \nPresident Bush's controversial nomination of J. Leon Holmes to a \nlifetime position to the Federal court in Arkansas. For some reason, he \nis finally coming up for a vote today. The Republican leadership could \nhave brought him up at any time in the last 14 months since his \nnomination was reported out of the Judiciary Committee. The Democratic \nleadership had no objection to him coming up. Many of us oppose the \nnomination, but we had no objection to bringing him up. For some \nreason, the Republican leadership refused to do so for almost 14 \nmonths.\n  As you look at the public record of this nomination, you can almost \nsee why they were embarrassed to bring it up before now. In fact, this \ncontroversial nomination was not only denied consideration by the \nRepublican leadership for over a year, but on a remarkable day last \nspring the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee didn't even give \nhim a positive recommendation. They voted him out without \nrecommendation. On the few occasions that has happened with lower court \nnominees in the past, that pretty much determined you would not get a \nvote on the floor.\n  Can you imagine how troubling the record must be if the majority were \nRepublicans, the nominee was of a Republican President, and a majority \nof the Republicans were not willing to vote for him in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee? So the leadership held him back for over a year.\n  I think I understand why. I think I understand why some of my friends \non the other side of the aisle pay lip service to this nomination and \nare rather embarrassed by it.\n\n  If you look at the record of this nominee, it is quite clear he has \nmade numerous strident, intemperate, and insensitive public statements \nover the years regarding school desegregation, political emancipation, \nschool prayer, voting rights, women's equal rights, gay rights, the \ndeath penalty, the Bill of Rights, and privacy, among other issues.\n  For example, he has argued in the area of reproductive privacy law \nthat ``concern for rape victims is a red herring because conceptions \nfrom rape occur with the same frequency as snow falls in Miami . . . ''\n  I prosecuted a lot of rape cases when I was a prosecutor, and a lot \nof child abuse cases where the child was raped--something that is rape \nunder the law of every State in this Union. I find the statement of \nthis nominee on this issue to be insensitive and appalling. Speak to \nthe family of a 13-year-old girl who is pregnant after being raped by \nher family's best friend, the next-door neighbor, and in some instances \nby her father, and tell them that pregnancy does not happen from rape. \nI prosecuted some of those cases. They are the most sickening and \nappalling things.\n  But I tell Mr. Holmes, if he is confirmed and cases come before his \ncourt, I hope he will open his eyes. I hope he will open his eyes to \nreality and realize these things do happen--not just in this country. \nWhat would he say to the women who are being raped in Sudan for the \npurpose of forcing them to have babies of a certain hue as part of the \ngenocide that is going on in Sudan? It is genocide. Our administration \ndoesn't want to admit it is, but it is.\n\n[[Page S7543]]\n\n  Rape is a serious matter. Mr. Holmes called concerns about pregnant \nrape victims ``trivialities.'' That is his word--``trivialities.'' Ask \na pregnant rape victim if they consider this a trivial matter.\n  By making such remarks, Mr. Holmes has revealed how tightly closed \nhis mind is to seeing the realities of this world. But worse than that, \nhis statements also reveal a callous disregard for the trauma of women \nwho are raped and a disturbingly willful ignorance of the facts.\n  An interesting matter is that according to the Weather Almanac, it \ndid snow one time in Miami, Florida during a freak cold spell in 1977. \nBut a more disturbing statistic is that, according to the American \nJournal of Preventive Medicine, there were more than 25,000 pregnancies \nthat resulted from rape in 1998 in our country alone. Not 1, 2, 3, or \n4; it was 25,000. And this nominee says such things don't occur. He \nsays that people who express such concerns are focused on trivialities.\n  Where in heaven's name has he been living? What kind of a mindset \nwould he bring to a Federal bench? Why in heaven's name did the \nPresident nominate him?\n  In fact, according to the medical journals, as many as 22,000 of \nthose pregnancies could have been prevented if the women had received \nemergency contraceptive treatment. Instead, with more than 300,000 \nrapes each year in the United States, more than 25,000 women each year \nfind that not only were they violated, but they are pregnant as a \nresult. One can barely imagine the trauma and heartache of such a \ncircumstance.\n  For many rape victims, the girl is under 18 or the victim of incest. \nIt is hard to imagine the pain and difficult decisions these young \nwomen face. But Mr. Holmes has called concerns about these women \n``trivialities.''\n  This type of statement and attitude makes one wonder what kind of \njudge he would make, and federal judgeships are for life. Can you \nimagine if such cases were before a judge like this? In my own \nconscience, I could not reward a lifetime position of power to such a \nperson with power over women and men alike.\n  I think this sort of judgmental and intemperate approach is opposite \nof the qualities needed for the Federal bench. Indeed, given Mr. \nHolmes' strong commitment to various political causes of the right wing \nover these past two decades, a Republican Senator was moved to ask this \nnominee: ``Why in the world would you want to serve in a position where \nyou have to exercise restraint and you could not, if you were true to \nyour convictions about what the role of a judge should be, feel like \nyou have done everything you could in order to perhaps achieve justice \nin any given case?''\n  Mr. Holmes, for his part, conceded:\n\n       I know it is going to be difficult for this Committee to \n     assess that question, and I know it is a very important \n     question.\n\n  But for this Senator, a member of that committee, it is a very \ndifficult question, especially with a record like Mr. Holmes'. And it \nis certainly not a question I would answer by giving somebody a \nlifetime appointment to a position of such enormous power.\n  In fact, the question is so difficult that at the Judiciary Committee \nbusiness meeting, where Democrats were prepared to vote on Mr. Holmes' \nnomination, Republican Senators asked for more time to review Mr. \nHolmes' record. I think perhaps that at that meeting some of them heard \nfor the first time some of the statements made by Mr. Holmes in the \nmaterial he submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Eventually, in \nMay of last year, they reported him out provided they did not have to \nvote for him, provided they could vote him out without recommendation. \nThat does not happen very often.\n  The last time I can remember that happening was with Judge Clarence \nThomas. His nomination was reported without recommendation in order to \nallow a vote before the full Senate when he could not achieve a \nmajority in the committee.\n  Like Justice Thomas, Mr. Holmes has been a proponent of what is known \nas a ``natural rights'' or ``natural law'' theory of interpreting our \nConstitution in order to achieve judicial recognition of rights he \nbelieves should exist. He has been supportive of reading new and \nundefined rights into the Constitution based on his personal or \npolitical conception of ``justice.'' This sounds to me like the \njudicial activists the President has said he does not want to see on \nthe bench. I guess if they are very conservative Republican judicial \nactivists, it is OK.\n  Mr. Holmes has supported efforts to require that the language of the \nConstitution be trumped by language he prefers in the Declaration of \nIndependence in order to advance a social agenda against choice and \nagainst the separation of church and state. This method of interpreting \nthe Constitution, the fundamental charter of our democratic nation, \nrepresents an approach which has been advocated by the far right in its \neffort to erode the longstanding separation of church and state that \nassures all Americans their first amendment freedoms.\n  The idea of ``natural law'' is what led to the tyrannical period of \njudicial activism at the turn of the last century in which the Supreme \nCourt struck down numerous State and Federal laws written to protect \nthe health and safety of working Americans. Those decisions are \ndiscussed at length in law school. In the activist Supreme Court \ndecision of Lochner v. New York federal judges found a ``natural \nright'' to contract in employment decisions that trumped any \nlegislative efforts to end child labor--which in many cases was \nbasically child slavery--sweatshops, and the terribly unsafe workplaces \nat the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. The Supreme Court's \nreliance on ``natural rights'' was repudiated in 1937--70 years ago.\n  Mr. Holmes has been critical of the dissenting opinion in the Lochner \ndecision, and he seemingly embraces the idea that the activism of the \nSupreme Court almost 100 years ago was justified.\n  Again, I mention this because President Bush has spoken repeatedly \nagainst judicial activism while simultaneously nominating people likely \nto be judicial activists for his social and political agenda, people \nsuch as Mr. Holmes. This approach is one of those: Watch what we say; \ndon't watch what we do. Republicans will say we are against judicial \nactivists with the one hand, and with the other hand quietly nominate \njudicial activists.\n  One of the most troubling things Mr. Holmes has written is his \ncriticism of what is known in our law as ``substantive due process.'' \nAs even Mr. Holmes conceded in his answers to my questions, substantive \ndue process is the means by which the rights in the Constitution's Bill \nof Rights apply to protect individuals from State governments that \nwould deprive them of those rights, such as the right to freedom of \nreligion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press. Mr. Holmes concedes \nthat as a scholar he disagreed with the idea of substantive due \nprocess, but now, when he is facing a vote on his nomination in the \nSenate, he says basically: Oh, by the way, of course now I see it as \nsettled law. He did not see it that way a few short years ago.\n\n  That reminds me again of another nomination. These issues rose during \nthe hearings on Clarence Thomas's hearings on his nomination to the \nSupreme Court. He had given many speeches praising natural law \nprinciples, but then disavowed them during his Supreme Court \nconfirmation hearings. For example, he praised Lew Lehrman's article, \n``The Declaration of Independence and the Right to Life,'' as ``a \nsplendid example of applying natural law.'' That article looked to the \nDeclaration of Independence as the basis for overturning Roe v. Wade. \nThen, despite his assurances to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he \nwould follow the law in this area if he was confirmed, of course, \nJustice Thomas immediately voted to overturn Roe v. Wade--just the \nopposite of what he said--as soon as he was confirmed. The Senate \ntrusted him, and we saw what happened.\n  Now, Mr. Holmes wishes to regard this issue as one in which we should \njust trust him to set aside what he himself calls his ``history of \nactivism.'' He admitted to a reporter that the ``only cause that I have \nactively campaigned for and really been considered an activist for is \nthe right-to-life issue.'' But then he told the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee that he would not promise to recuse himself from those\n\n[[Page S7544]]\n\ncases in which he has a history of activism. What he said was: Just \ntrust me.\n  Well, I do hope that if the Senate Republicans disagree with me and \nMr. Holmes is confirmed, that he will keep his word and he will not \nimpose his political views on others as a judge, especially as he was \nunder oath when he made that promise. But I have seen too many, even \nthough they were under oath, go back on their word as soon as they were \nconfirmed.\n  This debate is not about his position on right to life issue. We have \nconfirmed numerous judicial nominees of President Bush who have been \nactive in the right-to-life movement or litigation, such as Judge \nLavenski Smith, confirmed to the Eighth Circuit; Judge John Roberts, \nconfirmed to the DC Circuit; Judge Michael McConnell, confirmed to the \nTenth Circuit; Judge Ron Clark, confirmed to the District Court in \nTexas; Judge Ralph Erickson, confirmed to the District Court in North \nDakota; Judge Kurt Englehart and Judge Jay Zainey, confirmed to the \nDistrict Court in Louisiana; and Judge Joe Heaton, confirmed to the \nDistrict Court in Oklahoma--among the 197 judicial nominees of \nPresident Bush who have been confirmed.\n  I have voted for many judges who made it very clear in their public \nrecord that they had taken a right-to-life position. In fact, the \njudges I just mentioned have been at the forefront of efforts to \nreverse Roe v. Wade as lawyers, and all were confirmed.\n  So it is unequivocally false to claim that Democrats have employed a \npro-choice litmus test in voting on judicial nominees--not with all the \nones we have voted for who would fall in that area. But the same, about \nthe litmus test, cannot be said of the choices made by President Bush. \nIt seems he has sought out individuals who share his pro-life views and \nwho have strong pro-life credentials for these lifetime positions as \nFederal judges. In fact, I cannot think of a single judicial nomination \nPresident Bush has made of an individual who has been active on the \npro-choice side of this issue. Senate Democrats have shown we do not \nhave a litmus test. The White House has shown it does.\n  I am also saddened to note Mr. Holmes has attacked efforts to enforce \nthe Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education, the \nlandmark case which declared that separate is inherently unequal. As a \nnation we have just celebrated the 50th anniversary of this unanimous \ndecision of the Supreme Court--a unanimous decision with conservative \nand liberal justices joining together, but here we have a nominee who \nhas criticized efforts to enforce this decision.\n  Brown v. Board of Education helped break the shackles of Jim Crow \nthat had bound the Nation's dream of racial equality and the \nConstitution's promise of the 14th amendment. Instead, Mr. Holmes \nsuggested that the Federal courts should not have the power to order \nschool districts to take actions to remedy segregation that was \nblatantly unconstitutional. But I would remind him that, fortunately, \nthere were judges who did not take this twisted, I might say, cowardly \nview of Brown v. Board of Education.\n  There were countless judges appointed by Republicans and Democrats \nwho had courage in their efforts in the South because they did not \nbelieve our federal courts lacked the power to enforce a remedy to the \nviolation of a fundamental constitutional right. Because of their \ncourage, Brown v. Board of Education was enforced. One has to ask, if \nMr. Holmes, based on his statement, would have shown that courage.\n  I respect the legacy of Judge Ronald Davies, who ordered that Little \nRock Central High be integrated and had the independence and the \nstrength of character to stand up to Governor Orval Faubus and insist \non the enforcement of our Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme \nCourt. We do not honor his legacy--his great, great legacy on this \nissue--by voting for this nominee.\n  In fact, Mr. Holmes has suggested that Booker T. Washington was \ncorrect to teach that slavery in the United States, which resulted in \nthe inhumane, involuntary servitude and often brutal deaths of millions \nof African Americans, was part of divine providence. Mr. Holmes who \nwrote his dissertation on Mr. Washington's controversial ideas, stated \nthat ``what we need to learn from Booker T. Washington is that not \neverything that parades under such banners as `liberation' and \n`freedom' is genuine.''\n  My grandparents and great-grandparents came to this country because \nthey believed that the freedom promised by the Constitution in America \nis genuine. They believed liberation is genuine. They believed that \nthis was a country that guaranteed it. I was sorely disappointed to \nhear Mr. Holmes' statement.\n  I do not think Mr. Holmes is simply out of step with reasonable \ninterpretations of liberty, privacy, and equality. He is marching \nbackward in the direction of an era in which individual rights under \nour Constitution were not fully endorsed by the courts and were often \nempty promises. While such a narrow approach may once have been in \nfavor among a few, his hostility to modern understandings about civil \nrights and human rights is eccentric, to say the least. It is the \nSenate's job under our Constitution to serve as a check on the \nexecutive branch in nomination and it is our job to protect the rights \nof the American people by trying to ensure that we have a fair and an \nindependent Federal judiciary.\n  Given his views of equality and freedom, it is perhaps not surprising \nthat Mr. Holmes has also been critical of full endorsement of voting \nrights. For example, he represented the Republican Party of Arkansas \nbefore the Arkansas Supreme Court in late 2002 to reverse a lower court \norder allowing voting hours to extend beyond statutory times set in \nPulaski County, in Little Rock. In the Republican Party of Arkansas v. \nKilgore, Mr. Holmes was the party's lawyer in its emergency petition to \nthe Arkansas Supreme Court.\n  According to his questionnaire, the Democratic Party ``obtained on \norder at 6:46 p.m. on election night extending the voting hours from \n7:30 p.m., the statutory time for concluding voting, to 9:00 p.m. for \nPulaski County.''\n  Subsequently, Mr. Holmes was able to get all 300 ballots cast after \n7:30 thrown out, even though many of those people, working people, who \nvoted had been waiting in long lines, waiting for their right to vote. \nAccording to press accounts, many of these long lines were in precincts \nwith large numbers of African Americans. I think we should all be \nconcerned when votes are not counted, when the American citizens who \nexercise their right to vote are disenfranchised. Mr. Holmes does not \ngive much weight to this concern.\n  During the Bush v. Gore recount litigation, Mr. Holmes wrote a letter \nto the editor strongly opposing the accurate counting of Presidential \nballots. Why? Such a recount would result in more votes to the \nDemocratic candidate. I do not believe that with the record of this \nnominee that he will be impartial on such issues in Federal court. I \nwould hate to be a Democrat to have to come before his court with views \nlike this, but it appears that this is a case where the White House is \nsaying: We do not want an independent Federal judge. We want somebody \nwho we hope will be an arm of the Republican Party from the bench.\n\n  Finally, I note that among the many very troubling things this \nnominee has said, he has written that he does not think the \nConstitution was made for people of different views. I believe our \nConstitution's tolerance and protection for a diversity of views is one \nof the things that has made our Nation strong. Just look at the first \namendment, the beginning of our Bill of Rights. The first amendment \nsays you have the right to practice any religion you want or none if \nyou want. It says very clearly you have a right of free speech. What it \nsays is that we will have diversity because people have freedom of \nconscience. People have different ideas. Not only does the Constitution \ninherently value diversity, but also it guarantees that diversity will \nbe protected. Anywhere you have diversity protected, you can have a \nstrong democracy.\n  I cannot think of anything I have heard by any nominee that goes so \nmuch against our vision of America than to say that our Constitution \nwas not for people of different views. Mr. Holmes seems to think the \nConstitution is meant only for people who share his own views of the \nworld. I cannot imagine a fairminded person suggesting, as this nominee \nhas, that Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes erred when\n\n[[Page S7545]]\n\nhe wrote that the judicial activism of a century ago was wrong. Justice \nHolmes stood up against other judges who were substituting their \npersonal, political, and economic views for those of legislators. \nJustice Holmes observed our Constitution is made for people of \ndifferent views, but Mr. Holmes specifically objects to that vision of \nour Nation's charter.\n  I cannot imagine a fairminded and open-minded person staking out the \nground that Mr. Holmes has. Mr. J. Leon Holmes has taken issue with \nthat bedrock principle of our law. It is abundantly clear from the \nnominee's own writings and record why this nomination has stirred such \ncontroversy in the Senate and among the American people. Mr. Holmes \nmight be one of the most intolerant nominees we have had before the \nSenate for a confirmation vote in the time I have been in the Senate. I \ncan see why, even with a Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee, he \ncould not get a majority vote to support him. He should not get a \nmajority vote in the Senate.\n  Ask yourselves, men and women of this Senate, can you really vote to \ngive somebody a lifetime appointment when they interpret the laws of \nthis Nation--somebody who says that the laws are not made to protect \ndiversity in America? Tell my Irish grandfather and my Italian \ngrandfather, both of whom were stonecutters in Vermont, that our \nConstitution should not protect people from diverse backgrounds. I \ncannot believe that a judicial nominee would take issue with this core \nvalue because he wants to impose his own political views on the \nConstitution.\n  What we have before us is a very troubling nomination. Here, the \nPresident, who campaigned against the idea of judicial activism, has \nnominated somebody who is unabashedly an activist in a wide range of \nissues taking a narrow view of individual rights. The President, who \nhas said he wants to respect all views in the country, has nominated \nsomebody who does not believe in such diversity.\n  I still cannot get out of my mind the comments about rape and \npregnancy. I still have nightmares when I think of some of the cases I \nprosecuted, some of the children I counseled, some of the families who \ngrieved in my office, some of the lives I saw shattered by children who \nhad been raped, became pregnant from that rape, and also were abused.\n  I will soon yield the floor so others may speak. I will vote against \nMr. Holmes. He is not a man who should be on the federal bench with a \nlifetime post interpreting the rights of others, a man whose mind is so \nset against women's rights no matter how polite he may be, so set \nagainst the idea of protecting diversity, so set against the way our \nConstitution should be interpreted. His writings are a throwback to \ndarker days in our Nation's approach to the law and the fundamental \nfreedoms promised by our Constitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been here a long time. I sat through \nthe comments of the Senator. I have heard a lot of remarks on the floor \nof the Senate with regard to judges. In fact, I have heard them for the \nlast 28 years. I have to say that not only do I totally disagree with \neverything the distinguished Senator from Vermont has said, but I \nbelieve he has seriously distorted this man's record. Let me just \nanswer these distortions with maybe a few points.\n  No. 1, this man has the support of virtually everybody who counts in \nArkansas--Democrats and Republicans.\n  No. 2, he has the support of the leading newspapers in Arkansas, \nwhich are not necessarily known for supporting Republicans.\n  No. 3, this man is an intellectually profound man who earned a Ph.D. \nfrom Duke University before he got his law degree. He graduated with \nhonors with his law degree as well.\n  No. 4, this man has the blessing of the American Bar Association, \nwith the highest rating a person can have.\n  No. 5, Leon Holmes is a very religious person, and virtually \neverybody who writes in his favor--virtually everybody I have seen, \nincluding many Democrat leaders in Arkansas--state that he is totally \ncapable of putting aside his deeply held personal beliefs in order to \nact with dispassion and fairness on the bench.\n  No. 6, a number of Democrat pro-choice women lawyers have written in \nand informed us that he has been their mentor, their advocate to \npartnership in his law firm; that he has not only been fair, he has \nbeen decent, honorable, and he has been their friend, even though they \ndisagree with some of his personal views.\n  My gosh, if we are going to bring up every case an attorney has \ntried, because we differ with his particular clients, and paint the \nattorney as somebody who is not a good person, as has been done here, \nwe would not have very many judges confirmed.\n  I could go on and on. Let me say that you don't get the well-\nqualified highest rating from the ABA because you are a jerk, as has \nbeen painted here. You don't get the support of Democrats and \nRepublicans in your home State if you are a partisan who won't obey or \nfollow the law. You don't get a Ph.D. from Duke unless you are a very \nbright person and somebody who has earned the right to a Ph.D. His \nstudies were mainly of three great Black leaders, including DuBois, \nWashington, and Martin Luther King, Jr.\n  I could go on and on. I am just saying that I guess we could find a \nway to decry anybody who has ever tried a case, or at least a \ncontroversial case. Attorneys do that. I know the distinguished Senator \nfrom Vermont has done that. I have done that. If this body cannot \nunderstand why a person, when they are very young, makes some \nstatements they are sorry they made later, then what body can? Many of \nthe statements that have been described today are statements that were \nmade almost 24 years ago, for which Leon Holmes has apologized and has \nreceived forgiveness from the people of Arkansas, and especially the \ntwo Senators from Arkansas, who know him more than anybody else here. \nThey are both strong advocates for Leon Holmes.\n  Yet we sit here and hear very inappropriate comments and, in my \nopinion, highly distorted, about a man who is considered one of the \nbetter lawyers in Arkansas, maybe one of the better lawyers in the \ncountry. Look, it is time we quit playing these games with judges. Our \nside should not do it and the other side should not do it. If you \ndisagree with Leon Holmes, vote against him, but you don't have to \ndistort his record. Virtually every legitimate criticism he has had has \nbeen answered, and answered substantively. In fact, every legitimate \nquestion that has been raised has been answered.\n\n  This is a fine man who has the support of his media, which is pretty \nunusual for a pro-life Republican. He has the support of the bar down \nthere. He has the support of Democratic women, as well as Republican \nwomen. He has the support of people who live religious lives. He has \nthe support of his partners, many of whom are Democrats who don't agree \nwith his personal views--although I think many would agree with his \npersonal views. His personal views are legitimate, but there is room to \ndisagree. But I don't know anybody of substance in Arkansas who thinks \nthis man is unworthy to be on the Federal district bench, or thinks he \nwill not obey the law when he gets on the Federal district bench, or \nthinks he will not uphold the law when he gets on the Federal district \nbench.\n  I could go through every argument that has been made and every one is \nnot unanswerable but I think overwhelmingly answerable. It comes down \nto some statements he made a long time ago for which he has apologized, \nwhich he has said were insensitive. He was a young man dedicated to the \npro-life movement and he made some insensitive statements, as some do \non both sides in pro-life or pro-choice contingencies.\n  This man deserves a vote up or down. I hope he will receive that and \nI hope he will be confirmed. But those who vote against him, I think, \nare doing so without the consideration of the high qualities this man \noffers, and without the recognition of the many Democrats who have \nwritten in favor of him. Many pro-choice Democrats have written in \nfavor of him. If we are going to debate, we should debate the facts, \nnot distortions of the facts. He has apologized and made amends. He \nasked forgiveness for some of his remarks that were insensitive.\n  I hope around here we are not of the persuasion or opinion that \neverybody who comes to the Federal bench has to be perfect from the \ntime they graduate from law school on, or even before\n\n[[Page S7546]]\n\nthat, or because we differ with them on one or two positions that may \nbe very important issues to one side or the other, they do not have a \nright to serve on the bench, or that there may be people of deeply held \nreligious views who are unwilling to admit, because I think of some of \nthe stereotypes around here, they can do a great job on the bench in \nspite of their religious views.\n  In this particular case, this man is a very religious man who has \nmade it more than clear that he will abide by the law even when he \ndiffers with it. This is a trial judge position. This is not the \nSupreme Court. But it is an important position, and I compliment my \ncolleagues on both sides for scrutinizing all of these judgeships. But \nif they scrutinize fairly this man's record and what he has done, his \nreputation, his ability in the law, and his honesty and decency, then \nthey are going to have to vote for him. If my colleagues do not do \nthat, then I suppose they can vote against him. If they do so, they \nreally have not looked at the record, have not been fair, and they have \nallowed buzz issues that have long since been answered to take a \nprecedent position in the arguments that should not be permitted.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President. I began this day calling for bipartisanship \nand civility in this Chamber. It seems that call has fallen on deaf \nears with Republicans renewing their baseless charges that Democrats \nare anti-Catholic. Some Republicans keep recycling these reckless \ncharges even though they are false. They do so in order to play wedge \npolitics, the type of dirty politics preferred by the President's \nstrategist Karl Rove. I have called on the White House to disavow these \ncharges of religious bigotry. After all, President Bush ran for office \nclaiming that he would change the tone in Washington and ``be a uniter, \nnot a divider.'' His repeated actions to the contrary speak louder than \nhis words. I have called on the Republican administration to disavow \nthese anti-Catholic claims. Everyone knows that the President's \nfather's counsel is pushing these false and partisan charges against \nDemocrats. The White House has not stopped these charges. Its allies \ncontinue to throw this mud. It is beneath the dignity of this body.\n  Anyone who reviewed the public submissions of the 197 judicial \nnominees of President Bush we have confirmed would see that many of \nthese nominees have been active volunteers in their communities, \nincluding their parishes and other faith-based organizations. For \nexample, the judges we have confirmed have been active members of their \nDiocesan Parish Council, the Friends of Cardinal Munich Seminary, the \nAltar and Rosary Society, the Knights of Columbus, the Archdiocese \nCatholic Foundation, Catholic Charities, the Archbishop's Community \nRelief Fund, the Catholic Metropolitan School Board, Serra Club, their \nParish and Pastoral Councils, the Homebound Eucharistic Ministers \nProgram, the St. Thomas More Catholic Lawyers Association, the John \nCarroll Society, the Guild of Catholic Lawyers, the Catholic League for \nReligious and Civil Rights, and the U.S. Catholic Conference, among \nother organizations. How dare Republicans come to this floor and claim \nthat Democrats oppose Catholics or others active in their church when \nthe public records of the 197 nominees confirmed absolutely refute \nthese false and hurtful claims.\n  I stand against the religious McCarthyism being used by some \nRepublicans to smear Senators who dare to vote against this President's \nmost extreme nominees for lifetime positions on the federal courts. We \nshould come together to condemn their injection of religious smears \ninto the judicial nomination process. Partisan political groups have \nused religious intolerance and bigotry to raise money and to punish and \nbroadcast dishonest ads that falsely accuse Democratic Senators of \nbeing anti-Catholic. I cannot think of anything in my 29 years in the \nSenate that has angered me or upset me so much as this. Earlier this \nsession I recall emerging from mass to learn that one of these \nadvocates had been on C-SPAN at the same time that morning to brand me \nan anti-Christian bigot.\n  As an American of Irish and Italian heritage, I remember my parents \ntalking about days I thought were long past, when Irish Catholics were \ngreeted with signs that told them they did not need apply for jobs. \nItalians were told that Americans did not want them or their religious \nways. This is what my parents saw, and a time that they lived to see as \nlong passed. And my parents, rest their souls, though this time was \nlong past, because it was a horrible part of U.S. history, and it mocks \nthe pain--the smears we see today mock the pain and injustice of what \nso many American Catholics went through at that time. These partisan \nhate groups rekindle that divisiveness by digging up past intolerances \nand breathing life into that shameful history, and they do it for \nshort-term political gains. To raise the specter of religious \nintolerance in order to try to turn our independent federal courts into \nan arm of the Republican party is an outrage. They want to subvert the \nvery constitutional process designed to protect all Americans from \nprejudice and injustice. It is shocking that they would cavalierly \ndestroy the independence of our federal courts.\n\n  It is sad, and it is an affront to the Senate as well as to so many, \nwhen we see senators sit silent when they are invited to disavow these \nabuses. Where are the fair-mined Republican Senators? Where are the \nvoices of reason of moderate Members of this body? Do they agree with \nthis wedge campaign by the more extreme elements in the Republican \nparty to cause further divide in our nation along religious lines? What \nhas silenced these Senators who otherwise have taken moderate and \nindependent stands in the past? Are they so afraid of the White House \nthat they would allow this religious McCarthyism to take place? Why are \nthey allowing this to go on? The demagoguery, divisive and partisan \npolitics being so cynically used by supporters of the President's most \nextreme judicial nominees needs to stop.\n  These smears are lies, and like all lies they depend on the silence \nof others to live, and to gain root. It is time for the silence to end. \nThe administration has to accept responsibility for the smear campaign; \nthe process starts with the President. We would not see this stark \ndivisiveness if the President would seek to unite, instead of to \ndivide, the American people and the Senate with his choices for the \nFederal courts.\n  And those senators who actively join in this kind of a religion \nsmear; they may do it to chill debate on whether Mr. Holmes can be a \nfair and impartial judge, but they do far more. They hurt the whole \ncountry. They hurt Christians and non-Christians. They hurt believers \nand non-believers. They hurt all of us, because the Constitution \nrequires judges to apply the law, not their political views, and \ninstead they try to subvert the Constitution. And remember, all of us, \nno matter what our faith--and I am proud of mine--no matter what our \nfaith, we are able to practice it, or none if we want, because of the \nConstitution. All of us ought to understand that the Constitution is \nthere to protect us, and it is the protection of the Constitution that \nhas seen this country evolve into a tolerant country. And those who \nwould try to put it back, for short-term political gains, subvert the \nConstitution, and they damage the country.\n  These baseless and outrageous claims harken back to dark days in our \nnation's history. I was just a young man growing up in Montpelier, VT \nwhen Senator Joseph McCarthy rose to power and ignomy as one of our \ncountry's worst demagogues through his spectacular brand of \nthe politics of destruction. Senator McCarthy first claimed to a \nRepublican Party club in West Virginia that he had a list of 205 known \ncommunists in the State Department. The next day, in Salt Lake City, he \nclaimed he had a list of 57 ``card-carrying communists'' at the State \nDepartment. At other times he claimed there were 81. You see, the facts \ndo not really matter to McCarthyists--so long as the claim is \nspectacular and causes voters alarm.\n\n  I think many Americans believed because they could not imagine why \nsomeone would make such false allegations and smear the reputations of \ninnocent people. That is the advantage of the demagogue, but we must be \never vigilant that such a lie does not become the truth through the \nalchemy of repetition.\n  Shortly afterward his remarks in Utah, Senator McCarthy came to the \nfloor of the Senate, this floor, and asserted that he had dossiers on \nfederal\n\n[[Page S7547]]\n\nemployees who were un-American, changing descriptions as he read them. \nFor example where one person was described as ``liberal'' on paper, \nSenator McCarthy substituted the infammatory ``communistically \ninclined.'' That year, in 1950, a Senate Committee investigating \nSenator McCarthy's charges issued a report, known as the Tydings \nCommittee Report after Maryland Senator Millard Tydings who chaired the \nsubcommittee looking into the lies that were being spread. A critical \npiece of that report from 1950 has relevance today, more than 50 years \nlater so I would like to quote a paragraph in full:\n\n       At a time when American blood is again being shed to \n     preserve our dream of freedom, we are constrained fearlessly \n     and frankly to call the charges, and the methods employed to \n     give them ostensible validity, what they truly are: A fraud \n     and a hoax perpetrated on the Senate of the United States and \n     the American people. They represent perhaps the most \n     nefarious campaign of half-truths and untruth in the history \n     of the Republic. For the first time in our history, we have \n     seen the totalitarian technique of the ``big lie'' employed \n     on a sustained basis. The result has been to confuse and \n     divide the American people at a time when they should be \n     strong in their unity, to a degree far beyond the hopes of \n     the Communists whose stock in trade is confusion and \n     division. In such a disillusioning setting, we appreciate as \n     never before our Bill of Rights, a free press, and the \n     heritage of freedom that has made this Nation great.\n\n  This quote is from the Report of the Committee on Foreign Relations \npursuant to S. Res. 231, a resolution to investigate whether there are \nemployees in the State Department disloyal to the United States, dated \nJuly 20, 1950.\n  The Tydings Report also noted that ``few people, cognizant of the \ntruth in even an elementary way, have, in the absence of political \npartisanship, placed any credence in the hit-and-run tactics of Senator \nMcCarthy.'' Similarly, the Report sagely observed that ``the oft-\nrepeated and natural reaction of many good people . . . goes something \nlike this--`Well there must be something to the charges, or a United \nStates Senator would never have made them!' The simple truth now is \napparent that a conclusion based on this premise, while normally true, \nis here erroneous. . . .'' Unfortunately, we face a similar situation \ntoday.\n  It was not until 1954 that Senator McCarthy's deceitful campaign \nearned the censure of the full Senate for conduct unbecoming a Member \nof the Senate. I do remember that year when one of the greatest \nSenators of Vermont, Ralph Flanders, stood up on this floor, even \nthough he was a Republican, sort of the quintessential Republican and \ncondemned the tactics of Joe McCarthy on several occasions.\n  For example, on June 1, 1954, Senator Flanders renewed his deep \nconcerns about the allegations of Senator McCarthy and made some \nobservations that are particularly relevant, unfortunately, to the \nrecnt religious smear of Republicans in 2003. He noted how Senator \nMcCarthy's political agenda involved sowing division and fear among \npeople of different faiths--Jews, Protestants, and Catholics. After \ninstilling fear in Jewish Americans, McCarthyists ``charged the \nProtestant ministry with being, in effect, the center of Communist \ninfluence in this country.'' As Senator Flanders observed, ``the ghost \nof religious intolerance was not laid'' by the departure of a few close \nallies of Senator McCarthy who had been rebuked for attacking a \nmajority faith in this country. As Senator Flanders noted, ``Clearer \nand clearer evidence of the danger of setting church against church, \nCatholic against Protestant. . . . [Senator McCarthy's] success in \ndividing his country and his church'' was paralleled only by his \ndivisiveness to the Republican party.\n  Later that summer, Senator Flanders offered resolution of censure \ncondemning the conduct of Senator McCarthy, who had smeared so many \ninnocent people with his false claims and treated some of his \ncolleagues in this body with contempt in his zeal. He noted Senator \nMcCarthy's penchant for breaking rules, ``The Senator [McCarthy] can \nbreak rules faster than we can make them.'' When the Senate considered \nthe matter, it censured Senator McCarthy, and rightly so.\n  History properly condemns him and his cohorts, even though it has \nbecome fashionable for right-wing extremists such as Ann Coulter to \nattempt to rewrite history and call him a brave hero who saved America. \nThe fact is that our Nation and Constitution are lucky to have survived \nhis divisive, destructive and manipulative tactics which were then and \nremain, the words of Senator Flanders, a blot on the reputation of the \nSenate. He was a ruthless political opportunist who exploited his \nposition of power in the Senate to smear hundreds of innocent people \nand win headlines and followers with his false assertions and innuendo, \nwithout regard to facts, evidence, rules and human decency.\n  Senator Flanders of Vermont stood up and fearlessly condemned what \nJoseph McCarthy was doing. And it stopped. I hope some will stand up \nand condemn these McCarthyist charges of anti-Catholic bigotry leveled \nat Catholics and others who are members of he Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and Members of this Senate.\n  The reality is that not one of the Democratic Senators in Committee \nwho voted against Mr. Holmes did so because he is Catholic. Half of the \nDemocratic Members of the Judiciary Committee are Catholic. We would \nnot vote for him or vote against him because of his religious \naffiliation. What we cared about was Mr. Holmes long history of \nstatements that he himself admits have been inflammatory and \nunfortunate. Among the many concerns are his statements that the \nConstitution, our Constitution, is not meant for people of different \nviews. His intolerance of the views of others is manifest in numerous \nstatements he has made. His insensitivity to rights of others is also \napparent, no matter how polite a person he may be.\n\n  His statements against efforts to implement the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Brown v. Board of Education, his opposition to Federal law \nintended to restore basic civil rights rules that had been modified by \nconservative activist judges, his denigration of political rights for \nAfrican Americans, his active work to limit people exercising their \nright to vote or to have their vote counted, and his screeds against \nwomen's rights are just too much to overlook. The President has marked \nthe anniversary of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 with public \nspeeches while below the radar screen he has put forward nominee after \nnominee with records of hostility toward civil rights, toward women's \nrights, toward environmental protections, and toward human rights. This \nPresident knows what he is looking for in the legacy he wants to leave \nwith the lifetime appointees he has put forward. He has nominated more \npeople active in the Federalist Society, such as Leon Holmes, than \nAfrican Americans, Latinos or Asians combined. He is more committed to \nideological purity than to diversity or full enforcement of civil \nrights.\n  President Bush has claimed that he wants judges who will interpret \nthe law and not make the law, but in the aftermath of the \nadministration's re-interpretation of the laws against torture that \nassurance is meaningless. Just look at the torture memo written by Jay \nBybee, who was confirmed for a lifetime seat on the Ninth Circuit after \nstonewalling the Senate on his legal work and views. It is not fair to \nthe American people that this President's judicial nominees be given \nthe benefit of the doubt. Here, in Leon Holmes, we have a nominee whose \nviews are well known. There is little doubt what kind of activist judge \nhe was chosen to be and will be if confirmed.\n  Senator Hatch has claimed that asking about whether a nominee will \nfollow Supreme Court precedent on privacy and choice is out of bounds \nbecause in his view ``the great majority of people who are pro-life \ncome to their positions as a result of their religious convictions. We \nhold this view as a religious tenet, and this is part and parcel of who \nwe are.'' Under Senator Hatch's view that it is improper to ask \njudicial nominees about their view of legal issues that may also relate \nsomehow to a religious position. I ask, however, would it be wrong for \nthe Senate to ask a nominee for a lifetime position for their views on \nracial discrimination? Of course that would be absurd and an abdication \nof our responsibility to serve as a check on the nominees put forward \nby this or any President. As Senator Durbin has mentioned based on the \ntragic shootings instigated by the racist World Church of the\n\n[[Page S7548]]\n\nCreator in Illinois, it would be irresponsible for the Senate in its \nadvice-and-consent role to ignore, for example, questions of racial \ndiscrimination if those views can be cloaked in religious garb.\n  The Senate has considered the views of nominees since the beginning \nof our Nation, when Justice John Rutledge's nomination to be Chief \nJustice of the Supreme Court was rejected for a speech he gave \nexpressing his views on a treaty. To assert suddenly that although \nPresident Bush and his advisors can consider a judicial candidate's \nviews, such as on race or choice, the Senate is forbidden from doing so \nis a terrible manipulation of the process. The Constitution gives the \nSenate an equal role in the decision about who serves on the Federal \ncourts, not a lesser rule and certainly not that of a rubber stamp. \nWith these religious assertions, Republicans may think that they have \nfound a loophole to avoid public questions to and answers by their \nhand-picked judicial nominees about their views that both Democrats and \nRepublicans actually consider to be significant areas of law. Support \nfor protecting racial discrimination should be allowed no loophole from \nscrutiny. A nominee's beliefs and views about constitutional rights \nshould not be hidden from public view until after a nominee is \nconfirmed to a lifetime seat on the bench.\n\n  The truth is that Mr. Holmes' affiliation with the Catholic Church \nneither disqualifies him nor qualifies him for the Federal bench. And \nthis is how it should be, how it must be, under our Constitution. Mr. \nHolmes' record is what causes grave concerns. He has been active and \noutspoken with rigid and radical views about the meaning of the \nConstitution, the role of the Federal Government, equality rights and \nother liberties.\n  Republicans have falsely claimed that Democrats have an anti-Catholic \nbias because we oppose the nomination of Leon Holmes for a lifetime job \nas a Federal judge. The opposition to Mr. Holmes is not based on his \nreligious affiliation. No matter his faith, Mr. Holmes' record does not \ndemonstrate that he will be fair to all people on most legal issues \nthat affect the rights of all Americans. Mr. Holmes' religious \naffiliation is irrelevant to these serious matters of concern about \nwhether he would be a fair judge. He has no meaningful judicial \nexperience that would demonstrate his ability to set aside his views \nand apply the law fairly. To suggest otherwise is low and base.\n  It is also untrue to claim that Democrats have a pro-choice litmus \ntest. Many of the 197 judicial nominees of President Bush have been \nactive in pro-life issues or organizations according to the public \nrecord, and most have been confirmed unanimously, such as Ron Clark, a \npro-life former Texas State legislator, Ralph Erickson, who was active \nin pro-life groups in North Dakota, Kurt Englehardt, a former pro-life \nleader in Louisiana, and Joe Heaton, a pro-life former Oklahoma \nlegislator. The public record shows that it is obviously false to claim \nthat Democrats have employed a pro-choice or anti-Catholic litmus test \nin voting on judicial nominees.\n  Why anyone would tell such lies, claiming that Democrats are anti-\nCatholic or anti-pro-life, and sow such seeds of division and hate. \nWhy, as Senator Tydings asked in regard to McCarthy, why would anyone \non the floor of the Senate or in a committee or in a hallway press \nconference in the Capitol or anywhere make such charges if there were \nnot something to them? Conservative columnist Byron York noted that \nRepublicans are working closely with some organizations to press the \ndebate: `` `The issue is playing very well in the Catholic press and in \nCatholic e-mail alerts,' the [unnamed] Republican says. `You tap into \nan entire community that has its own press, its own e-mail systems, and \nthat has been tenderized by anti-Catholicism, which they consider to be \nthe last permissible bias in America.' '' This religious McCarthyism of \nRepublican partisans is bad for the Senate. It is bad for the courts. \nAnd it is bad for the country.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the \ntime be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to share my views \non this nominee to the Federal district court. I heard our \ndistinguished chairman, a man who I greatly respect and admire, mention \nhe was recommended as well qualified by the American Bar Association, \nand that he in fact could distance himself from his personal beliefs; \nthat he is a deeply religious man, and the chairman believed he would \nbe able to truly distance himself.\n  I have a very hard time believing that. If I look at his personal \nbeliefs, they are extraordinary and they are way out of line with the \nmainstream of American thinking. I want to comment a little bit about \nthem. They are not only outside the mainstream of American thinking, \nbut they are outside the mainstream of American judicial thought as \nwell.\n  Mr. Holmes has no real judicial experience. That is what makes it \ndifficult, because there is no way we know whether he can distance \nhimself from many of the comments he has made over many years. He is a \nnative of Arkansas. He is a practicing lawyer at a law firm. He has \ndone some teaching at the University of Arkansas and at the Thomas \nAquinas College in my State: California.\n  With the exception of two instances where he served as a special \njudge on the Arkansas Supreme Court, he has no judicial experience. But \nthat is not my main objection. My main objection is over the past 24 \nyears he has put forward in word and writing philosophies that are far \nfrom U.S. mainstream opinion on a whole series of subjects, from \nwomen's rights, to choice, to race, and to the separation of church and \nstate. These statements make him a very troubling nominee, and I have \nnever--again, never--before voted ``no'' on a nominee to the district \ncourt. This is my first ``no'' vote in the 12 years I have been on the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Let me give you a few examples. Let me take a subject, women's \nrights. Seven years ago--it is not too long ago--seven years ago he \nwrote:\n\n       ``The wife is to subordinate herself to her husband,'' and \n     that ``the woman is to place herself under the authority of \n     the man.''\n\n  This belief, if sustained, clearly places this nominee in a place \napart. But this is not merely my own view, it is the view of the equal \nprotection clause of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which I \nwould hope any Federal judge would uphold.\n  It is also the view of numerous Federal civil rights laws, including \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, for which the Nation celebrated its 40th \nanniversary on July 2. How can I or any other American believe that one \nwho truly believes a woman is subordinate to her spouse can interpret \nthe Constitution fairly? When women are parties to claims of job \ndiscrimination, sexual harassment, domestic violence, and a host of \nother issues involving the role of women in society, how can I be \nassured they can get a fair hearing from Leon Holmes? What will a \nplaintiff think when she finds out the judge hearing her case thinks \nwomen should subordinate themselves to men?\n  That is a fairly crisp view. It is a view I have not seen presented, \ncertainly in the last 20 years, in any serious way.\n  Let's take a woman's right to choose. Again and again over decades, \nMr. Holmes has made comments that show he is solidly opposed to a \nwoman's right to choose, even in the case of rape. Let me give an \nexample.\n  In a letter that he wrote to the Moline Daily Dispatch--this is a \nletter he writes to a newspaper--Mr. Holmes called rape victims who \nbecome pregnant ``trivialities.''\n  How is a rape victim ever a triviality?\n  He wrote in that same letter that ``concern for rape victims is a red \nherring because conceptions from rape occur with approximately the same \nfrequency as snowfall in Miami.''\n  That might be a cute phrase but, in fact, it is grossly incorrect. \nSnow falls in Miami about once every 100 years, but, according to the \nAmerican Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, each\n\n[[Page S7549]]\n\nyear in America over 30,000 women become pregnant as a result of rape \nor incest. This is hardly a trivial matter.\n  Mr. Holmes' letter wasn't a one-time comment. I can excuse a lot of \none-time comments. I understand how they happen. I understand how they \ncan be taken out of context. But he has also been an opponent of a \nwoman's right to choose for decades. Other comments he has made on the \nvery sensitive issue of abortion are equally insensitive. For example, \nhe said:\n\n       I think the abortion issue is the simplest issue this \n     country has faced since slavery was made unconstitutional, \n     and it deserves the same response.\n\n  In other words, end it. It is a very precise point of view.\n  Mr. Holmes has stated:\n\n       The pro-abortionists counsel us to respond to these \n     problems by abandoning what little morality our society still \n     recognizes. This was attempted by one highly sophisticated, \n     historically Christian nation in our history--Nazi Germany.\n\n  In a 1987 article written to the Arkansas Democrat, Mr. Holmes wrote:\n\n       [T]he basic purpose of government is to prevent the killing \n     of innocent people, so the government has an obligation to \n     stop abortion.\n\n  Seven years later, in a 1995 interview, with the Arkansas Democrat \nGazette, Mr. Holmes stated:\n\n       I would like to appear before the Supreme Court of the \n     United States, and I would like to have argued Roe v. Wade.\n\n  In response to Senator Durbin's written question asking what Supreme \nCourt cases Mr. Holmes disagrees with, he answered: Dred Scott v. \nSanford, Buck v. Bell, and Roe v. Wade.\n  Dred Scott held that blacks were not people under the Constitution. \nAs you know, Buck v. Bell held that a woman could be sterilized against \nher will. Those cases were abominations.\n  To include Roe v. Wade with these two decisions clearly indicates \nthat he holds Roe as a decision to be abolished. This is simply not a \nmainstream perspective.\n  These comments don't sound as if they come from a man with an open \nmind about a most sensitive issue. Rather, they sound as if they come \nfrom a man with an agenda to eliminate the constitutional rights of \nAmerican women to choose.\n  That is a problem for me because I don't believe someone who has \nthese views can fairly hand out justice. I don't believe such a person \nshould be a Federal judge for the rest of his life.\n  Mr. Holmes is not merely opposed to a woman's constitutionally \nprotected right to choose. He has also lashed out at contraception, \nagainst women generally, and against the rights of gays and lesbians. \nHe wrote in 1997:\n\n       It is not coincidental that the feminist movement brought \n     with it artificial contraception and abortion on demand, with \n     recognition of homosexual liaisons soon to follow.\n\n  That is emotion-laden language. It is offensive to a whole host of a \nnumber of people. It is extraordinary language. It certainly is not a \nline of thinking with which I can agree. These are all areas where the \nFederal courts play a vital role.\n  He has also made some shocking statements about race in America. \nSpecifically, in a 1981 article, he wrote for a journal called \nChristianity Today about Booker T. Washington. This is what he wrote:\n\n       He taught that God had placed the Negro in America so it \n     could teach the white race by example what it means to be \n     Christlike. Moreover, he believed that God could use the \n     Negroes' situation to uplift the white race spiritually.\n\n  Mr. Holmes first wrote those words 23 years ago. But he still stands \nby them. In April of last year, Leon Holmes wrote to Senator Lincoln:\n\n       My article combines [Washington's] view of providence--that \n     God brings good out of evil--with his view that we are all \n     called to love one another. This teaching can be criticized \n     only if it is misunderstood.\n\n  Are these the words of a man who should be confirmed to interpret the \nequal protection clause of our Constitution without prejudice, to \ninterpret the due process clause, to interpret Federal civil rights \nstatutes?\n  In my view, Mr. Holmes' statements also indicate that he can't \nseparate his own religious views from the Federal law he will be \ncharged with interpreting. This is a trait that is particularly \ndangerous, given the strong views he has taken.\n  On religion, in a speech he delivered 2 years ago in Anne Arbor, MI, \nhe stated:\n\n       Christianity, unlike the pagan religions, transcends the \n     political order.\n\n  That is really food for thought.\n  He continues:\n\n       Christianity, in principle, cannot accept subordination to \n     the political authorities, for the end to which it directs \n     men is higher than the end of the political order; the source \n     of its authority is higher than the political authority.\n\n  I guess one could say that all depends on what he means by the \npolitical order. The political order produces the law and the court \ninterprets the law.\n  If he is saying the political order which produces the law is \nsubservient to Christianity, how can we feel this is going to be an \nopen-minded judge?\n  He also stated in the same speech that he was ``left with some unease \nabout this notion that Christianity and the political order should be \nassigned to separate spheres, in part because it seems unavoidably \nambiguous.''\n  I have no desire to cause Mr. Holmes any additional ``unease.'' But \nif he is confirmed today, that is what he will have, whenever a \nquestion about the separation of church and state comes before him. The \nFirst Amendment in reality is not ``ambiguous.'' It clearly states that \nthere shall be ``no law respecting an establishment of religion.''\n  My concerns go further than First Amendment cases. If Mr. Holmes \nbecomes a U.S. district court judge, how can we be sure he will \nseparate his faith from the law? How will the parties before him know \nhe is basing his rulings on the U.S. Constitution rather than on his \nspiritual faith?\n  This is not a statement on belief. I respect Mr. Holmes' right to his \nown faith, and I generally believe that a strong and abiding faith is a \npositive, not a negative, factor in reviewing an individual for public \nservice. But here, where a nominee has himself said that faith must \ntrump the law, it would be troubling at best to grant that nominee a \nlifetime seat on a Federal bench where law must trump all else, if our \nsystem of justice is to work.\n  Mr. Holmes' disconcerting views about the Constitution go beyond what \nhe thinks about a particular area of law. He has expressed support for \nthe concept of natural law, which holds there are laws that trump the \nlaw of the Constitution.\n\n  Natural law, simply put, holds that the Constitution is not the \nsupreme law of the land. Rather, those who believe in natural law would \nsubordinate the Constitution to some higher law. This concept is \nstarkly at odds with the role of a Federal judge, who must swear to \nuphold the Constitution. But Mr. Holmes says that natural law trumps, \nas I understand it, the Constitution which he takes an oath to uphold.\n  In an article three years ago, in 2001, he wrote:\n\n       [T]he Constitution was intended to reflect the principles \n     of natural law.\n\n  In response to a written question from Senator Durbin, Mr. Holmes \nwrote:\n\n       [M]y view of natural rights derives from the Declaration of \n     Independence.\n\n  Now the Declaration of Independence, which all Americans joyfully \ncelebrated this past weekend, is the source of our Nation's liberation. \nThe Constitution is the source of our Government and our laws. So they \nare separate and distinct from one another. This is a critical \ndistinction, and I am not sure Mr. Holmes appreciates that. If he reads \nnatural law into the Constitution, then he is not reading the same \nConstitution as the rest of America.\n  There is one final issue I would like to address. At the end of last \nmonth, on June 24, we confirmed six judges in a single day. Since the \naccommodation of the White House, the Senate has confirmed 24 of the 25 \njudges to which we agreed to proceed to floor votes. We have confirmed \n28 nominations this year alone, including 5 circuit court nominations. \nAnd the Senate has confirmed 197 judges since President Bush was \nelected as our President.\n  I have always maintained my own counsel when it comes to the \nconfirmation of judicial nominees. I do not use my blue slip. I do not \nmake a decision until after the individual has a hearing and generally \nuntil after he or she has answered the written questions. I have always \ntried to see the potential for\n\n[[Page S7550]]\n\ngood in the nominees who come to us. When the President nominates a \nperson to the Senate, it is my feeling we should do everything we can \nto respect the President's choices, while still taking with the utmost \nseriousness our own constitutional obligation to advise and consent.\n  To that end, as I said before, I have never before opposed a nominee \nto a U.S. district court. I have also supported nominees to the Court \nof Federal Claims--Susan Braden, Charles Lettow, and Victor Wolski--\nwhom other Democrats opposed.\n  Even at the level of the U.S. Court of Appeals, I have supported \nnominees whom others have opposed. I supported the nomination of \nJeffrey Sutton to the Sixth Circuit, and I was the only Democrat on the \nJudiciary Committee to do so. I supported the nomination of John \nRoberts to the DC Circuit, even though three Democrats on the Judiciary \nCommittee opposed him. I supported the nomination of Deborah Cook, also \nto the Sixth Circuit, when many of my colleagues voted against her.\n  In all of these instances, I had confidence the nominees would \ninterpret the Constitution and the Nation's laws fairly and without \nbias. And that is all I ask. I would expect these nominees to be \nconservative, and that is not a problem, as long as their views are not \ncontrary to what a majority of Americans believe and the judicial \nthinking of a majority of mainstream judges. But I do not feel that way \nabout Mr. Holmes.\n  I have no doubt he is a man of deep and sincere beliefs, and in this \ngreat Nation he is entitled to those beliefs. I commend him for his \nfaith. But how can I entrust protection of separation of church and \nstate, protection of the civil rights laws, protection of a woman's \nright to choose--all of the major values which come before a Federal \ncourt judge--with the comments he has made? Because these comments are \nrobustly extraordinary. I would never dream of these comments being \nmade by someone who aspires to be on a Federal court of law. And if you \nhave no judicial experience by which to evaluate whether he can in fact \nseparate himself from his views, it is a very difficult nomination to \nswallow.\n\n  As a woman, how can I possibly vote for someone to go on to a Federal \ndistrict court who believes women should be subordinate to men, when \nthat judge is going to have to look at employment discrimination, \nsexual harassment cases, who in the modern day and age, as a practical \ntenet of public thinking, believes--and believes strongly enough to \nwrite about it and say it to the world--that women should be \nsubordinate to men and a wife should be subordinate to her husband, and \nexpect any woman who comes before that judge is going to have fair and \neven treatment?\n  For over 20 years, Mr. Holmes has been making extremist statements on \nwomen, on race, on abortion, on the role of religion in society. His \nstatements in each individual area, as I have said, are startling. \nTaken together, he has given us more than enough reason to fear he will \ncontinue to make radical statements when his words have the force of \nlaw. And that is a risk I, for one, do not want to take.\n  So I urge my colleagues today to join me in opposing this \nconfirmation and voting no. It will be my first one in 12 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from New Mexico is \nto be next.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I inquire, how much time does the \nSenator have remaining on the subject matter at hand?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama has 83\\1/2\\ minutes, \nalmost 84 minutes, under his control; and the opposition has about \n31\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask the Senator if he will yield me up \nto 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am delighted to yield the Senator from \nNew Mexico up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield myself up to 10 minutes off \nthe side of Senator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to discuss Leon Holmes' \nnomination to the bench of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Arkansas. Article II, section 2 of the Constitution imposes \nprofound responsibility on the U.S. Senate to advise and consent on \nappointments of individuals to lifetime positions.\n  I rarely voted against a judicial nominee or even opposed one under \nPresident Clinton. I have never opposed one under President Bush. On \nthe rare occasion when I did oppose a judicial candidate, it was \nbecause a nominee had failed to show proper judicial temperament, or if \nquestions about judicial philosophy arose, and there was no judicial \nrecord on which to base a vote of confidence.\n  I take very seriously the responsibility of confirming an individual \nfor a lifetime appointment. These Federal judges do not answer to \nanyone after they take office. So when someone's views raise a question \nor concern and there is no record as a judge to show he or she can set \npersonal views aside, I believe caution is warranted. For my vote, such \nis the case with Leon Holmes.\n  Dr. Holmes is a gifted man and a capable attorney. He has had a \nstrong career and demonstrated commitment to his community. His rich \nspiritual conviction and work ethic are traits for which he is \ncommended. I have listened to Dr. Holmes' supporters. I read statements \nin support of his candidacy presented by the Department of Justice. I \nknow his distinguished career. I have read carefully his writings and \npublic statements, including those for which he has subsequently \nclarified or apologized. I met Dr. Holmes to talk about his nomination.\n  Mr. President, we have made mistakes like this in the past. Last \nmonth a judge on the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a judge who \nwas confirmed unanimously by the Senate in 1994 with my vote, made a \ndisturbing public speech. In it, he compared President Bush's election \nin 2000 to the rise of power of Mussolini. The judge has, of course, \napologized. We have all made remarks we wish we had not made. But in \nthis case, coming from a judge, the blatant partisanship and political \nbias revealed by this remark, reduced the value of the subsequent \napology. Now, it is a fair question, if a Republican-oriented litigant \ncomes to the Second Circuit, can he or she be assured of an impartial \njustice by that judge?\n  In 1980, Leon Holmes wrote:\n\n       The concern for rape victims is a red herring because \n     conceptions from rape occur with approximately the same \n     frequency as snowfall in Miami.\n\n  I differ with him absolutely on this issue.\n  If one rape victim is pregnant, she deserves protections and rights. \nShe is a victim our society must acknowledge. What of the 14-year-old \npregnant girl--a victim of incest from her father? Should she be cast \naside as inconsequential? If you talk to any person who has served on a \ngrand jury, in any urban area of our country, they have seen such a \ncase. It happens. Thousands of rape victims in our country become \npregnant every year. The Houston Chronicle recently reported that the \nAmerican Journal of Preventive Medicine estimates 25,000 rape-related \npregnancies occur annually. Are these victims to be ignored by our laws \nand society?\n  To his credit, Dr. Holmes has acknowledged that these comments were \ninsensitive, but in conjunction with his other writings, that isn't \nenough for a lifetime appointment to a federal judgeship.\n  My vote will not be in any way related to his views on abortion or \nhis personal religious beliefs. It is based on his body of statements \nover a 25-year period that lead me to conclude he does not have a \nfundamental commitment to the total equality of women in our society.\n  I have supported all of President Bush's previous nominees. In each \ninstance, if there has been a controversy, I have tried to make an \nindependent judgment without employing a litmus\n\n[[Page S7551]]\n\ntest, and without employing my own discrimination based on the \nnominee's personal practices or ideologies. In each case, I felt the \ncandidate met the requirements. But I have a constitutional role that I \nmust, in good conscience, uphold as I see it. I believe in the \noverwhelming majority of cases, the President should be granted his \nappointments to the bench. The role given to the Senate was to allow \nall possible information about a nominee to come forward to assure that \na person is fit. Personally, I doubt that the writings of this nominee \nwere known to the Administration when the appointment was made. But \nsince his statements have come to the attention of the Senate, we must \nuse our judgment about the overall ability of this nominee to give \nimpartial justice in all cases.\n  I conclude that I cannot provide my consent for Leon Holmes.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to share some thoughts about the \nHolmes nomination. I feel very deeply about it. I respect so much my \nfriend, the Senator from Texas, and her service in this body. I will \nsay that she and I have talked about it before. I think we are missing \nsomething here. I urge her to reconsider the position she has taken, \nalthough I know she has taken it carefully and I doubt that is likely. \nBut I urge her and others to consider what we are doing here, about how \nwe vote on judges.\n  Let me just say that Americans and people around the world have \nvarious beliefs, and to some people different beliefs are viewed as \nstrange. Those with religious beliefs may have different views on some \nissues than those who don't have religious beliefs. There is quite a \nlot of that. We don't all agree. We have different views about whether \nthere is a Trinity, or what do you think about the virgin birth, and \nissues of all kinds. We have a lot of differences of opinion.\n  We have a view in this country that there cannot be a religious test \nfor a judge or any other position in Government. There cannot be a \nreligious test that you can put on them, saying you have to have a \ncertain religion or certain belief before you can be an official in \nthis Government. No, that is not true. We should not do that.\n  I guess what I will first say--and I hope I can be clear about this--\nwe differ in our religious principles. It has been suggested that Mr. \nHolmes' religious principles are extreme. I say to you that his \nprinciples are consistent with the Catholic Church's principles. What \nhe has said in every writing I have seen, and as I understand it, they \nare perfectly consistent--in fact, he defended classic Catholic \ndoctrine. He defended classic Catholic doctrine. Regardless of whether \nhe had a personal view that was somewhat unusual about his religious \nfaith, that is not the test we have here. The question is, Will his \npersonal religious beliefs he may adhere to strongly interfere with his \nability to be a good judge?\n  He and his wife wrote a letter to a church in a church newspaper to \ndiscuss how they have ordered their marriage, and they have ordered it \nin the classical terms of Christianity. As a matter of fact, I think \nthe Baptist Church recently affirmed a similar position in their \ndenomination. It is the second largest denomination in the U.S.--second \nto the Catholic Church. That is not an extreme view. Whether you agree \nwith it, it is scriptural, it is Christian doctrine. He defended and \nexplained and wrote about that.\n  Isn't it good that we have a nominee for the Federal bench who is \nactive in his church, who thinks about the issues facing his country \nand writes about them and talks about them? That is a healthy thing. \nThe question is--and it is legitimate for those who are concerned about \nthose views--if they don't agree with his view on abortion or on how \nmarriage is arranged, to inquire of the nominee whether those views are \nso strong they would affect his or her opinions from the bench. That is \nthe test. If we get away from that, we have a problem.\n  What is going to happen when we have a Muslim who has been nominated \nhere or an Orthodox Jew, or any other denomination that doesn't agree \nwith us on religious beliefs? Are we going to demand that they come \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee and renounce their faith as a \nprice to be paid before they can be a Federal judge? No, sir, that is \nwrong. This is big-time stuff; this is not a little iddy-biddy matter, \nMr. President. We should not be in that position. Yes, inquire if the \nperson's views are so strongly held that they would impair his ability \nto be a Federal judge. Yes, ask whether they are a good lawyer, or do \nthey have a good reputation among the bar, or do people respect their \nintegrity, do they have good judgment, do people like and admire them. \nAsk those things. Ask whether the person has lack of judgment. But \ndon't say: I don't agree with your theology on marriage; I don't agree \nwith your church's view on abortion; therefore, I am not going to vote \nfor you. That is a dangerous thing. It should not be done. It is a \nmistake for us to head down that direction. I cannot emphasize that too \nmuch.\n  This is wrong. We should not do this. It is not the right way to \nevaluate Federal judges. I understand when somebody says: I just feel \nstrongly about this deal on marriage that he and his wife wrote. I \nfeel, feel, feel. We need to stop thinking like that and not be so much \nworried about how we feel, and we better think about the consequences \nof our actions and our votes.\n  This is a dangerous precedent. I respect Judge Holmes. He is a man \nwho has reached out to the poor, helped women lawyers to an \nextraordinary degree, helped them become partners in his firm. He has a \nwonderful wife who respects him and defended him in a real hot letter \nin response to the criticism of the article that she and Judge Holmes \nwrote. I think we ought to look at that.\n  We have confirmed people to the bench that have made big mistakes in \nmy judgement--we have confirmed people to the bench that have used \ndrugs, yet, we are now debating keeping this man off the bench for his \nreligious writings. Would Mr. Holmes be in a better position with \nmembers of this body if he had smoked dope instead of written religious \narticles? That should not be so.\n  Let's look at his basic background and reputation for excellence. Of \ncourse, we know the two Democratic Senators from his home State of \nArkansas support his nomination. So he has home State support.\n  We know the American Bar Association rated him their highest rating, \n``well-qualified.''\n  We know he is probably the finest appellate lawyer in the State of \nArkansas.\n  We know the Arkansas Supreme Court, when at various times they need a \nlawyer to sit on that court, they have called him two or three times to \nsit on the court.\n  He is one of the most respected lawyers in the State of Arkansas.\n  He was Phi Beta Kappa at Duke University. I think he was No. 1 in his \nclass in law school.\n  This is a man of integrity, of religious faith and conviction, who is \nactive in his church, who has reached out to the poor all his life, \ntried to do the right thing, and he is the one who comes up here and \ngets beaten up.\n  This is what his hometown newspaper, the Arkansas Democrat Gazette, \nsaid. These are the kinds of comments from the people who know him:\n\n       What distinguishes Mr. Holmes is a rare blend of qualities \n     he brings to the law--intellect, scholarship, conviction, \n     detachment, a reverence not just for the law but for ideas, \n     for the life of the mind. All of that would shine through the \n     clutter of argument that awaits any judge. He would not only \n     bring distinction to the bench, but promise. In choosing Leon \n     Holmes, the President could bequeath a promise of greatness.\n\n  I think that is high praise. That is a beautiful comment. I suggest \nthat is something anyone would be proud to have said about them.\n  He has practiced commercial litigation at the trial and appellate \nlevel in State and Federal courts. He has acquired significant \ncourtroom experience. He is currently a partner at Quattlebaum, Grooms, \nTull & Burrow in Little Rock. He was rated ``well-qualified'' by the \nABA.\n  He knows the value of hard work. He came from humble roots and is the \nonly one of his seven siblings to attend college. He worked his way \nthrough college, finished law school at night while working a full-time \njob to support his family.\n\n[[Page S7552]]\n\n  He is an accomplished scholar. As I said, he finished at the top of \nhis class, was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa while a doctoral student at \nDuke University. He was named outstanding political science student \nupon graduation from the college. That is pretty good. Duke University \nis a pretty fine university.\n  During the academic years of 1990 to 1992, he taught a variety of \ncourses at Thomas Aquinas College in California. He taught law at the \nUniversity of Arkansas during the year he clerked for Justice Holt of \nthe Arkansas Supreme Court. One does not get selected to be a law clerk \nfor a supreme court judge if one is not good. He displayed wide-ranging \nacademic interest. His doctoral dissertation discussed the political \nphilosophies of W.E.B. Debois and Booker T. Washington. It analyzed the \nefforts of Martin Luther King, Jr., and has made efforts to reconcile \ntheir views. He has written substantial essays dealing with the \nsubjects of political philosophy, law, and theology. He has been active \nin the bar in Arkansas. He taught continuing legal education courses on \nnumerous occasions. He has been awarded the State bar's best CLE award \nfour times. He sits on the board of advisers of the Arkansas Bar \nAssociation. He chaired the editorial board for the bar's education for \nhandling appeals in Arkansas.\n\n  That is pretty good. The Arkansas Bar does a publication on how to \nhandle appeals in Arkansas. He was chosen to chair the editorial board \nfor that publication. I submit to my colleagues that his peers think he \nis a good lawyer.\n  He sits on the judicial nominations committee for the Arkansas State \ncourts which recommends attorneys to the Governor for judicial \nappointment in supreme court cases where one or more justices recuse \nthemselves. He is one of a top handful of appellate lawyers in \nArkansas, and in 2001, the Arkansas Bar Association bestowed its \nwriting excellence award on Mr. Holmes.\n  On two occasions Leon Holmes has been appointed to serve as a special \nArkansas Supreme Court judge, which is a real honor for a practicing \nattorney. The judges have praised his service in those cases, and more \nthan one has urged him to run for a seat on the Arkansas Supreme Court. \nSo he is well respected by the plaintiffs bar in Arkansas.\n  Mr. Holmes is currently defending on appeal the largest jury verdict \never awarded in Arkansas history. It is the case of a nursing home \nresident who allegedly died from neglect. He is representing the \nplaintiffs side on appeal.\n  If you are a plaintiff lawyer and you won in trial the largest civil \njudgment in Arkansas history, and it is on appeal and you want a lawyer \nto represent you, you want the best lawyer you can get, and you have \nthe money to get that lawyer, you have a verdict worth millions, \nprobably hundreds of millions of dollars--I do not know. Who did they \nchoose out of the whole State of Arkansas? Leon Holmes. What does that \nsay? They put their money on him. Their case was put on his shoulders.\n  Look, he has given back to the community. This is not a man who is \nselfish as a practicing lawyer just to see how much money he can make. \nHe was a habeas counsel for death row inmate Ricky Ray Rector, the \nmentally retarded man who was attempting to avoid execution. It came \nbefore then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton. He refused at that time to \ncommute the death sentence. But Holmes helped prepare the case for the \nevidentiary hearing in Federal court after habeas had already been \nfiled.\n  Not many big-time civil lawyers give their time to represent poor \npeople, or mentally retarded people on death row. Holmes represented a \nLaotian immigrant woman suffering from terminal liver disease when \nMedicaid refused to cover treatment for a liver transplant. Do my \ncolleagues think he made a bunch of money off that case? He did it \nbecause he thought it was the right thing to do. He helps people who \nare weak and do not have fair access to the courts.\n  He represented a woman who lost custody of her children to her ex-\nhusband, who could not afford counsel on appeal. He represented an \nindigent man with a methamphetamine felony history in connection with \ntraffic misdemeanors.\n  He has given back to his community outside the law, also. He was a \nhouse parent for the Elan Home for Children while a graduate student in \nNorth Carolina. He served as director of the Florence Critten Home of \nLittle Rock, helping young women cope with pregnancy.\n  He is partner with Philip Anderson, a former president of the \nAmerican Bar Association who does not share Judge Holmes' views on a \nlot of issues politically, but he strongly supports him as an excellent \njudge, as do a large number of women.\n  Let me read some of the people who know him. This is what his history \nshows. Some say, well, we do not know. He has these religious beliefs. \nWhat do we know about him in practice? Will he get on the bench and do \nall of these horrible things? It is not his record to do that kind of \nthing.\n  Female colleagues from the Arkansas bar who know him support him \nstrongly. This is what one said:\n\n       During my 7 years at Williams & Anderson, I worked very \n     close with Leon. We were in contact on a daily basis and \n     handled many cases together. I toiled many long hours under \n     stressful circumstances with Leon and always found him to be \n     respectful, courteous and supportive. I was the first female \n     associate to be named as a partner at Williams & Anderson. \n     Leon was a strong proponent of my election to the partnership \n     and, subsequently, encouraged and supported my career \n     advancement, as well as the advancement of other women within \n     the firm.\n\n  So they say, well, he and his wife wrote this article quoting St. \nPaul and we think he does not like women. What about him being a strong \nsupporter of this woman being the first female partner at his law firm?\n  Continuing to quote from the letter:\n\n     . . . Leon treated me in an equitable and respectful manner. \n     I always have found him to be supportive of my career . . . \n     Leon and I have different political views; however, I know \n     him to be a fair and just person and have complete trust in \n     his ability to put aside any personal or political views and \n     apply the law in a thoughtful and equitable manner.\n\n  That is Jeanne Seewald in a letter to Chairman Hatch and Senators \nLeahy and Schumer dated April 8 of last year when this issue came up. \nSo this lady does not share his political views, or I assume his views \nmaybe on abortion or other issues, but she knows he will be a fair and \ngood judge.\n  Here is another letter:\n\n       Leon has trained me in the practice of law and now, as my \n     partner, works with me on several matters. His office has \n     been next to mine at the firm approximately two years. During \n     that time, I worked with Leon as an expectant mother and now \n     work with him as a new mother. Leon's daughters babysit my \n     11-month-old son.\n       I value Leon's input, not only on work-related matters but \n     also on personal matters. I have sought him out for advice on \n     a number of issues. Although Leon and I do not always see \n     eye-to-eye, I respect him and trust his judgment. Above all, \n     he is fair.\n       While working with Leon, I have observed him interact with \n     various people. He treats all people, regardless of gender, \n     station in life, or circumstance, with the same respect and \n     dignity. He has always been supportive of me in my law \n     practice, as well as supportive of the other women in our \n     firm. Gender has never been an issue in any decision in the \n     firm.\n\n  That is a letter from Kristine Baker, April 8, to Senators Hatch, \nSchumer, and Leahy.\n  Another female attorney in Little Rock, AR, Eileen Woods Harrison, \nstates:\n\n       I am a life-long Democrat and also pro-choice. I commend \n     Mr. Holmes to you. He is a brilliant man, a great lawyer and \n     a fine person.\n\n  That was a letter sent to Senators Hatch, Schumer, and Leahy.\n  Another one states:\n\n       I heartily recommend Mr. Holmes to you. He is an \n     outstanding lawyer and a fine person. While he and I differ \n     dramatically on the pro-choice, pro-life issue, I am fully \n     confident he will do his duty as the law and facts of a given \n     case require.\n\n  One more--well, let me ask right there, has there been any instance \nshown where he has failed to comply with the law in his practice, in \nany way shown disrespect to the court, or in any way said a judge or a \nlawyer should not obey the law and follow the law? No, and these \nletters say that.\n\n  Beth Deere, in a letter dated March 24, 2003, to Senators Hatch and \nLeahy, states:\n\n       I support Leon Holmes because he is not only a bright legal \n     mind, but also because he is a good person who believes that \n     our nation will be judged by the care it affords the least\n\n[[Page S7553]]\n\n     and the littlest in our society. I am not troubled that he is \n     personally opposed to abortion. Mr. Holmes is shot through \n     with integrity. He will, I believe, uphold and apply the law \n     with the utmost care and diligence.\n\n  Well, I do not know what else can be said. The only thing I can see \nis that people do not like his views on abortion, they do not like the \nviews on family he and his wife have, and they are holding him up for \nthat. His views are not extreme. His views are consistent with the \nfaith of his church, not only his church, but the majority of \nChristendom.\n  Now does that make someone unqualified to be a Federal judge? Is the \nrule that no true believers in Catholic doctrine need apply for a \nFederal judgeship? They say that is not it; they say that they are not \nanti-Catholic. I am not saying anybody is anti-Catholic. I am saying a \nlot of people do not agree with the doctrine of a lot of Christian \nchurches and that should not affect how they vote on a nominee if the \nnominee is proven to be committed to following the law.\n  It is all right, of course, for a person to have a religious faith; \neverybody says that. We would never discriminate against anybody who \nhas religious faith. But if their faith calls on them to actually \nbelieve something and they have to make choices and those choices are \nnot popular or politically correct at a given time, but they adhere to \nthem because they believe in them, it is part of the tenets of their \nfaith and the church to which they belong--and I would note \nparenthetically no church spends more time studying carefully the \ntheology of its church and the doctrines of its church than the \nCatholic church--if they are consistent with that church's beliefs, \nthey now no longer can be confirmed as a Federal judge?\n  It is all right if one goes along and does not ever do anything to \nactually affirm aggressively the doctrine of their church. In other \nwords, if one goes to mass and never says anything about the question \nof abortion or family or other issues outside of the church doors, then \nthey are all right, but if someone actually writes an article somewhere \nand says, I believe in this, they risk being punished. Actually, in \nthis case it was an article written from one Catholic couple to other \nCatholics discussing in depth some of the doctrines of the church and \nhow they believed in them. So the Holmes shared their thoughts within \ntheir church family about how the church's views ought to be \ninterpreted and expressed their personal views about how it ought to \nbe, does that disqualify them from being a Federal judge? No. I think \nthis is a bad policy.\n  The question should simply be this: Will he follow the law of the \nU.S. Supreme Court on abortion even if he does not agree with it? And \nthe answer is, yes. He has already stated that unequivocally. His \nrecord shows that.\n  The lawyers who practice with him who are pro-choice, women lawyers \nwho affirm him so beautifully and so strongly, say he is going to \nfollow the law. The American Bar Association, which is pro-choice and \nto the left of America on a host of issues, gave him their highest \nrating of well qualified.\n  The Arkansas Supreme Court has asked him to sit on their court at \nvarious times because they respected him. In 2001, he wrote the best \nlegal writing in the State.\n  Some say they are worried because he has never been a judge. So he \nhas not sat on the bench before. I do not think that is a matter that \ndisqualifies him. Most people who become judges have not been a judge \nbefore on the district bench.\n  So what do we do to assess how he will act as a Judge? We talk to the \nlawyers, talk to the American Bar Association, talk to other judges in \nthe State, and ask: What is this person like?\n  They all say he is first rate. Both Democratic Senators from \nArkansas, who know this man, known lawyers who know this man and are \nfamiliar with his reputation, support him.\n  As one of our Members said earlier, in criticizing him, they asked: \nHow can I vote for someone who believes women should be subordinated to \nmen in this modern age?\n  That is not the gist of the Pauline doctrine in Ephesians. Mrs. \nHolmes wrote to tell us that she is not subordinate and she believes in \nequality and that their joint article did not mean anything other than \nthat.\n  The Catholic Church does believe in ordination of only males. Some \nmay disagree with that. I am a Methodist. We, I am pleased to say, \nordain women. There are many women ministers in our church. But I want \nto ask again, if a person agrees with the doctrine of his church, which \nhas been discussed and considered by the finest theologians for \nhundreds of years, and he agrees with that, and we don't agree with \nthat, we don't think that is right, do we now think we should vote \nagainst that person because we don't agree with his religious beliefs? \nIt is very dangerous to do that. We should not do it.\n  I ask again, what about other denominations and other faiths that \nhave different views from ours? We may find them far more offensive \nthan this. Are we going to refuse to vote for them? Are we going to \ninsist that those people renounce the doctrines of the church to which \nthey belong as a price to be paid before they can become a Federal \njudge? I hope not. I think we are making a mistake.\n  If there was something which would show that Judge Holmes could not \nfollow the law, was not a first-rate attorney, did not have the respect \nof his colleagues, did not have the respect of the American Bar \nAssociation, had women lawyers who thought he was a sexist and unfair \nin the treatment of them and they came forward and said so, OK, I might \nbe convinced. But none of that occurs here. That is not what we have. \nWe have nothing but his personal beliefs that are consistent with the \nfaith of his church. Some people don't agree with his views regarding \nhis faith and tell us that they are going to vote against him because \nof that. That is not a good idea; that is not a good principle for us \nin this body to follow.\n  This is what his wife wrote. The first thing I will just note in \nhere, she said, ``The article is a product of my''--she italicized \n``my''--``my Bible study over many years of my marriage.''\n  But it was a joint article. She says this:\n\n       I am incredulous that some apparently believe my husband \n     views men and women as unequal when the article states \n     explicitly that men and women are equal. The women who have \n     worked with my husband, women family members, women friends, \n     can all attest to the fact that he treats men and women with \n     equal respect and dignity. I can attest to that in a special \n     way as his wife.\n\n  She noted this was an article from a Catholic couple to Catholic \nlaypeople. ``It has no application to anyone who is not attempting to \nfollow the Catholic Christian faith.'' She also notes that Leon cooks \nhis share of meals, washes the dishes, does laundry, and has changed \ninnumerable diapers, and she has worked many years outside the home, \nalthough right now she does not.\n  I would like to have printed in the Record an article from the Mobile \nPress-Register of the State of Alabama. It notes the similarity to the \ntreatment given to Alabama's attorney general, Bill Pryor, when he was \nnominated to the Federal court of appeals, a man who also is a \nthoughtful, intelligent, committed Christian Catholic. This is what the \nMobile Press-Register says:\n\n       The example of Bill Pryor should be illustrative in the \n     case of Leon Holmes as well. When a nominee enjoys strong \n     bipartisan support from the home-state folks who know him \n     best, and from some of the top non-partisan legal officers in \n     the country, that support should weigh far more heavily than \n     should the out-of-context criticisms from ideological \n     pressure groups whose fund-raising prowess depends on how \n     much havoc they wreak on the nomination process.\n\n  I know Attorney General Bill Pryor was asked about his personal \nreligious views on issues such as abortion. He answered honestly and \ntruthfully and consistently with his faith, a faith that he studied \ncarefully. People didn't like it: Well, I don't agree with you on \nabortion, they say.\n  So what. We don't have to agree on abortion to support somebody for a \nFederal judgeship. He affirmed and had demonstrated that he would \nfollow any Supreme Court rulings and could demonstrate as attorney \ngeneral of Alabama he followed those rulings. That wasn't enough for \nthem. They weren't satisfied.\n  I ask unanimous consent this article dated July 5, 2004, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7554]]\n\n                      [From al.com, July 5, 2004]\n\n              Pryor's Example Bears on Holmes Controversy\n\n       U.S. Senators considering how to vote Tuesday in a new \n     judicial nomination battle should reflect on a lesson \n     provided by a decision just written by Judge William Pryor of \n     the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Judge Pryor, of course, is the Mobile native and former \n     Alabama attorney general whose own nomination to the bench \n     was long blocked by smear tactics employed against him by \n     liberal opponents. When Senate Democrats used a questionable \n     filibuster to deny Mr. Pryor the ordinary lifelong term as a \n     judge, President George W. Bush gave him a special ``recess \n     appointment'' to the bench that lasts only through the end of \n     2005.\n       One of the many cheap shots launched at Mr. Pryor during \n     the confirmation battle was the charge that he was \n     insensitive to women's rights. The allegation, based on a \n     legal brief he filed on one technical aspect of a federal \n     law, ignored the overwhelming bulk of his legal and volunteer \n     work to secure protections for women.\n       One of Mr. Pryor's first decisions as a federal judge, \n     released last Wednesday, proves again the illegitimacy of the \n     original charge against him. The case involved a woman in \n     Delray Beach, Fla., who claimed she was the victim of two \n     counts of sex discrimination by her former employer. The \n     district court had thrown out both of her claims on ``summary \n     judgment,'' meaning it found so little legal merit to her \n     allegations that the case wasn't even worth a full trial.\n       On appeal, however, Mr. Pryor reinstated one of the woman's \n     claims and ordered it back to trial at the district level. \n     His willingness--on well-reasoned legal grounds, we might \n     add--to force the woman's case to be heard provides yet more \n     evidence refuting the allegation that he somehow is hostile \n     to women's rights.\n\n\n                          holmes is like Pryor\n\n       As it happens, another Bush nominee is facing similar, and \n     similarly baseless, allegations. Arkansas lawyer and scholar \n     Leon Holmes is due for a Senate vote on Tuesday. While no \n     filibuster is planned against him, opponents hope to defeat \n     him on a straight up-or-down vote by highlighting past \n     statements of his that supposedly touch on women's rights.\n       The parallels to the Pryor nomination battle are striking, \n     both because opponents are taking the nominee's statements \n     out of context and because much of the opposition stems from \n     factors emanating from the nominee's Catholic faith.\n       In the most prominent controversy, Mr. Holmes and his wife \n     together wrote an article for a Catholic magazine that \n     touched on Catholic theological teachings concerning marriage \n     and gender roles in the clergy. Included was an explication \n     of the famous lines in St. Paul's letter to the Ephesians \n     that say, ``Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.''\n       Aha! Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California asserted that this \n     passage makes Mr. Holmes antagonistic towards women's rights. \n     Never mind that in the very same article, the Holmes couple \n     wrote: ``The distinction between male and female in \n     ordination has nothing to do with the dignity or worth of \n     male compared to female,'' and ``Men and women are equal in \n     their dignity and value.''\n       Never mind that Mr. Homes has elsewhere written that \n     ``Christianity and the political order are assigned separate \n     spheres, separate jurisdictions.'' Never mind that a host of \n     pro-choice, liberal women from Arkansas have written in favor \n     of Mr. Holmes' nomination, nor that the Arkansas Democrat-\n     Gazette has praised the ``rare blend of qualities he brings \n     to the law--intellect, scholarship, conviction, and \n     detachment.''\n       And so on and so forth: For every out-of-context allegation \n     against Mr. Holmes, there is a perfectly good answer.\n\n\n                           Bipartisan support\n\n       Philip Anderson, a recent president of the American Bar \n     Association and a long-time law partner of Leon Holmes, \n     endorsed Mr. Holmes: ``I believe that Leon Holmes is superbly \n     qualified for the position for which he has been nominated. \n     He is a scholar first, and he has had broad experience in \n     federal court. He is a person of rock-solid integrity and \n     sterling character. He is compassionate and even-handed. He \n     has an innate sense of fairness.''\n       Finally, in what in less contentious times would end all \n     questions about Mr. Holmes' fitness, both senators from his \n     home state, Blanche Lincoln and Mark Pryor (no relation to \n     Bill), have endorsed his nomination--even though he and \n     President Bush are Republicans, while both of them are \n     Democrats.\n       It would be virtually unprecedented for the Senate to turn \n     down a candidate nominated by one party and supported by both \n     of his home-state senators from the other party.\n       The example of Bill Pryor should be illustrative in the \n     case of Leon Holmes as well: When a nominee enjoys strong \n     bipartisan support from the home-state folks who know him \n     bests, and from some of the top non-partisan legal officers \n     in the country, that support should weigh far more heavily \n     than should the out-of-context criticisms from ideological \n     pressure groups whose fund-raising prowess depends on how \n     much havoc they wreak on the nomination process.\n       Leon Holmes is no more antagonistic to women's rights than \n     is Bill Pryor--who, it should be mentioned, is in the Hall of \n     Fame of Penelope House, a prominent local women's shelter.\n       Mr. Holmes ought to be confirmed, and the character \n     assassination must come to an end.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think we will soon be voting--at 5:30. \nI urge my colleagues to remember this. You do not have to agree with a \nnominee's personal religious views to support him or her as judge. The \nfact that you do not share a person's personal religious views on a \nhost of different matters is not a basis to vote no. The question is, \nWill that person follow the law?\n  That is the right test. That is the classical test we have always \nhad. We are getting away from it. We have Members I respect in this \nbody who say we just ought to consider ideology, we just ought to \nconsider their politics, just put it out on the table. Let's not \npretend anymore that these things are not what some of my colleagues \nbase their judicial votes on, let's put it out there.\n  But I say to you that is a dangerous philosophy because it suggests \nthat judges are politicians, that judges are people who are empowered \nto make political decisions; therefore, we ought to elect judges who \nagree with our politics. It is contrary to the Anglo-American rule of \nlaw through our whole belief system in which judges are given lifetime \nappointments so they can be expected to resist politics and to adhere \nto the law as it is written and as defined by the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States. That is what it is all about. That is what we need to \nadhere to here. If we move away from that idea, if we suggest we no \nlonger believe or expect judges to follow the law and not to be \npoliticians, we have undermined law in this country to an extraordinary \ndegree. The American people will not put up with it.\n  The American people will accept rulings even if they don't like them \nif they believe the court is following the law, if they believe the \ncourt is honestly declaring the Constitution. But if they believe our \nSupreme Court has ceased to do that, or any other judges in this \ncountry have ceased to do that, and they are then imposing their \npersonal views--even though they have not been elected to office, don't \nhave to stand for election for office, hold their office for life and \nthey are unaccountable--they will not accept that.\n  There is a danger in America at this point in time. What President \nBush is doing, day after day, week after week, is simply sending up \njudges who believe the law ought to be followed and they ought not to \nimpose their political views from the bench.\n  How can we be afraid of that? Our liberties are not at risk by these \njudges, as one wise lawyer said at a hearing of the Judiciary \nCommittee, of which I am a member. He said: I don't see that our \nliberties are at great risk from judges who show restraint. Our \nliberties are at risk from those who impose their political views from \nthe bench.\n  I think Justice Holmes has demonstrated a career of commitment to the \nlaw. He has won the respect of both of the Democratic Senators from \nArkansas. He has won the respect of the Supreme Court of Arkansas. He \nhas won the respect of the American Bar Association, fellow women \nlawyers who worked with him, year after year after year. He is the kind \nof person we want on the bench, a person who truly believes in \nsomething more than making a dollar, who has represented the poor and \ndispossessed, who has spoken out on issues that are important to him, \nwho is active in his church. That is what we need more of on the bench. \nI urge the Senate to confirm Leon Holmes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that the quorum call be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand that we are under time \ncontrol. I yield myself such time as I may use.\n\n[[Page S7555]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the nomination of Leon \nHolmes to a lifetime appointment to the U.S. District Court for the \nEastern District of Arkansas. His record gives us no confidence that he \nwill be fair in the wide range of cases that come before him, \nparticularly in cases involving the rights of women, gay rights, and \nthe right to choose. His record contains example after example of \nextreme views of the law that suggest he will not follow established \nprecedent.\n  Every nominee who comes before us promises to follow the law, \nincluding laws in cases with which they disagree. Mr. Holmes is no \nexception. But the Senate's constitutional role of advise and consent \ngives each of us the duty to evaluate these claims carefully. It is \nclear from his record that Mr. Holmes has not shown the dedication to \nupholding constitutional principles and the judgment necessary for a \nFederal judge.\n  Mr. Holmes has expressed extraordinary hostility to equal rights for \nwomen. In 1997 he wrote that it is a woman's obligation to \n``subordinate herself to her husband.'' He also wrote that a woman must \n``place herself under the authority of the man.'' It doesn't get much \nmore extreme than that.\n  In fact, Mr. Holmes has blamed feminism for the erosion of morality. \nHe has written that ``to the extent that we adopt the feminist \nprinciple that the distinction between the sexes is of no consequence . \n. . we are contributing to the culture of death.'' Are we really \nexpected to believe that someone with such medieval views will dispense \n21st century justice?\n  This nomination is an insult to working women. It is an insult to all \nAmericans who believe in fairness and equality.\n  Just last week we celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964 which gave women equal opportunity in the workplace. \nDemocrats and Republicans alike joined in celebrating that important \nlaw. If that celebration is to be more than lip service, we cannot \napprove this nomination.\n  Judges appointed to lifetime positions on the Federal court must have \na clear commitment to the principles of equality in our basic civil \nrights laws. Mr. Holmes' view that a woman must ``place herself under \nthe authority of the man'' does not demonstrate such a commitment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to be printed in the Record Mr. Holmes' \narticle containing these statements.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Gender Neutral Language--Destroying an Essential Element of Our Faith\n\n                       (By Leon and Susan Holmes)\n\n       Our whole life as husband and wife, as father and mother to \n     our children; and as Catholic Christians, is based on the \n     historic Catholic teaching regarding the relation between \n     male and female.\n       So when that teaching is rejected, the rejection pierces \n     the heart of who we are as persons, as family, and as \n     Catholic Christians. Nothing causes us greater grief than the \n     fact that the historic and scriptural teaching on the \n     relationship between male and female is widely unpopular in \n     the Church today. We have studied these teachings, prayed \n     about them, and struggled to live them for the largest part \n     of the almost 25 years we have been married; and we ask your \n     indulgence and patience as we attempt to share the fruits of \n     our reflection and struggle with you.\n       The historic teachings of the Catholic Church are grand, \n     elegant, and beautiful. When they are unpopular amount \n     Catholics, it is usually because they are not understood; and \n     so it is; we think with respect to the teaching of the Church \n     regarding the relationship between male and female. The \n     passages of Scripture that call Christians ``sons of God'' \n     and ``brothers'' are offensive only if they are \n     misunderstood. The teaching that only males can be ordained \n     to be the priesthood and the diaconate is offensive only if \n     it is misunderstood. Far from being offensive, these \n     teachings are elegant and beautiful; and true for this age, \n     as for every age, because truth is eternal.\n       Catholic theology is essentially sacramental, which is to \n     say that its teaching is permeated by and flows from the \n     notion that there is an unseen reality that is symbolized by \n     visible, external signs. We believe, for instance, that \n     Christ was incarnate as a male because His masculinity is the \n     most fitting sign of the unseen reality of His place in the \n     Holy Trinity, who is revealed to us as Father, Son, and Holy \n     Spirit. Our relationship to God is a part of this unseen \n     reality, and it is twofold. In one aspect, we are related to \n     God as individuals; in another aspect, we are related to God \n     as a community. Individually, we are adopted into the same \n     relationship to the God the Father as Christ enjoys,which is \n     to say; we are all sons of God the Father and brothers of \n     Christ. All of us, male and female, are equally sons of God \n     and therefore brothers of one another. The equality of our \n     relationship is destroyed when some of us are called sons but \n     others are called daughters, some are called brothers but \n     others are called sisters. Daughters have not the same \n     relationship to their father as sons have. Daughters \n     cannot be like their father to the same extent as can \n     sons. Sisters have not the same relationship to brothers \n     as brothers have to one another. Sisters cannot be like \n     brothers to same extent as brothers can be like one \n     another. Hence Scripture refers to all Christians--Jew and \n     Greek, male and female, slave and free--as sons of God \n     (Gal. 3:26) and brothers of one another to signify the \n     equality, the sameness of our spiritual relationship in \n     its unseen reality to God.\n       As a community, as a Church, we also have a relationship to \n     God as the bride of Christ. This relationship is an unseen \n     reality that is signified in the visible world by the \n     relationship between male and female and especially by the \n     relationship between husband and wife. Hence, the husband is \n     to love his wife as Christ loves the Church; and as the \n     Church subordinates herself to Christ, in that manner the \n     wife is to subordinate herself to her husband. The verb used \n     in Ephesians 5:24 is hypotassetai, which means to place one's \n     self under. The Church is to place herself under the \n     protection of Christ and ipso facto place herself under His \n     authority. Likewise, the woman is to place herself under the \n     authority of the man and ipso facto place herself under his \n     authority. Both the man and the woman are to live so that \n     their relationship is a visible sign of an unseen reality, \n     the relationship between Christ and the Church. Distorting \n     the relationship between male and female is as sacrilegious \n     as profaning any of the other sacraments that by which God \n     symbolizes a divine, unseen reality through tangible symbols.\n       The use of male and female to symbolize the relationship \n     between Christ and the Church is pervasive in Scripture. In \n     Leviticus, for instance, whenever a sacrificial animal was to \n     stand for Christ, a priest, or a leader, the animal was \n     required to be male; whereas, whenever a sacrificial animal \n     was to stand for the common man or for the community, the \n     animal was required to be a female. In the Gospels, Christ \n     always forgave and never condemned women, though he sometimes \n     condemned men. Women were always forgiven because the Church \n     will always be forgiven. Men could be condemned for their \n     sins because Christ was condemned for our sins. If we were to \n     use ``gender neutral'' language to describe the relationship \n     between Christ and the Church, we would destroy an essential \n     element of our faith. To be true to the reality of the \n     relationship, we must recognize Christ as the groom and the \n     Church as the bride. Christ cannot be the bride, the Church \n     cannot be the groom; nor can Christ and the Church both be \n     groom or both be bride.\n       This unseen reality is signified once again by an outward \n     sign within the Church, which ordains only males to those \n     positions in the Church that represent Christ among us, the \n     priesthood and the diaconate. Ignoring the distinction \n     between male and female in ordination is like ignoring the \n     distinction between male and female in marriage. It has \n     nothing to do with dignity or worth of male compared to \n     female. When a woman chooses to marry a man, it is not \n     because she thinks men have more dignity or value than \n     women. The suggestion that male-only ordination implies a \n     devaluation of women is as silly as the suggestion that a \n     woman devalues women when she looks exclusively among men \n     for a husband. The assertion that males and females both \n     should be ordained without regard to their sex is akin to \n     the assertion that same-sex relationships should be \n     regarded as having equal legitimacy with heterosexual \n     marriage.\n       The demand of some women to be ordained is prefigured in \n     the Old Testament when Korah and 250 ``well-known men'' \n     claimed the right to offer sacrifice equally with Moses and \n     Aaron because ``all the congregation are holy, every one of \n     them, and the Lord is among them'' (Nm. 16:3). It is true \n     that all the congregation are holy and the Lord is among \n     them; but it does not follow that all are entitled to offer \n     sacrifice. By the same token, it is true that men and women \n     are equal in their dignity and value, but it does not follow \n     that all are entitled to be ordained. Ordination does not \n     signify the intrinsic worth or holiness of the one ordained; \n     it signifies that the one ordained is to be another other \n     Christ to the Church, which is to say another groom to the \n     bride. A woman cannot be ordained, not because she is \n     inferior in dignity to a man, but because she cannot be a \n     husband to the Church, which is the bride of Christ.\n       In a way that we cannot understand, the relationship \n     between the unseen reality and the visible signs is \n     reciprocal. St. Paul says he was made a minister to make all \n     men see what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in \n     God who created all things, that through the church the \n     manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the \n     principalities and powers in the heavenly places (Eph 3:10). \n     He also says the apostles have been made a spectacle ``to the \n     world, to angels and to me'' (1 Cor. 4:9). In the same vein,\n\n[[Page S7556]]\n\n     he says a woman should have a veil on her head (as a sign of \n     authority) ``because of the angels.'' It is an awesome \n     thought that what we do somehow signifies the reality of the \n     unseen world; but it is even a more awesome thought, that God \n     calls us to make known the reality of the unseen world to the \n     unseen world.\n       In the biological sphere, life depends on the relationship \n     between male and female. In this respect, the biological \n     sphere is a visible sign of the unseen reality of the \n     spiritual realm in which life depends on the relationship of \n     Christ and the Church. Sexuality is a ``great mystery . . . \n     in reference to Christ and the Church'' (Eph. 5:32).\n       All of this is why denominations whose theology is not \n     essentially sacramental have been quick to endorse artificial \n     contraception, divorce and the ordination of women; and it is \n     why they are much more open to the legitimation of homosexual \n     relationships. Churches whose theology is essentially \n     sacramental, which is to say the Catholic Church and the \n     Orthodox Churches, cannot accommodate the spirit of the \n     age with respect to these matters no matter how \n     overwhelming the society pressure. To do so would be to \n     repudiate the essence (in the strictest Thomistic sense of \n     the word) of our whole theology. Apart from sacramental \n     theology sexuality is just another physical function and \n     the distinction between the sexes is no more significant \n     than the distinction between right-handed persons and \n     left-handed ones. When we treat the distinction between \n     the sexes as of no consequence, we are parting from \n     sacramental theology, which is to say we are parting form \n     Catholicism, which is to say we are parting from \n     Christianity.\n       It is not coincidental that this culture of death in which \n     we live is a culture that seeks to eliminate the distinctions \n     between male and female. It is not coincidental that the \n     feminist movement brought with it artificial contraception \n     and abortion on demand, with recognition of homosexual \n     liaisons soon to follow. The project of eliminating the \n     distinctions between the sexes is inimical to the \n     transmission of life, which is the raison d'etre of that \n     distinction in both the biological and spiritual realms. No \n     matter how often we condemn abortion, to the extent we adopt \n     the feminist principle that the distinction between the sexes \n     is of no consequence and should be disregarded in the \n     organization of society and the Church, we are contributing \n     to the culture of death.\n       As Church, we are the bride of Christ. We are to submit to \n     Him. This means in part that we are to take on the mind of \n     Christ rather than adopt whatever paradigm prevails in the \n     age in which we live. As Bishop McDonald said last January \n     when talking about abortion, ``I do not want a Church that is \n     right when the world is right, I want a Church that is right \n     when the whole world is wrong.''\n       We write in a spirit of friendship, not of animosity. We \n     have brought all five of our children into the Catholic \n     Church. It is no exaggeration to say we have bet their \n     eternal lives on the Church. At the same time, we have built \n     our whole family life on the traditional and now unpopular \n     teachings about the relationship between male and female. \n     What are we to do when we see these pillars of our life start \n     to separate and pull apart? How do we stand on both? How can \n     we stand on only one?\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Mr. Holmes has expressed opinions that \ncast doubt on his fairness on other civil rights issues as well. He has \ncriticized remedies to enforce the requirements of school desegregation \nunder Brown v. Board of Education. He has written that Federal court \norders requiring assignment of students to desegregate public schools \nare part of ``a cultural and constitutional revolution in the past 20 \nyears . . . for which the Nation has never voted.'' He has called such \nremedies authoritarian and argued that it is an ``injustice,'' that \noverturning them would require a change in the Constitution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Holmes' letters on this subject also \nbeen printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Christian Science Monitor, Dec. 23, 1980]\n\n       Nina Totenberg asks in ``Did America vote for this, too?'' \n     whether the people of the United States voted for ``a \n     cultural and constitutional revolution.'' The truth is that \n     the United States has undergone a cultural and constitutional \n     revolution in the past 20 years, and the revolution is one \n     for which the nation has never voted.\n       Seven years ago, seven members of the Supreme Court held \n     that the abortion laws in all 50 states violate the 14th \n     Amendment, despite the fact that virtually every state that \n     ratified the amendment had a restrictive abortion law at the \n     time. Eight years ago the Supreme Court held the death \n     penalty laws in virtually every state to be in violation of \n     the 14th Amendment, despite the fact that the very wording of \n     the amendment acknowledges the authority of states to take \n     life when done according to due process. Nine years ago the \n     Supreme Court held that the 14th amendment grants to federal \n     courts the power to order schools to bus students to achieve \n     racial balance. Nineteen years ago the Supreme Court held \n     that public schools are not allowed to authorize prayer as a \n     part of their activities.\n       Combined, these rulings constitute a significant cultural \n     and constitutional revolution. This revolution, not the \n     conservative reaction to it, is the novelty on the American \n     political scene. This revolution has been accomplished by \n     authoritarian means, despite the charges that its opponents \n     are authoritarians.\n       If we now submit these issues to the electorate or the \n     legislative process, the only injustice will be that the \n     opponents of the recent revolution will bear the burden of \n     mustering a two-thirds majority in Congress and majorities in \n     38 states in order to restore the Constitution.\n                                                      Leon Holmes,\n                               Augustana College, Rock Island, IL.\n\n                [From Daily Dispatch, December 24, 1980]\n\n                             Abortion Issue\n\n       To the Editor: In response to the misrepresentations of \n     Murray Bishoff's recent letter, I make the following \n     comments:\n       First, the HLA explicitly permits ``those medical \n     procedures required to prevent the death of the mother'' \n     Second, nothing in the HLA would affect the birth control \n     pill or prevent anyone from buying and using contraception. \n     Mr. Bishoff simply misstates the effect of the HLA on these \n     issues. third, it seems to me that the language of the HLA \n     neither explicitly allows nor explicitly prohibits the IUD \n     and the morning after pill. Bishoff's concern for rape \n     victims is a red herring because conceptions from rape occur \n     with approximately the same frequency as snowfall in Miami. \n     Fourth, it is silly to say that such trivialities are the \n     principal concern of either HLA proponents of opponents.\n       If Bishoff really is not ``anti-life'' and if he sincerely \n     believes the HLA to be overly broad, he and others like him \n     should propose a ``complex response'' to these ``complex \n     issues.'' In the absence of an alternative proposal, I cannot \n     help but think their criticism a dishonest effort to \n     perpetuate the status quo, with some 1.8 million abortions \n     per year performed, including 160,000 in the 6th, 7th and 8th \n     months of pre-natal life. In light of these facts, it simply \n     cannot be true that ``The reality is that no one likes \n     abortion.''\n       Bishoff's letter contrasts ``a fetus'' with ``people.'' But \n     the word ``fetus means, simply, a person developing in the \n     womb. To continue our present policy is to give those persons \n     in the womb no rights at all, not even the most minimal \n     right, the right to life. I think that the abortion issue is \n     the simplest issue this country has faced since slavery was \n     made unconstitutional. And it deserves the same response.\n\n                                                  Leon Holmes,\n\n                                 Ass't Prof. of Political Science,\n                                   Augustana College, Rock Island.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, he opposed the Civil Rights Restoration \nAct of 1987, an act approved by a broad, bipartisan majority to restore \nthe original meaning of title VI and title IX of the Civil Rights Act \nwhich prohibit discrimination in federally funded activities.\n  Mr. Holmes has also expressed views hostile to gay rights. At one \npoint he even said he opposed the feminist movement because he feared \nit would bring ``recognition of homosexual liaisons.''\n  Mr. Holmes' record also indicates that he is intensely opposed to a \nwoman's constitutional right to choose. In his answers to questions, \nhowever, he said that he disagrees with the Supreme Court's decision in \nRoe v. Wade, but he would not try to undermine Roe if he became a \nFederal judge. But merely repeating the mantra that he will ``follow \nthe law'' does not make it credible that he will do so.\n\n  Regardless of the assurances he made after he was nominated for a \nFederal judgeship, no one looking at his record can avoid the \nconclusion Mr. Holmes has dedicated much of his career to opposing Roe \nv. Wade. It defies reason to believe he will abandon that position if \nhe becomes a Federal judge.\n  In fact, he has demonstrated a clear commitment to using a variety of \npolitical and legal means to take away a woman's right to choose. His \nstatements opposing it are among the most extreme we have seen.\n  He has said the concern expressed by supporters of choice for ``rape \nvictims is a red herring because conceptions from rape occur with the \nsame frequency as snow in Miami.'' According to the American Journal of \nPreventive Medicine, at least 25,000 pregnancies resulted from rape in \n1998 alone.\n  Mr. Holmes has likened abortion to slavery and the Holocaust.\n  In the mid-1980s, Mr. Holmes helped write an amendment to the \nArkansas Constitution to ban the use of any public funds for abortion, \neven in cases of rape or incest, and even if abortion was necessary to \nsafeguard a woman's health.\n  In 1995, he stated the ``only cause that I have actively campaigned \nfor\n\n[[Page S7557]]\n\nand really been considered an activist is the right to life issue.''\n  In 2000, he wrote an article expressing his approval of ``natural \nlaw,'' the idea that people have inalienable rights that precede the \nConstitution. That great phrase is part of the Declaration of \nIndependence. But then Mr. Holmes went on to state any recognition of a \nright to privacy in cases such as Roe v. Wade is illegitimate and \ninconsistent with natural law. Supporters of Mr. Holmes' nomination say \nhis statements do not show he will fail to enforce the law if he \nbecomes a Federal judge. It is true that after he was pressed by \nseveral Senators, Mr. Holmes admitted his statement that pregnancies \nfrom rape occur as frequently as snow in Miami was too inflammatory. \nBut this was more than an isolated statement--it came in the context of \nan extensive pattern of strident, anti-choice statements, writings, and \nactions over the past two decades. His cavalier dismissal of the \nproblems facing rape and incest victims is consistent with his repeated \nattempts to repeal or severely limit the right to choose, even in cases \nof rape or incest.\n  Supporters of the nomination suggest many intemperate statements he \nhas made say nothing about how he will interpret the law. But that \ndefies common sense. Mr. Holmes is a self-proclaimed activist against a \nfundamental constitutional right. Why should we approve a nominee who \nhas made such strong and intemperate statements against rights \nestablished in the Constitution? Why should we confirm a nominee who \nhas stated women must be subservient to men? Even if we assume those \nstrong opinions will somehow not affect how he interprets the law, they \nclearly do not reflect the judgment and temperament we expect from a \nFederal judge.\n  I respect the views of my colleagues from Arkansas who support Mr. \nHolmes' nomination. But too much is at stake. Once nominees are \nconfirmed for the Federal courts, they serve for life, and will \ninfluence the law for years to come.\n  We all know the values Americans respect the most: the commitment to \nfairness, equality, opportunity for all, and adherence to the rule of \nlaw. The American people expect us to honor these values in evaluating \nnominees to the Federal courts, and our consciences demand it. Mr. \nHolmes has every right to advocate his deeply held beliefs, but his \nrecord and his many extreme statements--especially about women's role \nin our modern society--raise too many grave doubts to justify his \nconfirmation, and I urge my colleagues to oppose his nomination.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to respond to a few of the \ncomments that have been made earlier today.\n  One of the complaints that has been made is that Leon Holmes, in a \nletter, said pregnancies from rape were as rare as snowstorms in Miami. \nI think there is a literary device called exaggeration for effect. I am \nsure he did not intend that literally. As a matter of fact, some of the \nstudies at that time showed pregnancies as a result of rape to be very \nrare indeed. I think since then numbers have come out to show a larger \nnumber have resulted from rape.\n  Mr. Holmes apologized, not recently but a number of years ago, for \nthat statement and, in fact, has written a nice letter in which he \ndealt with that explicitly and said that was not appropriate and noted \nhe had matured over the years. I point out he wrote that letter before \nhe became a lawyer in the early 1980s, or earlier, as a young man \ndebating as a free American citizen an issue that was important to him.\n  So that is what he said. That is how that came about. He has \napologized for it. I do not think it was malicious. I do not think he \nintended anything bad by it. I think he was trying to make the point \nthat based on the evidence he had at the time not that many abortions \noccurred as a result of rape. But he has admitted that was wrong and he \nshould not have used that kind of language. He has apologized to \neverybody he can apologize to. But it will not make much difference, I \nam sure, to some people.\n  I see the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the Chamber, Senator \nHatch.\n  I remember we had a young man who had gone off to college, I guess in \nhis early twenties, and had used a college credit card to purchase \nillegal property for himself, and they found it in the dorm room. He \nwent off to the Army and did well and went to law school and did well, \nand we considered that and sat down, and we felt this was not \ndisqualifying.\n  So they say that as a young man he made this one statement and this \nis going to disqualify him from sitting on the bench? It was 24 years \nago. Well, as if there is something bad about this man, his comment was \non the only thing he has politically ever really been engaged with--the \npro-life issue. His pro-life views are his religious belief. It is \nconsistent with his church's belief. It is his personal belief. He \nbelieves it is a bad thing to abort human life. And he has been active \nout there as a private citizen--not as a judge, as a private citizen--\nadvocating. But the complaints they had about him on this issue were \nover 20 years ago before he even got his law degree. So I think they \nare not persuasive in this debate.\n  He has also been attacked about the question of ``natural law.'' And \nhe answered the questions of the Senate Judiciary Committee, by \nDemocratic members, about when they asked him about it. He said:\n\n       In my scholarly capacity, I wrote in my ``Comment on \n     Shankman'' that there are no other provisions that open the \n     door to natural law.\n\n  He was asked whether he said that you couldn't alter the Constitution \non a natural law basis on a specific case. I believe one of the members \nof the committee asked him, what about any other case? And he said no.\n  He was asked another question:\n\n       During his Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Clarence \n     Thomas testified that he did not ``see a role for the use of \n     natural law in constitutional adjudication.'' Do you disagree \n     or agree? Please explain why or why not?\n\n  Mr. Holmes replied:\n\n       As I have stated above, I do not believe that the courts \n     are empowered by the Constitution to appeal to natural law as \n     a basis for their decisions. The courts are given whatever \n     authority they have by the Constitution. The Constitution \n     does not authorize the courts to use natural law as a basis \n     for overruling acts of Congress or acts of state \n     legislatures.\n\n  The comment that he believes natural law overrides the Constitution \nis contrary to his personal religious views but proves that he will be \na fair judge.\n  He was attacked viciously for the article he and his wife wrote about \nmarriage. I will just note that he and his wife together were quoting \nthe Pauline doctrine of marriage out of the book of Ephesians in the \nNew Testament. It was written in a Catholic magazine for Catholic \nreadership. It assumed certain background knowledge by the readers of \nthe article on Catholic doctrine. It did not attempt to explicate \nCatholic theology for readers of other faiths who would lack that \nbackground and have difficulty understanding. Moreover, the main thrust \nof the article was to explain why gender-neutral language was \ninappropriate in the liturgy of a church. It did not focus on Catholic \ndoctrine on marriage.\n  In a letter to Senator Blanche Lincoln, a fine Senator from Arkansas \nwho supports him and a Democratic Senator, he wrote this in explaining \nwhat he and his wife meant:\n\n       The Catholic faith is pervaded with the view that the \n     visible things symbolize aspects of the spiritual realm. This \n     pervasive element of the faith is manifest in the teaching \n     that the marital relationship symbolizes the relationship \n     between Christ and the Church. My wife and I believe that \n     this teaching ennobles and dignifies marriage and both \n     partners in it. We do not believe that this teaching demeans \n     either the husband or the wife but that it elevates both. It \n     involves a mutual self-giving and self-forgetting, a \n     reciprocal gift of self. This teaching is not inconsistent \n     with the equality of all persons, male and female, and, in \n     fact, in that column we say: ``[a]ll of us, male and female, \n     are equally sons of God and therefore brothers of one \n     another.'' This aspect of my faith--the teaching that male \n     and female have equal dignity and are equal in the sight of \n     God--has been manifest, I believe in my dealings with my \n     female colleagues in our firm and in the profession as a \n     whole.\n\n\n[[Page S7558]]\n\n\n  Indeed, many of them support him quite strongly. I reserve the \nremainder of the time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to respond briefly to the \ncomments made by Members on the other side of the aisle about the \nnomination of J. Leon Holmes to be a District Court Judge for the \nEastern District of Arkansas.\n  Mr. Holmes has been criticized for a number of comments--some of \nwhich are more than two decades old. Yet his opponents ignore the best \nevidence about Mr. Holmes: the people who have known him well \nthroughout the past two decades of his legal career. As Senator Lincoln \nof Arkansas recently noted in reaffirming her support for Mr. Holmes, \nletters of support from:\n\n       the legal community in Arkansas, many of whom share \n     different views than Mr. Holmes . . . describe him as \n     ``fair,'' ``compassionate,'' ``even-handed,'' and \n     ``disciplined.'' His colleagues hold him in high esteem.\n\n  That is from a press release of Senator Blanche Lincoln, April 11, \n2003. The other home State Senator, Senator Pryor also, of course, a \nDemocrat--supports Mr. Holmes.\n  Additionally, the strong support of Mr. Holmes' colleagues in the \nlegal community caused the American Bar Association to give him its \nhighest rating of ``well-qualified.'' Finally, the Arkansas Democrat-\nGazette, Holmes' hometown paper, is intimately familiar with his record \nand strongly supports him. The paper, writing while Mr. Holmes was \nbeing considered, indicated that Mr. Holmes was a well qualified, \nmainstream nominee:\n\n       What distinguishes Mr. Holmes is the rare blend of \n     qualities he brings to the law--intellect, scholarship, \n     conviction, and detachment. A reverence not just for the law \n     but for ideas, for the life of the mind. All of that would \n     shine through the clutter of argument that awaits any judge . \n     . . . He would not only bring distinction to the bench but \n     promise. . . . In choosing Leon Holmes, [the President] could \n     bequeath a promise of greatness.\n\n  That is from an editorial, Name on a List in a Field of Seven, One \nStands Out, Arkansas Democrat Gazette, Dec. 1, 2002, at 86.\n  It is easy to use out-of-context comments to paint an incomplete and \ninaccurate picture of a person. By looking at the entire context of Mr. \nHolmes' career, it is clear that he is held in high regard by those who \nknow him and his work. This includes those who hold views contrary to \nthose of Mr. Holmes, such as Stephen Engstrom, who on March 24, 2003 \nwrote to Chairman Hatch and Senator Leahy:\n\n       I heartily commend Mr. Holmes to you. He is an outstanding \n     lawyer and a man of excellent character. Leon Holmes and I \n     differ on political and personal issues such as pro-choice/\n     anti-abortion. I am a past board member of our local Planned \n     Parenthood chapter and have been a trial lawyer in Arkansas \n     for over twenty-five years. Regardless of our personal \n     differences on some issues, I am confident that Leon Holmes \n     will do his duty as the law and facts of any given case \n     require.\n\n  Letters like this, from people who have known Mr. Holmes well in the \ncontext in which he would serve, are the best evidence regarding Mr. \nHolmes. It is always appropriate to consider questions raised about \ncomments that a nominee has made in the past, and there certainly has \nbeen controversy about some of Mr. Holmes' statements. In this \nsituation, I defer to those who know the nominee, and who are in the \nbest position to put his statements into context. In this case, Mr. \nHolmes has overwhelming bipartisan support from those in his home \nState, especially those in the legal community, who have known him over \nthe past two decades. Based on this evidence, I will support Mr. \nHolmes' confirmation to the Federal bench.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination \nof Leon Holmes to be a district court judge for the U.S. District Court \nof Arkansas.\n  The ``advice and consent'' role given to the Senate in the U.S. \nConstitution is one of the Senate's most solemn duties, and one to \nwhich I give the utmost care. Since Federal judges serve for lifetime \nterms, I carefully review every nominee to ensure that he or she is \nwell-qualified and possesses the proper professional competence and \nintegrity. Although, naturally, I apply no litmus test with respect to \na nominee's personal beliefs, a commitment to following the law and \napplying it soundly is critical.\n  Perhaps the most important factor in evaluating a nominee is whether \nthe person has the proper ``judicial temperament.'' There are two \nelements that must be considered when making this determination. The \nfirst involves what we would commonly understand the characteristics of \ngood temperament to entail: would the nominee show courtesy and respect \ntoward the practitioners and parties in his courtroom, while at the \nsame time remaining confident and firm. From all I have heard about Mr. \nHolmes, he has a fine reputation for being both civil and professional, \nand I have no concerns about his nomination in this regard.\n  The second element of judicial temperament is more troubling in this \ncase. It involves the deliberative mindset that is so valued in our \njurists--the ability to separate emotion and personal views while \napplying the laws in a neutral and impartial manner. A judge must be \nable to transcend personal views in ruling on the matters before the \ncourt. It is for this reason that I am concerned about whether Mr. \nHolmes has the proper judicial temperament to receive a lifetime \nappointment to the federal bench.\n  After a careful review of the Judiciary Committee proceedings and Mr. \nHolmes' record, I have come to the conclusion that Mr. Holmes has not \ndemonstrated the requisite ability to put aside his personal views and \nfollow settled law. Over many years, Mr. Holmes has made a number of \npublic statements, many in letters to the editor or in published \narticles, that raise serious questions about his ability to set aside \nhis deeply held beliefs in order to impartially apply laws with which \nhe disagrees. In fact, Mr. Holmes himself has characterized some of his \nprevious comments as ``strident and harsh rhetoric.'' These statements \nwere not made in the midst of casual conversation; they were largely \nwritten pieces that reflected the thoughts of Mr. Holmes on these \nmatters.\n  In one extremely troubling instance, Mr. Holmes wrote that ``concern \nfor rape victims is a red herring because conceptions from rape occur \nwith approximately the same frequency as snowfall in Miami.'' This \nappalling statement was not a chance comment, instantly regretted. \nRather, Mr. Holmes included this statement in a letter he submitted for \npublication in The Daily Dispatch. In addition to the insensitivity and \ninaccuracy demonstrated by this comment, I believe it demonstrates that \nMr. Holmes lacks the measured approach that is critical for sound \njudicial decision-making and the ability to set aside his personal \nviews to apply settled principles of law.\n  In an April 11, 2004 letter to Senator Lincoln, Mr. Holmes stated, \n``I do not propose to defend that sentence, and I would not expect you \nor anyone else to do so.'' While in this same letter Mr. Holmes went on \nto apologize for this remark, he also acknowledged that his comment \n``reflects an insensitivity for which there is no excuse.'' I agree \nwith Mr. Holmes that there is no excuse for this statement, and his \nbelated apology came only after he was nominated for the Federal bench.\n  Unfortunately, this type of comment is not an isolated one, but one \nin a series of unsettling statements Mr. Holmes has made in his \nwritings over many years. For example, Mr. Holmes authored an article \nin 1997 in which he wrote that ``the wife is to subordinate herself to \nher husband,'' and ``the woman is to place herself under the authority \nof the man.'' In 1982, Mr. Holmes authored another letter for the \nArkansas Gazette, entitled ``The Scary New Argument for Abortion,'' in \nwhich he compared certain arguments justifying abortion to arguments \nused to justify the actions of Nazi Regime. In 2001, he authored a \ncomment for another publication in which he criticized both Roe and \nCasey as ``constitutionaliz[ing] the theory of moral relativism.''\n  Mr. President, let me be clear that I respect Mr. Holmes' personal \nviews on abortion rights and am not opposing his nomination on those \ngrounds. In fact, I have voted for many judicial nominees whose \npersonal views were different from mine on the right to choose, among \nother issues. Nor do I believe that a nominee should be required to \nindicate how he would decide issues of substantive law that may arise \nin future cases. That is not the issue. The issue is whether Mr. Holmes\n\n[[Page S7559]]\n\ncan put aside his personal views and follow settled law. Unfortunately, \nhis strident statements about a woman's right to choose raise doubts \nabout his commitment to following settled law, including Roe v. Wade.\n  I note that the Judiciary Committee reported Mr. Holmes' nomination \n``without recommendation.'' It is extremely rare for a nominee to be \npassed from the Judiciary Committee in this manner. In fact, according \nto the Congressional Research Service, a district court nominee has \nnever been reported out of Committee to the floor without \nrecommendation. It is my belief that the Judiciary Committee's unusual \naction in this regard represents more than an historical quirk. In \nfact, it underscores the concerns about this nomination.\n  Because of the concerns raised by the many writings and comments of \nMr. Holmes, of which I have cited only a few examples, I am unable to \nsupport his nomination. Our legal system depends on having judges who \nput an allegiance to following settled law above any personal beliefs. \nMr. Holmes' history of inflammatory statements could cause the parties \nbefore him to question whether his strong personal beliefs would allow \nhim to follow settled law and apply it in a fair and unbiased way. Mr. \nPresident, in light of these concerns, I will oppose this nomination.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, after careful consideration, I am voting \nto confirm Mr. J. Leon Holmes for the United States District Court for \nthe Eastern District of Arkansas.\n  I am concerned about certain of his writings/statements where he \nsaid: ``. . . concern for rape victims is a red herring because \nconceptions from rape occur with approximately the same frequency as \nsnowfall in Miami . . .'', ``the wife is to subordinate herself to her \nhusband'' and analogies of pro-choice advocates to Nazis and abortion \nto slavery.\n  Mr. Holmes subsequently acknowledged ``using strident and harsh \nrhetoric'' on abortion and wrote to Senator Blanche Lincoln that ``I am \na good bit older now and I hope more mature than I was at that time,'' \nblaming immaturity for his past harsh statements.\n  After discussing these issues with Mr. Holmes and noting that they \nwere written some time ago, in 1980 and 1997 respectively, I do not \nbelieve that they reflect a fixed state of mind demonstrating a pre-\ndisposition on judicial issues to come before his Court. I am also \nmindful that, as a District Court Judge, his decisions will be subject \nto review by the Court of Appeals. There would be a substantially \ndifferent consideration if he were a Circuit Court Judge where he could \ncast the decisive vote on a three-judge panel where it would be \nunlikely to be reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court since certiorari is \ngranted in such a small number of cases.\n  Mr. Holmes has a very impressive academic record, graduating first in \nhis law school class at the University of Arkansas, holds a Ph.D. in \nPolitical Science from Duke University and an M.A. degree from Northern \nIllinois University and is a member of Phi Beta Kappa.\n  In voting for confirmation of Mr. Holmes, I also noted that he has \nthe support of both of his home State senators. In their floor \nstatements, Senator Blanche Lincoln and Senator Mark Pryor noted that \nMr. Holmes has broad support among pro-choice advocates from Arkansas, \nand both Senators concluded that he should be confirmed based on their \nknowledge of his legal skills, temperament and character and based on \nhis reputation in their community among others who know him. In \naddition to their floor statements, I talked individually to Senators \nLincoln and Pryor who amplified to me their solid support for Mr. \nHolmes.\n  For these reasons, I am voting to confirm Mr. J. Leon Holmes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to discuss the nomination of \nJames Leon Holmes to be a federal court judge in the district court of \nArkansas. Before I address Mr. Holmes' record and qualifications, \nhowever, I think it is important to remind my colleagues of where we \nare in confirming President Bush's judicial nominees and how the \nSenate's record stands in historical context.\n  Thanks to bipartisan cooperation, the Senate has confirmed nearly 200 \nof President Bush's judicial nominees. This is more confirmations than \nin President Reagan's entire first term, President George H.W. Bush's \npresidency, or in President Clinton's last term. There are now only 27 \nvacant seats in the Federal courts, the lowest level of vacancies since \nthe Reagan administration. In fact, more than 96 percent of Federal \njudicial seats are filled.\n  With 28 judicial confirmations in this year alone, this Senate is \nwell ahead of 1996, the last time a President was running for re-\nelection, and when Republicans allowed not one single judge to be \nconfirmed until July. In 1996, Republicans allowed only 17 of President \nClinton's judicial nominees to be confirmed, none of which were for the \ncircuit courts. The Senate has confirmed five circuit court nominees \nthis year. In total, the Senate has confirmed 35 circuit court \nnominees, which is more than President Reagan and President Clinton saw \nconfirmed in each of their first terms.\n  There have been limited occasions where a nomination raises such \nsignificant concerns that members choose to oppose granting that \nnominee a lifetime appointment on the Federal bench. However, these \ncases have been few. Democrats have allowed 98 percent of President \nBush's nominees to be confirmed. In addition, Democrats recently \nreached an agreement with Republican leadership and the White House to \nensure that 25 judicial nominees, including Mr. Holmes, receive an up \nor down vote on the Senate floor. Any objective look at the record \nshows that Democrats have been willing to work with the White House to \nconfirm President Bush's nominees to the Federal bench.\n  While Democrats have worked with Republicans to provide James Leon \nHolmes an up or down vote, I must oppose this nomination. I have great \nrespect for my esteemed colleagues from Arkansas, who are supporting \nhis nomination. However, my review of the nominee's record raises \nserious concerns about Mr. Holmes' ability to put his personal beliefs \naside and decide cases based on the law. The Federal judiciary is too \nimportant to allow the appointment of any individual whose personal \nviews interfere with his ability to interpret and adjudicate the laws \nof the United States impartially.\n  This controversial nomination has been pending for a vote on the \nSenate floor for more than a year. His nomination was reported out of \nthe Judiciary Committee last year without recommendation, a rarely used \nprocedure. Mr. Holmes has been a lawyer for 20 years, and has made \ncountless insensitive and extreme statements over the years. In just \none troubling example, Mr. Holmes described slavery as divine \nprovidence intended to teach whites to be more Christlike.\n\n  During his hearing before the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Holmes \nadmitted that some of his remarks have been ``unduly strident and \ninflammatory,'' however, he also refused to promise to recuse himself \nin cases involving issues on which he already holds a committed \nposition.\n  In fact, during his hearing one Republican Senator on the Judiciary \nCommittee asked Mr. Holmes, ``why in the world would you want to serve \nin a position where you have to exercise restraint and you could not, \nif you were true to your convictions about what that role as a judge \nshould be, how you could feel like you have done everything you could \nin order to perhaps achieve justice in any given case.'' Rather than \nassuring the Committee of his ability to separate his personal beliefs \nfrom his role as a judge, Mr. Holmes simply conceded that ``I know it \nis going to be difficult for this Committee to assess that question, \nand I know it is a very important question.''\n  Another example of why this concern was raised, in October 200, Mr. \nHolmes delivered a speech in which he stated that, ``Christianity, in \nprinciple, cannot accept subordination to the political authorities, \nfor the end to which it directs men is higher than the end of the \npolitical order.''\n  Mr. Holmes is entitled to these beliefs. And one of the magnificent \naspects of our country is that every American can hold such beliefs and \nadvance them in the national discourse. But our country was founded on \nthe separation of church and state and the administration and \nadjudication of our laws must remain free from the influence of any one \nreligious perspective.\n\n[[Page S7560]]\n\nThat separation has been one of the linchpins of American liberty. \nBecause of the unique role of the federal judiciary in preserving our \nliberties, the Senate needs to be vigilant and ensure that no judge is \nable to impose his or her religious views on the rest of our country.\n  Mr. Holmes's actions and statements raise profound, and unanswered, \nquestions about his willingness to set aside his personal beliefs when \ninterpreting the law. Each member of the Senate has taken an oath to \nuphold and defend the Constitution and I believe that in good \nconscience we should not support the appointment of a judicial \ncandidate who will not be able to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nthe nomination of J. Leon Holmes occur at 5:45 p.m. today and the time \nbe equally divided. I further ask that when the Senate begins \nconsideration of the class action bill this evening, it be for debate \nonly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time remains on the minority side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. We have Senator Schumer and Senator Durbin here to speak. \nWe can divide that time between the two of them, so 7\\1/2\\ to each \nSenator, with Senator Schumer first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am not sure I will take my entire 7\\1/\n2\\ minutes, but I do wish to speak for a minute regarding this \nnomination.\n  Let me say before we begin that judging a potential judge is not an \neasy question. The question many of us grapple with is, Would this \njudge follow the law or would this judge impose his or her own views \ninstead of the law? That is a difficult question for most nominees. I \nthink both sides of the aisle think that way.\n  Senator Hatch said a few years ago:\n\n       I believe the Senate can and should do what it can to \n     ascertain the jurisprudential views of a nominee, that a \n     nominee will bring to the bench, in order to prevent the \n     confirmation of those who are likely to become judicial \n     activists.\n\n  Activists go both ways. You can be an activist and want to move the \nclock way ahead or you can be an activist and want to move the clock \nway back. If you want to move the body politic further to the left or \nfurther to the right, then jurisprudence would dictate. In my judgment, \nif you use that standard, it is not very difficult to come to the \nconclusion that Mr. Holmes does not deserve to be on the Federal bench.\n  It is true that when we evaluate candidacies of judges--at least some \nof us on this side; I for one--the fact they are district court \nnominees rather than court of appeals nominees means I give them a \nlittle extra room because they have less say and it is not an appellate \ncourt. But I think that Holmes is so far over, one of the most far over \nwe have seen, that even though he is a district court judge, he did not \ndeserve nomination, and he does not deserve approval by this body.\n\n  Mr. Holmes clearly has been an ardent and passionate advocate for \ncauses in which he genuinely believes. I respect that advocacy. But \nsome of the rhetoric he has used, some of the arguments he has advanced \nshould give one real pause--they sure give me real pause--as to who \ncares about the impartial enforcement of the rule of law.\n  Mr. Holmes said that our Nation's record on abortion is comparable to \nour Nation's record on slavery. Perhaps even more disturbingly on this \ncount, he said that rape leads to pregnancy about as often as snow \nfalls on Miami. That last comment isn't about choice or abortion. It is \noffensive, it is disturbing, and it shows a pattern of thought. If it \nwere a total aberration, then one might say, well, it is a mistake. But \nit wasn't.\n  According to the weather almanacs we have consulted, it snowed once \nin Miami in the last 100 years. According to a study published by the \nAmerican Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, over 32,000 women a year \nbecome pregnant as a result of rape or incest. I would say to Mr. \nHolmes, those 32,000 women a year are not a myth. If you were looking \nat the facts, not what you want to believe because of your deeply held \nviews but the facts, you wouldn't have said that. And certainly you \nwouldn't have said it casually without doing some research. These \n32,000 women are not red herrings. They are real women in real pain, \nmaking traumatic decisions about whether to give birth to their \ntormentor's child.\n  Unfortunately, that remark may be the most egregious but it is hardly \nisolated. He said that it is a woman's duty to subordinate herself to \nher husband and to place herself under the authority of the man. You \ncan see, I hope, why we might be concerned that he is insufficiently \nattuned to women's rights.\n  I know the President is going to go tomorrow to Michigan to speak on \nthe issue of judicial nominees. I would like him to tell all the women \nin the audience what his nominee said about women and their rights. \nLet's see if he will talk about that tomorrow.\n  My guess is that 99 percent of the women would be aghast that he said \nthat--whether they are Democrats, Republicans, liberals, or \nconservatives. I asked Mr. Holmes in written questions whether he was \nconcerned that, for example, a woman advancing a battered woman's \ndefense against her husband would lack confidence in his impartiality. \nHe said he doesn't see why anything he has written would justify any \nconcern that he could not be impartial.\n  Not only does Mr. Holmes not disavow his assertion that women are \nbound to subordinate themselves to men, he doesn't see why women should \nbe troubled by this. To paraphrase Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, ``It is \nelementary, Mr. Holmes.'' It is pretty basic stuff. This is not a great \nepistemological argument. It is very simple why women could be \noffended. If you cannot see it, you should not be on the bench. If I \nwere a woman in a dispute with a man, and my case was assigned to Mr. \nHolmes, I would be worried that Mr. Holmes could not even see why I had \nthese concerns. That is troubling.\n  There is a lot more to be worried about when it comes to the Holmes \nnomination. In his comments, which have already been printed in the \nRecord, just over and over again he defended and endorsed Booker T. \nWashington's view that slavery was a consequence of divine providence, \ndesigned to teach white people how to be more Christ-like. Is the \nPresident going to mention that when he goes to Michigan? See what \npeople think of that one. He said of all the cases in history, he would \nwant to have argued the creation case. It is right at the top of the \nlist. I don't know why he said that, since John Scopes was convicted. I \nguess Mr. Holmes thinks he could have done a better job teaching the \nevolutionary theory in the public schools. More egregious, in not any \nof these instances, with maybe the exception of the first, has he \ndisavowed them; he stands behind them. These are not slips of the \ntongue. This is a man caught, when you look at his writing, in almost a \ntime warp. This man probably doesn't even want to turn the clock back \nto the 1930s or 1890s but somewhere way back in the 1600s.\n  Holmes said he believes he possesses sufficient self-transcendence--\nhis words--to be able to set aside his views and judge cases \nimpartially. I don't think it is enough to get up and just say: I will \nfollow the law.\n  I don't mean to be flip, but it is just not that easy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. In conclusion, if moderation is a criteria in choosing \njudges--and it is one of mine--Mr. Holmes abjectly fails the test. I \nurge that he be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of \nJ. Leon Holmes. There is a reason this nomination has been sitting on \nthe calendar for over a year. There is a reason the Republican Senators \nare breaking ranks to vote against this nominee because, frankly, the \nnomination of J. Leon Holmes really speaks volumes about the message \nbeing sent by this White House to the American people.\n  Is this the kind of person they want to give a lifetime appointment \non the Federal bench? The things he said--his own words--condemn him. \nHe has written that ``the wife is to subordinate herself to her \nhusband'' and ``the\n\n[[Page S7561]]\n\nwoman is to place herself under the authority of the man and ipso facto \nplace herself under his authority.''\n  He wrote that abortion should not be available for rape victims \n``because conceptions from rape occur with the same frequency as snow \nin Miami.'' Does that sound like the kind of statement you want to hear \nfrom a man who is going to stand in judgment of cases brought before \nhim, cases that involve the rights of women, the rights of victims of \nrape?\n  Words count in life and in law. The words of a judge determine the \noutcome of a trial and the rights of the parties in the courtroom. The \nwords of J. Leon Holmes convict him of insensitivity to some of the \nmost basic issues in modern America.\n  I know Mr. Holmes and I disagree on some critical issues, but that is \nnot the basis for my opposition. We have already confirmed 197 of \nPresident Bush's nominees to the Federal bench. Trust me, the majority \nof them disagree with my positions on many issues, and I voted \noverwhelmingly because the President has his right to choose his \nnominees. But of all of the attorneys in Arkansas, and of all of the \nRepublican attorneys in the State of Arkansas, of all of the \nconservative Republican attorneys in the State of Arkansas, is this the \nbest the White House can do? A man who cannot really distinguish the \nrole of women in a modern society? A man who so cavalierly dismisses \nthe plight of a rape victim? This is a man who needs a lifetime \nappointment to stand in judgment of others?\n  I asked him in a written question about whether he would recuse \nhimself in cases as a Federal district court judge if any of the anti-\nabortion organizations that he has represented or founded came into his \ncourt. He said no; he was going to stand in judgment of the same \norganizations that he founded and those that paid him. He would not \nrecuse himself.\n  I also asked him a basic question that we ask of all nominees. I \nasked:\n\n       Mr. Holmes, name 3 Supreme Court cases with which you \n     disagree.\n\n  He said:\n\n       As a citizen, I am troubled by the Supreme Court decisions \n     in Dred Scott v. Sandford, Buck v. Bell, and Roe v. Wade, \n     because in my view each of those decisions failed to respect \n     the dignity and worth of the human person.\n\n  How could a person make that statement in response to that question \nand say he will uphold the decision in Roe v. Wade, which is a basic \nright of privacy for women in America? That is what Mr. Holmes said. In \nfairness to Mr. Holmes, though, he has apologized for his statement \nabout rape victims that ``conceptions from rape occur with the same \nfrequency as snow in Miami.'' When I asked about his statement, he \nwrote back and said:\n\n       Regardless of the merits of the issue, the articulation in \n     that sentence reflects an insensitivity for which there is no \n     excuse and for which I apologize.\n\n  I think it is important that that apology is on the record. Where is \nthe apology for his statement about the subordination of women to men? \nNo statement of explanation or apology was forthcoming. Some have come \nto the floor on the other side and said: Listen, these happen to be his \nreligious views. If you say you will not support him because of that, \nthen you are discriminating against his religion.\n\n  That is an upside down view of the world. Whether Mr. Holmes' views \nare based on religious beliefs, personal beliefs, cultural upbringing, \nor his life experiences, that is irrelevant. The basis for his beliefs \nis not important. What is relevant is whether his beliefs and his \nreasoning will guide his decisions as a Federal judge, his values that \ninfluence his judicial philosophy. The real question is, Are those \nbeliefs reasonable, mainstream, commonsense beliefs?\n  How can you read what this man has said about the issues of race and \ngender and say that these are mainstream views and he should have a \nlifetime appointment to instill those views into the decisions of the \nUnited States of America through its judicial system?\n  Those on the other side say this is all about religion. It is not. It \nis about a candidate, a nominee for a judicial lifetime appointment. \nOur Constitution only refers to religion in a few particular areas: \nFirst, it says there will be no religious test to qualify to any office \nof public trust in the United States. Of course, in the first amendment \nit says that Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of \nreligion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. Mr. Holmes is \nentitled to his religious beliefs, as I am, as Senator Hatch is, as \nevery Member of the Senate is. But when his religious beliefs reach a \npoint where they call into question whether he will be fair and \nbalanced in his judicial capacity, that is an important public policy \nissue. We must face it. To say that his beliefs, whether generated by \nreligion or otherwise, are inconsistent with mainstream thinking in \nAmerica is not antireligious. He is entitled to his religious beliefs. \nIt is a statement that we do not want to perpetuate those beliefs in \nthe findings of a judge with a lifetime appointment. Mr. Holmes' \nstatements, I am afraid, give us fair warning of what he will do as a \njudge.\n  Of all of the conservative Republican attorneys in Arkansas, why did \nit come down to this man? I don't think it is an accident. I think it \nis a test. This White House is testing this Senate to see how far we \ncan go, how far they can push us to put someone on the bench who is \nclearly out of the mainstream of American thinking.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Illinois asked the \nquestion, Is this the best the White House can do? In all honesty, I \nthink the people of Arkansas believe it is. The Democrat Gazette \nnewspaper thinks it is. A lot of Democratic women who are law partners \nwith this man think it is. I personally think it is a great nomination.\n  His record has been visibly distorted on the floor today. Let me take \na few minutes to rebut some of the charges and arguments made by those \nopposing Mr. Holmes' nomination. Many of these were addressed in the \nmorning in my opening statement and by others.\n  I refer my colleagues to the excellent statement made by the Senator \nwho knows him best, our colleague from Arkansas--in fact, both \ncolleagues from Arkansas, Senators Pryor and Lincoln. Senator Pryor \nworked with him and associated with him. Both he and Senator Lincoln \nsupport Mr. Holmes' confirmation.\n  It seems kind of specious to make the argument that nobody in their \nright mind would support this man. There is no doubt Mr. Holmes has \ntaken a public stance on many issues while in private life. He had a \nright to do so as an American citizen. We encourage citizens to play a \nrole in the democratic process. That is what Mr. Holmes has done.\n  We all can recognize abortion is a very divisive issue in this body \nabout which many persons feel strongly. The issue today is not whether \none view is right or wrong, but whether Mr. Holmes is able to set aside \nhis personal views, whatever they may be, and act as a judge should \nact.\n  The American Bar Association says, by giving him the highest rating \npossible, that he is able to do that. His friends in Arkansas say he \nis. The newspapers say he is. The two Senators from Arkansas, both \nDemocrats, say he is. Let me make a few points in this regard.\n  Some of the statements Mr. Holmes has made in the course of his \nactivism are, without doubt, inflammatory. They were made 24 years ago \nwhen he was 27 years of age. To his credit, Mr. Holmes has apologized \nfor his remark about rape which he made 24 years ago in the heat of the \nmoment.\n  In response to a written question from Senator Durbin, he wrote:\n\n       I have to acknowledge that my own rhetoric, particularly \n     when I first became involved in the issue [of abortion] in \n     1980 and perhaps some years thereafter, sometimes has been \n     unduly strident and inflammatory. The sentence about rape \n     victims which was made in a letter to an editor in 1980 is \n     particularly troublesome to me from a distance of 23 years \n     later.\n\n  It was a year ago he wrote this answer.\n\n       Regardless of the merits of the issue, the articulation in \n     that sentence reflects an insensitivity for which there is no \n     excuse and for which I apologize.\n\n  He was 27 years old. He was an activist in the pro-life cause. He has \napologized over and over. Can we not as adults accept his apology, or \ndo we require everybody to be perfect from 27 years old or before and \non?\n\n[[Page S7562]]\n\n  In an April 11, 2002, letter to Senator Lincoln, Mr. Holmes explained \nin a similar manner.\n\n       In the 1980s I wrote letters to the editor and newspaper \n     columns regarding the abortion issue using strident and harsh \n     rhetoric. I am a good bit older now and, I hope, more mature \n     as I was at the time. As the years passed, I came to realize \n     that one cannot convey a message about the dignity of the \n     human person, which is the message I intended to convey, \n     using that kind of rhetoric in public discussion.\n\n  Referring directly to his 1980 ``snow in Miami'' remark--which has \nbeen more than plastered all over this place today in spite of the case \nwe made that the remark was made years ago when he was a young man, and \nhe has more than prostrated himself in asking for forgiveness--he said:\n\n       I do not propose to defend that sentence--\n\n  The sentence about ``snow in Miami''--\n\n     and I would not expect you or anyone else to do so.\n\n  Based upon this letter and the level of support Mr. Holmes enjoys in \nArkansas, Senator Lincoln reaffirmed her belief that Mr. Holmes will be \na fair judge, and so do the people of Arkansas and anybody who knows \nhim.\n  I share Senator Lincoln's views. The fact that Mr. Holmes recognizes \nhis words in the past were sometimes strident and insensitive suggests \nto me he has undergone a maturation process for which he is given no \ncredit by the perfect people here in the Senate who are so willing to \nsit in judgment on statements made by 27-year-olds. I wonder how they \nwould fare if all of their 27-year-old statements were used to \ndetermine whether they could sit in the Senate.\n  Mr. Holmes was questioned by my Democratic colleagues on many of the \nissues they raised today. I thought his answers were very responsive, \nand I want to review them today so there is no further distortion of \nhis record, because we have had plenty of that today.\n  In response to another question by Senator Durbin, which was whether \nMr. Holmes, as a judge, would restrict the rights granted by Roe v. \nWade, Mr. Holmes responded:\n\n       The judge is an instrument of the court and hence the law. \n     Thus, the judge's personal views are irrelevant. Roe v. Wade \n     is the law of the land. As a judge, I would be bound by oath \n     to follow that law. I do not see how a judge could follow the \n     law but restrict the rights established by that law.\n\n  I do not know what more he has to say to show good faith, but he \nsurely said it there. In response to the question, ``Do you believe in \nand support a constitutional right to privacy?'' Mr. Holmes responded:\n\n       I recognize the binding force of the court's holding in \n     Griswold and Eisenstadt recognizing a right to privacy. I \n     have never engaged in political activity directed toward \n     overturning the result obtained in Griswold or Eisenstadt. If \n     I am confirmed by the Senate, I would follow the rulings of \n     the Supreme Court.\n\n  What do my colleagues need? Senator Leahy implied Leon Holmes has had \nsome kind of confirmation conversion. That is the usual bullcorn that \nhappens on the floor from time to time, especially with regard to \njudicial nominees.\n  I note that the overwhelming evidence, based on his own actions and \nletters of support, is Mr. Holmes is a man who respects the rule of law \nand is a man of integrity and will follow the law. His colleagues say \nthat. His women colleagues say that. People who differ with him \npersonally on his views say that. They say he will respect the law and \nfollow it.\n  Mr. Holmes is not nominated to the Supreme Court where the Justices, \nsuch as Justice Thomas, Justice O'Connor, or other Justices, are \nrequired to review and sometimes vote to overturn previous decisions. \nMr. Holmes, as a district court judge, is bound by the Supreme Court \nand the appellate court determinations and precedents.\n\n  I also heard some criticism that was raised by Senator Feinstein from \nCalifornia that Mr. Holmes placed the Roe v. Wade decision in the same \ncategory as Dred Scott and Buck v. Bell, as Supreme Court decisions \nwith which he disagrees. If he has, he has millions of Americans who \nalso disagree with those three decisions, and I am one of them myself.\n  Let me give the full and complete answer of Mr. Holmes on this issue. \nHe stated:\n\n       In my view, each of these decisions failed to respect the \n     dignity and worth of the human person. As a judge, I would \n     follow every decision of the Supreme Court that has not been \n     subsequently overruled.\n\n  Even though he disagrees with Roe v. Wade, he will uphold it. I do \nnot know when this business of not believing people on this issue \nstarted to take place, but it started back around the time of Justice \nRehnquist's nomination, and it has been coming every year. And they say \nthey do not have a litmus test. Give me a break.\n  One can disagree with Mr. Holmes' personal views, but one cannot \ncredibly argue that he does not respect the supremacy of the laws laid \ndown by the Supreme Court. Everything the man stands for says that.\n  Let me quickly turn to a few other issues raised today. I have \nalready addressed the issue regarding the charge that Mr. Holmes is \nantiwomen. The article he wrote with his wife--both of them wrote it--\nwas to discuss their fervent belief in Catholic teachings regarding \nrelationships. It was written for his religious peers in the Catholic \nfaith, published in a religious document. It was not a statement of his \nlegal views.\n  A fair reading of the article would show a support for the equality \nof women. I have read it a number of times. And by the way, if it comes \ndown to a choice between St. Paul and my distinguished friend from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, or my distinguished friend from \nIllinois, Senator Durbin, I think I will take St. Paul every time, and \nI think most everybody else in the country would, too. He and his wife \nwere quoting St. Paul.\n  We have even had some indications that St. Paul was out of whack. Not \naccording to the Bible, in which I think most of us claim to believe. I \nwill choose St. Paul every time. By the way, the article is why only \nmales in the Catholic Church hold the priesthood. If one reads it \nfairly, that is what he was driving home. If one reads it fairly, one \nwill find he was very fair to women and treated them equally, as his \npartners. Democratic women in his law firm whom he mentored and tutored \nand helped and worked with and works with today have testified through \nletters to us that they trust him, believe in him. Even though they \ndiffer with his views in some matters, they know he will follow the law \nbecause they know he is devoted to the law.\n  We ought to be able to give some credibility to people of that \nquality who get the highest possible rating by the American Bar \nAssociation. That is not always totally dispositive, I have to admit, \nbut it certainly adds to the belief of those of us who support this man \nand the Democrat people down there who also support him. Mr. Holmes \nenjoys the support of numerous women in Arkansas, including coworkers \nand colleagues who know him best.\n  There is a charge against Mr. Holmes. Holmes does not have the \ntemperament to be a Federal judge, some have said. He has said that \nrape occurs with the same frequency as snow in Miami and compared \nabortion to the Holocaust.\n  He has openly apologized for his 27-year-old rhetoric:\n\n       The sentence about rape victims which was made in a letter \n     to an editor in 1980 is particularly troublesome to me from a \n     distance of 23 years later.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Regardless of the merits of the issue, the articulation in \n     that sentence reflects an insensitivity for which there is no \n     excuse and for which I apologize.\n\n  That is a written response to Senator Durbin. We cannot take his word \nfor that? He was 27 years old, a fervent believer in the pro-life \ncause. Arkansans holding strong pro-choice views uniformly attest that \nHolmes will set aside any personal beliefs and follow the law while on \nthe bench.\n  Holmes' ``well-qualified'' rating shows he is at the top of the legal \nprofession in his legal community. He has outstanding legal ability, \nbut listening to the arguments today, one would think he is a total \nmalcontent who does not believe in the law. He has a breadth of \nexperience and the highest reputation for integrity. He has \ndemonstrated or exhibited the capacity for judicial temperament.\n  There is a charge that Holmes does not believe in the separation of \nchurch and State. He said this:\n\n       Christianity in principle cannot accept subordination to \n     the political authorities,\n\n[[Page S7563]]\n\n     for the end to which it directs men is higher than the end of \n     the political order.\n\n  That is what they say. He quoted him, so he must not believe in the \nseparation of church and State. But what did he say? Holmes was \ncontrasting Christianity with the pagan religions about which Aristotle \nwrote in which religious activities are political concerns. The speech \nmakes the point that Christianity looks to an ultimate source of \nauthority beyond Earthly authority, and that is God.\n  I mean, give him a break.\n  Holmes notes that the model of assigning religious and political \nmatters to separate spheres is favored by modern liberalism, including \nJohn Locke, Thomas Jefferson, and Alexis de Tocqueville, and the modern \nCatholic Church. He urges us not to miss the strengths of de \nTocqueville's argument that the church is stronger when separate from \nthe State. Holmes offers his own theological grounds for the separation \nof church and State, and yet one would think he was not.\n  Another charge is that Holmes is unwilling to recuse himself from \ncases involving anti-abortion organizations or abortion matters. He has \npledged that:\n\n       In any case in which litigants were concerned about my \n     fairness and impartiality, or the appearance of impropriety, \n     I would take those concerns seriously. I would follow 28 \n     U.S.C. Section 455 and the Code of Conduct for United States \n     Judges when making recusal decisions.\n\n  He would follow the law. He will abide by the same standards of \nconduct that govern every Federal judge.\n  Since the issue of natural law has been raised in discussing Mr. \nHolmes' nomination, I want to set the record straight.\n  Some have expressed concern that Mr. Holmes seems to be a believer in \nnatural law and will allow those beliefs to influence his rulings on \nthe bench. The facts show otherwise.\n  When asked if he believes that the Declaration of Independence \nestablishes or references rights not listed or interpreted by the \nSupreme Court to be in the Constitution, Mr. Holmes wrote:\n\n       I do not believe the Declaration of Independence \n     establishes judicially enforceable rights.\n\n  Instead, he wrote:\n\n       The Constitution as a whole is aimed at securing the rights \n     described as unalienable by the Declaration of Independence.\n\n  Mr. Holmes noted that:\n\n       Working all together, the entire system of government \n     should . . . result in a free country, a country without \n     tyranny, which, in the terms that the founders used, is \n     equivalent to saying a country in which natural rights \n     generally are respected.\n\n  Mr. Holmes, however, cautions:\n\n       [T]here is no constitutional authority for the courts to \n     use the Declaration of Independence to overrule the \n     Constitution. The authority of the courts is granted by the \n     Constitution, not the Declaration.\n\n  He also wrote:\n\n       No one branch of government can appeal to natural rights as \n     a basis for exceeding or altering its authority under the \n     Constitution.\n\n  Rather, he writes:\n\n       [w]hen citizens believe that natural rights are not \n     safeguarded adequately by the present system of government, \n     they may express that view in the electoral process, or they \n     may seek to amend the Constitution pursuant to Article V.\n\n  Mr. Holmes has demonstrated, and his record demonstrates, that once \nhe dons the robes of a judge, he will set aside those beliefs and \nfollow the law as it is stated. Mr. Holmes understands key differences \nbetween an advocate and a judge, and that personal views play no role \nin the duty of a judge to abide by stare decisis and apply the \nprecedent of the Supreme Court and Eighth Circuit. For those reasons, I \nbelieve that Mr. Holmes will make an outstanding Federal district \njudge.\n  I close by yielding my last few minutes to Senator Pryor, a Member of \nthe Senate who knows Mr. Holmes the best. I believe we ought to listen \nto the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 58 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I will be brief.\n  Earlier today, I read from 23 different letters of people from \nArkansas, lawyers who practice with him, who support him. Many of these \nstatements are inflammatory. I admit that. He admits that. He has \napologized. Many of these were done 15, 20, in one case 24 years ago.\n  I hope we will tone down the rhetoric. If Senators vote for Leon \nHolmes, they are not antiwoman. If Senators vote against him, certainly \nthey are not anti-Catholic. Let us have a straight up-or-down vote.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for Leon Holmes. Over and \nover, people in Arkansas who know him, who repeatedly say they do not \nagree with him on many of these issues, think he will be a fair, \nimpartial, and an excellent member of the bench.\n  I ask my colleagues for their consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report S. 2062.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2062) to amend the procedures that apply to \n     consideration of interstate class actions to assure fairer \n     outcomes for class members and defendants, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the Class Action Fairness Act of 2004, which is now renumbered S. \n2062, to accommodate the bipartisan compromise we reached last November \nwith Senators Dodd, Schumer, and Landrieu. This improved bill embodies \na carefully balanced legislative solution that responds to some of the \nmost outrageous abuses of the class action litigation device in some of \nour State courts.\n  As anyone who has read the bill knows, it restores fairness to the \nclass\n\n[[Page S7564]]\n\naction system. Among other things, it eliminates the opportunity that \nexists in the current system for unscrupulous lawyers to profit by \nvictimizing injured parties with sham settlements. It takes away the \nopportunity for those lawyers to use the system to extort legitimate \nbusinesses for their personal financial gain.\n  Throughout the years, Congress has received powerful evidence showing \nan extraordinary concentration of large interstate class action \nlawsuits in a handful of outlier State courts--certain county courts, \nto be precise. The evidence further shows these outlier courts operate \nin a manner that deprives the rights of truly injured individual \nplaintiffs, as well as defendants. In too many cases, the families have \nfallen prey to the manipulation, and in some cases outright evasions, \nby certain plaintiffs' lawyers of the settled rules supposed to ensure \nbasic fairness during the major interstate class action disputes. Too \noften, judges approve settlements that primarily benefit the class \naction attorneys rather than the injured class members.\n  Indeed, it has become all too common for certain State courts to \napprove proposed settlements where class members receive little or \nnothing of value, such as meaningless coupons, while their attorneys \nrake in millions of dollars in fees.\n  It is one of the new games in litigation practice in America. It is a \ndisgrace caused by a relatively small few in the legal profession but \nenough to make it a matter of great concern. This bill would clarify \nand solve some of these problems.\n  To make matters worse, multiple class action lawsuits asserting the \nsame claims on behalf of the same plaintiffs are routinely filed in \ndifferent State courts, thus creating judicial inefficiencies and \nencouraging collusive settlement behavior. Unfortunately, the injuries \ncaused by these abuses are not confined to the parties who are named in \nthe class action complaint. Rather, they extend to everyday consumers \nwho unwittingly get dragged into these lawsuits as unnamed class \nmembers simply because they purchased a cell phone, bought a box of \ncereal, drove a car fitted with a certain brand of tires, or rented a \nvideo. What we are talking about is a system that impacts the vast \nmajority of people who live in this country, not only lawyers and some \nbusinesses, as some have wrongly suggested.\n\n  We are talking about people such as Irene Taylor of Tyler, TX, who \nwas cheated out of approximately $20,000 in a telemarketing scam that \ndefrauded senior citizens out of more than $200 million.\n  This is a picture of Irene Taylor. In a class action brought in \nMadison County, IL, the attorneys purportedly representing Ms. Taylor \nnegotiated a proposed settlement which excluded her from any recovery \nwhatsoever.\n  We are talking about people such as Martha Preston of Baraboo, WI, as \nevidenced by this picture of her. Martha was involved in the infamous \nBancBoston case, brought in Alabama State court, which involved the \nbank's alleged failure to post interest to mortgage escrow accounts in \na prompt manner. Ms. Preston received a settlement of about $4. \nApproximately $95 was deducted from her account to help pay the class \naction fees of $8.5 million.\n  This is the Bank of Boston chart, a perfect illustration of class \naction abuses going on in this country as we speak. A Bank of Boston \nsettlement over disputed accounting practices produced $8.5 million in \nattorneys' fees--costing the class members as much as $95, which was \ndeducted from their accounts. The plaintiffs' attorneys in this case \nlater sued class members for an additional $25 million. I do not care \nwho you are, you have to say that is outrageous.\n  Ms. Preston testified before the Judiciary Committee 5 years ago \nasking us to halt these abusive class action lawsuits, but it appears \nthat, at least so far, her plea has fallen on very deaf ears.\n  Class action abuses are far-reaching, so far-reaching that they \naffect nonconsumers as well. Take, for instance, Hilda Bankston, a \nhard-working American, shown in this picture, who came to this country \nseeking to fulfill the American dream. Hilda found that instead of \nreaping the rewards that normally come with hard work, she was \nunmercifully dragged into hundreds of lawsuits filed by personal injury \nlawyers in the State of Mississippi. Why? She owned the only drugstore \nin Jefferson County--a county known for hosting one of the most \nnotorious magnet courts in the country.\n  Her small business became a prime target for forum-shopping personal \ninjury lawyers in pharmaceutical cases, not because her business \ncommitted acts of negligence, and certainly not because her business \nhad deep pockets to pay a large jury award or a lucrative settlement. \nTo the contrary, they were sued, in this particular case, for the sole \npurpose of evading Federal court jurisdiction so the class action \nlawsuit could remain in State court.\n  Why would personal injury lawyers go to such trouble to keep a class \naction in State court? Because unlike our Federal courts which have \njudges who are insulated from political influence through lifetime \nappointments, many State court judges are elected officials who answer \nthrough the political process itself.\n  Even though Ms. Bankston no longer owns the drugstore, she continues \nto be named a defendant in these lawsuits today and is buried under a \nmountain of discovery requests because of the litigation. On a more \npersonal level, Ms. Bankston told us about how this ordeal has affected \nher both personally and professionally. She testified that:\n\n       [N]o small business should have to endure the nightmares I \n     have experienced. . . . I have spent many sleepless nights \n     wondering if my business would survive the tidal wave of \n     lawsuits cresting over it.\n\n  Critics have argued the Senate should vote this bill down because it \namounts to nothing more than special interest legislation. These \ncritics are dead wrong and stand in desperate need of a reality check. \nTo be perfectly clear, it is because of the wrongs committed against \neveryday American consumers such as Irene Taylor and Martha Preston \nthat the time has come for the Senate to pass class action reform. It \nis because of the victimization of innocent people like Hilda Bankston \nthat the Senate needs to act now, and it is because of the public's \ncollapsing confidence in our civil justice system that we need to pass \nthis bill without further delay. Arguments being raised to the contrary \nare red herrings that distort the real truth of the matter. The class \naction problem is real and significantly affects the general public.\n  The Class Action Fairness Act represents a modest and balanced \nsolution to the class action problems. There are two core features to \nthe legislation.\n  First, the bill implements consumer protections against abusive \nsettlements by, No. 1, valuing attorneys' fees in coupon settlements to \nthose coupons that are actually redeemed by class members; No. 2, \nproviding a standard for judicial approval of settlements that would \nresult in a net monetary loss to plaintiffs; No. 3, prohibiting \nsettlements that favor class members based upon geographic proximity to \nthe courthouse; and, No. 4, requiring notice of class action \nsettlements be sent to appropriate State and Federal authorities to \nprovide them with sufficient information to determine whether the \nsettlement is in the best interest of the citizens they represent.\n  Second, the bill corrects a flaw in the current Federal diversity \njurisdiction statute so the class actions with a truly interstate \nimpact are adjudicated where they originally should be adjudicated, and \nthat is in our Federal courts. Specifically, S. 2062 amends the \ndiversity of citizenship jurisdiction statute to allow larger \ninterstate class actions to be adjudicated in Federal court by granting \noriginal jurisdiction in class actions where there is ``minimal \ndiversity'' and the aggregate amount in controversy among all class \nmembers exceeds $5 million.\n  The bill also balances the States' interest in adjudicating local \ndisputes by providing that class actions filed in the home State of the \nprimary defendants remain in State court subject to a triple-tiered \nformula that looks at the composition of the plaintiffs' class \nmembership. This formula become known as the Feinstein compromise, \nwhich we were able to reach with Senator Feinstein during the Judiciary \nCommittee markup on the bill.\n  Moreover, after negotiations with Senators Dodd, Schumer, and \nLandrieu last November, we were able to reach consensus on further \nrefinements that allow truly local disputes\n\n[[Page S7565]]\n\ninvolving principal injuries within the forum State to be adjudicated \nin the State courts.\n\n  Now that I have summarized what the bill does, let me explain what it \ndoes not do. First, this bill does not eliminate all State court class \naction litigation. Class action suits brought in State courts have \nproven in many contexts to be an effective and desirable tool for \nprotecting consumer rights, nor do the proposed reforms in any way \ndiminish the rights or practical ability of victims to band together to \npursue their claims against large corporations. In fact, we have \nincluded several consumer-protection provisions in our legislation that \nI believe will substantially improve plaintiffs' chances of achieving a \nfair result in any proposed settlement.\n  My summary of the bill should not come as a surprise to anyone here \nbecause these reform efforts have an extensive history in this body. \nMost importantly, this bill maintains strong support from several \nMembers on the other side of the aisle. In this regard, I extend a \nspecial thanks to Senators Carper, Kohl, and Miller for their tireless \nefforts in pushing for class action reform. Their commitment has helped \nus to get where we are today with this bill, and I look forward to \ntheir efforts in the coming days to keep the focus on passing this \nmuch-needed compromise legislation without becoming mired in extraneous \namendments.\n  I also thank my colleagues--Senators Schumer, Dodd, and Landrieu--for \nworking with us in good faith to build a stronger bipartisan consensus \nfor this bill. As you may know, we fell one vote shy of invoking \ncloture, on getting 60 votes, last year. These three Members, who \noriginally voted against the bill presented us with a detailed list of \nissues they wanted resolved before they could support class action \nreform legislation. After extensive discussions last November, we \nresponded in good faith to each and every concern they raised by making \nthe appropriate changes that are now embodied in S. 2062.\n  I look forward to continuing the good faith that was displayed last \nNovember as we proceed on this bill.\n  Opponents of this legislation would, no doubt, like to derail it by \nbogging it down in the amendment process. I look to the leadership of \nmy Democratic colleagues who have worked with me on getting this \nlegislation to where it is, and to others who are serious about ending \nthe victimization of American consumers, to do all they can to prevent \nthis from happening.\n  Above all, I look to the leadership of Senator Grassley, who was the \noriginal sponsor of this bill and who deserves a lot of credit for \nhaving fought this bill through in such a magnificent way through all \nof these years. He is a gutsy guy. He stands for what he believes. He \ndeserves a lot of the credit for this bill.\n  In the coming days, I fully expect that some Members will offer \nnumerous amendments to the bill, many of which will have nothing to do \nwith the subject of class action. Look, we know this bill is going to \nbe used as an attempt to bring up all kinds of political amendments for \nthe purpose of scoring political points. I wish my colleagues wouldn't \ndo that on a bill this important. Naturally, some of them want to adopt \nsome of these amendments so they can kill this bill. Others just want a \nshot at making Senators vote on political issues that they think will \nbe embarrassing to them. I would hope we would concentrate on the bill \nbecause it is important, and if there are legitimate amendments, \ncertainly we will give every consideration to them.\n  While I understand the desire to follow regular order, I would like \nto note that this bill rests on a delicate bipartisan compromise that \nat least on paper commands a supermajority of votes--beyond 60--to \novercome a Democratic filibuster. But with each controversial measure \nadded to this bill, we all know it is less likely to become law. That \nis after 5 years of very hard work and an agreement by 62 Members of \nthis body who have signed on to this bill up front to see that it \npasses. As such, I urge my colleagues, especially those who have \nsupported class action reform, to limit and oppose amendments so we can \nmove an important bipartisan measure through the Senate.\n  Again, while I expect opponents of this bill to do everything in \ntheir power to gut and weaken the bill, I trust that my Democratic \ncolleagues who support class action reform will remain faithful to the \nbipartisan deal by vigorously opposing these amendments that will \nlikely be offered in the coming days. That is what we do when we agree \nto a settlement. We agree to work to stop all poison pill amendments, \nand we agree to work to stop amendments that those who made the \nagreement to begin with do not agree with.\n  Class action reform is long overdue, and it is now time for us to \nact. We have considered legislation for many years now, and the pattern \nof abuse has become clear. What once began as an occasional outrageous \nclass action settlement has now become a routine occurrence. There are \njurisdictions in this country, State jurisdictions and local \njurisdictions, that border on corruption, that literally don't care \nwhat the facts are, don't care what the law is. They are just going to \ngive the plaintiffs' attorneys whatever they want. The plaintiffs' \nattorneys have caught on to it, so they forum shop to these outrageous \njurisdictions so they can get judgments and verdicts far beyond what \nthey could ever get in a jurisdiction that treated the law with \nrespect.\n  The legislation we are considering would fix all of these problems. I \nwould consider it a shame if we allowed partisan politics to kill much-\nneeded reform of the abuses in the current system, abuses that are \nactually hurting those in the system we are supposed to help.\n  This is an important bill. We have worked long and hard to get to \nthis point. I hope with all my heart that our colleagues on both sides \nwill live up to the commitments they have made and that we can pass \nthis bill and solve some of these terrible problems.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the current version of class action \nlegislation has undergone a number of changes since it was reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee. Some of these changes have been improvements. \nI want to note that. Some have not. I know that Senators Dodd, \nLandrieu, Schumer, Kohl, and Carper negotiated some procedural \nimprovements to S. 1751. I believe these do help. I appreciate their \nefforts to rein in some of the worst aspects of the bill.\n  For example, these improvements restricted the use of worthless \ncoupon settlements. I agree with that. To hear some of the commentators \nabout this bill, you would think that was not in there, but I want \neverybody to know it is. They also eliminated some provisions that were \nharmful to civil rights and consumer plaintiffs who endure hardships as \na result of initiating and pursuing litigation.\n  But in other aspects, the compromise failed to achieve their intended \ngoals. For example, one provision seeks to reduce the delay plaintiffs \ncan experience when a case is removed to Federal court. It sets a time \nlimit for appeals and remand orders. But there is not a concomitant \nmeasure that would set a timeline for the district court to rule on the \nactual remand motion.\n  This may seem like a bit of arcane lawyer's jargon, but it is a lot \nmore than that. It means that you could be a plaintiff, be in State \ncourt legitimately. You suddenly get plucked out of State court. But \nthen they could put you on the Federal docket. Somebody could say, OK, \nwe are just going to leave it there year after year after year after \nyear, and there is nothing you could do about it. There is no recourse. \nI understand that Senator Feingold will offer an amendment to set a \nreasonable time limit for the district court to rule on these remand \norders. It seems like common sense. Rule them up or rule them down, but \nhave a time to do it. I hope all Senators will support him.\n  In addition, I am disturbed the bill may deny justice to consumers \nand others in class actions involving multiple State laws. The recent \ntrend in the Federal courts is to not certify class actions if multiple \nState laws are involved; thus, the class action bill could force \nnationwide class actions into Federal court and then just be dismissed \nfor involving too many State laws. It is kind of a way of making sure \nthat you never reach the merits of the\n\n[[Page S7566]]\n\ncase, whether in Federal courts or State courts, because you could get \nrid of it on a technicality. I understand Senator Bingaman has an \namendment to prevent this from happening. I would support that.\n  I am also concerned with provisions contained in the most recent \niteration of this class action bill before the Senate. I try to keep up \nwith it, but it keeps undergoing so many changes. But this latest part \nwould deprive Vermonters of the right to band together to protect \nthemselves against violations of State civil rights, consumer, health, \nand environmental protection laws in their own State courts. What it is \nsaying is, we here in the Senate can make a far better judgment than \nthe people of Vermont going into State courts on State matters or the \npeople of Tennessee going into Tennessee court on a Tennessee matter.\n  I hear so many speeches about how we have to protect our States and \nkeep the heavy hand of government from them, but basically we are \nsaying that if a group of people, say, in Iowa, want to band together \nto protect themselves against a violation of State civil rights or \nconsumer or health or environmental protection laws, and do it just in \ntheir own State courts, they can't do it because the U.S. Senate has \nfigured we know a lot better than the people of Iowa or Tennessee or \nVermont.\n\n  This bill continues to deprive citizens of the right to sue on State \nlaw claims in their own State courts if the principal defendant is a \ncitizen of another State, even if that defendant has a substantial \npresence in the plaintiff's home State and even if the harm done was in \nthe plaintiff's home State. In other words, you might have somebody \nfrom State A, but they have invested a huge amount in the second State. \nThey are involved in things in that second State. They do something in \nthat second State. They may deprive citizens of their rights in that \nsecond State, and they can't sue in that State. I understand that \nSenator Breaux intends to offer an amendment to keep these in-State \nclass actions in State courts. They should be.\n  I am also troubled by the scope of the legislation in that it \nfederalizes a lot more than class actions. This goes way beyond class \nactions. Despite the fact that such a provision was struck from the \nbill during markup in the Judiciary Committee, mass torts now again are \nincluded in the bill. This expansion simply amplifies the harm done to \ncitizens' rights and to the possibility of vindicating those rights in \ntheir own State courts.\n  Some special interest groups are distorting the state of class action \nlitigation by relying on a few anecdotes in an ends-oriented attempt to \nimpede plaintiffs bringing class action cases. It will make a lot of \nmoney in radio and TV stations. The ads are designed to actually be \nseen or heard only by 535 people--Members of Congress.\n  I think we should take steps to correct actual problems in class \naction litigation where they occur. But simply shoving most suits into \nFederal court will not correct the real problems faced by plaintiffs \nand defendants. We have done something like this by taking a whole lot \nof criminal matters that should easily be handled in State courts and \nput them into the Federal courts, and the Federal courts are so \noverloaded they don't get to either the criminal or civil cases.\n  Our State-based tort system has grown over 200 years. It remains one \nof the greatest and most powerful vehicles for justice anywhere in the \nworld. One reason for that is the availability of class action \nlitigation to let ordinary people band together to take on powerful \ncorporations or, in some cases, even their own Government. Nobody has \nthe money by themselves to take on the Government. Nobody has the money \nby themselves to take on some multibillion-dollar corporation. Banding \ntogether, sometimes they can.\n  Defrauded investors, deceived consumers, victims of defective \nproducts, environmental torts, and thousands of other people are \ncurrently able to access class action lawsuits in their State court \nsystem to seek and receive justice. They can band together to afford a \ncompetent lawyer. Whether they are getting together to force \nmanufacturers to recall products or to clean up after devastating \nenvironmental harm or to vindicate basic civil rights, they are using \nclass action. We should not try to make it more difficult or costly for \nthem to right those wrongs, although many people who cause the wrongs \nwould love us to put roadblocks in the way.\n  So the so-called Class Action Fairness Act falls short in the \nexpectation set by its title. It is going to leave many injured parties \nwho have valid claims with no way to seek relief. Class action suits \nhave enabled our citizens to receive justice and expose wrongdoing by \ncorporations and their own Government. It has given the average \nAmerican a local venue and a chance.\n  This legislation may be the last authorization bill the Senate \nconsiders this year. We have only passed one appropriations bill for \nthe upcoming fiscal year. The Senate has so few days left. Can you \nimagine that? There are 14 appropriations bills and we have only passed \n1. We have not passed a budget yet. I think that is supposed to be done \nin March or April. We are not going to do our appropriations bills. \nEverybody knows that. Someone will write a huge omnibus bill with the \nWhite House and try to cram it through. So I think because this is the \nlast authorization bill, you are going to have Senators on both sides \nof the aisle with both germane and nongermane amendments.\n  So we will vote and see where we go. There were improvements made. We \nshowed we could make improvements. But as soon as it started really \nbeing improved, the doors got slammed shut.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter on behalf of the attorneys \ngeneral of California, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, \nMinnesota, Montana, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Vermont, and West \nVirginia in opposition to S. 2062 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                State of New York,\n\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                        Albany, NY, June 22, 2004.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Majority Leader and Mr. Minority Leader: On behalf \n     of the Attorneys General of California, Illinois, Iowa, \n     Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New \n     Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Vermont, and West Virginia, we \n     are writing in opposition to S. 2062, the so-called ``Class \n     Action Fairness Act,'' which reportedly will be scheduled for \n     a vote in the next few weeks. Although S. 2062 has been \n     improved in some ways over similar legislation considered \n     last year (S. 274), it still unduly limits the right of \n     individuals to seek redress for corporate wrongdoing in their \n     state courts. We therefore strongly recommend that this \n     legislation not be enacted in its present form.\n       As you know, under S. 2062, almost all class actions \n     brought by private individuals in state court based on state \n     law claims would be forced into federal court, and for the \n     reasons set forth below many of these cases may not be able \n     to continue as class actions. All Attorneys General \n     aggressively prosecute violations of our states' laws through \n     public enforcement actions filed in state court. Particularly \n     in these times of state fiscal constraints, class actions \n     provide an important ``private attorney general'' supplement \n     to our efforts to obtain redress for violations of state \n     consumer protection, civil rights, labor, public health and \n     environmental laws.\n       We recognize that some class action lawsuits in state and \n     federal courts have resulted in substantial attorneys' fees \n     but minimal benefits to the class members, and we support \n     targeted efforts to prevent such abuses and preserve the \n     integrity of the class action mechanism. However, S. 2062 \n     fundamentally alters the basic principles of federalism, and \n     if enacted would result in far greater harm than good. It \n     therefore is not surprising that organizations such as AARP, \n     AFL-CIO, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, \n     Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, NAACP and Public \n     Citizen all oppose this legislation in its present form.\n       1. Class Actions Should Not Be ``Federalized''\n       S. 2062 would vastly expand federal diversity jurisdiction, \n     and thereby would result in most class actions being filed in \n     or removed to federal court. This transfer of jurisdiction in \n     cases raising questions of state law will inappropriately \n     usurp the primary role of state courts in developing their \n     own state tort and contract laws, and will impair their \n     ability to establish consistent interpretations of those \n     laws. There is no compelling need for such a sweeping change \n     in our long-established system for adjudicating state law \n     issues. Indeed, by transferring most state court class \n     actions to an already overburdened federal court system, this \n     bill will delay (if not deny) justice to substantial numbers \n     of injured citizens. The federal judiciary faces a serious \n     challenge in managing\n\n[[Page S7567]]\n\n     its current caseload, and thus it is no surprise that the \n     Judicial Conference of the United States has opposed the \n     ``federalization'' of class action litigation.\n       S. 2062 is fundamentally flawed because under this \n     legislation, most class actions brought against a defendant \n     who is not a ``citizen'' of the state will be removed to \n     federal court, no matter how substantial a presence the \n     defendant has in the state or how much harm the defendant has \n     caused in the state. While the amendments made last fall give \n     the federal judge discretion to decline jurisdiction in some \n     cases if more than one-third of the plaintiffs are from the \n     same state, and place additional limitations on the exercise \n     of federal court jurisdiction if more than two-thirds of the \n     plaintiffs are from a single state, even in those \n     circumstances there are additional hurdles that frequently \n     will prevent the case from being heard in state court.\n       2. Many Multi-State Class Actions Cannot Be Brought in \n     Federal Court\n       Another significant problem with S. 2062 is that many \n     federal courts have refused to certify multi-state class \n     actions because the court would be required to apply the law \n     of different jurisdictions to different plaintiffs--even if \n     the laws of those jurisdictions are very similar. Thus, cases \n     commenced as state class actions and them removed to federal \n     court may not be able to be continued as class actions in \n     federal court.\n       In theory, injured plaintiffs in each state could bring a \n     separate class action lawsuit in federal court, but that \n     defeats one of the main purposes of class actions, which is \n     to conserve judicial resources. Moreover, while the \n     population of some states may be large enough to warrant a \n     separate class action involving only residents of those \n     states, it is very unlikely that similar lawsuits will be \n     brought on behalf of the residents of many smaller states. We \n     understand that Senator Jeff Bingaman will be proposing an \n     amendment to address this problem, and that amendment should \n     be adopted.\n       3. Civil Rights and Labor Cases Should be Exempted\n       Proponents of S. 2062 point to allegedly ``collusive'' \n     consumer class action settlements in which plaintiffs' \n     attorneys received substantial fee awards, while the class \n     members merely received ``coupons'' towards the purchase of \n     other goods sold by defendants. If so, then this ``reform'' \n     should apply only to consumer class actions. Class action \n     treatment provides a particularly important mechanism for \n     adjudicating the claims of low-wage workers and victims of \n     discrimination, and there is no apparent need to place \n     limitations on these types of actions. Senator Kennedy \n     reportedly will offer an amendment on this issue, which also \n     should be adopted.\n       4. The Notification Provisions Are Misguided\n       S. 2062 requires that federal and state regulators be \n     notified of proposed class action settlements, and be \n     provided with copies of the complaint, class notice, proposed \n     settlement and other materials. Apparently this provision is \n     intended to protect against ``collusive'' settlements between \n     defendants and plaintiffs' counsel, but those materials would \n     be unlikely to reveal evidence of collusion, and thus would \n     provide little or no basis for objecting to the settlement. \n     In addition, class members could be misled into believing \n     that their interests are being protected by their government \n     representatives, simply because the notice was sent to the \n     Attorney General of the United States and other federal and \n     state regulators.\n       Equal access to the American system of justice is a \n     foundation of our democracy. S. 2062 would effect a sweeping \n     reordering of our nation's system of justice that will \n     disenfranchise individual citizens from obtaining redress for \n     harm, and thereby impede efforts against egregious corporate \n     wrongdoing. Although the Attorneys General of California, \n     Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, \n     Montana, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Vermont, and West \n     Virginia oppose S. 2062 in its present form, we fully support \n     the goal of preventing abusive class action settlements, and \n     would be willing to provide assistance in your effort to \n     implement necessary reforms while maintaining our federal \n     system of justice and safeguarding the interests of the \n     public.\n           Sincerely,\n     Eliot Spitzer,\n       Attorney General of the State of New York.\n     W.A. Drew Edmondson,\n       Attorney General of the State of Oklahoma.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial \nin today's New York Times in opposition be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 6, 2004]\n\n                        Class-Action Unfairness\n\n       A mischievous bill masquerading as an effort to reform the \n     system of class-action lawsuits is headed for the Senate \n     floor this week. The bill would tilt the civil justice system \n     in favor of corporations and against consumers, the \n     environment and public health. Democrats blocked a nearly \n     identical measure by just one vote last October, Since then, \n     three Democratic senators--Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, \n     Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and Charles Schumer of New \n     York--have agreed to switch sides to support the bill in \n     exchange for certain improvements in it.\n       Unfortunately, those improvements would not cure the bill's \n     core defect: namely, that it would move almost all major \n     class-action lawsuits to overburdened federal courts from \n     state courts. Such a shift is likely to delay or deny justice \n     in numerous instances, and, ultimately, to dilute the impact \n     of the strong consumer protection laws in many states.\n       A letter to Congress representing the views of 13 state \n     attorneys general, including Eliot Spitzer of New York, makes \n     this point emphatically. It goes on to note that the bill's \n     sweeping provisions moving state class actions to federal \n     courts would not only threaten individual plaintiffs but \n     would also trespass on traditional principles of federalism.\n       Should the Senate measure be passed, it would have to be \n     reconciled with an even more damaging House bill, which would \n     apply retroactively to pending class-action cases. The best \n     result would be for the Senate to defeat the bill and go back \n     to the drawing board. At the very least, however, it should \n     limit the damage by approving corrective amendments being \n     offered by Senator Jeff Bingaman and others to lessen the \n     disadvantage to plaintiffs.\n       No one disputes that certain provisions of the bill address \n     real class-action abuses, foremost among them the collusive \n     settlements that benefit plaintiffs' lawyers while \n     shortchanging their clients. But taken as a whole, the bill \n     before the Senate isn't genuine tort reform. It is mostly a \n     gift to wealthy special interests that is mislabeled as \n     reform.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see other Senators seeking the floor. I \nwill probably have an opportunity to say a few words tomorrow. I find \nthat the summertime laryngitis is coming back, and I see my dear friend \nfrom Iowa on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased that Majority Leader Frist \nhas called up the Class Action Fairness Act. I have been working on \nthis bill since the 105th Congress, so I think it is about time the \nSenate completes action on this bill.\n  My colleagues will recall that in October of last year Senator Frist \nbrought this bill to the floor, but we were not able to proceed to the \nbill because of filibuster, and we lost the vote on cloture on the \nmotion to proceed by just a one-vote margin. A supermajority of 60 \nvotes was needed. We had 59 votes which, obviously, means that last \nfall we had enough votes to pass the legislation but could not get \naround the filibuster.\n  When you are up against a filibuster, you have to work out issues \nbecause nothing in the Senate gets done that is not done in a fairly \nbroad bipartisan way. Since then, I have worked in good faith with \nSenator Hatch, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and our lead \nDemocratic cosponsors, Senator Kohl and Senator Carper, to modify the \nbill to address a number of concerns raised by their colleagues on the \nDemocratic side, Senators Dodd, Landrieu, and Schumer.\n  These Senators are now satisfied with the changes we made to this \nbill. We reintroduced the legislation this year as S. 2062. So the bill \nbefore us goes even further in terms of compromising on the issues than \nwere brought before the Senate last October--enough action, I hope, \nthat we can get to finality within a few days.\n  As many colleagues may already know, this bill has gone through many \nchanges and mostly changes to accommodate the minority in the Senate, a \nfew Democratic Senators. I have worked in good faith with my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle to bring people together and to address \nvalid concerns to increase support for this bill, especially to get \nover the hurdle of the supermajority of 60 to get to stop debate and \nget to finality.\n  To tell you the truth, Mr. President, I really didn't think we needed \nto make any changes in this class action bill that we originally \nintroduced this Congress--in other words, last year. I thought then, \nand I think now, that the original introduction was a pretty good bill. \nBut, of course, being a pretty good bill in my judgment doesn't mean it \nhas enough votes to get that supermajority and get the compromise that \nis necessary to get to finality. So in order to move the class action \nbill forward, I did my best to listen to the issues raised and to make \nmodifications to the bill where there was room for compromise.\n  Yet S. 2062 still retains the goals I wanted to achieve and other \ncosponsors\n\n[[Page S7568]]\n\nwanted to achieve; that is, to fix some of the more egregious problems \nthat we are seeing in the class action system, and to provide a more \nlegitimate forum for nationwide class action lawsuits.\n  The deal we have struck is a very carefully crafted compromise that \nshould not need any further modifications. So I am asking my colleagues \nto withhold offering amendments to avoid disrupting the balance we have \nachieved. I also hope we will not see a lot of nongermane amendments \noffered to this bill--meaning nothing to do with this legislation. \nUnder the rules of the Senate, they can be offered but they are very \ndistracting. We ought to keep our focus upon the class action system \nreform. Instead, we should focus on the germane amendments, get this \nbill done, and move on. We should not get all caught up in message \namendments that will do nothing but play politics and delay all the \nhard work that we put into this bipartisan compromise bill. So I hope \nwe can pass this bipartisan class action bill without changes and \nwithout any further delay.\n  The reality is that the class action system is broken and we should \ndo something about it. The current class action system is rife with \nproblems which have undermined the rights of both plaintiffs and \ndefendants. Class members are often in the dark as to what their rights \nare, with the class lawyers, driving the lawsuits and the settlements, \nwith their interests as much in mind as those of members of the class.\n  Class members receive court and settlement notices in hard-to-\nunderstand legalese. The notices are written in small print and in \nconfusing legal jargon so class members often do not understand their \nrights or, more importantly, the consequences of their actions with \nrespect to the class action lawsuit of which they are a part.\n  Furthermore, many class action settlements only benefit lawyers, with \nlittle or nothing going to the members who have been harmed. We are all \nfamiliar with class action settlements where the members get a coupon \nof little or no value, and the lawyers get all the money available in \nthe settlement agreement. We know that is not protecting the consumers \nof America.\n  In addition, the current class action rules are such that the \nmajority of the large nationwide class action lawsuits can only proceed \nin State court when they are clearly the kinds of cases that should be \ndecided in our Federal courts because they have nationwide \nimplications.\n  At least these class action lawsuits should have had an opportunity \nto be heard in Federal court because usually they are the cases that \ninvolve the most amount of money, citizens from all across the country, \nand issues of nationwide concern.\n  Why should a State court or a county court be deciding these kinds of \nclass action cases that are going to impact people all across our \ncountry? Those cases ought to be decided in a Federal jurisdiction. \nThis present system has never made sense to me.\n  To further compound the problem, the present rules are easily gamed \nby unscrupulous lawyers who steer class action cases to certain State-\npreferred courts where judges are quick to certify a class and approve \nsettlements with little regard to class members' interests and the \nparties' due process rights.\n  We have heard of class action lawyers manipulating case pleadings to \navoid removal of a class action lawsuit to Federal court, claiming that \ntheir clients suffered under $75,000 in damages, in order to avoid the \nFederal jurisdiction amount threshold in existing law.\n  We have also heard of class action lawyers crafting lawsuits in such \na way to defeat the complete diversity requirements by ensuring that at \nleast one named class member is from the same State as one of the \ndefendants, even if every other class member is from a different State.\n  These are only a couple of the gamesmanship tactics that we hear \nlawyers like to utilize to bring down an entire class action legal \nsystem. The fact is, many of these class action cases are just \nfrivolous lawsuits that are cooked up by lawyers to make a quick buck, \nwith little benefit to class members whom the lawyers are supposed to \nbe representing.\n  This is a real drag on the economy. Many a good business is being \nhurt by frivolous litigation costs. Unfortunately, the current class \naction rules are contributing to the cost of businesses across America \nand particularly hitting hard small businesses that get caught up in \nthe class action web.\n  Too many frivolous lawsuits are being filed and too many good \ncompanies and consumers are having to pay for lawyer greed. We need to \nrestore some commonsense reform to our legal system, and this \nlegislation does it. It should have been done years ago.\n  So my colleagues understand, then, why Senator Kohl of Wisconsin and \nI originally joined forces several Congresses ago--too long ago--to do \nsomething about these runaway abuses, and the only thing standing \nbetween us and success several years ago was the powerful influence of \npersonal injury lawyers within our political system.\n  The Class Action Fairness Act will address some of the more egregious \nproblems within our class action system, and it will, at the same time, \npreserve class action lawsuits as an important tool to bring \nrepresentation to the unrepresented.\n  I remind my colleagues of all the time that was spent working on \nfinding a fair solution to the class action problem. For the past four \nCongresses, Senator Kohl, Senator Hatch, and others have joined me in \nstudying the abuses in the class action system and working to solve \nthese problems. Over the years, both the House and Senate Judiciary \nCommittees have convened numerous hearings on these class action abuses \nand, more importantly, highlighting the need for reform. The House \npassed similar versions of class action bills in several Congresses \nwith very strong bipartisan support.\n  In the Senate, in the 105th Congress, I held a hearing on class \naction abuse in the Judiciary Committee's Administrative Oversight \nSubcommittee. In the 106th Congress, my subcommittee held another \nhearing on class action, and the Judiciary Committee, at that time, \nmarked up and reported out our class action legislation. The Judiciary \nCommittee held a hearing on class action abuse again in the 107th \nCongress and again in this 108th Congress. The Judiciary Committee \nmarked up the bill which is before the Senate.\n  Chairman Hatch, Senator Kohl, and I worked closely with Senator \nFeinstein to make sure that more in-State class actions stayed in State \ncourt. That was a compromise to garner a little more bipartisan support \nat that time.\n  We also worked closely with Senator Specter, albeit a Republican but \na person who had some questions about this legislation, to make sure \nthat his concerns relative to class actions were addressed.\n  The bill was approved by the Judiciary Committee with solid \nbipartisan support. Late last year, we worked with Senators Schumer, \nDodd, and Landrieu to address concerns they raised and to get them on \nboard. Those Senators joined us in the introduction of the numbered \nbill before us, S. 2062, in February of this year in a bipartisan show \nof support for class action reform.\n  I wanted to elaborate on the history of this bill so my colleagues \nwere aware of the tremendous amount of time, over almost a decade, that \nCongress has spent studying the problem with our class action system \nand all the work and compromises that we put into this bipartisan bill \nto hopefully now get it passed.\n  I will highlight some of the changes that we made to the bill to \nincrease bipartisan support since Senator Kohl and I introduced the \nfirst Class Action Fairness Act several years ago.\n  The bill, as was originally introduced, did several things. It \nrequired that notice of proposed settlements in all class actions, as \nwell as all class notices, be in clear, easily understood English and \ninclude all material settlements and the terms of those settlements, \nincluding amount and source of attorney's fees. Mr. President, you \nshould not have to be a lawyer to understand what you are suing about \nand what your cause is and what is going to happen to attorney's fees \nand other issues in the settlement. Presently, it is pretty complicated \nto understand that situation.\n  Because plaintiffs give up their right to sue by joining a class \naction, they have a right to understand the ramifications of their \nactions in joining a class.\n\n[[Page S7569]]\n\n  Then our bill required that State attorneys general, or other \nresponsible State government officials, be notified of any proposed \nclass settlement that would affect the residents of their States.\n  We included this provision to help protect class members because such \nnotices would provide State officials with an opportunity to object if \nthe settlement terms were unfair to the citizens of their particular \nState. Somebody at the State level ought to be reviewing that for the \npopulations of their States.\n  Our bill also requires that courts closely scrutinize class action \nsettlements where the plaintiffs only receive a coupon or some other \nnoncash award while, as I have said before, the lawyers get the bulk of \nthe money.\n  Our bill required the Judiciary Committee to report back to Congress \non the best practices in class action cases and how to best ensure \nfairness of class action settlements.\n  Finally, the bill allowed more class action lawsuits to be removed \nfrom State court to Federal court. The bill eliminated the complete \ndiversity rule for class action cases but left in State court those \nclass actions with fewer than 100 plaintiffs, class actions that \ninvolved less than $5 million, and class actions in which the State \ngovernment entity, like the attorney general--well, no that is not \nright--where a State government entity is a primary defendant. Our bill \nstill does many of these things, but we have made a number of \nmodifications to get broader bipartisan support.\n  In the Judiciary Committee last year, we incorporated the Feinstein \namendment, which would leave in State court class action cases brought \nagainst a company in its home State where two-thirds or more of the \nclass members are also residents of that State. We also incorporated \nchanges to address issues raised by Senator Specter relative to how \nmass actions should be treated under the bill.\n  In our negotiations in late 2003 with Senators Schumer, Dodd, and \nLandrieu, we made numerous changes. I am only going to mention a few of \nthose important compromises reached. Examples: We made changes to the \ncoupon settlement provisions in the bill, providing that attorneys fees \nmust be based either on the value of the coupons actually redeemed by \nclass members or the hours actually billed in prosecuting the case.\n  We deleted the bounties provision because of concern that it might \nharm civil rights plaintiffs.\n  We deleted provisions in the bill that dealt with specific notice \nrequirements because the Judicial Conference has already approved \nsimilar notice requirements to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  To address questions about the merry-go-round issue, we eliminated a \nprovision dealing with the dismissal of cases that failed to meet rule \n23 requirements so that existing law continues to apply.\n  We deleted a provision allowing plaintiff class members to remove \nclass action because of gaming concerns.\n  We placed reasonable time limitations on appellate review of remand \norders in the bill.\n  We clarified that citizenship of proposed class members is to be \ndetermined on the date plaintiffs file the original complaint or when \nplaintiffs amend that complaint.\n  We made modifications to the Feinstein compromise that I have already \nreferred to and to the class actions language referred to.\n  We clarified that nothing in the bill restricts the authority of the \nJudicial Conference to promulgate rules with respect to class actions.\n  Finally, we crafted a new local class action exception which would \nallow class actions to remain in State court if, No. 1, more than two-\nthirds of the class members are citizens of the forum State; No. 2, \nthere is at least one in-State defendant from whom significant relief \nis sought by members of the class and whose conduct forms a significant \nbasis of the plaintiffs' claims; No. 3, principal injuries resulting \nfrom the alleged conduct or related conduct of each defendant were \nincurred in the State where the action was originally filed; and \nlastly, no other class action asserting the same or similar factual \nallegations against any of the defendants on behalf of the same or \nother persons has been filed during the preceding 3 years. We did this \nto ensure that truly local class action cases, such as a plant \nexplosion or some other localized event, would be able to stay in the \nState court where the harm took place.\n  So we have made significant concessions to get our Democratic \ncolleagues on board the Class Action Fairness Act. They have been \ntelling us they are ready to support the bill and to get it passed. \nBoth sides have been asking the leader to bring up this bill. Now that \nwe have an agreement to proceed to the bill, hopefully no partisan \npolitics will be played and we will get down to business and finally \nget this job done. It is time to make real progress on the class action \nbill and get it passed.\n  Again, I want to remind my colleagues that we crafted a carefully \nbalanced bill that consists of all of these compromises and more that I \nhave mentioned. I believe we have done a pretty good job of addressing \nlegitimate concerns with the bill, and I am hopeful we will not see \nlots of amendments to disrupt this compromise.\n  I urge my colleagues to refrain from offering nonrelevant amendments, \namendments that have nothing to do with this bill, because this is a \nbill that should not be bogged down with everyone's pet project, for \nwhich the Senate is so famous. All of our hard work of forging a \nbipartisan compromise bill should not go down the drain.\n  The bottom line is class action reform is badly needed. Both \nplaintiffs and defendants alike are calling for change. The Class \nAction Fairness Act will help curb many problems that have plagued the \nclass action system.\n  The bill will increase class member protections and ensure the \napproval of fair settlements. It will allow nationwide class actions to \nbe heard in the proper forum--the Federal courts--but keep primarily \nState class actions in State court. It will preserve the process but \nput a stop to the more egregious abuses. It will also help to put a \nstop to the frivolous lawsuits that are a drag on our economy and \nespecially harmful to small business.\n  Now that we have worked out a delicate compromise, we should be able \nto get this bipartisan bill done without any changes.\n  A lot of my colleagues listening will say: Well, the gall of the \nSenator from Iowa to say that we have such a perfect bill before the \nSenate that we should not have any amendments. Well, over the course of \nseveral years, this has been a bipartisan bill in sponsorship. We \ndeveloped more broad bipartisan consensus last year to get this bill \nout of committee. We just about had enough consensus to move the bill, \none vote short of a supermajority, last October, of 60 votes, to move \nthis bill.\n\n  Then there were further compromises made to get over that hurdle. You \ncan quantify in this body, what it takes, as a measure of \nbipartisanship. It is whether you get that 60-vote supermajority to \nstop debate and to get to finality. That is where the power of the \nminority comes into play in this body. They can say they need further \ncompromise to move this bill to finality. We did that between last \nOctober and now.\n  Some people do not want class action reform and they have a right to \nvote against it. But it seems when the Senate process has worked to \nbring about the necessary votes, and those necessary votes are gotten \nby the proper bipartisan compromises being worked out, then we ought to \nbe able to let the Senate work its will. The rights of the minority \nhave been protected.\n  Have the rights of every last Senator been protected? No. But if we \nhad to wait for that to happen, no bill would pass. But if it did pass, \nit would pass by a 100-to-0 margin.\n  We are there. Hopefully this bill will pass the way it has been \nworked out and be done in a short period of a few days. We do not have \na lot of time to spend on it. Of course, that works to the advantage of \nthose who do not want anything because they represent the interests, \nthey would say, of the consumers, and I don't doubt that is what they \nare concerned about. But they are also, intended or not, representing \nthe interests of the selfish personal injury lawyers who want to play \ngames with picking this county in this State, or that county in that \nState--some Podunk county where they can win their case.\n  It would be OK if that case were only pertinent to the people of that \nState,\n\n[[Page S7570]]\n\nbut you find this forum shopping with national implications. Something \nof national implication should not be decided in one Podunk county in \none State but should be decided by our Federal courts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARPER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. I yielded the floor, but if you want me to hold \nthe floor----\n  Mr. CARPER. I would appreciate it. If the Senator will yield, I would \nlike to make a comment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. CARPER. I want to thank the chairman, as the prime sponsor of \nthis bill, for his willingness to entertain changes and ideas from our \nside of the aisle, from Democrats who had what we thought were ideas to \nimprove this legislation. I think as the bill has gone through its \nintroduction, its markup and debate in the Judiciary Committee, been \nreported out of the Judiciary Committee--the bill was sort of \nrereported out of the Judiciary Committee with some further changes, \nthere was the adoption of the changes and incorporation of the changes \nthat were negotiated with a number of us, including Senators Schumer, \nDodd, Landrieu, Kohl, and myself--I think one of the reasons why we are \nhere tonight with a bill we can go forward with, that is going to get \npretty good bipartisan support, has been your willingness to not only \nlisten to some other ideas but to incorporate them into this bill.\n  As I listened to the Senator go through the bill and talk about it, \nparticularly to talk about the changes that have been made in it, I was \nstruck how far we have come in the course of the last year or two. I \nwant, while you are still here, to express my thanks for the way you \napproached this subject and the openminded way you have enabled us to \nmove forward.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, if I could say this before I yield the \nfloor, and I am going to yield the floor right away, first of all, I \nappreciate the statement by the Senator from Delaware. He may have \nmissed it, but sometime in my remarks tonight I made some commentary \nabout his efforts to help work a compromise and bring up issues that \nwere very important to get settled in order to move to finality.\n  Also, Mr. President, I want to tell you as well as other Members of \nthis body, this bill is where it is because of the urgency Senator \nCarper has put on this legislation, to get it passed, because he knows \nof the need. He also understands the need of bipartisanship.\n  I hope I have given him proper credit in this way. So many times as \nwe Senators do, we go to breakfasts or lunches to speak to groups that \nare interested in legislation, and they are always asking us about this \nbill or that bill. More often than not, particularly when I am talking \nto small business groups, I am often asked about when are we going to \nget class action reform. I say, under certain circumstances we will get \nit. Sometimes people compliment me because I was the prime sponsor of \nthis legislation. But I say at every one of these meetings, they need \nto thank Senator Carper whenever they see him, because no person in the \nSenate is trying move this bill along and do it in a bipartisan way, no \none more than Senator Carper.\n  I can say to Senator Carper, I thank him very much for what he has \ndone and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. CARPER. I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank Senator Grassley for what he said. I understand \nSenator Grassley may need to do some wrap-up here. I am not sure. If he \ndoes, I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. I guess I didn't understand that was part of my \nresponsibility. I will do that right away.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/06/senate-section/article/S7570-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I do not frequently come to the floor--I \nassume not very many Senators do--calling to the attention of the \nSenate an article that has appeared in ``Parade,'' the magazine that is \ninserted in our Sunday newspapers. But this past weekend I witnessed \nand then read an article entitled ``The America I Love.'' It was by \nElie Wiesel. I think we all have heard of him. He is a Jewish man who \nwas in the concentration camps. He was freed by American soldiers and \nthen came to America. He has spent much of his life here, becoming a \ncitizen. He has been a professor for a long time at one of our \nuniversities and has written about 40 books.\n  I do not know why this article came up this weekend, but let me read \nexcerpts from it, and then I will ask that the entire article be made a \npart of the Record.\n  At one point, Mr. Wiesel says:\n\n       In America, compassion for the refugees and respect for the \n     other still have biblical connotations.\n       Grandiloquent words used for public oratory? Even now, as \n     America is in the midst of puzzling uncertainty and \n     understandable introspection because of tragic events in \n     Iraq, these words reflect my personal belief. For I cannot \n     forget another day that remains alive in my memory: April 11, \n     1945.\n       That day I encountered the first American soldiers in \n     Buchenwald concentration camp. I remember them well. \n     Bewildered, disbelieving, they walked around the place, \n     hell on earth, where our destiny had been played out. They \n     looked at us, just liberated, and did not know what to do \n     or say. Survivors snatched from the dark throes of death, \n     we were empty of all hope--too weak, too emaciated to hug \n     them or even speak to them. Like lost children, the \n     American soldiers wept and wept with rage and sadness. And \n     we received their tears as if they were heartrending \n     offerings from a wounded and generous humanity.\n       Ever since that encounter, I cannot repress my emotion \n     before the flag and the uniform--anything that represents \n     American heroism in battle. That is especially true on July \n     Fourth. I reread the Declaration of Independence, a document \n     sanctified by the passion of a nation's thirst for justice \n     and sovereignty, forever admiring both its moral content and \n     majestic intonation. Opposition to oppression in all its \n     forms, defense of all human liberties, celebration of what is \n     right in social intercourse: All this and much more is in \n     that text, which today has special meaning.\n       Granted, U.S. history has gone through severe trials, of \n     which anti-black racism was the most scandalous and \n     depressing. I happened to witness it in the late Fifties, as \n     I traveled through the South. What did I feel? Shame. Yes, \n     shame for being white. What made it worse was the realization \n     that, at that time, racism was the law, thus making the law \n     itself immoral and unjust.\n       Still, my generation was lucky to see the downfall of \n     prejudice in many of its forms. True, it took much pain and \n     protest for that law to be changed, but it was. Today, while \n     fanatically stubborn racists are still around, some of them \n     vocal, racism as such has vanished from the American scene. \n     That is true of anti-Semitism too. Jew-haters still exist \n     here and there, but organized anti-Semitism does not--unlike \n     in Europe, where it has been growing with disturbing speed.\n       As a great power, America has always seemed concerned with \n     other people's welfare, especially in Europe. Twice in the \n     20th century, it saved the ``Old World'' from dictatorship \n     and tyranny.\n       America understands that a nation is great not because its \n     economy is flourishing or its army invincible but because its \n     ideals are loftier. Hence America's desire to help those who \n     have lost their freedom to conquer it again. America's credo \n     might read as follows: For an individual, as for a nation, to \n     be free is an admirable duty--but to help others become free \n     is even more admirable.\n       Some skeptics may object: But what about Vietnam? And \n     Cambodia? And the support some administrations gave to \n     corrupt regimes in Africa or the Middle East? And the \n     occupation of Iraq? Did we go wrong--and if so, where?\n       And what are we to make of the despicable, abominable \n     ``interrogation methods'' used on Iraqi prisoners of war by a \n     few soldiers (but even a few are too many) in Iraqi military \n     prisons?\n       Well, one could say that no nation is composed of saints \n     alone. None is sheltered from mistakes or misdeeds. All have \n     their Cain and Abel. It takes vision and courage to undergo \n     serious soul-searching and to favor moral conscience over \n     political expediency. And America, in extreme situations, is \n     endowed with both. America is always ready to learn from its \n     mishaps. Self-criticism remains its second nature.\n       Not surprising, some Europeans do not share such views. In \n     extreme left-wing political and intellectual circles, \n     suspicion and distrust toward America is the order of the \n     day. They deride America's motives for its military \n     interventions, particularly in Iraq. They say: It's just \n     money. As if America\n\n[[Page S7572]]\n\n     went to war only to please the oil-rich capitalists.\n       They are wrong. America went to war to liberate a \n     population too long subjected to terror and death.\n       We see in newspapers and magazines and on television \n     screens the mass graves and torture chambers imposed by \n     Saddam Hussein and his accomplices. One cannot but feel \n     grateful to the young Americans who leave their families, \n     some to lose their lives, in order to bring to Iraq the first \n     rays of hope--without which no people can imagine the \n     happiness of welcoming freedom.\n       Hope is a key word in the vocabulary of men and women like \n     myself and so many others who discovered in America the \n     strength to over come cynicism and despair.\n       Remember the legendary Pandora's box? It is filled with \n     implacable, terrifying curses. But underneath, at the very \n     bottom, there is hope. Now as before, now more than ever, it \n     is waiting for us.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the \nfull text of the article in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           The America I Love\n\n                            (By Elie Wiesel)\n\n       Born in Sighet, Transylvania (Romania), Elie Wiesel became \n     a U.S. citizen in 1963. Since then, Wiesel--a Holocaust \n     survivor, Boston University professor and the author of more \n     than 40 books--has become one of our nation's most honored \n     citizens. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan awarded him the \n     Congressional Gold Medal, the highest honor Congress can \n     bestow on a civilian. In 1992, President George Bush \n     recognized Wiesel with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. \n     Wiesel, who has been an outspoken advocate of human rights \n     around the world, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986.\n       The day I received American citizenship was a turning point \n     in my life. I had ceased to be stateless. Until then, \n     unprotected by any government and unwanted by any society, \n     the Jew in me was overcome by a feeling of pride mixed with \n     gratitude.\n       From that day on, I felt privileged to belong to a country \n     which, for two centuries, has stood as a living symbol of all \n     that is charitable and decent to victims of injustice \n     everywhere--a country in which every person is entitled to \n     dream of happiness, peace and liberty; where those who have \n     are taught to give back.\n       In America, compassion for the refugee and respect for the \n     other still have biblical connotations.\n       Grandiloquent words used for public oratory? Even now, as \n     America is in the midst of puzzling uncertainty and \n     understandable introspection because of tragic events in \n     Iraq, these words reflect my personal belief. For I cannot \n     forget another day that remains alive in my memory: April 11, \n     1945.\n       That day I encountered the first American soldiers in the \n     Buchenwald concentration camp. I remember them well. \n     Bewildered, disbelieving, they walked around the place, \n     hell on earth, where our destiny had been played out. They \n     looked at us, just liberated, and did not know what to do \n     or say. Survivors snatched from the dark throes of death, \n     we were empty of all hope--too weak, too emaciated to hug \n     them or even speak to them. Like lost children, the \n     American soldiers wept and wept with rage and sadness. And \n     we received their tears as if they were heartrending \n     offerings from a wounded and generous humanity.\n       Ever since that encounter, I cannot repress my emotion \n     before the flag and the uniform--anything that represents \n     American heroism in battle. That is especially true on July \n     Fourth. I reread the Declaration of Independence, a document \n     sanctified by the passion of a nation's thirst for justice \n     and sovereignty, forever admiring both its moral content and \n     majestic intonation. Opposition to oppression in all its \n     forms, defense of all human liberties, celebration of what is \n     right is social intercourse: All this and much more is in \n     that text, which today has special meaning.\n       Granted, U.S. history has gone through severe trials, of \n     which anti-black racism was the most scandalous and \n     depressing. I happened to witness it in the late Fifties, as \n     I traveled through the South. What did I feel? Shame. Yes, \n     shame for being white. What made it worse was the realization \n     that, at that time, racism was the law, thus making the law \n     itself immoral and unjust.\n       Still, my generation was lucky to see the downfall of \n     prejudice in many of its forms. True, it took much pain and \n     protest for that law to be changed, but it was. Today, while \n     fanatically stubborn racists are still around, some of them \n     vocal, racism as such has vanished from the American scene. \n     That is true of anti-Semitism too. Jew-haters still exist \n     here and there, but organized anti-Semitism does not--unlike \n     in Europe, where it has been growing with disturbing speed.\n       As a great power, America has always seemed concerned with \n     other people's welfare, especially in Europe. Twice in the \n     20th century, it saved the ``Old World'' from dictatorship \n     and tyranny.\n       America understands that a nation is great not because its \n     economy is flourishing or its army is invincible but because \n     its ideals are loftier. Hence America's desire to help those \n     who have lost their freedom to conquer it again. America's \n     credo might read as follows: For an individual, as for a \n     nation, to be free is an admirable duty--but to help others \n     become free is even more admirable.\n       Some skeptics may object: But what about Vietnam? And \n     Cambodia? And the support some administrations gave to \n     corrupt regimes in Africa or the Middle East? And the \n     occupation of Iraq? Did we go wrong--and if so, where?\n       And what are we to make of the despicable, abominable \n     ``interrogation methods'' used on Iraqi prisoners of war by a \n     few soldiers (but even a few are too many) in Iraqi military \n     prisons?\n       Well, one could say that no nation is composed of saints \n     alone. None is sheltered from mistakes or misdeeds. All have \n     their Cain and Abel. It takes vision and courage to undergo \n     serious soul-searching and to favor moral conscience over \n     political expediency. And America, in extreme situations, is \n     endowed with both. America is always ready to learn from its \n     mishaps. Self-criticism remains its second nature.\n       Not surprising, some Europeans do not share such views. In \n     extreme left-wing political and intellectual circles, \n     suspicion and distrust toward America is the order of the \n     day. They deride America's motives for its military \n     interventions, particularly in Iraq. They say: It's just \n     money. As if America went to war only to please the oil-rich \n     capitalists.\n       They are wrong. America went to war to liberate a \n     population too long subjected to terror and death.\n       We see in newspapers and magazines and on television \n     screens, the mass graves and torture chambers imposed by \n     Saddam Hussein and his accomplices. One cannot but feel \n     grateful to the young Americans who leave their families, \n     some to lose their lives, in order to bring to Iraq the first \n     rays of hope--without which no people can imagine the \n     happiness of welcoming freedom.\n       Hope is a key word in the vocabulary of men and women like \n     myself and so many others who discovered in America the \n     strength to overcome cynicism and despair.\n       Remember the legendary Pandora's box? It is filled with \n     implacable, terrifying curses. But underneath, at the very \n     bottom, there is hope. Now as before, now more than ever, it \n     is waiting for us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/06/senate-section/article/S7572-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7572-S7573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        111TH VIBORG DANISH DAYS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize the \nupcoming Danish Days Festival in Viborg, SD. This annual event attracts \nhundreds of people to the small South Dakota town to celebrate the \narea's rich Danish history. I especially applaud the Danish Days \nplanning committee and the Danish Heritage Association for their work \nto make this event a success.\n  Denmark-native Peter Larsen Christensen first settled near Viborg in \n1864, establishing a small general store on his homestead. Southwestern \nRailroad completed a line connecting Sioux Falls and Yankton in 1893, \nwhich passed through the present-day Viborg. The community incorporated \non August 25, 1893, shortly after the railroad's arrival, and quickly \ngrew into a bustling Danish community on the new South Dakota prairie.\n  Today, this town of 800 remains a vibrant community. In a time when \nsmall town stores continue to close, Viborg's Main Street features full \nstorefronts offering a variety of services, including a pharmacy, \ngrocery store and bank. The city's industrial park also continues to \ngrow. Viborg's strong business community exists because of the town's \nstrong foundation of community, established more than 100 years ago.\n  Each year, the Danish Days Festival provides Viborg residents, past \nand present, with an opportunity to celebrate the community's proud \nheritage. The event will feature a leadership luncheon for Turner \nCounty's public servants and an honoring reception for the decedents of \n2004 Danish Days honorees, C.J. and Cena Glood. A parade, community \nbarbecue, car show, and fireworks display are also planned.\n  The C.J. and Cena Glood family opened Viborg's first hardware and \nimplement store shortly after the community was incorporated, and their \ndecedents have continued to impact Viborg's prosperity through proud \nleadership. Most prominently, their eldest son, Royal, served 10 years \nin South Dakota State Legislature, advocating for the interests of \nTurner County.\n  Their daughter, Dagmar, maintained a medical practice in Viborg for \nnearly 20 years and made numerous contributions to the community. The \nfamily has had a substantial impact on Viborg's development and are \nworthy honorees.\n  Finally, the Danish Heritage Association will unveil Viborg's first \nDanish heritage museum during the festivities.\n\n[[Page S7573]]\n\nThe Association has dedicated hours of volunteer time and labor to \n``preserving yesterday and today for tomorrow,'' and I am pleased that \nartifacts of Viborg's history will be preserved in this fashion.\n  South Dakota communities each have their own unique history. I am \nproud to recognize Vibrog's ongoing work to preserve its heritage while \nbuilding toward the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/06/senate-section/article/S7573-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING SUE POWERS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I rise to remember Sue Powers, a woman \nwho devoted her last years to honoring the memory of cold-war veterans, \nand the widow of famed U-2 pilot Gary Powers.\n  When the United States salutes its war heroes, those who fought the \ncold war are often overlooked. Sue Powers, who died last month in Las \nVegas, worked tirelessly to change that, and to preserve this important \nchapter of our history.\n  Mrs. Powers served as a volunteer at the Atomic Testing Museum in Las \nVegas, and was a founding member of the Cold War Museum.\n  ``She was as much of a cold-war warrior as her husband and believed \nin him and what he did through the events in the Soviet Union'' said \nTroy Wade, chairman of the Nevada Test Site Historical Foundation.\n  Mrs. Powers, born Claudia Edwards, grew up in Warrenton, VA., and \nWashington, DC. After graduating from Anacostia High School, she went \nto work for the Central Intellegence Agency as a psychometrist.\n  In 1962 she met Francis Gary Powers, a famed U-2 pilot. Two years \nearlier in 1960, Powers had been shot down and taken as a prisoner of \nwar while flying his U-2 spy plane over the Soviet Union.\n  Gary and Sue met just after Gary's return from Russia. He literally \nbumped into her when he walked around a corner near their offices. \nAccording to their son Gary Jr., there was spilled coffee, which led to \na cup of coffee, which led to dinner, which led to romance and \nmarriage.\n  Sue left the CIA and the couple was married in 1963. After their \nmarriage they moved to Sun Valley, CA, where Gary worked as a pilot \nfirst for Lockheed then for KNBC television. They worked together to \npreserve the memories of those people who sacrificed their lives during \nthe cold war. Sue was left to carry on their cold-war crusade alone \nafter Gary died in a helicopter crash in 1977 while piloting for KNBC.\n  After her husband's death Mrs. Powers moved to Los Angeles and \neventually to Las Vegas. She devoted the rest of her life to preserving \nthe legacy of her husband and other heroes of the cold war. She was \nhonorary chairwoman of the Silent Heroes of the Cold War National \nMemorial Committee.\n  As a citizen of Nevada, Mrs. Powers worked especially hard to \npreserve Nevada cold war history. Her husband was trained at Area 51, a \nmilitary facility in Nevada, and Mrs. Powers was well aware of the many \nother contributions that Nevadans made during the cold war.\n  Many Government personnel were trained at Area 51, Nellis Air Force \nBase, or the Naval Air Station in Fallon. Nevada was also crucial to \nthe cold-war effort because it was home to intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles, fight training centers, nuclear weapons test sites, and \nstrategic tactical resources.\n  Mrs. Powers appreciated the importance of these contributions and was \ndiligent in her efforts to ensure that the Silver State's role in the \ncold war was not forgotten.\n  Sue never swayed in her loyalty to cold-war veterans or her \ndetermination to ensure their sacrifices were not forgotten. For this, \nshe herself is a hero. It is only fitting that she will be buried on \nJuly 13 in Arlington National Cemetery, along with her beloved husband.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/06/senate-section/article/S7573-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PASSAGE OF THE AGOA ACCELERATION ACT OF 2004\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to praise the Senate for \nthe passage of the African Growth and Opportunity Acceleration Act of \n2004 which was completed before we adjourned for the Fourth of July \nrecess. The House of Representatives passed the legislation on June 14, \n2004, and it was imperative the Senate quickly follow suit.\n  The passage of AGOA is great news for Africa. Since AGOA was first \nenacted in 2000, investment in Africa is up, and trade from Africa is \nup. Because of the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, many African \nfamilies can now feed their children. For the first time there is a new \nsense of hope in many countries. Many provisions of the Africa Growth \nand Opportunity Act were set to expire this year. This created an \nenvironment of uncertainty, which as leading to investment flight and \nlost opportunities. Passage of this bill will help people in Africa \nreap the full benefits of the program.\n  It is encouraging that this bill received such strong bipartisan \nsupport in the House and Senate. Trade can be a powerful tool of \ngrowth, and I am pleased that the majority of my colleagues share this \nview.\n  Although passage of this bill is a great step forward, there is still \na lot of work to be done. For example, the United States is currently \nnegotiating a free trade agreement with members of the Southern African \nCustoms Union. This will include the nations of South Africa, Botswana, \nLesotho, Swaziland, and Namibia. Completion of this agreement will help \nfoster trade and investment in the region, which could lead to a new \nperiod of sustained economic growth.\n  For trade to work, it has to be two-way street. Foreign aid and \npreference programs are always a short-term answer. For long-term \ngrowth, Africans must work hand-in-hand with the United States to open \nmarkets both in Africa and around the world. History proves that the \nmost economically advanced nations are those that embrace free trade \nand free markets. Too often, unduly high tariff barriers in developing \ncountries hinder the trade and investment that is so vital to economic \ngrowth. I want to help create a climate of sustained prosperity in \nAfrica, so we can eliminate poverty and provide hope for a better \nfuture. Passage of this bill is a good first step. I hope we can \ncontinue our work with the African people to help advance both our \neconomies and build toward a brighter, more prosperous future.\n  I would now like to take a minute and thank my staff who helped bring \nthis legislation into realization. First and foremost is my staff \ndirector and chief counsel, Kolan Davis, for his leadership and \nloyalty. I would like to thank Everrett Eissenstat, my chief \ninternational trade counsel, for his hard work as well as that of the \nrest of my trade team, including Stephen Schaefer, David Johanson, Zach \nPaulsen and Dan Shepherdson. I must not forget to mention Carrie \nClark--now Carrie Clark-Philips--who competently covered this issue for \nme before leaving the Committee. And finally, I want to thank the \nranking member on the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, and his able \ntrade staff of Tim Punke, Brian Pomper, Shara Aranoff, Sara Andrews, \nJohn Gilliland and Pascal Niedermann, for the work they did in getting \nthis bill compelted.\n  I look forward to seeing the President sign this legislation into law \nquickly, so we can continue to work with the African nations in \nfurthering economic progress. I thank the Senate for the bipartisan \nnature extended in the passage of this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/06/senate-section/article/S7573-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7573-S7574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On January 2, 1993, police found Chrissey Johnson naked, with her \nfeet tied together. She had been stabbed approximately 15 times and \nthrown from the second floor of her apartment. The disturbing nature of \nthe murder suggested to police that Johnson was targeted for being \ntransgendered.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing\n\n[[Page S7574]]\n\ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/06/senate-section/article/S7574-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COLLOQUY ON CAMCORDER PROVISION OF S. 1932\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, Section 3 of the ART Act establishes a new \nprovision of Title 18 entitled, ``Unauthorized Recording of Motion \nPictures in a Motion Picture Exhibition Facility.'' I ask Senator \nCornyn, what is the purpose of this provision?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Section 3 addresses a serious piracy issue facing the \nmovie business: the use of camcorders in a motion picture theater. Sad \nto say, there are people who go to the movie theater, generally during \npre-opening ``screenings'' or during the first weekend of theatrical \nrelease, and using sophisticated digital equipment, record the movie. \nThey're not trying to save $8.00 so they can see the movie again. \nInstead, they sell the camcorded version to a local production factory \nor to an overseas producer, where it is converted into DVDs or similar \nproducts and sold on the street for a few dollars per copy. This misuse \nof camcorders is a significant factor in the estimated $3.5 billion per \nyear of losses the movie industry suffers because of hard goods piracy. \nEven worse, these camcorded versions are posted on the Internet through \n``P2P'' networks such as KaZaa, Grockster and Morpheus--and made \navailable for millions to download. The goal of our bill is to provide \na potent weapon in the arsenal of prosecutors to stem the piracy of \ncommercially valuable motion pictures at its source.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have heard it said that this bill could be used against \na salesperson or a customer at stores such as Best Buy or Circuit City \nif he or she were to point a video camera at a television screen \nshowing a movie. Is this cause for concern?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Absolutely not. The offense is only applicable to \ntransmitting or copying a movie in a motion picture exhibition \nfacility, which has to be a movie theater or similar venue ``that is \nbeing used primarily for the exhibition of a copyrighted motion \npicture.'' In the example of Best Buy--the store is being used \nprimarily to sell electronic equipment, not to exhibit motion pictures. \nFor the same reason, the statute would not cover a university student \nwho records a short segment of a film being shown in film class, as the \nvenue is being used primarily as a classroom, and not as a movie \ntheater.\n  Mr. HATCH. Does the Senator from California agree with our colleague \nfrom Texas?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Absolutely, on all points.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have also heard some say that this statute could be used \nto prosecute someone for camcording a DVD at his home. Is this a fair \nconcern?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. No, it is not. The definition of a motion picture \nexhibition facility includes the concept that the exhibition has to be \n``open to the public or is made to an assembled group of viewers \noutside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances.'' \nThis definition makes clear that someone recording from a television in \nhis home does not meet that definition. It is important to emphasize \nthat the clause ``open to the public'' applies specifically to the \nexhibition, not to the facility. An exhibition in a place open to the \npublic that is itself not made to the public is not the subject of this \nbill. Thus, for example, a university film lab may be ``open to the \npublic.'' However, a student who is watching a film in that lab for his \nor her own study or research would not be engaging in an exhibition \nthat is ``open to the public.'' Thus, if that student copied an excerpt \nfrom such an exhibition, he or she would not be subject to liability \nunder the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Do the users of hearing aids, cell phones or similar \ndevices have anything to fear from this statute?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Of course not. The statute covers only a person who \n``knowingly uses or attempts to use an audiovisual recording device to \ntransmit or make a copy of a motion picture or other audiovisual work \nprotected under Title 17, or any part thereof. . . .'' In other words, \nthe defendant would have to be making, or attempting to make, a copy \nthat is itself an audiovisual work, or make, or attempt to make, a \ntransmission embodying an audiovisual work, as that term is defined in \nSection 101 of Title 17. As such, the Act would not reach the conduct \nof a person who uses a hearing aid, a still camera, or a picture phone \nto capture an image or mere sound from the movie.\n  Mr. HATCH. It appears that there is no fair use exception to this \nprovision. Is that correct?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This is a criminal provision under Title 18, not a \ncopyright provision under Title 17. Accordingly, there is no fair use \nexception included. However, Federal prosecutors should use their \ndiscretion not to bring criminal prosecutions against activities within \nmovie theaters that would constitute fair use under the copyright laws. \nThe object of this legislation is to prevent the copying and \ndistribution of motion pictures in a manner that causes serious \ncommercial harm. This legislation is not intended to chill legitimate \nfree speech.\n  Mr. HATCH. Does the Senator from Texas agree?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Yes, on all points.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/06/senate-section/article/S7574-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS OF AMERICA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

For over a hundred \nyears, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America have been empowering the \nyouth of our Nation by giving them tools to help them become productive \ncitizens and future leaders. Providing children a safe place to learn \nand grow is just the beginning for this wonderful organization, which \nsupports and inspires its members to participate in community service, \narts, and culture, and sports and fitness activities, to learn \nimportant health and life skills, and much more.\n  I am especially proud of the vibrant 115-year history of the Boys and \nGirls Clubs of Milwaukee, whose five clubs currently serve more than \n22,000 Milwaukee-area members. The Milwaukee clubs have won national \nawards for their technology and dental programs, and have achieved \ntremendous success in inspiring their members to strive to attend \ncollege.

The Boys and Girls \nClubs of America are integral in fostering a safe and productive \nenvironment for our Nation's young people, our country's greatest \nresource for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/06/senate-section/article/S7574-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7574-S7575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO JAMES A. ZIMBLE, M.D.\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to James A. \nZimble, President of the Uniformed Services University of the Health \nSciences, USUHS. On August 3, 2004, this remarkable individual will \nmark the end of his 46-year career in Federal service.\n  Dr. Zimble, Vice Admiral, Medical Corps, United States Navy \n(Retired), and 30th Surgeon General of the United States Navy, was born \non October 12, 1933, in Philadelphia, PA. He served as a senior medical \nstudent and ensign in the Navy Reserve Program from 1958 through 1959, \nearning a Medical Degree from the University of Pennsylvania, School of \nMedicine (SOM). Thus commenced a career dedicated to service to his \nnation, medical readiness, and force health protection.\n  Dr. Zimble's 33-year career in the Navy began with his internship and \nresidency at the Naval Hospital in St. Albans, New York. By 1969, he \nwas board certified by the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology. \nFrom 1972 through 1987 he served with distinction in a series of \nassignments directing clinical services and strategic planning. His \nNavy career culminated with his selection to serve as Surgeon General \nof the Navy, from 1987 through 1991. Vice Admiral Zimble earned \nmultiple honors and awards during his\n\n[[Page S7575]]\n\nNavy career, including the Department of Defense Distinguished Service, \nSuperior Service, and Meritorious Service Medals, the Department of \nNavy Legion of Merit, the Naval Reserve Association Distinguished \nService Award, and the Association of Military Surgeons of the United \nStates Founder's Medal.\n  Dr. Zimble was selected by the Secretary of Defense to serve as the \nPresident of USUHS in 1991. He was first to initiate strategic planning \nand assessment processes, which focused on mission accomplishment and \nthe annual achievements of the 1,824 members of the USUHS community. \nToday, the University provides a comprehensive, performance-based \nannual report to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).\n  In 1996, under Dr. Zimble's leadership, the Graduate School of \nNursing was established and officially recognized by OSD, thereby, \nproviding uniquely qualified advanced practice nurses for the military. \nIn December of 2000, the OSD Joint Meritorious Unit Award was presented \nto Dr. Zimble and the University, which officially recognized the \nmultiple products and services of USUHS and their generation of cost \navoidance for the Department. In addition, research conducted at USUHS \nwas recognized in Science as one of the top ten scientific \nbreakthroughs of 2002. In 2003, the University received the maximum \nterm of ten years of accreditation with commendation from the Middle \nStates Commission on Higher Education. Today, the USUHS School of \nMedicine Graduate Education Programs in Public Health rank sixth in the \nNation according to U.S. News & World Report's 2004 Rankings of \nAmerica's Best Graduate Schools on the list of the top 10 community \nhealth master or doctoral programs. The American Medical Association \nhas recognized that USUHS not only educates its own graduates, but also \nprovides a significant national service through its continuing medical \neducation courses for military physicians in combat casualty care, \ntropical medicine, combat stress, disaster medicine, and medical \nresponses to terrorism, courses not available through civilian medical \nschools. Significantly, the Emerging Infectious Diseases Graduate \nEducation Program provides courses on the agents and effects of \nbioterrorism and is the only graduate program in the Nation to offer \nformal training in these critical areas. Over the past 13 years, USUHS \nhas gained recognition and evolved into the Academic Center for \nMilitary Medicine.\n\n  During his tenure, Dr. Zimble remained focused on the medical \nreadiness and force health protection requirements of the Uniformed \nServices. Today, USUHS prepares its career-oriented physicians, \nadvanced practice nurses, and scientists for the practice of health \ncare in contingency environments. USUHS alumni possess the essential \nknowledge, skills, and attitudes required during Joint Service \ndeployments. Relevant knowledge in the psychological stresses of combat \nand trauma and the medical effects of nuclear, chemical, and biological \nweapons and extreme environments have been integrated throughout the \nUSUHS educational programs. USUHS' internationally recognized \noperational exercises, Operations Kerkesner and Bushmaster, ensure \nflexibility in meeting the ever-evolving requirements of medical \nreadiness. Dr. Zimble's meticulous focus has secured recognition for \nUSUHS throughout the uniformed and civilian health care communities for \nproviding uniformed physicians, advanced practice nurses and scientists \nwith a better understanding of, commitment to, and preparation for the \npractice of health care in the military. Such accomplishments were \nrecognized in 2000, when the Surgeon General of the United States \nawarded Dr. Zimble the Public Health Service Surgeon General's \nMedallion. In December of 1998 and 2001, the Association of American \nMedical Colleges confirmed the critical role of USUHS in national \nsecurity by recognizing the USUHS is the one place where physicians of \ntomorrow, obtain today, thorough preparation to deal with many \ncontingencies, including the medical aspects of chemical and biological \nterrorism. As of April 2004, the USUHS SOM alumni averaged \napproximately 20 years of active duty service and represent 22.2 \npercent of the 11,901 physicians on active duty. The Center for Navy \nAnalysis has reported that where the median length of non-obligated \nservice for physician specialists is 2.9 years, the median length of \nnon-obligated service for USUHS SOM alumni is 9 years, making USUHS the \nmost cost-effective and recommended accession source for leadership \npositions and ensuring continuity in the military health system. Today, \nUSUHS alumni are globally deployed and providing essential care for our \nArmed Forces in every theater of operation.\n  Dr. Zimble provided visionary leadership in the establishment of the \nNational Capital Area Medical Simulation Center and the immersive \nComputer-Aided Virtual Environment. Both projects serve as a template \nfor civilian entities to model and participate in similar training \nscenarios.\n  Dr. Zimble's extraordinary contributions are respected and admired \nthroughout the Joint Services and within the Federal and civilian \nhealth care communities. Our Nation is proud of Dr. Zimble's long and \ndistinguished career and his devotion to the health of the Armed Forces \nand that of all citizens. I take this opportunity to thank him for his \ntremendous dedication and love for our country. I wish him fair winds \nand following seas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/06/senate-section/article/S7575-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7575-S7576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BRUCE F. MUNDIE\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute today to \nBruce Mundie, Director of the Office of Regional Aviation Assistance \nfor the Maryland Aviation Administration. Bruce is retiring after a \ndistinguished career serving the public and the aviation community and \nI would like to extend my personal congratulations and thanks for his \ntremendous public service.\n  When the next chapter in Maryland's aviation history is written, \nBruce Mundie's name is likely to figure prominently as one of the key \nleaders who helped make the sky more accessible and greatly improved \nMaryland's air transportation infrastructure. Over the past 17 years, \nBruce has worked tirelessly to enhance aviation at Maryland's 34 \nregional general aviation airports and more than 100 private airports. \nAmong his many other accomplishments, Bruce was instrumental in the \ndevelopment of the Maryland Aid to Private Airports program, the \nMaryland Airport Equipment Loan Program, and the Maryland Airport \nManagers Association. He also introduced the innovative system of using \nautomated weather stations, allowing for the institution of all-weather \ncommercial service at eight new airports. In addition, he oversaw the \nreplacement of 27 visual approach slope indicators that violated FAA \nstandards and introduced new units that will save Maryland 95 percent \nof the cost of new equipment.\n  I have had the privilege of working closely with Bruce since he was \nfirst appointed to the Maryland Aviation Administration. Over the years \nwe worked to bring a new control tower to Salisbury-Ocean City-Wicomico \nRegional Airport, expand the runways at Hagerstown, Garrett County, and \nCarroll County Airports, and create a bi-state compact for the Greater \nCumberland Regional Airport, to name just a few projects. In every \ninstance, Bruce exhibited an extraordinary commitment to elevating \nairport efficiency and safety standards in Maryland.\n  But Bruce's passion for flying and aviation was not just exemplified \nin his work. As a founding member of Opportunity Skyway, Bruce \nintroduced programs that target students at risk of dropping out of \nschool, benefiting citizens across the State and allowing students to \npursue their interests in aviation. He has worked to integrate aviation \ninto school curriculums through an aerospace workshop for teachers \nentitled ``Take It to the Top.'' Bruce also contributed to area \ninstitutions of higher education, teaching Aviation Management at the \nUniversity of Maryland Eastern Shore.\n  Bruce's contributions and accomplishments to aviation and public \nservice have been recognized numerous times with prestigious honors, \nincluding his National Association of Aviation Officials Distinguished \nService Award in 2000. He also received the Distinguished Flying Cross \nin Vietnam and left the service a Lieutenant Colonel after a 26-year \ncareer in the United States Air Force.\n\n[[Page S7576]]\n\n  It is my firm conviction that public service is the highest calling, \none that demands the most dedicated efforts of those who have the \nopportunity to serve their fellow citizens and country. Throughout his \ncareer Bruce has exemplified a firm commitment to meeting this demand, \nconstantly and tirelessly devoting his energy to improving Maryland \nairports and the community through his education initiatives that have \nfostered local interest in aviation and encouraged adolescents to \nremain in school.\n  It has been a pleasure working with a man who has followed his \npassion to make aviation safer, more efficient, and accessible to young \npeople. I want to extend my personal congratulations and thanks for his \nyears of hard work and dedication and wish him the best in his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/06/senate-section/article/S7576-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING DR. DONALD DAHLIN\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to publicly \ncongratulate Dr. Donald Dahlin who is retiring from his position as \nVice President for Academic Affairs at the University of South Dakota. \nHe will be returning to the Department of Political Science where he \nwill be teaching American Government and Constitutional Law on a part-\ntime basis.\n  As the Vice President for Academic Affairs over the past 7 years, Don \nhas further enhanced the ideals and principles upon which the \nUniversity of South Dakota stands. Much has been accomplished during \nhis tenure. Of particular note is the progress made on a strategic plan \nand implementation of the First Year Experience and IdEA programs.\n  University of South Dakota President James W. Abbott said that the \nUniversity of South Dakota has benefited greatly from Dr. Dahlin's \nservice.\n\n       As a new president without academic experience, I was \n     extremely fortunate to have been the beneficiary of Don \n     Dahlin's wisdom and expertise.\n\n  Don has provided leadership in many different roles. He served as the \nacting President at USD, Chair of the Department of Political Science, \nand Director of the Criminal Justice Studies Program. He also served \nthe State as Secretary of the Department of Public Safety as well as \nthe Nation as an active consultant in the field of law enforcement, \npublic safety, the judiciary and court management.\n  Don's leadership and character is exactly what the USD community and \neducation field in South Dakota needs to evolve and survive in the \nfuture. I wish nothing but the best for him and his family. It is with \ngreat honor that I share his impressive accomplishments with my \ncolleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/06/senate-section/article/S7576-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/06/senate-section/article/S7576-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/06/senate-section/article/S7576-4", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  LEGISLATION AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS TO IMPLEMENT THE UNITED STATES-\n              AUSTRALIA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT (FTA)--PM 90\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit legislation and supporting documents \nprepared by my Administration to implement the United States-Australia \nFree Trade Agreement (FTA). This Agreement adds an important dimension \nto our bilateral relationship with a steadfast ally in the global \neconomic and strategic arena. This FTA will enhance the prosperity of \nthe people of the United States and Australia, serve the interest of \nexpanding U.S. commerce, and advance our overall national interest.\n  My Administration is committed to securing a level playing field and \ncreating opportunities for America's workers, farmers, and businesses. \nThe United States and Australia already enjoy a strong trade \nrelationship. The U.S.-Australia FTA will further open Australia's \nmarket for U.S. manufactured goods, agricultural products, and \nservices, and will promote new growth in our bilateral trade. As soon \nas this FTA enters into force, tariffs will be eliminated on almost all \nmanufactured goods traded between our countries, providing significant \nexport opportunities for American manufacturers. American farmers will \nalso benefit due to the elimination of tariffs on all exports of U.S. \nagricultural products.\n  The U.S.-Australia FTA will also benefit small- and medium-sized \nbusinesses and their employees. Such firms already account for a \nsignificant amount of bilateral trade. The market opening resulting \nfrom this Agreement presents opportunities for those firms looking to \nstart or enhance participation in global trade.\n  In negotiating this FTA, my Administration was guided by the \nnegotiating objectives set out in the Trade Act of 2002. The \nAgreement's provisions on agriculture represent a balanced response to \nthose seeking improved access to Australia's markets, through immediate \nelimination of tariffs on U.S. exports and mechanisms to resolve \nsanitary and phytosanitary issues and facilitate trade between our \ncountries, while recognizing the sensitive nature of some U.S. \nagricultural sectors and their possible vulnerability to increased \nimports.\n  The U.S.-Australia FTA also reinforces the importance of creativity \nand technology to both of our economies. The Agreement includes rules \nproviding for strong protection and enforcement of intellectual \nproperty rights, promotes the use of electronic commerce, and provides \nfor increased cooperation between our agencies on addressing \nanticompetitive practices, financial services, telecommunications, and \nother matters.\n  The Agreement memorializes our shared commitment to labor and \nenvironmental issues. The United States and Australia have worked in \nclose cooperation on these issues in the past and will pursue this \nstrategy and commitment to cooperation in bilateral and global fora in \nthe future.\n  With the approval of this Agreement and passage of the implementing \nlegislation by the Congress, we will advance U.S. economic, security, \nand political interests, and set an example of the benefits of free \ntrade and democracy for the world.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act \nof 2002 to extend and improve national dairy market loss payments; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased to help lead the effort to put \nthe Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program on equal footing with \nother counter-cyclical income support programs in the farm bill.\n  The MILC program provides critical support to dairy farmers when \nprices are low. When dairy prices rebound, as they have in recent \nmonths, it makes no payments to dairy farmers and the government spends \nnothing.\n  For thousands of family-sized dairy operations across the nation, the \nMILC program has meant the difference between bankruptcy and survival. \nUnfortunately, the program as authorized in the last farm bill will \ncome to an end in September, 2005.\n  As many of my colleagues will recall, the MILC program was \nestablished after an extremely painful debate over dairy compacts. I \nremain resolutely opposed to dairy compacts or any scheme that further \nexacerbates regional discontent in diary. Extending the MILC program to \nthe 2007 Farm Bill--rather than reopening rancorous regional warfare \nover dairy--seems the only prudent course of action.\n  This proposal is a bipartisan and national approach that will provide \nstability and predictability in an otherwise volatile industry. I \nencourage my colleagues to support this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/06/senate-section/article/S7582-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7582-S7583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 398--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PROMOTING \n                 INITIATIVES TO DEVELOP AN HIV VACCINE\n\n  Mr. LUGAR submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

ESTABLISHING A GLOBAL HIV VACCINE ENTERPRISE.\n\n       The Senate urges the President to continue the efforts of \n     the United States to generate global support for the \n     establishment of a Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise by carrying \n     out an initiative that--\n       (1) is in coordination and partnership with the members of \n     the Group of Eight, the private sector, and other countries, \n     especially\n\n[[Page S7583]]\n\n     those most affected by the HIV/AIDS pandemic;\n       (2) encourages the members of the Group of Eight to act \n     swiftly to mobilize money and resources to make the \n     establishment of a Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise a reality;\n       (3) includes a strategic plan to prioritize the scientific \n     and other challenges to be addressed, to coordinate research \n     and product development efforts, and to encourage greater use \n     of information-sharing networks and technologies;\n       (4) encourages the establishment of a number of coordinated \n     global HIV vaccine development centers that would have the \n     critical mass and scientific expertise necessary to advance \n     the development of an HIV vaccine; and\n       (5) increases cooperation, communication, and sharing of \n     information on issues related to HIV and AIDS among \n     regulatory authorities in various countries.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution expressing \nthe Sense of the Senate on promoting initiatives to develop an HIV \nvaccine.\n  The HIV/AIDS pandemic is unlike any disease in history and has \nprofound implications for political stability, development, and human \nwelfare. The sheer magnitude of the crisis is overwhelming. An \nestimated 40,000,000 people around the world live with HIV or AIDS, and \nnearly 8,500 people die every day from AIDS. Last year alone, more than \n3,000,000 people died from AIDS. Every 14 seconds, a child loses a \nparent to AIDS. An estimated 14,000,000 children have lost one or both \nparents to AIDS, and this number is expected in increase to 25,000,000 \nby 2010. According to recent projections from the World Health \nOrganization and the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), \nif the pandemic spreads at this current rate, there will be 45,000,000 \nnew infections by 2010 and nearly 70 million deaths by 2020. Sub-\nSaharan Africa has been hardest hit by the disease, with more than 75 \npercent of the people infected with HIV living in the region.\n  The U.S. is leading global efforts to combat the pandemic through its \n$15 billion dollar Emergency Plan for AIDS relief and its commitment to \nthe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. But the human \nand economic toll of the HIV pandemic demands that these activities be \ncomplemented by accelerated efforts to develop an HIV vaccine. An HIV \nvaccine would prevent new HIV and AIDS cases, which could save millions \nof lives and dramatically reduce the negative social and economic \nconsequences of the disease. Yet, HIV vaccine development is still not \nprominent on national or international public health agendas.\n  Developing an HIV vaccine is particularly challenging because HIV is \none of the most complicated viruses ever identified. In addition, many \nprivate sector biotechnology companies have not invested money and \nexpertise in the search for an HIV vaccine. Developing an HIV vaccine, \ntherefore, is unlikely to occur without a well-coordinated and focused \nglobal research effort.\n  Recently, under President Bush's leadership, the Members of the Group \nof Eight Industrialized Nations (G-8), during their meeting at Sea \nIsland, endorsed the establishment of a Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise. \nThe Enterprise, an international alliance working to develop an HIV \nvaccine, would be modeled after the Human Gnome Project which brought \ntogether public and private sector researchers to map the human genetic \ncode. Similarly, the HIV Vaccine Enterprise is intended to accelerate \nprogress by promoting international public-private collaboration. It \nwould coordinate the research efforts of scientists from around the \nglobe to improve the chances of developing an HIV vaccine. President \nBush also announced plans to establish a second HIV Vaccine Research \nand Development Center, in addition to the one at the U.S. National \nInstitutes of Health. The new center will become a key component of the \nGlobal HIV Vaccine Enterprise.\n  The International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) has been \ninstrumental in laying the groundwork for such an enterprise. The IAVI \nis an international organization that collaborates with developing \ncountries, governments, and international agencies dedicated to \naccelerating the development of a vaccine to halt the AIDS epidemic. \nThe IAVI, however, cannot accomplish this task alone. Here in the \nUnited States, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the \nRockefeller Foundation have joined forces to help address the financial \nproblems faced by small biotechnology companies. They founded BIO \nVentures for Global Health to help small biotechnology companies \naddress the problems they confront in developing new medical products \nfor poor countries. The wider application of this model would greatly \nimprove the development of vaccines and other medicines aimed at \nimproving health in the developing world.\n  I commend the President's leadership on this critically important \nissue. The G-8's endorsement of a Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise is a \nbig step forward in the development of an HIV vaccine. My resolution \nacknowledges the President's and the G-8's actions towards this goal \nand urges them to continue to cooperate with other countries, \nparticularly those hit hardest by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, to achieve \nthis important objective.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/06/senate-section/article/S7583-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3546.

Use of Tradeable \n                               Allowances\n\n     SEC. 301. COVERED ENTITIES MUST SUBMIT ALLOWANCES FOR \n                   EMISSIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Beginning with calendar year 2010--\n       (1) each covered entity in the electric generation, \n     industrial, and commercial sectors shall submit to the \n     Administrator one tradeable allowance for every metric ton of \n     greenhouse gases, measured in units of carbon dioxide \n     equivalents, that it emits from stationary sources, except \n     those described in paragraph (2);\n       (2) each producer or importer of hydrofluorocarbons, \n     perfluorocarbons, or sulfur hexafluoride that is a covered \n     entity shall submit to the Administrator one tradeable \n     allowance for every metric ton of hydrofluorocarbons, \n     perfluorocarbons, or sulfur hexafluoride, measured in units \n     of carbon dioxide equivalents; that it produces or imports \n     and that will ultimately be emitted in the United States, as \n     determined by the Administrator under subsection (d) and\n       (3) each petroleum refiner or importer that is a covered \n     entity shall submit one tradeable allowance for every unit of \n     petroleum product it sells that will produce one metric ton \n     of greenhouse gases, measured in units of carbon dioxide \n     equivalents, as determined by the Administrator under \n     subsection (b), when used for transportation.\n       (b) Determination of Transportation Sector Amount.--For the \n     transportation sector, the Administrator shall determine the \n     amount of greenhouse gases, measured in units of carbon \n     dioxide equivalents, that will be emitted when petroleum \n     products are used for transportation.\n       (c) Exception for Certain Deposited Emissions.--\n     Notwithstanding subsection (a), a covered entity is not \n     required to submit a tradeable allowance for any amount of \n     greenhouse gas that would otherwise have been emitted from a \n     facility under the ownership or control of that entity if--\n       (1) the emission is deposited in a geological storage \n     facility approved by the Administrator under section \n     204(a)(2)(F); and\n       (2) the entity agrees to submit tradeable allowances for \n     any portion of the deposited emission that is subsequently \n     emitted from that facility.\n       (d) Determination of Hydroflurocarbon, Perfluorocarbon, and \n     Sulfur Hexafluoride Amount.--The Administrator shall \n     determine the amounts of hydrofluorocarbons, \n     perfluorocarbons, or sulfur hexafluoride, measured in units \n     of carbon dioxide equivalents, that will be deemed to be \n     emitted for purposes of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 302. COMPLIANCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Source of tradeable allowances used.--A covered entity \n     may use a tradeable allowance to meet the requirements of \n     this section without regard to whether the tradeable \n     allowance was allocated to it under subtitle B or acquired \n     from another entity or the Climate Change Credit Corporation \n     established under section 351.\n       (2) Verification by administrator.--At various times during \n     each year, the Administrator shall determine whether each \n     covered entity has met the requirements of this section. In \n     making that determination, the Administrator shall--\n       (A) take into account the tradeable allowances submitted by \n     the covered entity to the Administrator; and\n       (B) retire the serial number assigned to each such \n     tradeable allowance.\n       (b) Alternative Means of Compliance.--For the years 2010 \n     and after, a covered entity may satisfy up to 15 percent of \n     its total allowance submission requirement under this section \n     by--\n       (1) submitting tradeable allowances from another nation's \n     market in greenhouse gas emissions if--\n       (A) the Secretary determines that the other nation's system \n     for trading in greenhouse gas emissions is complete, \n     accurate, and transparent and reviews that determination at \n     least once every 5 years;\n       (B) the other nation has adopted enforceable limits on its \n     greenhouse gas emissions which the tradeable allowances were \n     issued to implement; and\n       (C) the covered entity certifies that the tradeable \n     allowance has been retired unused in the other nation's \n     market;\n       (2) submitting a registered net increase in sequestration, \n     as registered in the database, adjusted, if necessary, to \n     comply with the accounting standards and methods established \n     under section 372;\n       (3) submitting a greenhouse gas emissions reduction (other \n     than a registered net increase in sequestration) that was \n     registered in the database by a person that is not a covered \n     entity; or\n       (4) submitting credits obtained from the Administrator \n     under section 303.\n       (c) Dedicated Program for Sequestration in Agricultural \n     Soils.--If a covered entity chooses to satisfy 15 percent of \n     its total allowance submission requirements under the \n     provisions of subsection (b), it shall satisfy up to 1.5 \n     percent of its total allowance submission requirement by \n     submitting registered net increases in sequestration in \n     agricultural soils, as registered in the database, adjusted, \n     if necessary, to comply with the accounting standards and \n     methods established under section 371.\n\n     SEC. 303. BORROWING AGAINST FUTURE REDUCTIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator shall establish a \n     prograrn under which a covered entity may--\n       (1) receive a credit in the current calendar year for \n     anticipated reductions in emissions in a future calendar \n     year; and\n       (2) use the credit in lieu of a tradeable allowance to meet \n     the requirements of this Act for the current calendar year, \n     subject to the limitation imposed by section 302(b).\n       (b) Determination of Tradeable Allowance Credits.--The \n     Administrator may make credits available under subsection (a) \n     only for anticipated reductions in emissions that--\n       (1) are attributable to the realization of capital \n     investments in equipment, the construction, reconstruction, \n     or acquisition of facilities, or the deployment of new \n     technologies--\n\n[[Page S7588]]\n\n       (A) for which the covered entity has executed a binding \n     contract and secured, or applied for, all necessary permits \n     and operating or implementation authority;\n       (B) that will not become operational within the current \n     calendar year; and\n       (C) that will become operational and begin to reduce, \n     emissions from the covered entity within 5 years after the \n     year in which the credit is used; and\n       (2) will be realized within 5 years after the year in which \n     the credit is used.\n       (c) Carrying Cost.--If a covered entity uses a credit under \n     this section to meet the requirements of this Act for a \n     calendar year (referred to as the use year), the tradeable \n     allowance requirement for the year from which the credit was \n     taken (referred to as the source year) shall be increased by \n     an amount equal to--\n       (1) 10 percent for each credit borrowed from the source \n     year, multiplied by\n       (2) the number of years beginning after the use year and \n     before the source year.\n       (d) Maximum Borrowing Period.--A credit from a year \n     beginning more than 5 years after the current year may not be \n     used to meet the requirements of this Act for the current \n     year.\n       (e) Failure To Achieve Reductions Generating Credit.--If a \n     covered entity that uses a credit under this section fails to \n     achieve the anticipated reduction for which the credit was \n     granted for the year from which the credit was taken, then--\n       (1) the covered entity's requirements under this Act for \n     that year shall be increased by the amount of the credit, \n     plus the amount determined under subsection (c);\n       (2) any tradeable allowances submitted by the covered \n     entity for that year shall be counted first against the \n     increase in those requirements; and\n       (3) the covered entity may not use credits under this \n     section to meet the increased requirements.\n\n     SEC. 304. OTHER USES OF TRADEABLE ALLOWANCES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Tradeable allowances may be sold, \n     exchanged, purchased, retired, or used as provided in this \n     section.\n       (b) Intersector Trading.--Covered entities may purchase or \n     otherwise acquire tradeable allowances from other covered \n     sectors to satisfy the requirements of section 301.\n       (c) Climate Change Credit Organization.--The Climate Change \n     Credit Corporation established under section 351 may sell \n     tradeable allowances allocated to it under section 332(a)(2) \n     to any covered entity or to any investor, broker, or dealer \n     in such tradeable allowances. The Climate Change Credit \n     Corporation shall use all proceeds from such sales in \n     accordance with the provisions of section 352.\n       (d) Banking of Tradeable Allowances.--Notwithstanding the \n     requirements of section 301, a covered entity that has more \n     than a sufficient amount of tradeable allowances to satisfy \n     the requirements of section 301, may refrain from submitting \n     a tradeable allowance to satisfy the requirements in order to \n     sell, exchange, or use the tradeable allowance in the future.\n\n     SEC. 305. EXEMPTION OF SOURCE CATEGORIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator may grant an exemption \n     from the requirements of this Act to a source category if the \n     Administrator determines, after public notice and comment, \n     that it is not feasible to measure or estimate emissions from \n     that source category, until such time as measurement or \n     estimation becomes feasible.\n       (b) Reduction of Limitations.--If the Administrator exempts \n     a source category under subsection (a), the Administrator \n     shall also reduce the total tradeable allowances under \n     section 331(a)(1) by the amount of greenhouse gas emissions \n     that the exempted source category emitted in calendar year \n     2000, as identified in the 2000 Inventory.\n       (c) Limitation on Exemption.--The Administrator may not \n     grant, an exemption under subsection (a) to carbon dioxide \n     produced from fossil fuel.\n\n    Subtitle B--Establishment and Allocation of Tradeable Allowances\n\n     SEC. 331. ESTABLISHMENT OF TRADEABLE ALLOWANCES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator shall promulgate \n     regulations to establish tradeable allowances, denominated in \n     units of carbon dioxide equivalents, for calendar years \n     beginning after 2009, equal to--\n       (1) 5896 million metric tons, measured in units of carbon \n     dioxide equivalents, reduced by\n       (2) the amount of emissions of greenhouse gases in calendar \n     year 2000 from non-covered entities.\n       (b) Serial Numbers.--The Administrator shall assign a \n     unique serial number to each tradeable allowance established \n     under subsection (a), and shall take such action as may be \n     necessary to prevent counterfeiting of tradeable allowances.\n       (c) Nature of Tradeable Allowances.--A tradeable allowance \n     is not a property right, and nothing in this title or any \n     other provision of law limits the authority of the United \n     States to terminate or limit a tradeable allowance.\n       (d) Non-Covered Entity.--In this section:\n       (1) In general.--The term `non-covered entity' means an \n     entity that--\n       (A) owns or controls a source of greenhouse gas emissions \n     in the electric power, industrial, or commercial sectors of \n     the United States economy (as defined in the Inventory), \n     refines or imports petroleum products for use in \n     transportation, or produces or imports hydrofluorocarbons, \n     perfluorocarbons, or sulfur hexafluoride; and\n       (B) is not a covered entity.\n       (2) Exception.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an entity \n     that is a covered entity for any calendar year beginning \n     after 2009 shall not be considered to be a non-covered entity \n     for purposes of subsection (a) only because it emitted, or \n     its products would have emitted, 10,000 metric tons or less \n     of greenhouse gas, measured in units of carbon dioxide \n     equivalents, in the year 2000.\n\n     SEC. 332. DETERMINATION OF TRADEABLE ALLOWANCE ALLOCATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall determine--\n       (1) the amount of tradeable allowances to be allocated to \n     each covered sector of that sector's allotments; and\n       (2) the amount of tradeable allowances to be allocated to \n     the Climate Change Credit Corporation established under \n     section 351.\n       (b) Allocation Factors.--In making the determination \n     required by subsection (a), the Secretary shall consider--\n       (1) the distributive effect of the allocations on household \n     income and net worth of individuals;\n       (2) the impact of the allocations on corporate income, \n     taxes, and asset value;\n       (3) the impact of the allocations on income levels of \n     consumers and on their energy consumption;\n       (4) the effects of the allocations in terms of economic \n     efficiency;\n       (5) the ability of covered entities to pass through \n     compliance costs to their customers;\n       (6) the degree to which the amount of allocations to the \n     covered sectors should decrease over time; and\n       (7) the need to maintain the international competitiveness \n     of United States manufacturing and avoid the additional loss \n     of United States manufacturing jobs.\n       (c) Allocation Recommendations and Implementation.--Before \n     allocating or providing tradeable allowances under subsection \n     (a) and within 24 months after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary shall submit the determinations under \n     subsection (a) to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, \n     and Transportation, the Senate Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works, the House of Representatives Committee on \n     Science, and the House of Representatives Committee on Energy \n     and Commerce. The Secretary's determinations under paragraph \n     (1), including the allocations and provision of tradeable \n     allowances pursuant to that determination, are deemed to be a \n     major rule (as defined in section 804(2) of title 5, United \n     States Code), and subject to the provisions of chapter 8 of \n     that title.\n\n     SEC. 333.

I ask unanimous consent the resolutions be agreed to, \nthe preambles be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid on \nthe table, all en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S7591]]\n\n  The resolutions were agreed to.\n  The preambles were agreed to.\n  The resolutions, with their preambles, read as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 322\n\n       Whereas the airborne forces of the United States Armed \n     Forces have a long and honorable history as units of \n     adventuresome, hardy, and fierce warriors who, for the \n     national security of the United States and the defense of \n     freedom and peace, project the effective ground combat power \n     of the United States by Air Force air transport to the far \n     reaches of the battle area and, indeed, to the far corners of \n     the world;\n       Whereas August 16, 2004, marks the anniversary of the first \n     official validation of the innovative concept of inserting \n     United States ground combat forces behind the battle line by \n     means of a parachute;\n       Whereas the United States experiment of airborne infantry \n     attack began on June 25, 1940, when the Army Parachute Test \n     Platoon was first authorized by the United States Department \n     of War, and was launched when 48 volunteers began training in \n     July of 1940;\n       Whereas the Parachute Test Platoon performed the first \n     official Army parachute jump on August 16, 1940;\n       Whereas the success of the Parachute Test Platoon in the \n     days immediately preceding the entry of the United States \n     into World War II led to the formation of a formidable force \n     of airborne units that, since then, have served with \n     distinction and repeated success in armed hostilities;\n       Whereas among those units are the former 11th, 13th, and \n     17th Airborne Divisions, the venerable 82nd Airborne \n     Division, the versatile 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault), and the airborne regiments and battalions (some as \n     components of those divisions, some as separate units) that \n     achieved distinction as the elite 75th Ranger Regiment, the \n     173rd Airborne Brigade, the 187th Infantry (Airborne) \n     Regiment, the 503rd, 507th, 508th, 517th, 541st, and 542nd \n     Parachute Infantry Regiments, the 88th Glider Infantry \n     Regiment, the 509th, 551st, and 555th Parachute Infantry \n     Batallions, and the 550th Airborne Infantry Battalion;\n       Whereas the achievements of the airborne forces during \n     World War II provided a basis of evolution into a diversified \n     force of parachute and air assault units that, over the \n     years, have fought in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, the \n     Persian Gulf Region, and Somalia, and have engaged in \n     peacekeeping operations in Lebanon, the Sinai Peninsula, the \n     Dominican Republic, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo;\n       Whereas the modern-day airborne force that has evolved from \n     those World War II beginnings is an agile, powerful force \n     that, in large part, is composed of the 82nd Airborne \n     Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), and the \n     75th Ranger Regiment which, together with other units, \n     comprise the quick reaction force of the Army's XVIII \n     Airborne Corps when not operating separately under a regional \n     combatant commander;\n       Whereas that modern-day airborne force also includes other \n     elite forces composed entirely of airborne trained and \n     qualified special operations warriors, including Army Special \n     Forces, Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance units, Navy SEALs, \n     and Air Force combat control teams, all or most of which \n     comprise the forces of the United States Special Operations \n     Command;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the \n     United States on September 11, 2001, the 75th Ranger \n     Regiment, special forces units, and units of the 82nd \n     Airborne Division and the 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault), together with other units of the Armed Forces, have \n     been prosecuting the war against terrorism by carrying out \n     combat operations in Afghanistan, training operations in the \n     Philippines, and other operations elsewhere;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the President's announcement of \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom in March 2003, the 75th Ranger \n     Regiment, special forces units, and units of the 82nd \n     Airborne Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), \n     and the 173rd Airborne Brigade, together with other units of \n     the Armed Forces, have been prosecuting the war against \n     terrorism, carrying out combat operations, conducting civil \n     affair missions, and assisting in establishing democracy in \n     Iraq;\n       Whereas the airborne forces are and will continue to be at \n     the ready and the forefront until the Global War on Terrorism \n     is concluded;\n       Whereas of the members and former members of the United \n     States combat airborne forces, all have achieved distinction \n     by earning the right to wear the airborne's ``Silver Wings of \n     Courage'', thousands have achieved the distinction of making \n     combat jumps, 69 have earned the Medal of Honor, and hundreds \n     have earned the Distinguished-Service Cross, Silver Star, or \n     other decorations and awards for displays of such traits as \n     heroism, gallantry, intrepidity, and valor;\n       Whereas the members and former members of the United States \n     combat airborne forces are members of a proud and honorable \n     fraternity of the profession of arms that is made exclusive \n     by those distinctions which, together with their special \n     skills and achievements, distinguish them as intrepid combat \n     parachutists, special operations forces, and (in former days) \n     glider troops; and\n       Whereas the history and achievements of the members and \n     former members of the airborne forces of the United States \n     Armed Forces warrant special expressions of the gratitude of \n     the American people as the airborne community celebrates \n     August 16, 2004, as the 64th anniversary of the first \n     official jump by the Army Parachute Test Platoon: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates August 16, 2004, as ``National Airborne \n     Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on Federal, State, and local administrators and the \n     people of the United States to observe ``National Airborne \n     Day'' with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                              S. Res. 357\n\n       Whereas community, migrant, public housing, and homeless \n     health centers are nonprofit, community owned and operated \n     health providers and are vital to the Nation's communities;\n       Whereas there are more than 1,000 such health centers \n     serving 15,000,000 people in over 3,500 communities in every \n     State and territory, spanning urban and rural communities in \n     all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, \n     and the Virgin Islands;\n       Whereas these health centers have provided cost-effective, \n     high-quality health care to the Nation's poor and medically \n     underserved (including the working poor, the uninsured, and \n     many high-risk and vulnerable populations), acting as a vital \n     safety net in the Nation's health delivery system, meeting \n     escalating health needs, and reducing health disparities;\n       Whereas these health centers provide care to individuals in \n     the United States who would otherwise lack access to health \n     care, including 1 of every 8 uninsured individuals, 1 of \n     every 9 Medicaid beneficiaries, 1 of every 7 people of color, \n     and 1 of every 9 rural Americans;\n       Whereas these health centers and other innovative programs \n     in primary and preventive care reach out to over 621,000 \n     homeless individuals and more than 709,000 migrant and \n     seasonal farm workers;\n       Whereas these health centers make health care responsive \n     and cost effective by integrating the delivery of primary \n     care with aggressive outreach, patient education, \n     translation, and enabling support services;\n       Whereas these health centers increase the use of preventive \n     health services such as immunizations, Pap smears, \n     mammograms, and glaucoma screenings;\n       Whereas in communities served by these health centers, \n     infant mortality rates have been reduced between 10 and 40 \n     percent;\n       Whereas these health centers are built by community \n     initiative;\n       Whereas Federal grants provide seed money that empowers \n     communities to find partners and resources and to recruit \n     doctors and needed health professionals;\n       Whereas Federal grants on average form 25 percent of such a \n     health center's budget, with the remainder provided by State \n     and local governments, Medicare, Medicaid, private \n     contributions, private insurance, and patient fees;\n       Whereas these health centers are community oriented and \n     patient focused;\n       Whereas these health centers tailor their services to fit \n     the special needs and priorities of communities, working \n     together with schools, businesses, churches, community \n     organizations, foundations, and State and local governments;\n       Whereas these health centers contribute to the health and \n     well-being of their communities by keeping children healthy \n     and in school and helping adults remain productive and on the \n     job;\n       Whereas these health centers engage citizen participation \n     and provide jobs for over 70,000 community residents; and\n       Whereas designating the week of August 8 through August 14, \n     2004, as ``National Health Center Week'' would raise \n     awareness of the health services provided by health centers: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of August 8 through August 14, \n     2004, as ``National Health Center Week''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe the \n     week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                              S. Res. 370\n\n       Whereas Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (also \n     known as AD/HD or ADD), is a chronic neurobiological \n     disorder, affecting both children and adults, that can \n     significantly interfere with an individual's ability to \n     regulate activity level, inhibit behavior, and attend to \n     tasks in developmentally appropriate ways;\n       Whereas AD/HD can cause devastating consequences, including \n     failure in school and the workplace, antisocial behavior, \n     encounters with the justice system, interpersonal \n     difficulties, and substance abuse;\n       Whereas AD/HD, the most extensively studied mental disorder \n     in children, affects an estimated 3 percent to 7 percent \n     (2,000,000) of young school-age children and an estimated 4 \n     percent (8,000,000) of adults across racial, ethnic, and \n     socioeconomic lines;\n       Whereas scientific studies clearly indicate that AD/HD runs \n     in families and suggest that genetic inheritance is an \n     important risk factor, with between 10 and 35 percent of \n     children with AD/HD having a first-degree relative with past \n     or present AD/HD, and with\n\n[[Page S7592]]\n\n     approximately 50 percent of parents who had AD/HD having a \n     child with the disorder;\n       Whereas despite the serious consequences that can manifest \n     in the family and life experiences of an individual with AD/\n     HD, studies indicate that less than 85 percent of adults with \n     the disorder are diagnosed and less than half of children and \n     adults with the disorder are receiving treatment;\n        Whereas poor and minority communities are particularly \n     underserved by AD/HD resources;\n       Whereas the Surgeon General, the American Medical \n     Association (AMA), the American Psychiatric Association, the \n     American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), \n     the American Psychological Association, the American Academy \n     of Pediatrics (AAP), the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention (CDC), and the National Institute of Mental \n     Health, among others, recognize the need for proper \n     diagnosis, education, and treatment of AD/HD;\n       Whereas the lack of public knowledge and understanding of \n     the disorder play a significant role in the overwhelming \n     numbers of undiagnosed and untreated cases of AD/HD, and the \n     dissemination of inaccurate, misleading information \n     contributes to the obstacles preventing diagnosis and \n     treatment of the disorder;\n        Whereas lack of knowledge, combined with the issue of \n     stigma associated with AD/HD, has a particularly detrimental \n     effect on the diagnosis and treatment of AD/HD;\n       Whereas there is a need to educate health care \n     professionals, employers, and educators about the disorder \n     and a need for well-trained mental health professionals \n     capable of conducting proper diagnosis and treatment \n     activities; and\n       Whereas studies by the National Institute of Mental Health \n     and others consistently reveal that through proper and \n     comprehensive diagnosis and treatment, the symptoms of AD/HD \n     can be substantially decreased and quality of life for the \n     individual can be improved: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 7, 2004, as ``National Attention \n     Deficit Disorder Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder \n     (AD/HD) as a major public health concern;\n       (3) encourages all people of the United States to find out \n     more about AD/HD and its supporting mental health services, \n     and to seek the appropriate treatment and support, if \n     necessary;\n       (4) expresses the sense of the Senate that the Federal \n     Government has a responsibility to--\n       (A) endeavor to raise public awareness about AD/HD; and\n       (B) continue to consider ways to improve access to, and the \n     quality of, mental health services dedicated to the purpose \n     of improving the quality of life for children and adults with \n     AD/HD; and\n       (5) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on Federal, State and local administrators and the \n     people of the United States to observe the day with \n     appropriate programs and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/06/senate-section/article/S7592-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7592-S7684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2005\n\n  On Wednesday, June 23 (legislative day of Tuesday, June 22), 2004, \nthe Senate passed S. 2400, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2400\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Department of Defense and Donald B. \n     Rice, Secretary of the Air Force on the basis that denying \n     the media the right to view the return of remains at Dover \n     Air Force Base does not violate the first amendment \n     guarantees of freedom of speech and of the press.\n\n[[Page S7606]]\n\n       (4) The United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia in that case cited the following two key Government \n     interests that are served by the Department of Defense \n     policy:\n       (A) Reducing the hardship on the families and friends of \n     the war dead, who may feel obligated to travel great \n     distances to attend arrival ceremonies at Dover Air Force \n     Base if such ceremonies were held.\n       (B) Protecting the privacy of families and friends of the \n     dead, who may not want media coverage of the unloading of \n     caskets at Dover Air Force Base.\n       (5) The Court also noted, in that case, that the bereaved \n     may be upset at the public display of the caskets of their \n     loved ones and that the policy gives the family the right to \n     grant or deny access to the media at memorial or funeral \n     services at the home base and that the policy is consistent \n     in its concern for families.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Department of Defense policy regarding no media coverage \n     of the transfer of the remains of deceased members of the \n     Armed Forces appropriately protects the privacy of the \n     members' families and friends of and is consistent with \n     United States constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech \n     and freedom of the press.\n\n     SEC. 367.

DRUG ERADICATION EFFORTS IN AFGHANISTAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States engaged in military action against \n     the Taliban-controlled Government of Afghanistan in 2001 in \n     direct response to the Taliban's support and aid to Al Qaeda.\n       (2) The military action against the Taliban in Afghanistan \n     was designed, in part, to disrupt the activities of, and \n     financial support for, terrorists.\n       (3) A greater percentage of the world's opium supply is now \n     produced in Afghanistan than before the Taliban banned the \n     cultivation or trade of opium.\n       (4) In 2004, more than two years after the Taliban was \n     forcefully removed from power, Afghanistan is supplying \n     approximately 75 percent of the world's heroin.\n       (5) The estimated value of the opium harvested in \n     Afghanistan in 2003 was $2,300,000,000.\n       (6) Some of the profits associated with opium harvested in \n     Afghanistan continue to fund terrorists and terrorist \n     organizations, including Al Qaeda, that seek to attack the \n     United States and United States interests.\n       (7) The global war on terror is and should remain our \n     Nation's highest national security priority.\n       (8) United States and Coalition counterdrug efforts in \n     Afghanistan have not yet produced significant results.\n       (9) There are indications of strong, direct connections \n     between terrorism and drug trafficking.\n       (10) The elimination of this funding source is critical to \n     making significant progress in the global war on terror.\n       (11) The President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, has stated \n     that opium production poses a significant threat to the \n     future of Afghanistan, and has established a plan of action \n     to deal with this threat.\n       (12) The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has \n     reported that Afghanistan is at risk of again becoming a \n     failed state if strong actions are not taken against \n     narcotics.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President should make the substantial reduction of \n     drug trafficking in Afghanistan a priority in the war on \n     terror;\n       (2) the Secretary of Defense should, in coordination with \n     the Secretary of State, work to a greater extent in \n     cooperation with the Government of Afghanistan and \n     international organizations involved in counterdrug \n     activities to assist in providing a secure environment for \n     counterdrug personnel in Afghanistan; and\n       (3) because the trafficking of narcotics is known to \n     support terrorist activities and contributes to the \n     instability of the Government of Afghanistan, additional \n     efforts should be made by the Armed Forces of the United \n     States, in conjunction with and in support of coalition \n     forces, to significantly reduce narcotics trafficking in \n     Afghanistan and neighboring countries, with particular focus \n     on those trafficking organizations with the closest links to \n     known terrorist organizations.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit \n     to Congress a report that describes--\n       (1) progress made towards substantially reducing the poppy \n     cultivation and heroin production capabilities in \n     Afghanistan; and\n       (2) the extent to which profits from illegal drug activity \n     in Afghanistan fund terrorist organizations and support \n     groups that seek to undermine the Government of Afghanistan.\n\n     SEC. 1057. HUMANE TREATMENT OF DETAINEES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) After World War II, the United States and its allies \n     created a new international legal order based on respect for \n     human rights. One of its fundamental tenets was a universal \n     prohibition on torture and ill treatment.\n       (2) On June 26, 2003, the International Day in Support of \n     Victims of Torture, President George W. Bush stated, ``The \n     United States is committed to the world-wide elimination of \n     torture and we are leading this fight by example. I call on \n     all governments to join with the United States and the \n     community of law-abiding nations in prohibiting, \n     investigating, and prosecuting all acts of torture and in \n     undertaking to prevent other cruel and unusual punishment.''.\n       (3) The United States is a party to the Geneva Conventions, \n     which prohibit torture, cruel treatment, or outrages upon \n     personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading \n     treatment, during armed conflict.\n       (4) The United States is a party to 2 treaties that \n     prohibit torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment \n     or punishment, as follows:\n       (A) The International Covenant on Civil and Political \n     Rights, done at New York December 16, 1966.\n       (B) The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman \n     or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, done at New York \n     December 10, 1984.\n       (5) The United States filed reservations to the treaties \n     described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (4) \n     stating that the United States considers itself bound to \n     prevent ``cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or \n     punishment'' to the extent that phrase means the cruel, \n     unusual, and inhumane treatment or punishment prohibited by \n     the 5th amendment, 8th amendment, or 14th amendment to the \n     Constitution.\n       (6) Army Regulation 190-8 entitled ``Enemy Prisoners of \n     War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other \n     Detainees'' provides that ``Inhumane treatment is a serious \n     and punishable violation under international law and the \n     Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). . . . All prisoners \n     will receive humane treatment without regard to race, \n     nationality, religion, political opinion, sex, or other \n     criteria. The following acts are prohibited: murder, torture, \n     corporal punishment, mutilation, the taking of hostages, \n     sensory deprivation, collective punishments, execution \n     without trial by proper authority, and all cruel and \n     degrading treatment. . . . All persons will be respected as \n     human beings. They will be protected against all acts of \n     violence to include rape, forced prostitution, assault and \n     theft, insults, public curiosity, bodily injury, and \n     reprisals of any kind. . . . This list is not exclusive.''.\n       (7) The Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogation of the \n     Department of the Army states that ``acts of violence or \n     intimidation, including physical or mental torture, threats, \n     insults, or exposure to inhumane treatment as a means of or \n     an aid to interrogation'' are ``illegal''.

Revelation of use of torture by U.S. personnel \n     will bring discredit upon the U.S. and its armed forces while \n     undermining domestic and international support for the war \n     effort.

COORDINATION OF USERRA WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE \n                   CODE OF 1986.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Employers of reservists called up for active duty are \n     required to treat them as if they are on a leave of absence \n     or furlough under the Uniformed Services Employment and \n     Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (in this section referred to \n     as ``USERRA'').\n       (2) USERRA does not require employers to pay reservists who \n     are on active duty, but many employers pay the reservists the \n     difference between their military stipends and their regular \n     salaries. Some employers provide this ``differential pay'' \n     for up to 3 years.\n       (3) For employee convenience, many of these employers also \n     allow deductions from the differential payments for \n     contributions to employer-provided retirement savings plans.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Internal Revenue Service should, to the extent it is \n     able within its authority, provide guidance consistent with \n     the goal of promoting and ensuring the validity of voluntary \n     differential pay arrangements, benefits payments, and \n     contributions to retirement savings plans related thereto.\n\n     SEC. 1076. AERIAL FIREFIGHTING EQUIPMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The National Interagency Fire Center does not possess \n     an adequate number of aircraft for use in aerial firefighting \n     and personnel at the Center rely on military aircraft to \n     provide such firefighting services.\n       (2) It is in the national security interest of the United \n     States for the National Interagency Fire Center to purchase \n     aircraft for use in aerial firefighting so that military \n     aircraft used for aerial firefighting may be available for \n     use by the Armed Forces.\n       (b) Authority To Purchase Aerial Firefighting Equipment.--\n     (1) The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to purchase 10 \n     aircraft, as described in paragraph (2), for the National \n     Interagency Fire Center for use in aerial firefighting.\n       (2) The aircraft referred to in paragraph (1) shall be--\n       (A) aircraft that are specifically designed and built for \n     aerial firefighting;\n       (B) certified by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation \n     Administration for use in aerial firefighting; and\n       (C) manufactured in a manner that is consistent with the \n     recommendations for aircraft used in aerial firefighting \n     contained in--\n       (i) the Blue Ribbon Panel Report to the Chief of the Forest \n     Service and the Director of the Bureau of Land Management \n     dated December 2002; and\n       (ii) the Safety Recommendation of the Chairman of the \n     National Transportation Safety Board related to aircraft used \n     in aerial firefighting dated April 23, 2004.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Secretary of Agriculture for fiscal \n     year 2005 such funds as may be necessary to purchase the 10 \n     aircraft described in subsection (b).\n\n     SEC. 1077. SENSE OF SENATE ON AMERICAN FORCES RADIO AND \n                   TELEVISION SERVICE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is the mission of the American Forces Radio and \n     Television Service to provide United States military \n     commanders overseas and at sea with a broadcast media \n     resource to effectively communicate Department of Defense, \n     Service-unique, theater, and local command information to \n     personnel under their commands and to provide United States \n     military members, Department of Defense civilians, and their \n     families stationed outside the continental United States and \n     at sea with the same type and quality of American radio and \n     television news, information, sports, and entertainment that \n     would be available to them if they were in the continental \n     United States.\n       (2) Key principles of American Forces Radio and Television \n     Service broadcasting policy, as outlined in Department of \n     Defense Regulation 5120.20R, are to ensure political \n     programming characterized by fairness and balance and to \n     provide a free flow of political programming from United \n     States commercial and public networks without manipulation or \n     censorship of any news content to the men and women of the \n     Armed Forces and their dependents.\n       (3) The stated policy of the American Forces Radio and \n     Television Service is to select programming that represents a \n     cross-section of popular American radio and television \n     offerings and to emulate stateside scheduling and programming \n     seen and heard in the United States.\n       (4) It is the policy of American Forces Radio and \n     Television Service to select news and public affairs programs \n     for airing that provide balance and diversity from available \n     nationally recognized program sources, including broadcast \n     and cable networks, Headquarters, American Forces Radio and \n     Television Service, the military departments, and other \n     government or public service agencies.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the mission statement and policies of the American \n     Forces Radio and Television Service appropriately state the \n     goal of maintaining equal opportunity balance with respect to \n     political programming and that the Secretary of Defense \n     should therefore ensure that these policies are fully being \n     implemented by developing appropriate methods of oversight to \n     ensure presentation of all sides of important public \n     questions with the fairness and balance envisioned by the \n     Department of Defense throughout the American Forces Radio \n     and Television Service system.\n\n     SEC. 1078. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON AMERICA'S NATIONAL WORLD WAR \n                   I MUSEUM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Liberty Memorial Museum in Kansas City, Missouri, \n     was built in 1926 in honor of those individuals who served in \n     World War I in defense of liberty and the Nation.\n       (2) The Liberty Memorial Association, a nonprofit \n     organization which originally built the Liberty Memorial \n     Museum, is responsible for the finances, operations, and \n     collections management of the Liberty Memorial Museum.\n       (3) The Liberty Memorial Museum is the only public museum \n     in the Nation that exists for the exclusive purpose of \n     interpreting the experiences of the United States and its \n     allies in the World War I years (1914-1918), both on the \n     battlefield and on the home front.\n       (4) The Liberty Memorial Museum project began after the \n     1918 Armistice through the efforts of a large-scale, grass-\n     roots civic and fundraising effort by the citizens and \n     veterans of the Kansas City metropolitan area. After the \n     conclusion of a national architectural design competition, \n     ground was broken in 1921, construction began in 1923, and \n     the Liberty Memorial Museum was opened to the public in 1926.\n       (5) In 1994, the Liberty Memorial Museum closed for a \n     massive restoration and expansion project. The restored \n     museum reopened to the public on Memorial Day, 2002, during a \n     gala rededication ceremony.\n       (6) Exhibits prepared for the original museum buildings \n     presaged the dramatic, underground expansion of core \n     exhibition gallery space, with over 30,000 square feet of new \n     interpretive and educational exhibits currently in \n     development. The new exhibits, along with an expanded \n     research library and archives, will more fully utilize the \n     many thousands of historical objects, books, maps, posters, \n     photographs, diaries, letters, and reminiscences of World War \n     I participants that are preserved for posterity in the \n     Liberty Memorial Museum's collections. The new core \n     exhibition is scheduled to open on Veterans Day, 2006.\n       (7) The City of Kansas City, the State of Missouri, and \n     thousands of private donors and philanthropic foundations \n     have contributed millions of dollars to build and later to \n     restore this national treasure. The Liberty Memorial Museum \n     continues to receive the strong support of residents from the \n     States of Missouri and Kansas and across the Nation.\n\n[[Page S7649]]\n\n       (8) Since the restoration and rededication of 2002, the \n     Liberty Memorial Museum has attracted thousands of visitors \n     from across the United States and many foreign countries.\n       (9) There remains a need to preserve in a museum setting \n     evidence of the honor, courage, patriotism, and sacrifice of \n     those Americans who offered their services and who gave their \n     lives in defense of liberty during World War I, evidence of \n     the roles of women and African Americans during World War I, \n     and evidence of other relevant subjects.\n       (10) The Liberty Memorial Museum seeks to educate a diverse \n     group of audiences through its comprehensive collection of \n     historical materials, emphasizing eyewitness accounts of the \n     participants on the battlefield and the home front and the \n     impact of World War I on individuals, then and now. The \n     Liberty Memorial Museum continues to actively acquire and \n     preserve such materials.\n       (11) A great opportunity exists to use the invaluable \n     resources of the Liberty Memorial Museum to teach the \n     ``Lessons of Liberty'' to the Nation's schoolchildren through \n     on-site visits, classroom curriculum development, distance \n     learning, and other educational initiatives.\n       (12) The Liberty Memorial Museum should always be the \n     Nation's museum of the national experience in the World War I \n     years (1914-1918), where people go to learn about this \n     critical period and where the Nation's history of this \n     monumental struggle will be preserved so that generations of \n     the 21st century may understand the role played by the United \n     States in the preservation and advancement of democracy, \n     freedom, and liberty in the early 20th century.\n       (13) This initiative to recognize and preserve the history \n     of the Nation's sacrifices in World War I will take on added \n     significance as the Nation approaches the centennial \n     observance of this event.\n       (14) It is fitting and proper to refer to the Liberty \n     Memorial Museum as ``America's National World War I Museum''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the Liberty Memorial Museum in Kansas City, \n     Missouri, including the museum's future and expanded \n     exhibits, collections, library, archives, and educational \n     programs, as ``America's National World War I Museum'';\n       (2) recognizes that the continuing collection, \n     preservation, and interpretation of the historical objects \n     and other historical materials held by the Liberty Memorial \n     Museum enhance the knowledge and understanding of the \n     Nation's people of the American and allied experience during \n     the World War I years (1914-1918), both on the battlefield \n     and on the home front;\n       (3) commends the ongoing development and visibility of \n     ``Lessons of Liberty'' educational outreach programs for \n     teachers and students throughout the Nation; and\n       (4) encourages the need for present generations to \n     understand the magnitude of World War I, how it shaped the \n     Nation, other countries, and later world events, and how the \n     sacrifices made then helped preserve liberty, democracy, and \n     other founding principles for generations to come.\n\n     SEC. 1079.

BROADCAST DECENCY ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2004.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2004''.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to increase \n     the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) authority to \n     fine for indecent broadcasts and prevent further relaxation \n     of the media ownership rules in order to stem the rise of \n     indecent programming.\n       (c) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since 1996 there has been significant consolidation in \n     the media industry, including:\n       (A) Radio.--Clear Channel Communications went from owning \n     43 radio stations prior to 1996 to over 1,200 as of January \n     2003; Cumulus Broadcasting, Inc. was established in 1997 and \n     owned 266 stations as of December 2003, making it the second-\n     largest radio ownership company in the country; and Infinity \n     Broadcasting Corporation went from owning 43 radio stations \n     prior to 1996 to over 185 stations as of June 2004;\n       (B) Television.--Viacom/CBS's national ownership of \n     television stations increased from 31.53 percent of United \n     States television households prior to 1996 to 38.9 percent in \n     2004; GE/NBC's national ownership of television stations \n     increased from 24.65 percent prior to 1996 to 33.56 percent \n     in 2004; News Corp./Fox's national ownership of television \n     stations increased from 22.05 percent prior to 1996 to 37.7 \n     percent in 2004;\n       (C) Media mergers.--In 2000, Viacom merged with CBS and \n     UPN; in 2002, GE/NBC merged with Telemundo Communications, \n     Inc. and in 2004 with Vivendi Universal Entertainment; in \n     2003 News Corp./Fox acquired a controlling interest in \n     DirecTV; in 2000, Time Warner, Inc. merged with America \n     Online.\n       (2) Over the same period that there has been significant \n     consolidation in the media industry, the number of indecency \n     complaints also has increased dramatically. The largest \n     owners of television and radio broadcast holdings have \n     received the greatest number of indecency complaints and the \n     largest fines, including:\n       (A) Over 80 percent of the fines proposed by the Federal \n     Communications Commission for indecent broadcasts were \n     against stations owned by two of the top three radio \n     companies. The top radio company alone accounts for over two-\n     thirds of the fines proposed by the FCC;\n       (B) Two of the largest fines proposed by the FCC were \n     against two of the top three radio companies;\n       (C) In 2004, the FCC received over 500,000 indecency \n     complaints in response to the Superbowl Halftime show aired \n     on CBS and produced by MTV, both of which are owned by \n     Viacom. This is the largest number of complaints ever \n     received by the FCC for a single broadcast;\n       (D) The number of indecency complaints increased from 111 \n     in 2000 to 240,350 in 2003;\n       (3) Media conglomerates do not consider or reflect local \n     community standards.\n       (A) The FCC has no record of a television station owned by \n     one of the big four networks (Viacom/CBS, Disney/ABC, News \n     Corp./Fox or GE/NBC) pre-empting national programming for \n     failing to meet community standards;\n\n[[Page S7650]]\n\n       (B) FCC records show that non-network owned stations have \n     often rejected national network programming found to be \n     indecent and offensive to local community standards;\n       (C) A letter from an owned and operated station manager to \n     a viewer stated that programming decisions are made by \n     network headquarters and not the local owned and operated \n     television station management;\n       (D) The Parents Television Council has found that the \n     ``losers'' of network ownership ``are the local communities \n     whose standards of decency are being ignored;''\n       (4) The Senate Commerce Committee has found that the \n     current fines do not deter indecent broadcast because they \n     are merely the cost of doing business for large media \n     companies. Therefore, in order to prevent the continued rise \n     of indecency violations, the FCC's authority for indecency \n     fines should be increased and further media consolidation \n     should be prevented.\n       (d) Increase in Penalties for Obscene, Indecent, and \n     Profane Broadcast.--Section 503(b)(2) of the Communications \n     Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 503(b)(2)) is amended.--\n       (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (C) and (D) as \n     subparagraphs (D) and (E), respectively;\n       (2) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following new \n     subparagraph:\n       ``(C) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if the violator \n     is--\n       ``(i)(I) a broadcast station licensee or permittee; or\n       ``(II) an applicant for any broadcast license, permit, \n     certificate, or other instrument or authorization issued by \n     the Commission; and\n       ``(ii) determined by the Commission under paragraph (1) to \n     have broadcast obscene, indecent, or profane language, the \n     amount of any forfeiture penalty determined under this \n     subsection shall not exceed $275,000 for each violation or \n     each day of a continuing violation, except that the amount \n     assessed for any continuing violation shall not exceed a \n     total of $3,000,000 for any single act or failure to act.''; \n     and\n       (3) in subparagraph (D), as redesignated by paragraph (1), \n     by striking ``subparagraph (A) or (B)'' and inserting \n     ``subparagraph (A), (B), or (C)''.\n       (e) New Broadcast Media Ownership Rules Suspended.--\n       (1) Suspension.--Subject to the provisions of \n     paragraphs(d)(2), the broadcast media ownership rules adopted \n     by the Federal Communications Commission on June 2, 2003, \n     pursuant to its proceeding on broadcast media ownership \n     rules, Report and Order FCC-03-127, published at 68 FR 46286, \n     August 5, 2003, shall be invalid and without legal effect.\n       (2) Clarification.--The provisions of paragraph (1) shall \n     not supersede the amendments made by section 629 of the \n     Miscellaneous Appropriations and Offsets Act, 2004 (Public \n     Law 108-199).\n       (f) Additional Factors in Indecency Penalties; Exception.--\n     Section 503(b)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n     U.S.C. 503(b)(2)), is further amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       ``(F) In the case of a violation in which the violator is \n     determined by the Commission under paragraph (1) to have \n     uttered obscene, indecent, or profane material, the \n     Commission shall take into account, in addition to the \n     matters described in subparagraph (E), the following factors \n     with respect to the degree of culpability of the violator:\n       ``(i) Whether the material uttered by the violator was live \n     or recorded, scripted or unscripted.\n       ``(ii) Whether the violator had a reasonable opportunity to \n     review recorded or scripted programming or had a reasonable \n     basis to believe live or unscripted programming would contain \n     obscene, indecent, or profane material.\n       ``(iii) If the violator originated live or unscripted \n     programming, whether a time delay blocking mechanism was \n     implemented for the programming.\n       ``(iv) The size of the viewing or listening audience of the \n     programming.\n       ``(v) Whether the obscene incident or profane language was \n     within live programming not produced by the station licensee \n     or permitee.\n       ``(vi) The size of the market.\n       ``(vii) Whether the violation occurred during a children's \n     television program (as such term is used in the Children's \n     Television Programming Policy referenced in section \n     73.4050(c) of the Commission's regulations (47 C.F.R. \n     73.4050(c)) or during a television program rated TVY, TVY7, \n     TVY7FV, or TVG under the TV Parental Guidelines as such \n     ratings were approved by the Commission in implementation of \n     section 551 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Video \n     Programming Ratings, Report and Order, CS Docket No. 97-55, \n     13 F.C.C.

CHILDREN'S PROTECTION FROM VIOLENT PROGRAMMING \n                   ACT.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Children's Protection from Violent Programming Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Television influences children's perception of the \n     values and behavior that are common and acceptable in \n     society.\n       (2) Broadcast television, cable television, and video \n     programming are--\n       (A) uniquely pervasive presences in the lives of all \n     American children; and\n       (B) readily accessible to all American children.\n       (3) Violent video programming influences children, as does \n     indecent programming.\n       (4) There is empirical evidence that children exposed to \n     violent video programming at a young age have a higher \n     tendency to engage in violent and aggressive behavior later \n     in life than those children not so exposed.\n       (5) There is empirical evidence that children exposed to \n     violent video programming have a greater tendency to assume \n     that acts of violence are acceptable behavior and therefore \n     to imitate such behavior.\n       (6) There is empirical evidence that children exposed to \n     violent video programming have an increased fear of becoming \n     a victim of violence, resulting in increased self-protective \n     behaviors and increased mistrust of others.\n       (7) There is a compelling governmental interest in limiting \n     the negative influences of violent video programming on \n     children.\n       (8) There is a compelling governmental interest in \n     channeling programming with violent content to periods of the \n     day when children are not likely to comprise a substantial \n     portion of the television audience.\n       (9) A significant amount of violent programming that is \n     readily accessible to minors remains unrated specifically for \n     violence and therefore cannot be blocked solely on the basis \n     of its violent content.\n       (10) Age-based ratings that do not include content rating \n     for violence do not allow parents to block programming based \n     solely on violent content thereby rendering ineffective any \n     technology-based blocking mechanism designed to limit violent \n     video programming.\n       (11) The most recent study of the television ratings system \n     by the Kaiser Family Foundation concludes that 79 percent of \n     violent programming is not specifically rated for violence.\n       (12) Technology-based solutions, such as the V-chip, may be \n     helpful in protecting some children, but cannot achieve the \n     compelling governmental interest in protecting all children \n     from violent programming when parents are only able to block \n     programming that has, in fact, been rated for violence.\n       (13) Restricting the hours when violent programming can be \n     shown protects the interests of children whose parents are \n     unavailable, unable to supervise their children's viewing \n     behavior, do not have the benefit of technology-based \n     solutions, are unable to afford the costs of technology-based \n     solutions, or are unable to determine the content of those \n     shows that are only subject to age-based ratings.\n       (14) After further study, pursuant to a rulemaking, the \n     Federal Communications Commission may conclude that content-\n     based ratings and blocking technology do not effectively \n     protect children from the harm of violent video programming.\n       (15) If the Federal Communications Commission reaches the \n     conclusion described in paragraph (14), the channeling of \n     violent video programming will be the least restrictive means \n     of limiting the exposure of children to the harmful \n     influences of violent video programming.\n\n     SEC. 1086. ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS OF CURRENT RATING \n                   SYSTEM FOR VIOLENCE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF V-CHIP \n                   IN BLOCKING VIOLENT PROGRAMMING.\n\n       (a) Report.--The Federal Communications Commission shall--\n       (1) assess the effectiveness of measures to require \n     television broadcasters and multichannel video programming \n     distributors (as defined in section 602(13) of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 522(13)) to rate and \n     encode programming that could be blocked by parents using the \n     V-chip undertaken under section 715 of the Communications Act \n     of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 715) and under subsections (w) and (x) of \n     section 303 of that Act (47 U.S.C. 303(w) and (x)) in \n     accomplishing the purposes for which they were enacted; and\n       (2) report its findings to the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation of the United States Senate and \n     the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the United States \n     House of Representatives, within 12 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter.\n\n[[Page S7651]]\n\n       (b) Action.--If the Commission finds at any time, as a \n     result of its ongoing assessment under subsection (a), that \n     the measures referred to in subsection (a)(1) are \n     insufficiently effective, then the Commission shall complete \n     a rulemaking within 270 days after the date on which the \n     Commission makes that finding to prohibit the distribution of \n     violent video programming during the hours when children are \n     reasonably likely to comprise a substantial portion of the \n     audience.\n       (c) Definitions.--Any term used in this section that is \n     defined in section 715 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n     U.S.C. 715), or in regulations under that section, has the \n     same meaning as when used in that section or in those \n     regulations.\n\n     SEC. 1087.

SENSE OF SENATE ON RESOURCE CENTER FOR ENERGY \n                   EMPLOYEES UNDER ENERGY EMPLOYEE OCCUPATIONAL \n                   ILLNESS COMPENSATION PROGRAM IN WESTERN NEW \n                   YORK AND WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA REGION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) New York has 36 current or former Department of Energy \n     facilities involved in nuclear weapons production-related \n     activities statewide, mostly atomic weapons employer \n     facilities, and 14 such facilities in western New York. \n     Despite having one of the greatest concentrations of such \n     facilities in the United States, western New York, and \n     abutting areas of Pennsylvania, continue to be severely \n     underserved by the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \n     Compensation Program under the Energy Employees Occupational \n     Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (title XXXVI of the \n     Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2001 (as enacted into law by Public Law 106-398); 42 \n     U.S.C. 7384 et seq.).\n       (2) The establishment of a permanent resource center in \n     western New York would represent a substantial step toward \n     improving services under the Energy Employees Occupational \n     Illness Compensation Program for energy employees in this \n     region.\n       (3) The number of claims submitted to the Department under \n     subtitle B of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \n     Compensation Program Act of 2000 from the western New York \n     region, including western Pennsylvania, exceeds the number of \n     such claims filed at resource centers in Hanford, Washington, \n     Portsmouth, Ohio, Los Alamos, New Mexico, the Nevada Test \n     Site, Nevada, the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site, \n     Colorado, the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, Idaho, \n     and the Amchitka Test Site, Alaska.\n       (4) Energy employees in the western New York region, \n     including western Pennsylvania, deserve assistance under \n     subtitle B of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \n     Compensation Program Act of 2000 commensurate with the \n     assistance provided energy employees at other locations in \n     the United States.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate to \n     encourage the Office of Ombudsman of the Department of Labor, \n     as established by section 3669 of the Energy Employees \n     Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (as \n     amended by section 3163 of this Act), to--\n       (1) review the availability of assistance under subtitle B \n     of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation \n     Program Act of 2000 for energy employees in the western New \n     York region, including western Pennsylvania; and\n       (2) recommend a location in that region for a resource \n     center to provide such assistance to such energy employees.\n\n     SEC. 3156.

INCLUSION OF CERTAIN FORMER NUCLEAR WEAPONS \n                   PROGRAM WORKERS IN SPECIAL EXPOSURE COHORT \n                   UNDER THE ENERGY EMPLOYEES OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS \n                   COMPENSATION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Energy workers at the former Mallinkrodt facilities \n     (including the St. Louis downtown facility and the Weldon \n     Springs facility) were exposed to levels of radionuclides and \n     radioactive materials that were much greater than the current \n     maximum allowable Federal standards.\n       (2) The Mallinkrodt workers at the St. Louis site were \n     exposed to excessive levels of airborne uranium dust relative \n     to the standards in effect during the time, and many workers \n     were exposed to 200 times the preferred levels of exposure.\n       (3)(A) The chief safety officer for the Atomic Energy \n     Commission during the Mallinkrodt-St. Louis operations \n     described the facility as 1 of the 2 worst plants with \n     respect to worker exposures.\n       (B) Workers were excreting in excess of a milligram of \n     uranium per day causing kidney damage.\n       (C) A recent epidemiological study found excess levels of \n     nephritis and kidney cancer from inhalation of uranium dusts.\n       (4) The Department of Energy has admitted that those \n     Mallinkrodt workers were subjected to risks and had their \n     health endangered as a result of working with these highly \n     radioactive materials.\n       (5) The Department of Energy reported that workers at the \n     Weldon Springs feed materials plant handled plutonium and \n     recycled uranium, which are highly radioactive.\n       (6) The National Institute of Occupational Safety and \n     Health admits that--\n       (A) the operations at the St. Louis downtown site consisted \n     of intense periods of processing extremely high levels of \n     radionuclides; and\n       (B) the Institute has virtually no personal monitoring data \n     for Mallinkrodt workers prior to 1948.\n       (7) The National Institute of Occupational Safety and \n     Health has informed claimants and their survivors at those 3 \n     Mallinkrodt sites that if they are not interviewed as a part \n     of the dose reconstruction process, it--\n       (A) would hinder the ability of the Institute to conduct \n     dose reconstruction for the claimant; and\n       (B) may result in a dose reconstruction that incompletely \n     or inaccurately estimates the radiation dose to which the \n     energy employee named in the claim had been exposed.\n       (8) Energy workers at the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant (also \n     known as the Burlington Atomic Energy Commission Plant and \n     the Iowa Ordnance Plant) between 1947 and 1975 were exposed \n     to levels of radionuclides and radioactive material, \n     including enriched uranium, plutonium, tritium, and depleted \n     uranium, in addition to beryllium and photon radiation, that \n     are greater than the current maximum Federal standards for \n     exposure.\n       (9) According to the National Institute of Occupational \n     Safety and Health--\n       (A) between 1947 and 1975, no records, including bioassays \n     or air samples, have been located that indicate any \n     monitoring occurred of internal doses of radiation to which \n     workers described in paragraph (8) were exposed;\n       (B) between 1947 and 1955, no records, including dosimetry \n     badges, have been located to indicate that any monitoring \n     occurred of the external doses of radiation to which such \n     workers were exposed;\n       (C) between 1955 and 1962, records indicate that only 8 to \n     23 workers in a workforce of over 1,000 were monitored for \n     external radiation doses; and\n       (D) between 1970 and 1975, the high point of screening at \n     the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant, only 25 percent of the \n     workforce was screened for exposure to external radiation.\n       (10) The Department of Health and Human Services published \n     the first notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the \n     Special Exposure Cohort on June 25, 2002, and the final rule \n     published on May 26, 2004.\n       (11) Many of those former workers have died while waiting \n     for the proposed rule to be finalized, including some \n     claimants who were waiting for dose reconstruction to be \n     completed.\n       (12) Because of the aforementioned reasons, including the \n     serious lack of records and the death of many potential \n     claimants, it is not feasible to conduct valid dose \n     reconstructions for the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant facility \n     or the Mallinkrodt facilities.\n       (b) Inclusion of Certain Former Workers in Cohort.--Section \n     3621(14) of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \n     Compensation Program Act of 2000 (title XXXVI of the Floyd D. \n     Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2001 (as enacted into law by Public Law 106-398); 42 U.S.C. \n     7384l(14)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subparagraph (C) as subparagraph (D); \n     and\n       (2) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following new \n     subparagraph (C):\n       ``(C) Subject to the provisions of section 3612A and \n     section 3146(e) of the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2005, the employee was so employed for a number \n     of work days aggregating at least 45 workdays at a facility \n     operated under contract to the Department of Energy by \n     Mallinkrodt Incorporated or its successors (including the St. \n     Louis downtown or `Destrehan' facility during any of calendar \n     years 1942 through 1958 and the Weldon Springs feed materials \n     plant facility during any of calendar years 1958 through \n     1966), or at a facility operated by the Department of Energy \n     or under contract by Mason & Hangar-Silas Mason Company at \n     the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant (also known as the Burlington \n     Atomic Energy Commission Plant and the Iowa Ordnance Plant) \n     during any of the calendar years 1947 through 1975, and \n     during the employment--\n       ``(i)(I) was monitored through the use of dosimetry badges \n     for exposure at the plant of the external parts of an \n     employee's body to radiation;

These authorities can carry out \n     their responsibilities more effectively with greater Federal \n     assistance.\n       (4) Existing Federal law is inadequate to address this \n     problem.\n       (5) The prominent characteristic of a violent crime \n     motivated by bias is that it devastates not just the actual \n     victim and the family and friends of the victim, but \n     frequently savages the community sharing the traits that \n     caused the victim to be selected.\n       (6) Such violence substantially affects interstate commerce \n     in many ways, including--\n       (A) by impeding the movement of members of targeted groups \n     and forcing such members to move across State lines to escape \n     the incidence or risk of such violence; and\n       (B) by preventing members of targeted groups from \n     purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining \n     employment, or participating in other commercial activity.\n       (7) Perpetrators cross State lines to commit such violence.\n       (8) Channels, facilities, and instrumentalities of \n     interstate commerce are used to facilitate the commission of \n     such violence.\n       (9) Such violence is committed using articles that have \n     traveled in interstate commerce.\n       (10) For generations, the institutions of slavery and \n     involuntary servitude were defined by the race, color, and \n     ancestry of those held in bondage. Slavery and involuntary \n     servitude were enforced, both prior to and after the adoption \n     of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, through widespread public and private violence \n     directed at persons because of their race, color, or \n     ancestry, or perceived race, color, or ancestry. Accordingly, \n     eliminating racially motivated violence is an important means \n     of eliminating, to the extent possible, the badges, \n     incidents, and relics of slavery and involuntary servitude.\n       (11) Both at the time when the 13th, 14th, and 15th \n     amendments to the Constitution of the United States were \n     adopted, and continuing to date, members of certain religious \n     and national origin groups were and are perceived to be \n     distinct ``races''. Thus, in order to eliminate, to the \n     extent possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of \n     slavery, it is necessary to prohibit assaults on the basis of \n     real or perceived religions or national origins, at least to \n     the extent such religions or national origins were regarded \n     as races at the time of the adoption of the 13th, 14th, and \n     15th amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n\n[[Page S7682]]\n\n       (12) Federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes \n     motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and local \n     authorities to work together as partners in the investigation \n     and prosecution of such crimes.\n       (13) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is \n     sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in nature as \n     to warrant Federal assistance to States and local \n     jurisdictions.\n\n     SEC. 3403. DEFINITION OF HATE CRIME.\n\n       In this title, the term ``hate crime'' has the same meaning \n     as in section 280003(a) of the Violent Crime Control and Law \n     Enforcement Act of 1994 (28 U.S.C. 994 note).\n\n     SEC. 3404. SUPPORT FOR CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS AND \n                   PROSECUTIONS BY STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT \n                   OFFICIALS.\n\n       (a) Assistance Other Than Financial Assistance.--\n       (1) In general.--At the request of a law enforcement \n     official of a State or Indian tribe, the Attorney General may \n     provide technical, forensic, prosecutorial, or any other form \n     of assistance in the criminal investigation or prosecution of \n     any crime that--\n       (A) constitutes a crime of violence (as defined in section \n     16 of title 18, United States Code);\n       (B) constitutes a felony under the laws of the State or \n     Indian tribe; and\n       (C) is motivated by prejudice based on the race, color, \n     religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or \n     disability of the victim, or is a violation of the hate crime \n     laws of the State or Indian tribe.\n       (2) Priority.--In providing assistance under paragraph (1), \n     the Attorney General shall give priority to crimes committed \n     by offenders who have committed crimes in more than 1 State \n     and to rural jurisdictions that have difficulty covering the \n     extraordinary expenses relating to the investigation or \n     prosecution of the crime.\n       (b) Grants.--\n       (1) In general.--The Attorney General may award grants to \n     assist State, local, and Indian law enforcement officials \n     with the extraordinary expenses associated with the \n     investigation and prosecution of hate crimes.\n       (2) Office of justice programs.--In implementing the grant \n     program, the Office of Justice Programs shall work closely \n     with the funded jurisdictions to ensure that the concerns and \n     needs of all affected parties, including community groups and \n     schools, colleges, and universities, are addressed through \n     the local infrastructure developed under the grants.\n       (3)  Application.--\n       (A) In general.--Each State that desires a grant under this \n     subsection shall submit an application to the Attorney \n     General at such time, in such manner, and accompanied by or \n     containing such information as the Attorney General shall \n     reasonably require.\n       (B) Date for submission.--Applications submitted pursuant \n     to subparagraph (A) shall be submitted during the 60-day \n     period beginning on a date that the Attorney General shall \n     prescribe.\n       (C) Requirements.--A State or political subdivision of a \n     State or tribal official applying for assistance under this \n     subsection shall--\n       (i) describe the extraordinary purposes for which the grant \n     is needed;\n       (ii) certify that the State, political subdivision, or \n     Indian tribe lacks the resources necessary to investigate or \n     prosecute the hate crime;\n       (iii) demonstrate that, in developing a plan to implement \n     the grant, the State, political subdivision, or tribal \n     official has consulted and coordinated with nonprofit, \n     nongovernmental victim services programs that have experience \n     in providing services to victims of hate crimes; and\n       (iv) certify that any Federal funds received under this \n     subsection will be used to supplement, not supplant, non-\n     Federal funds that would otherwise be available for \n     activities funded under this subsection.\n       (4) Deadline.--An application for a grant under this \n     subsection shall be approved or disapproved by the Attorney \n     General not later than 30 business days after the date on \n     which the Attorney General receives the application.\n       (5) Grant amount.--A grant under this subsection shall not \n     exceed $100,000 for any single jurisdiction within a 1 year \n     period.\n       (6) Report.--Not later than December 31, 2005, the Attorney \n     General shall submit to Congress a report describing the \n     applications submitted for grants under this subsection, the \n     award of such grants, and the purposes for which the grant \n     amounts were expended.\n       (7) Authorization of appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this subsection $5,000,000 \n     for each of fiscal years 2005 and 2006.\n\n     SEC. 3405.

Mr. President, over the course of the next several days, \na number of unkind things are likely to be said about class action \nlawsuits, usually by people who do not support this legislation which \nis before us.\n  I simply suggest that some of the criticism we are going to hear is \nmerited, but, quite frankly, some of it is not. The legal process that \nwe call class action can be traced back to the old English courts of \nchancery.\n  Despite the criticism leveled at class action lawsuits today, these \nlawsuits frequently have served a public good. They have proven a \npowerful weapon against unscrupulous or reckless businesses, \ndiscouraging those businesses from selling dangerous products or from \ncheating customers.\n  Class action lawsuits reduce the likelihood that rogue companies can \nharm thousands of innocent people, confident in the belief that none of \nthose people could ever afford to hold those companies accountable in \ncourt for their misdeeds.\n  There are many examples over time where the bad guys were caught in \nthe act, where they were taken to court and where they were ordered to \npay up.\n  The film ``Erin Brockovich'' tells a story about one such time. Not \nlong ago I picked up a video at Blockbuster of the film starring Julie \nRoberts in the title role that some of us may have seen. The film tells \nthe story of how one woman convinced hundreds of people residing in a \nplace called Hinkley, CA, to join in a lawsuit. Together, they sued a \nutility company that was making people sick by polluting their water \nsupply. Erin Brockovich's leadership won damages of $333 million for \nthe victims of that pollution. That true story is just one example of \nthe good that class action litigation can accomplish.\n  While I will not take the time this evening to talk about those other \nexamples, let me say there are plenty of them. Unfortunately, though, \nthere are also a growing number of examples that are not as uplifting \nor not as inspiring as the tale told in ``Erin Brockovich.''\n  Let me mention several of those, too. Ironically, one of them also \ninvolves Blockbuster. That company was sued over its policy of charging \ncustomers for overdue rentals. The result was that plaintiffs, of which \nI may unknowingly have been one, will get two free movie rentals and a \ndollar-off coupon. Meanwhile, attorneys received more than $9 million \nin fees and expenses.\n  Let me also mention Poland Spring. Poland Spring, if you are not \naware of it, is a bottled water company. They were sued a couple of \nyears ago in a place called Kane County, IL. Allegedly, the company's \nwater was not pure and did not come from a spring. During the course of \nlitigation, Poland Spring settled. The consumers alleging that they had \nspent their money on a product they did not actually receive were not \ncompensated. Instead, they were awarded coupons which they could apply \ntoward the purchase of the same Poland Spring water of which they \noriginally weren't happy. The attorneys who negotiated the settlement \non their behalf meanwhile were awarded $1.35 million. Poland Spring \nitself admitted no wrongdoing and has no plans, at least to my \nknowledge, to change the way they bottle and market their water.\n  Here is another one: General Mills was sued because an unapproved \nfood additive apparently was used in some oats that were used to make \nCheerios. Although I am told there was no evidence of customer injury, \na settlement was reached in the class action lawsuit. It provided for \n$1.75 million in fees for the plaintiffs' attorneys. The plaintiffs? \nThey received a coupon for more Cheerios.\n\n  In another class action suit involving Chase Manhattan Bank, \nplaintiffs' attorneys collected, I am told, over $4 million. The \nplaintiffs? They could collect 33 cents apiece if they were willing to \npony up the money for a postage stamp.\n  With the next one, I think it may actually get worse. In a different \nclass action lawsuit against the Bank of Boston over escrow accounts, \nplaintiffs apparently didn't win a dime. In fact, their accounts were \ndebited to help pay attorneys' fees of $8.5 million.\n  Let me mention just one more. A couple of years ago, Intel was taken \ninto court in I believe Madison County, IL, for asserting that the \ncompany's Pentium IV chips were faster than the company's Pentium III \nchips.\n  Let me say that I have no idea which chip is faster. I do have a \nhunch, though, that the Madison County Courthouse probably isn't the \nbest forum in which to make that determination. For that matter, \nneither were any of the other local courts in which the previous five \ncases that I have mentioned here were brought.\n  Don't get me wrong. Class action lawsuits are still being brought for \nnoble purposes that none of us would question for a minute. Last month, \nin fact, a class of 1.6 million current and former female Wal-Mart \nemployees alleging gender discrimination at that company were certified \nas a class. Ironically, I believe it was in a Federal court in \nCalifornia.\n  There is a growing phenomena, however, that is troubling, at least to \nme and I suspect to other fairminded people, including, I would be \nwilling to bet, a number of plaintiffs' attorneys. We have witnessed \nthe emergence in different parts of America of something called magnet \ncourts. Oftentimes, they are county courts with locally elected judges \nand a reputation for verdicts that can put the fear of God in companies \nwhen cases are filed in one of them. Once a plaintiffs' class is \ncertified in one of those courts, the companies generally realize that \ntheir goose is about to be cooked and the work of reaching a settlement \nbegins in earnest.\n  The attorneys who in many cases assembled the plaintiff class of \naggrieved consumers from across the country oftentimes make out pretty \nwell in those settlements. As you might imagine from the examples I \nhave cited above, the people those attorneys represent sometimes do \nnot.\n  Those who are supporting the legislation before the Senate this \nevening do so in the belief somebody needs to do something about the \ngrowing trend toward forum shopping we are witnessing around the \ncountry.\n  In addition, somebody needs to do so while preserving access to the \ncourts when people are harmed. My colleagues, that somebody is us.\n  The legislation before the Senate tonight, the Class Action Fairness \nAct, does not get rid of class action lawsuits. And it should not. For \nyears, they have been an efficient way for small and large groups of \nconsumers who have been harmed or shortchanged by some product or \nservice to pursue legislation against the company, when those consumers \nlack the wherewithal to pursue justice on their own.\n  What the legislation now before the Senate seeks to do is ensure \nclass action lawsuits that are national in scope are decided in Federal \ncourts. When the bulk of plaintiffs comes from across America, a \ndecision can have an impact on all or most of the 50 States. Federal \njudges, not State, not county judges, should hear those cases more \noften than not.\n  These issues are not new. They have been the subject of a number of \ncongressional hearings over the years. These issues have been debated \nand voted on in the relevant committees in both the House and the \nSenate. These issues have been debated in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and last year the House approved and sent to the Senate \na bill that sought to address the concerns we are raising this evening.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee reported out a more balanced bill, I \nbelieve, than the one we received from the House last year. That Senate \nbill was further improved through bipartisan negotiations last fall \nafter efforts to proceed to class action fell one vote short in the \nSenate.\n  It will come as no surprise that not everyone likes the measure \nbefore the Senate this evening. As is often the case with highly \ncontentious issues,\n\n[[Page S7686]]\n\nsome would say this bill goes too far. Frankly, there are others who \nsay it does not go far enough. The latter contend, for example, this is \nnot real tort reform. They are right. It is court reform. It attempts \nto close the gaping loophole in Federal law.\n  That loophole allows the plaintiffs from one State to be tried in a \nState or county court of another State on matters that have national \nimplications. That loophole also allows those cases to be heard by \njudges who are locally elected and whose elections and reelections are \nsupported at least in part by some of the very same plaintiffs' \nattorneys bringing cases before those judges against out-of-State \ndefendants.\n  Let me take a moment or two to be clear about what this bill does and \ndoes not do. This legislation does not limit the damages that can be \nawarded in class action lawsuits. It does not eliminate punitive \ndamages. It does not mention joint and several liability. In fact, even \nif this bill is adopted, a majority of class action lawsuits will still \nbe heard in State courts. For example, cases with fewer than 100 \nplaintiffs will be heard in State courts. The same holds true for cases \ninvolving less than $5 million, as well as for cases where two-thirds \nor more of the plaintiffs are from the same State as the defendant.\n  Federal judges would also have the discretion to keep cases in State \ncourts where as few as one-third of the plaintiffs are from the same \nState as the defendants.\n  That is not all. This bill includes what we call a local controversy \nexception. That local controversy exception will leave in State court \nclass actions with multiple defendants as long as one of the primary \ndefendants is local. That provision is intended to ensure State courts \ncan continue to preside over local controversies even though plaintiffs \nmay name an out-of-State defendant, such as a parent company.\n  This bill is an improvement, at least in my judgment, over the House \nbill in some other ways, too. The House bill is retroactive. The Senate \nbill is not. The House bill allows defendants to file appeals of class \ncertifications that would unnecessarily delay a plaintiff's day in \ncourt. The Senate bill does not. The House bill allows defendants to \nhave multiple bites out of the apple and continue to appeal decisions \nby judges to keep cases in State court. The Senate bill does not.\n  Unlike the House bill, the measure before the Senate allows lead \nplaintiffs, especially those in civil rights cases, to receive a \ngreater payment that is reflective of the higher and riskier profile \nthey have assumed.\n  Other provisions have been adopted as well. In settlements where \ncoupons were awarded to plaintiffs, the fees to their attorneys are \nlinked directly under this bill to the coupons that are actually \nredeemed, not just issued. In addition, Federal judges may direct that \nthe value of unredeemed coupons be donated to charity.\n  These and other changes have caused several of our colleagues, \nespecially on our side of the aisle, who had previously opposed class \naction legislation, to support the bill that is before the Senate \ntonight.\n  But Members of the legislative branch are not the only ones who \napparently have had a change of heart. Back in 1999, the Federal \njudiciary registered its opposition to a previous version of the Class \nAction Fairness Act through a letter the judicial conference sent to \nHenry Hyde who was then the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. \nAnd why? Largely because Federal judges fear the bill could well flood \nFederal courts with class action cases that otherwise would be heard in \nState or in local courts. Today, that view has changed as the \nlegislation has undergone some of the changes we have been talking \nabout this evening.\n  The Federal judiciary no longer opposes class action reform. I invite \nmy colleagues to read those views for themselves. They are contained in \nthis letter from the Judicial Conference which I hold in my hand.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Judicial Conference of the\n\n\n                                                 United States\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 25, 2003.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for your letters of April 9, \n     2003, and April 11, 2003. In those letters, you requested \n     that the Judicial Conference provide the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee with legislative language implementing the Judicial \n     Conference's March 2003 recommendations on class-action \n     litigation and the views of the Conference on S. 274, the \n     ``Class Action Fairness Act of 2003,'' as reported by the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee on April 11, 2003.\n       As you know, at its March 18, 2003, session, the Judicial \n     Conference adopted the following resolution:\n       That the Judicial Conference recognize that the use of \n     minimal diversity of citizenship may be appropriate to the \n     maintenance of significant multi-state class action \n     litigation in the federal courts, while continuing to oppose \n     class action legislation that contains jurisdictional \n     provisions that are similar to those in the bills introduced \n     in the 106th and 107th Congresses. If Congress determines \n     that certain class actions should be brought within the \n     original and removal jurisdiction of the federal courts on \n     the basis of minimal diversity of citizenship and an \n     aggregation of claims, Congress should be encouraged to \n     include sufficient limitations and threshold requirements so \n     that the federal courts are not unduly burdened and states' \n     jurisdiction over in-state class actions is left undisturbed, \n     such as by employing provisions to raise the jurisdictional \n     threshold and to fashion exceptions to such jurisdiction that \n     would preserve a role for the state courts in the handling of \n     in-state class actions. Such exceptions for in-state class \n     actions may appropriately include such factors as whether \n     substantially all members of the class are citizens of a \n     single state, the relationship of the defendants to the forum \n     state, or whether the claims arise from death, personal \n     injury, or physical property damage within the state. \n     Further, the Conference should continue to explore additional \n     approaches to the consolidation and coordination of \n     overlapping or duplicative class actions that do not unduly \n     intrude on state courts or burden federal courts.\n       S. 274, as reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee, \n     generally provides for federal jurisdiction of a class action \n     based on minimal diversity of citizenship if the matter in \n     controversy exceeds the sum of $5 million, exclusive of \n     interest and costs. (S. 274 as introduced established a $2 \n     million minimum amount in controversy.) The bill also now \n     permits a federal district court, in the interests of \n     justice, to decline to exercise jurisdiction over a class \n     action in which greater than one-third but less than two-\n     thirds of the members of all proposed plaintiff classes in \n     the aggregate and the primary defendants are citizens of the \n     state in which the action was originally filed. The court \n     would be required to consider five specified factors when \n     exercising this discretion. (This discretionary provision was \n     not included in the bill as introduced.)\n       In addition, S. 274 as reported provides that the federal \n     district courts shall not have original jurisdiction over any \n     class action in which: (A) two-thirds or more of the members \n     of all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate and the \n     primary defendants are citizens of the state in which the \n     action was originally filed; (B) the primary defendants are \n     states, state officials, or other governmental entities \n     against whom the district court may be foreclosed from \n     ordering relief; or (C) the number of members of all proposed \n     plaintiff classes in the aggregate is less than one hundred. \n     As introduced, the second and third exceptions were the same, \n     but the first one originally precluded federal jurisdiction \n     where ``the substantial majority of the members of the \n     proposed plaintiff class and the primary defendants are \n     citizens of the State in which the action was originally \n     filed'' and ``the claims asserted therein will be governed \n     primarily by the laws of'' that state. The replacement \n     language in essence substitutes a numerical ratio for \n     ``substantial majority'' and eliminates the choice-of-law \n     requirement.\n       We are grateful that Congress is working to resolve the \n     serious problems generated by overlapping and competing class \n     actions. The Judicial Conference ``recognizes that the use of \n     minimal diversity of citizenship may be appropriate to the \n     maintenance of significant multi-state class action \n     litigation in the federal courts.'' At the same time, the \n     Judicial Conference does not support the removal of all state \n     law class actions into federal court. Appropriate legislation \n     should ``include sufficient limitations and threshold \n     requirements so that federal courts are not unduly burdened \n     and states' jurisdiction over in-state class actions is left \n     undisturbed.'' Finding the right balance between these \n     objectives and articulating that balance in legislative \n     language implicate important policy choices.\n       Any minimal-diversity bill will result in certain cases \n     being litigated in federal court that would not previously \n     have been subject to federal jurisdiction. The effects of \n     this transfer should be assessed in determining the \n     appropriateness of various limitations on the availability of \n     minimal diversity jurisdiction.\n       Certain kinds of cases would seem to be inherently ``state-\n     court'' cases--cases in which a particular state's interest \n     in the litigation is so substantial that federal court \n     jurisdiction ought not be available. At the same\n\n[[Page S7687]]\n\n     time, significant multi-state class actions would seem to be \n     appropriate candidates for removal to federal court.\n       The Judicial Conference's resolution deliberately avoided \n     specific legislative language, out of deference to Congress's \n     judgment and the political process. These issues implicate \n     fundamental interests and relationships that are political in \n     nature and are peculiarly within Congress's province. \n     Notwithstanding this general view, we can, however, confirm \n     that the conference has no objection to proposals: (1) to \n     increase the threshold jurisdictional amount in controversy \n     for federal minimal diversity jurisdiction: (2) to increase \n     the number of all proposed plaintiff class members required \n     for maintenance of a federal minimal-diversity class action; \n     and (3) to confer upon the assigned district judge the \n     discretion to decline to exercise jurisdiction over a \n     minimal-diversity federal class action if whatever criteria \n     imposed by the statute are satisfied. Finally, the Conference \n     continues to encourage Congress to ensure that any \n     legislation that is crafted does not ``unduly intrude on \n     state courts or burden federal courts.''\n       We thank you for your efforts in this most complex area of \n     jurisdiction and public policy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Leonidas Ralph Mecham,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. The pages who are still here tonight would agree I may \nhave talked at least long enough for one evening.\n  As I prepare to wrap up, let me acknowledge that the impact of class \naction lawsuits on our Nation's business climate may not be as harmful \nas some of our business interests contend. In some cases, they may \nactually overstate the harm class actions have done.\n  Having said that, a balance still needs to be found in today's system \nthat is respectful on the one hand of the right to seek redress for \nwrongdoing by corporations while preserving a reasonable measure of \nfairness for business interests, too.\n  Patti Waldmeir, who writes on legal issues for the Financial Times, \nsummed it up in her column last month with these words:\n\n       The class-action lawsuit was meant to be a vehicle for \n     democracy in the U.S., a way to level the playing field \n     between the powerless and powerful by allowing individuals to \n     band together to sue big corporations.\n\n  I believe the bill before us does strike the balance that is needed. \nI am pleased to say that view is reflected on the editorial pages of \nscores of newspapers across America: from the Chicago Tribune, to the \nSt. Louis Post Dispatch, the Des Moines Register, the Christian Science \nMonitor, the Buffalo News, the Baltimore Sun, the Hartford Courant, \nNewsday, the Omaha World-Herald, the Oregonian, the Orlando Sentinel, \nthe Providence Journal, the Santa Fe New Mexican, and, yes, even the \nWashington Post.\n  Let me conclude my remarks this evening with these words from the \neditorial pages of the Washington Post in endorsing the Class Action \nFairness Act. These are their words:\n\n       It would ensure that cases with implications for national \n     policies get decided by a court system accountable to the \n     whole country. This is not, as opponents have cast it, an \n     attack on the right to sue or a liability shield for \n     corporate wrongdoing. It is a modest step to rein in a system \n     that too often simply taxes corporations--irrespective of \n     whether they have done anything wrong--and uses that money to \n     pay lawyers who provided no services to anyone. Such a system \n     does not deserve the Senate's protection for yet another \n     Congress.\n\n  Their words, not mine. But to those words let me simply add: Amen.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/06/senate-section/article/S7687-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
