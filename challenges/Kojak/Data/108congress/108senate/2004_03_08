Mr. President, today the Senate will begin debate on the \nfirst concurrent budget resolution for fiscal year 2005. Chairman \nNickles and Senator Conrad are prepared to begin the debate under the \nstatutory 50-hour time limitation. Given the nature of the budget \nresolution and the lengthy debate, on Friday I announced that no \nrollcall votes would occur today. This afternoon Senators will come to \nthe floor to speak in relation to the budget or the two managers may \nhave amendments to consider over the course of the day. However, any \nvotes ordered today will be delayed until tomorrow.\n  As we begin the week, I do want to put all of our Members on notice \nthat this week will include lengthy sessions each day and into the \nevening. We have the 50-hour time limit. There will be references made \nto that time limit during the course of this afternoon and, indeed, \nevery day. It is my hope we will be able to yield back some of the 50-\nhour time limit. I will be talking to the two managers to see if that \nwill be possible.\n  In any event, the debate will be lengthy; it will be throughout the \nday and likely, as I mentioned, go into the evening.\n  We have a recess next week. We will finish this bill this week. I \nhave already heard about a number of scheduling conflicts over the \ncourse of the week, into Saturday and Friday, and I will do everything \npossible to accommodate the request, but I need to make it absolutely \nclear, as I did last week, that we are going to finish the budget \nresolution this week. Therefore, I ask for all Members to adjust their \nschedules accordingly, especially on Friday.\n  I do want to comment on the process, the so-called vote-arama, that \nwe come to at this point each and every year. As Members are aware, \neven after the 50 hours expire, Senators can offer amendments with no \ndebate and they can demand votes, but I think if we look back at past \nexperience almost all Senators will agree that this vote-arama, which \nin more recent times has come to characterize what follows the 50 \nhours, is absolutely not the best process for consideration of their \namendments.\n  Thus, I encourage, in fact plead, with Members to approach the two \nmanagers of the resolution and see if they can limit the excessive \nnumber of votes needed at the end of the process.\n  I thank Senators Nickles and Conrad for their hard work in getting \nthis budget resolution ready for floor action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/08/senate-section/article/S2255-6", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2255-S2256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SENATOR BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to spend 2 minutes on the service of \nSenator Ben Nighthorse Campbell and his announcement that he is not \ngoing to be running for election. For more than 20 years, he has been a \ntireless advocate and a faithful champion for the people of Colorado. \nAlthough I have had the opportunity to discuss with him at length his \nreasons and understand his reasons, I am saddened by his decision to \nretire from his well-earned and well-deserved post. The Senate will \nmiss his plain-spoken humor, his astute and keen perspective, and his \nuncommon drive to improve the lives of those he represents.\n  He has a frank and straightforward approach to the job, and that has \nhelped us and it has helped me as leader walk through some very \ndifficult and contentious issues in a very quiet and dispassionate \nmanner.\n  He is an American original. He served in the Air Force in Korea, was \ncaptain of the 1964 U.S. Olympic judo team. He has been a rancher, a \njewelry designer, a horse trainer, and a public official. He is the \nonly American Indian serving in the Senate. He carries the distinction \nof being 1 of 44 chiefs of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe.\n  Senator Nighthorse Campbell's broad experience and background has \nbeen invaluable to this body. His direct and honest presence will be \ngreatly missed in the Senate. He has been a very good friend and a \ngreat Senator, and I wish the Senator from Colorado\n\n[[Page S2256]]\n\nand his family all the best in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/08/senate-section/article/S2256-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE IRAQ INTERIM CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are now on the resolution and the two \nmanagers are gathering now to start that debate. In the interim period, \nI wish to make another comment that has to do with a truly historic \noccurrence in Iraq.\n  Today is a historic day for the Iraqi people. Today, the Iraq \nGoverning Council will formally sign an interim constitution that \nrepresents one of the most liberal and democratic governing documents \nin the Arab world. It is a historic day for the entire Arab world.\n  The new Iraqi Constitution is a monumental achievement. I applaud the \ncourage and the foresight of Iraq's leaders to seize this historic \nopportunity before them and to work together to forge a framework for \nfreedom that reflects the aspirations and God-given rights of every \nsingle Iraqi citizen.\n  After 35 years of torment and oppression by an evil and dictatorial \nregime, Iraq is finally emerging from the shadows and becoming a \ndemocratic nation by and for the people. Remember, the people of Iraq \njust 1 year ago were ruled by a tyrant who worshipped Hitler and \nStalin, two of the 20th century's most prolific mass murderers--just a \nyear ago.\n  Iraq is emerging from a terrible history, and the Iraqi people \ndeserve our highest praise for their ability to set aside \nrecriminations and to set aside old ethnic conflicts, to confront their \nfears and overcome mistrust in order to embrace the future. It is my \nsincere hope that others in the region and around the world will take \nheart at Iraq's extraordinary progress and that this fledgling nation \nwill one day soon become a beacon of freedom for all.\n\n  The new interim constitution is rightly a document of principles. It \nguarantees freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, privacy, \nthought, conscience, religious belief, and due process. It protects \nwomen, ethnic and religious minorities, and strives to balance regional \nand national imperatives.\n  No longer will the Iraqi people have to fear secret police, \ngovernment abductions, torture, or arbitrary imprisonment. No more mass \ngraves, no more child prisons, no more forced confessions or mass \nexecutions.\n  I have great hopes for Iraq. Like President Bush, I believe all \npeople are capable and deserving of a democratic government. That is \nbecause I believe, like President Bush, freedom is an inherent right, \nnot a privilege to be dispensed by pundits or politicians. Securing \nfreedom in Iraq, as we all know, will be hard. The continuing vicious \nbombings against innocent Iraqis demonstrate that we are up against \ndetermined and evil forces. My heart goes out to those victims and to \nthose families.\n  We know from our own 9/11 how truly devastating these acts of evil \nare to the immediate victims and to the nation that is forced to watch, \nhelpless, in horror. But I have faith that the Iraqi people will \npersevere. We will not allow our enemies to divide us. We will stand \ntogether as two free nations. We will defeat the forces of terror and \nthe Iraqi people will live in peace and freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/08/senate-section/article/S2256-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of S. Con. Res. 95, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 95) setting forth for \n     the congressional budget for the United States Government for \n     fiscal year 2005 and including the appropriate budgetary \n     levels for fiscal years 2006 through 2009.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the concurrent resolution.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The chairman of the committee, the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the presence \nand use of small electronic calculators be permitted on the floor \nduring Senate consideration of the fiscal year 2005 concurrent \nresolution on the budget.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, as we begin consideration of the budget \nresolution, I want to urge our colleagues to be prepared for a long, \nbusy week. Under the rules of budget law, we have 50 hours on the \nresolution. Last year I am not sure how many hours we had, but it was a \nlot more than 50. I believe we had 81 rollcall votes. It was a very \ndifficult and long week. It was actually longer than a week. It spilled \nover into 2 weeks.\n  It is our intention to finish this week. That is going to take the \ncooperation of all Members. The majority leader already announced for \nMembers to expect long nights, long days, and a lot of votes. I urge \nour colleagues to be prepared for a long week. Please don't come up and \nsay, I have a plane reservation at 3 o'clock. I don't think you can \ncount on that. I think you have to assume you are going to be here for \nvery long evenings during long days--especially on Wednesday, Thursday, \nand Friday--until we conclude this resolution. I want to make sure that \nis known.\n  Saying that, I urge colleagues to work with my friend and colleague, \nSenator Conrad, and myself. If you have amendments, please present them \nto us. Give us time to consider them. Maybe we can accept them; maybe \nwe can't; maybe they will have to be objected to. But at least give us \na chance to review the amendments.\n  Last year we ended up in a very demeaning process. We called it a \nvote-arama. But we had a lot of votes that were on sincere issues that \nwere considered with very little debate. I would like to--one of the \nlittle legacy things--change the way we manage Senate budget \nresolutions. By saying that, I would like to avoid the vote-arama, or \nat least minimize it, and maybe have a certain number of votes on each \nside. Sometimes last year we voted on the same thing several times. I \ndon't think that helps the Senate. I want us to represent the Senate \nvery well.\n  I want to warn our colleagues to expect a long week. Hopefully we \nwill conclude. I would love to have it concluded Thursday night. I \ndoubt that will happen. But we will work aggressively with all of our \ncolleagues. And when we get into votes, we are going to be very pushy \non trying to limit the time on those votes.\n  I am just making mention of a couple of those things to let \ncolleagues know they should expect a long week and late nights. It may \nbe that Senator Conrad and those who are proposing amendments will work \nlate and we will stack votes for the next morning. That might be my \npreference. But I will work with Senator Conrad, who is a very good \nfriend and manager on the minority side, on this difficult challenge of \npassing a budget.\n  Again, we have the budget resolution before us. I will be talking \nabout that momentarily. It cuts the deficit in half. Actually, we cut \nit in half over 3 years. The deficits are far too high. Having $500 \nbillion deficits is not acceptable to this Senator, nor do I think it \nis acceptable to anybody. We charted a path to bring it down and bring \nit down rather abruptly. It will take the cooperation of all people to \nconclude this week, and also to make that happen. That is not easy \neasily done.\n  Again, I urge the cooperation of all of our colleagues and look \nforward to working with my colleague, Senator Conrad, for the remainder \nof this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I join the chairman of the committee in reminding our colleagues that \nthis\n\n[[Page S2257]]\n\nwill be a long week with many amendments. I am very hopeful that we on \nour side can find a way to get more amendments considered on the front \nend more quickly--the chairman and I discussed this and I think we are \nof like minds on this--rather than having a big crush at the end. Maybe \nif we spent less time on amendments on the front end and more votes on \nthe front end we could eliminate some of that gridlock at the end. I \nthink the chairman is entirely correct. That would be good for the \nSenate. It would be good for the disposition of these amendments and a \nbetter way to reach a conclusion.\n  The President has sent us a budget. I want to talk about that in part \nand then later on to talk about the chairman's mark.\n  First of all, I want to discus the budget the President sent to the \nCongress. In the President's budget, it spends $991,000 a minute more \nthan it takes in. That is truly a stunning statistic. Every minute, \nunder the President's plan, this country spends $991,000 more than it \ntakes in.\n  In 2001, the President told us:\n\n       Tax relief is central to my plan to encourage economic \n     growth, and we can proceed with tax relief without fear of \n     budget deficits, even if the economy softens.\n\n  That is what he told us in 2001.\n  Let us look at the result. We have seen the deficits absolutely \nskyrocketing. Here we are back in 2001, and we are still in the black. \nBut look at where we have gone. So the President was wrong when he \nasserted that.\n  A year after the President's first budget, he said to us:\n\n       . . . [O]ur budget will run a deficit that will be small \n     and short term.\n\n  This is after we saw a return of deficits which the President said \nwould not happen.\n  In the second year, he told us:\n\n       . . . [O]ur budget will run a deficit that will be small \n     and short term.\n\n  That proved to be wrong as well. We don't see deficits that are small \nand short term. We see deficits that are large and long term. In fact, \nthis chart shows the operating deficits under the President's plan from \nthis year going to the end of the budget period. You can see these are \nmassive deficits, by far the biggest we have had in our country's \nhistory.\n  In the third year, the President told us:\n\n       [O]ur budget gap is small by historical standards.\n\n  Let us look at in fact what has occurred with respect to that claim. \nYou can see this goes back to 1969. It shows the deficits in dollar \nterms. It shows these are record budget deficits, the biggest we have \never had. So the President was wrong again.\n  The President said at the end of last year:\n\n       Now, we've laid out a plan that shows the deficit will be \n     cut in half over the next five years, and that's good \n     progress toward deficit reduction.\n\n  We have to ask, Is the President going to be wrong again?\n  This chart speaks to that. It shows, I believe, that the President \nwill be absolutely wrong again, and wrong by a big margin. The \nPresident says in the fifth year the deficit will be $237 billion. But \nthat is only the case if you leave out lots of items. If you leave out \nthe $30 billion of additional war cost the Congressional Budget Office \ntells us we will still be facing in that fifth year; if you leave out \nthe money needed to fix the alternative minimum tax, which was, as you \nknow when it began, a millionaire's tax. Now it is rapidly becoming a \nmiddle-class tax. In fact, about 3 million people are now affected by \nthe alternative minimum tax. By the end of this period, we will have 30 \nmillion to 40 million people affected by the alternative minimum tax.\n  In addition, the President is not talking about the money he will be \ntaking from the Medicare trust fund, or the Social Security trust fund. \nIn that fifth year alone, the President will be taking $235 billion \nfrom the Social Security trust fund. That is much bigger than his \nentire projected deficit for that year. Every penny of this has to be \npaid back, and the President has no plan to pay it back.\n  The same is true with the Medicare surplus--$22 billion he is \nborrowing from the Medicare trust fund, again with no plan to pay it \nback.\n  Of course, we have the Congressional Budget Office reestimate. They \nhave looked at the President's numbers and made a change. They think \nthe number will be bigger than the President anticipated.\n  If you add all of this up, instead of adding $237 billion to the debt \nin that fifth year, we believe under the President's plan he will be \nadding $600 billion to the debt.\n  What we have, I believe, is a consistent pattern by the President to \nhide from the American people the full story of our fiscal condition. \nHere is just a few of the ways he is hiding the full effect of his \nplan.\n  The first way he does it is he provides no new funding for ongoing \noperations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the continuing war on terror, no \nnew money past September 30 of this year.\n  Does anybody seriously believe the war in Iraq, the war in \nAfghanistan, and the war on terror are going to end on September 30, \nwhich happens to be the end of the fiscal year? Does anybody believe \nthat? That is what is in the President's budget. When we ask the \nPresident's representatives, they say: Well, it is hard for us to know \nwhat the cost will be.\n  We can understand that. But the right answer is not zero, and the \nPresident is telling us there is no cost for the war on terror, no cost \nfor the war in Afghanistan, no cost for the war in Iraq past September \n30 of this year.\n  The Congressional Budget Office tells us that, instead of a zero, we \nought to be putting in $280 billion for these costs for the period 2005 \nto 2014. That is what they say the war cost will be going forward: $280 \nbillion. The President has nothing.\n  But that is not the only place the President is failing to tell the \nAmerican people what we really face. The Bush budget also hides the \nfull story on the cost of extending the tax cuts. The President has \ncome before us and said: Make all the tax cuts permanent. I wish we \ncould do that. But look at what happens. This dotted line shown on the \nchart is the first 5 years. The Bush budget only covers the first 5 \nyears. But look what happens to the cost of the tax cut right beyond \nthe 5-year budget window. The cost of the tax cut explodes.\n  This is being hidden, in effect, from the American people. I think if \nthey have a chance to see this information, they will realize the \nPresident has us on a fiscal course that simply does not add up. The \ndeficits and debt absolutely skyrocket as we approach the retirement of \nthe baby boom generation.\n  It is not just the war cost or the cost of the tax cuts, but we also \nsee the same pattern with the alternative minimum tax. The alternative \nminimum tax was the tax that was designed to catch millionaires, catch \npeople who were filing and paying no taxes. Remember, back in the \n1980s, we had that circumstance where Congress found there were a \nnumber of people making, at that time, $200,000 a year, and there were \n22 of them who did not pay a penny of tax.\n  In response to that, Congress put in place the alternative minimum \ntax. It affected a very small number of taxpayers. But it has not been \nadjusted since the time it was put in place, and now we have between 2 \nand 3 million people caught up in the alternative minimum tax.\n  But we have not seen anything yet because by the end of this 10-year \nperiod, they are telling us 40 million people will be caught up in the \nalternative minimum tax. The old millionaires' tax is swiftly becoming \na middle-class tax trap. The President deals with the problem only for \nthe first year in his budget. He does not deal with the soaring cost \nover the 10 years, again hiding the full story from the American \npeople.\n  But perhaps the biggest place--the biggest place--the President is \nhiding the full effect of his budget policies is with respect to Social \nSecurity. The President, after pledging not to use Social Security to \npay for tax cuts or other expenditures of Government, is now using, \nover the next 10 years, every penny of Social Security surplus. And \nremember, the word ``surplus'' is not accurate because the money is not \nextra. This is money that is needed when the baby boomers retire. It is \nsurplus for the moment. That is money that should be used to pay down \nthe debt or prepay the liability.\n\n  Instead, the President is taking it to pay for tax cuts and other \nthings. He is\n\n[[Page S2258]]\n\ntaking every penny of Social Security surplus, not just this year, not \njust next year, not just for the next 5 years, but for the next 10 \nyears under the President's plan--and all of that at the worst possible \ntime, right before the baby boomers begin to retire. Those funds will \nbe needed to keep the promise made to them.\n  Remember, in 2001, the President told us he was going to have maximum \npaydown of the debt. He said he would virtually eliminate the debt. \nWell, he was wrong again. Because we see the debt exploded. The gross \ndebt of the United States was $5.8 trillion in 2001 when he took \noffice. We now project--using his tax cuts, the alternative minimum tax \nreform that will be required, and the ongoing war costs; just making \nthose three corrections--the gross debt of the United States will \nskyrocket to $14.8 trillion in 2014.\n  You wonder, where is all that money coming from. We are running up \nthis huge debt. Where is this money coming from? Well, we have already \nseen the President is borrowing $2.4 trillion from the Social Security \ntrust fund--$2.4 trillion; every penny of the Social Security surplus. \nHe is taking every penny available to borrow, and using it to pay for \ntax cuts and other things.\n  But that is not the only place from which he is borrowing. He has \nborrowed already $545 billion from Japan, $149 billion from China; he \nhas borrowed $69 billion from the so-called Caribbean banking centers; \nhe has borrowed $58 billion from Hong Kong; he has even borrowed $43 \nbillion from South Korea. I do not think this makes us stronger. I \nthink this makes us weaker. And that is what has happened.\n  The President is very fond of saying it is the people's money; we \nhave to give it back to them.\n  Well, that may have made more sense when there was a surplus, but now \nthat you are in deficit, it is the people's money, certainly, but it is \nalso the people's debt. Where is the money coming from to finance this \ndebt? It is coming from borrowing. We are borrowing from ourselves. We \nare borrowing from the Social Security trust fund, the Medicare trust \nfund, under the President's plan, and we are borrowing from countries \nall around the globe, money that will ultimately have to be paid back, \nand the President has no plan to do it.\n  Here are the implications of this policy. This is from a story that \nwas in the Washington Post on January 26 of this year: ``Economists \nWorry About Long-Term Effects of Weak Dollar and Heavy U.S. \nBorrowing.'' Here is what it said in the article:\n\n       Currency traders fretting over that dependency--\n\n  The dependency they are talking about is our need to borrow all this \nmoney, borrow from the budget deficit, now approaching $500 billion \nthis year. We are also, in effect, borrowing from the rest of the world \nto finance our trade deficit, which is also about $500 billion a year.\n\n       Currency traders fretting over that dependency have been \n     selling dollars fast and buying euros furiously. The fear is \n     that foreigners will tire of financing America's appetites. \n     Foreign investors will dump U.S. assets, especially stocks \n     and bonds, sending financial markets plummeting. Interest \n     rates will shoot up to entice them back. Heavily indebted \n     Americans will not be able to keep up with rising interest \n     payments. Inflation, bankruptcies and economic malaise will \n     follow.\n\n  That is the risk the President is running with these enormous \ndeficits as far as the eye can see. We have a circumstance where we \nhave run deficits in the short term. That is more understandable. We \nhave been wracked by an attack on September 11. We have had an economic \nslowdown. We have a war in Afghanistan and Iraq. I think we can all \nunderstand that we would expect to run deficits in that circumstance.\n  The problem I see is the President's plan going forward. Because even \nwhen he sees economic recovery continuing, we are running deficits that \nare larger than anything we have seen in our country's history--not \njust for the next few years but the next 5 years and the next 10 years.\n  When they said in the article that economists are worried about the \nlong-term effect of the drop in the value of the dollar, here is what \nthey are talking about.\n  The dollar has declined more than 30 percent against the euro just \nsince 2002. In other words, our currency has lost 30 percent of its \nvalue against the European currency in the last 2 years. That has \nenormous implications, both short term and long term.\n  In the short term, it helps us celebrate abroad. If our dollar is \nworth less, it makes it easier for us to sell abroad. It makes it \nharder for us to buy from other countries, so that gives a boost in the \nshort term to our economy.\n  The problem is, if it continues for an extended period, then people \nwho are investing in the United States in dollar-denominated securities \nmay decide it is no longer advantageous to invest in dollar-denominated \ninvestments. They may decide it is time to diversify out of dollar-\ndenominated investments. That could have a very serious and negative \nconsequence on the American economy.\n  From the Washington Post this morning, I urge my colleagues to look \nat the story about Warren Buffett--Warren Buffett, the second richest \nman in the world, somebody who is a patriotic American--indicating that \nhe is betting against the value of the U.S. dollar. He has bet $12 \nbillion against the value of the American dollar.\n  I was just with a financial adviser, one of the most prominent \nfinancial advisers in America, who had a strategy meeting with one of \nAmerica's wealthiest families. For the first time at their meeting, \nthey decided to begin to invest in other than dollar-denominated \ninvestments because they believe the threat to the value of the \nAmerican dollar to long-term American economic strength is being so \nundercut by these budget and trade deficits.\n  We have to get serious about the long-term economic security of our \ncountry. Do not take my word for it. This is from the President's own \nbudget document. It is the long-term budget outlook. If we adopt the \nPresident's spending plan and if we adopt the President's tax plan, \nthis is what it shows. This is a very sobering chart. It tells us that \nright now we are in the budget sweet spot. Even though this represents \na record budget deficit, the biggest we ever had, it shows things \ngetting somewhat better on a so-called unified basis when Social \nSecurity money is being used to pay our bills.\n  Look what happens in the long term as the baby boomers start to \nretire and the cost of the President's tax cuts explode: The deficits \ngo right off the cliff, deficits that are utterly unsustainable and \nthat fundamentally threaten the economic strength of the country. That \nis from the President's own budget document. That is their outlook of \nwhere this is all headed. This is a policy that cannot be justified \nover the long term. It is utterly unsustainable.\n  If you do not want to trust the President's numbers--and I understand \nthat after we have looked at the previous claims of what would happen--\nthis is what the Congressional Budget Office shows. It is exactly the \nsame thing. This is their long-term budget outlook--again, a percentage \nof GDP so the effect of inflation has been taken out.\n  They show, with the President's tax cuts, the need for alternative \nminimum tax reform, maintaining current spending policies, and, of \ncourse, the President is really increasing current spending because of \nthe increases in defense and homeland security. Look what happens. The \nlong-term deficits absolutely skyrocket.\n  All of this is happening at the worst possible time, as this chart \nshows. This chart shows the tax cuts explode as the trust fund cash \nsurpluses become deficits. This chart shows, in green, the Social \nSecurity trust fund. The blue is the Medicare trust fund. The red are \nthe tax cuts, both those already passed and those proposed by the \nPresident.\n  What this chart shows is right now the surpluses in the Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds are offsetting the cost of the tax \ncuts. Look what happens when the trust funds go cash negative in 2016 \nand 2017. At the very time the cost of the tax cuts explode, that \ncombination drives us right over the fiscal cliff. This sets up a very \ndifficult set of choices for the future.\n  This is a joint statement by the Council on Economic Development, the \nConcord Coalition, and the Council on Budget and Policy Priorities. In \nthe fall of last year, trying to help people understand what we will \nface in the future as a result of digging the hole so deep now, this is \nwhat they said:\n\n       To get a sense of the magnitude of the deficits the nation \n     is likely to face without a\n\n[[Page S2259]]\n\n     change in policies, consider that even with the full economic \n     recovery that CBO forecasts and a decade of economic growth, \n     balancing the budget by the end of the coming decade would \n     entail such radical steps as:\n       Raising individual and corporate income taxes by 27 \n     percent; or eliminating Medicare entirely;\n\n  We have had tough choices in the past. Wait and see what is to come. \nThree very serious groups are warning where we are heading.\n  Continuing:\n\n       Raising individual and corporate income taxes by 27 \n     percent; or eliminating Medicare entirely; or cutting Social \n     Security benefits by 60 percent.\n\n  We have just had the head of the Federal Reserve, Chairman Greenspan, \nsay we are overcommitted. He said we ought to consider cutting Social \nSecurity benefits. But he has not said cut Social Security benefits by \n60 percent. That is what these three organizations are saying would be \nthe options facing a future President and a future Congress if we stay \non this current course.\n\n       Or shutting down three-fourths of the Defense Department; \n     or cutting all expenditures other than Social Security, \n     Medicare, defense, homeland security, and interest payments \n     on the debt including expenditure on the debt--including \n     expenditures for education, transportation, housing, the \n     environment, law enforcement, National Parks, research on \n     diseases, and the rest--by 40 percent.\n\n  I hope our colleagues are listening. I hope they are paying \nattention. We are on a course that is a reckless course. It is not a \nconservative course. It is a radical course. It is a course that is \nutterly unsustainable and will lead us into very serious trouble.\n  If we look at what has happened to spending, it is important to know, \nagain, if we look at total Federal spending, a share of GDP, and we go \nfrom 1981, we reached a peak in 1983 of 23.5 percent of gross domestic \nproduct going to the Federal Government and then it zigzagged.\n  In 1991, we put in place a 5-year budget plan that took spending down \neach and every year as a share of gross domestic production. Then, in \n1997, we passed a bipartisan plan that took us down even further, so \nthat in 2001 we were down to 18.4 percent of gross domestic production.\n  The Federal Government spending had come down very sharply in that \n20-year period. Now we have had this tick-up, and this tick-up \nprimarily has been for defense, homeland security, and the response to \nthe September 11 attack, rebuilding New York, and bailing out the \nairlines. Even with that tick-up, we see we are still well below the \nspending levels of the 1980s and 1990s in terms of what the Federal \nGovernment is spending.\n  If we turn to the revenue side, we see quite a different picture. On \nthe revenue side, we can see the revenue side of the equation has just \ncollapsed. In 2004, we now expect revenue to be 15.8 percent of gross \ndomestic production. The revenue has just collapsed. We will have the \nlowest revenue as a share of gross domestic production since 1950.\n  Spending is down substantially from where it was in the eighties and \nnineties, however up from where it was in 2001 because of the increases \nfor defense. Ninety-one percent of the increases have been for defense, \nhomeland security, and the response to the attacks of September 11.\n  Look what has happened on the revenue side of the equation. The \nrevenue side of the equation has collapsed. About half this is due to \nthe tax cuts. The other half is due to the economic slowdown. Again, we \nhave a real problem on the revenue side of this equation.\n  The President said last month in a speech in Louisville:\n\n       We've got plenty of money in Washington, DC, by the way.\n\n  We do not have plenty of money to pay the bills. There is a lot of \nmoney here, there is no question about that, but we cannot pay our \nbills and we cannot come anywhere close to paying our bills. So when \nthe President says we have plenty of money here, he certainly is right, \nthese are very big numbers with which we are dealing, but we do not \nhave enough money to pay the bills.\n  We are going to hear from the other side that the President has done \na good job with his budgets getting the economy growing again. If we \nlook at the economic record of this President, what we see is, in terms \nof creating private sector jobs, this administration is the first one \nin 70 years to lose private sector jobs. It is pretty stunning. If you \nlook back, every single President--President Roosevelt, President \nTruman, President Eisenhower, President Kennedy, President Johnson, \nPresident Nixon, President Ford, President Carter, President Reagan, \nPresident Bush 41, and President Clinton all had positive job creation \nin the private sector. We have to go all the way back to Herbert Hoover \nto see a President who has lost private sector jobs. That does not tell \nthe full story because as we look at what has happened and compare it \nto history, what we see should be of concern to all of us.\n  I asked my staff to go back and look at what has happened in the \nprevious times when we had an economic slowdown. I asked them to look \nat the last nine recessions we have had since World War II and compare \njob recovery out of those recessions to what is happening now because I \nthink this should alert all of us. Something is wrong, and we have to \ndiagnose what it is. I have some ideas. I am sure my colleagues will \nhave some ideas, but there is something very wrong happening.\n  This is a chart of a fit line looking at what happened in the last \nnine recessions. We have a dotted red line, the average of nine \nrecessions since World War II coming out of recessions. The bottom of \nthe chart is the months after the business cycle peak. What we see is \nabout 17 months after the peak, there is typically a strong job \nrecovery. That is about 17 months after the business peak.\n  Look at what has happened this time. We are now 35 months or 36 \nmonths past the business cycle peak, and still we see no substantial \njob recovery. In fact, we are now 5.4 million jobs short of the typical \nrecovery.\n  If we were comparing to just one time, I would be less concerned, but \nthis is every recession since World War II, nine recessions, and if we \ncompare what has happened in each of those to what is happening this \ntime, something is wrong. Something is radically wrong. Typically in \nthese other cases, 17 or 18 months past the business cycle peak, we \nstarted to see very strong job recovery. Here we are 37 months past the \nbusiness cycle peak and we still do not see job recovery. As I \nindicated, we are 5.4 million jobs short of the typical recovery. In \nfact, it is not just of a typical recovery; it is of every other \nrecovery since World War II. In the nine previous recessions, every \nother time, by this time, we would have been strongly recovering. It \nhas not happened.\n\n  Again, we are going to hear from the other side that things are \npretty good. What we see here is the smallest share of the population \nis at work since 1994. Again, this is a warning signal to us. Madam \nPresident, 62.2 percent of the population is employed now. We see the \npercentage of the population employed down very sharply from 2000 to \nnow--down very sharply. Only 62.2 percent of the population is \nemployed. We have to go all the way back to 1994 to see a number that \nweak.\n  It is not just that statistic which ought to concern us. We also see \nthe longest average duration of unemployment in over 20 years--that is, \nif we look at how long people are unemployed, we find they are staying \nunemployed for a longer period than any time in the last 20 years. In \nother words, people are not finding jobs quickly when they become \nunemployed. When they are laid off, they are not finding jobs for \nextended periods of time.\n  This side of the graph is over 20 weeks people have been waiting to \nfind a new job. Again, that takes you all the way back to 1984 to see \npeople having to wait so long to find other work.\n  I also asked my staff to look at what has happened to real wages \nduring the Bush administration and compare it to the previous \nadministration. Here is what we found.\n  If we go back to 1996, the average wages in the country were $485. By \nthe end of the Clinton administration, it got up to $530. During the \nBush administration, average wages have only gone up $8 a week. That is \nvery weak in historical comparison. Again, it is another warning sign \nthat the set of policies which are in place are not working \nappropriately.\n  I know we will hear the other side talk about the stock market \nrecovery that has taken place, and that certainly has been welcomed. It \nis much\n\n[[Page S2260]]\n\nbetter than where we were. We need to remind ourselves where we are now \ncompared to where we were.\n  As this chart shows, the market recovery still leaves stock prices at \n1998 levels. We have to go back 6 years to find the stock market at \nthis level.\n  Another point we have heard from the other side--and I am sure we \nwill hear again--is don't worry, it is the surveys that are at fault; \nthat is what is misleading us as to what is going on in terms of \nemployment. They will say over and over that the household survey--we \nheard this in the Budget Committee debate--the household survey is the \none to which we ought to be paying attention, but that contradicts \ntheir Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in testimony \nbefore the Joint Economic Committee. The Commissioner said:\n\n       The payroll survey is the best indicator of current job \n     trends.\n\n  That is what we have used here in these statistics. I am sure we will \nhear the other side argue, as they have in the Budget Committee, that \nthe household survey is better. But the person who is in charge of the \nBureau of Labor Statistics contradicts that and says the payroll survey \nis the best indicator of current job trends.\n  If we look at the President's economic report that was issued on \nFebruary 9, just a month ago, they said in that report:\n\n       [W]e expect sort of an average jobs in 2004 to be 2.6 \n     million more than jobs in 2003.\n\n  This is the President's economic report. This is his prediction of \nwhat is going to happen, that there are going to be 2.6 million more \njobs this year than last year. From here going forward, that would \nrequire the creation of 520,000 jobs a month.\n  Let's do a little reality test. Here is what happened in February: \nThe increase in jobs was not 520,000 for that month. It was 21,000. In \nthe private sector, there were no new jobs. Every one of these jobs was \na Government job. Of the 21,000 jobs created in February, every single \none of them was a Government job. There were no private sector jobs \ncreated.\n  The President's report says there are going to be 520,000 jobs \ncreated if we are going to meet their claim that there are going to be \n2.6 million more jobs by the third quarter of 2004 compared to the \nthird quarter of 2003. For that to come true, they would have to \ngenerate 520,000 jobs a month. In February, it was 21,000 jobs and not \na single one of them was in the private sector. Every single one of \nthese new jobs in February was in the Government.\n  So the President's plan is not working. He told us in 2001 this plan \nwould not create deficits. It has created the biggest deficits in our \ncountry's history. He told us it would create jobs. Here we are 3 years \nlater. Where are the jobs?\n  This is what consumers believe is happening. Consumers believe jobs \nare hard to get. Eighty-eight percent believe jobs are not plentiful or \nare hard to get. Only 12 percent believe jobs are plentiful. It is not \njust with respect to recovery. It is not just with respect to job \ncreation. It is not just with respect to people having an opportunity \nto find a new place if they lose their old job. We are also seeing the \nwage growth of production workers starting to fall behind inflation.\n  This green line shows the average hourly earnings of production of \nnonsupervisory workers. Let's look at this because it goes back to \n2001. This is the 12-month percentage change. Back in 2001, we saw an \naverage hour of earning increasing at a rate of over 4 percent. Since \nthat time, it has been almost a steady downward pattern. We see now \naverage wages are going up between 1.5 percent and 2 percent. The red \nline shows consumer prices, and this year we have now seen the lines \ncross, so that hourly average earnings are not keeping up with \ninflation. We are not seeing them keep pace with the increases in \nconsumer prices, another warning sign this is a policy that is not \nworking.\n  This is our initial take on the President's budget. We think it is \ntaking us in the wrong direction. Let me be clear. When the President \ncame into office in 2001, on our side we proposed a much larger tax \nreduction in the near term than did the President. I know many people \nwill be surprised by that, but it is a fact. We proposed a budget that \nhad much bigger tax cuts in the short term, to give lift to the \neconomy, than did the President. But we had much less in tax cuts over \nthe 10-year period, about half as many, to avoid going into this \ndeficit swamp.\n  In retrospect, we were right. It was right to have tax cuts on the \nfront end to give lift to the economy. The economy clearly needed it. \nIt was a mistake for the President to propose these massive tax cuts \ngoing out for years into the future when we had the baby boom \ngeneration about to begin retiring. It is the combination of policies \nthe President has pursued that we believe is a mistake. We believe, \nyes, we should have had tax cuts in the short term to give lift to the \neconomy, although we would have chosen a different mix of tax cuts than \nthe President did.\n\n  Interestingly enough, the President adopted some of our suggestions, \nthe 10-percent rate, the child care credit, reducing the marriage \npenalty, and we salute him for that. Those are policies many of us on \nthis side agreed with. But the President also adopted dramatic cuts in \ncapital gains and dividend taxation. These are taxation policies the \nCongressional Budget Office told us would give us very little bang for \nthe buck in terms of job creation and economic growth. I think the \nCongressional Budget Office was right. I think that particular mix of \ntax cuts the President chose was not the right mix to give maximal lift \nto the economy in the short term.\n  As we see going forward, the President's tax cuts are so large they \nfundamentally threaten our long-term economic security. That is where \nwe have the significant difference.\n  I am pleased to see members of the Budget Committee in the Senate and \nthe House have not adopted the President's full tax cut proposal going \nforward. Now maybe it will occur in later years, past the 5 years. None \nof us can know that now, but at least in this budget cycle they are not \nendorsing the President's plan to have another trillion and a half \ndollars of tax cuts when we already have the largest deficits in the \nhistory of our country and we are about to have the baby boomers begin \nto retire, which will dramatically increase the expenditures of the \nFederal Government, because that is one thing we know. The baby boomers \nare not a projection; they are out there. They have been born. They are \nalive. They are eligible for Social Security and Medicare, and we are \nfaced with a circumstance in which we have to start making very tough \ndecisions.\n  My own belief is we have to be tough on the spending side of the \nequation and we have to be tough on the revenue side of the equation. \nWe have to slow the growth of Federal spending. On the other side of \nthe equation, we have to do something about the revenue mess because \nthe revenue this year is the lowest as a percentage of gross domestic \nproduct since 1950. When the revenue was high as the share of gross \ndomestic product, the President said we needed tax cuts. Now that it is \nthe lowest it has been since 1950, the President's answer is, more tax \ncuts.\n  It does not matter what the problem is, this President comes up with \nthe same answer: Tax cuts, tax cuts, and tax cuts that primarily go to \nthe wealthiest among us.\n  I have a chart with me which I will use later on that shows 33 \npercent of the tax cuts this President has proposed and those that have \nbeen enacted have gone to the wealthiest 1 percent, those earning over \n$337,000 a year. That is not a fair distribution of the tax cuts in \nthis country. It is one reason we have a very weak job recovery, \nbecause the tax cuts that were selected were tax cuts that primarily \nwent to the wealthiest among us rather than being targeted at middle-\nincome people who would spend the money. So much of this money has gone \nto high-end people who save it.\n  As meritorious as it is to save money, and I try to remind my \ndaughter of this from time to time, that saving is a good thing, but \nwhen talking about getting an economy moving we need that money to be \nspent, we need that money to be moving in the economy. If we look at \nthis economic recovery that has occurred, to the extent it has \noccurred, there are many factors. One of the biggest factors is the \nmonetary policy of this Nation.\n  The Federal Reserve has the most accommodative monetary policy in 40 \nyears. It is a key reason this economy has recovered. We have combined \ndebt in this country of over $20 trillion.\n\n[[Page S2261]]\n\n  So an accommodative monitoring policy, the lowering of short-term \ninterest rates from 6.5 percent down to 1 percent, has been a key \nreason for the lift of this economy. The second key reason for the lift \nof this economy has been the stimulus both on the tax side and the \nspending side. The two of them are about equal over this 3-year period.\n  If we look at the increased spending that has occurred--and it has \nbeen substantial since 2001--from 2001 to 2003, the Federal Government \nhas increased expenditures by 20 percent. Of course, the tax cuts--\nespecially those geared to the middle class--have helped give lift to \nthis economy.\n  A third factor helping economic recovery has been the decline in the \nvalue of the dollar. That can have negative long-term consequences; but \nin the short term, a decline in the value of the dollar makes it easier \nfor us to sell abroad, which helps our manufacturing industry and all \nthose that export. It holds down imports because imports become more \nexpensive. So that has helped give lift to the economy in the short \nterm as well.\n  Madam President, the bottom line is that I believe the fiscal course \nthe President is taking us on--not so much in the short term, although \nthat is of increasing concern, but the longer term proposals by the \nPresident are truly dangerous to the economic security of our country. \nThe deficits are too large. They are too long lasting. They explode as \nthe baby boomers retire and the full cost of the President's tax cuts \nbecome clear.\n  I believe we have a responsibility to alter that course. I believe it \nwill become more and more clear in the months ahead that the course we \nare on is utterly unsustainable and fundamentally reckless. That is why \nwe simply must change course.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring quorum calls be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, the chairman has indicated to me he will \nreturn in a few minutes and begin his presentation at that time. Rather \nthan have the time be lost, I will say a few words now.\n  In addition to being concerned about the President's plan to explode \nthe deficits and the debt, as I look at the President's plan I also see \nwhat I believe are misplaced priorities. Let me discuss just a few.\n  As this chart shows, the Bush plan cuts No Child Left Behind, but \nthat cut saves very little in comparison to the cost of the tax cuts \nfor that same year going to the most wealthy 1 percent. Let me just be \nvery clear. The President's plan shorts No Child Left Behind by $9.4 \nbillion in this fiscal year, 2005. We passed legislation here that gave \nincreased responsibility to the States, increased the expenses of the \nStates, and in exchange we said we would cover the costs. The \nPresident's budget fails to do that. It fails to do it by $9.4 billion \nfor 2005.\n  But in that same year the cost of the President's tax cuts for the \nmost wealthy 1 percent, those who earn over $337,000 a year, are $45 \nbillion, five times as much as the money needed to keep the promise of \nNo Child Left Behind.\n  I must say I am in this category. My wife and I are in the top 1 \npercent. I would be happy to give up part of my tax cut. I would be \nhappy to have it reduced by 20 percent to keep the promise for No Child \nLeft Behind.\n  The same is true in other categories--veterans medical funding, for \nexample. The President's budget is $521 million short of providing \nfunding for veterans medical care in 2005 that should be in place to \nfund it at the same level as last year. It would take $521 million to \nbring it up to what we did last year for veterans medical care.\n\n  In that same year, the President's tax cuts cost $45 billion for the \nwealthiest 1 percent, those earning over $337,000. That is 90 times as \nmuch as the money necessary to restore the funding for veterans medical \ncare. I must say I don't understand these priorities. It doesn't stop \nthere.\n  This is President Bush's plan for cutting firefighting funds. It \nwould cost $246 million to restore the money. Again, in 2005, in \ncomparison, the President has $45 billion in tax cuts going to the \nwealthiest 1 percent, those earning over $337,000 a year. That is \nalmost 200 times as much as the money necessary to restore the cuts to \nthe firefighters.\n  We talked a lot about homeland security. Firefighters who are the \nfirst responders, the police who are first responders, ought to be high \nup on the list of our priorities, and certainly veterans health care. \nWe have just sent thousands of men and women half a world a way to \ndefend this country. Then we cut their medical care. I don't think \nthese are the priorities of the American people.\n  It doesn't stop there. The President plans to cut COPS funding to put \npolice on the streets. The COPS program has put 100,000 police on the \nstreets in this country. The President proposes deeply cutting COPS \nfunding. It would cost about $700 million to restore that funding for \n2005. Instead, the President says it is more important to have $45 \nbillion of tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent. I do not think that \nis the priority of the American people.\n  When we look at these programs individually, we can see the Bush \nbudget cuts the COPS program by 94 percent. This is the amount of money \nwe provided in 2004. We provided $742 million to put these police on \nthe streets. The President proposes cutting that down to $44 million. \nHe is cutting it by almost $700 million at the same time, saying, No, \nit is more important to have $45 billion of tax cuts for the wealthiest \n1 percent, those earning over $337,000 a year.\n  My own belief is the COPS program ought to be funded. I believe we \nare safer because there are 100,000 more police on the streets. The \nPresident, with these deep cuts--cutting the COPS program 94 percent--\nis going to take police off the streets. When we have a terrorist \nthreat in this country, as we do, why would you take police off the \nstreets? Why would you take police off the beat? It makes no sense to \nme.\n  As I say, it doesn't stop there. Here is the President's plan for \nfirefighters. He cuts that program 33 percent. Again, firefighters are \nfirst responders.\n  I can remember well September 11 when the Pentagon was attacked. I \nremember watching the television. I remember seeing all those first \nresponders. Who was it we asked to respond to the disaster? \nFirefighters, police, and EMTs. Those are the people who were there to \nhelp those who had been hurt.\n  The President's answer is cut the COPS program 94 percent, cut the \nfirefighters 33 percent, and cut port security 63 percent. We provided \n$125 million last year for port security. The President wants to cut \nthat by almost two-thirds, down to $46 million. We know we are only \ninspecting about 4 percent of the containers that come into our ports. \nWe know we need to do more. We know we need to do more to secure the \nports. In fact, those who are involved with the ports of the country \nsay we ought to have $5 billion for port security. Obviously, we can't \nafford $5 billion. But on the other hand, does it make any sense to cut \nwhat we are doing now by 63 percent? I don't think that makes much \nsense in the light of what we face in terms of a terrorist threat to \nthe country.\n\n  Earlier I was talking about the tax cuts the President put in place \nand the distribution of those tax cuts. Again, I want to make clear I \nproposed in 2001 much bigger tax cuts on the front end than the \nPresident proposed. You will recall the President's initial two \nproposals would have very small tax cuts in the initial years, and much \nmore in\n\n[[Page S2262]]\n\nthe outyears. I thought he had it upside down and backwards. I thought \nwe should have more tax cuts on the front end to give life to the \neconomy and much less in the long term so we could prepare for the \nretirement of the baby boom generation and not undermine Social \nSecurity and Medicare and national defense. The President largely got \nhis way, with some exceptions.\n  Here is what we see as beneficiaries of those income tax cuts. Of the \nincome tax cuts, 68.7 percent of the benefit goes to the top 20 \npercent, and 33 percent of the benefits--almost a third--go to the top \n1 percent. Those are people earning over $337,000 a year.\n  I believe one of the reasons we are not seeing the kind of job \ncreation we might have otherwise seen is the President shows the wrong \nmix of tax cuts. He has it much too weighted to the top end and not \nenough to the middle class who are the ones who would spend the money \nand really fuel the economy.\n  This next chart shows in a little different way who benefited from \nthe 2003 tax cut. Net tax cuts under the tax act passed in 2003 for \nupper-income individuals was 67 percent of the benefit, according to \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation. Low- and middle-income people got 29 \npercent, and businesses 3 percent. Again, I think the President chose \nthe wrong mix of tax cuts.\n  There is no question that stimulus is what the economy needs when you \nhave that kind of slowdown. Stimulus can be either spending or tax \ncuts. I believe we ought to do both. We have economic weakness and we \nspend more money--a 20-percent increase from 2001 to 2003 in Federal \nspending, most of it for defense and homeland security and responding \nto the effects of September 11, but we also cut taxes. That is a \nstrategy that makes sense at a time of economic weakness. The problem \nwith what was put in place is the taxes were so directed to tax \nreduction, so directed at the wealthiest among us, the highest income, \nthat we didn't get the same bang for the buck in terms of economic \ngrowth and job creation we would have gotten had we targeted more to \nmiddle-income individuals and lower-middle-income individuals who would \nmore likely have spent the money.\n  This is a very interesting chart. I hope my colleagues will have a \nchance to see a lot of this chart in the coming days. This is how the \ntax benefits stack up--the average tax cut in 2006. Middle-income \npeople got an average $566. This is the combined effect of the 2001 and \n2003 tax cuts. Middle-income people got an average of $566.\n  But look at what happened. Those earning over $1 million a year got \n$140,000 on average in tax cuts. If these bars were proportionate, the \nbar showing what the people earning over $1 million get would have to \ngo 35 feet higher. I don't know how high the Chamber is here, but 35 \nfeet would be a long way up in the air to show the comparable tax cuts \ngoing to those earning over $1 million compared to what the middle-\nincome people get. Middle-income people got $566. People earning over \n$1 million got $140,000 in tax cuts on average in 1 year.\n  If we were going to have the comparison done in a proportional way, \nthe bar showing what those earning over $1 million are receiving for \nthe year would have to go 35 feet high compared to this little bit at \nthe middle income.\n  Again, I believe one of the reasons we are not seeing the job \nrecovery all of us would like to see is the President simply has the \nwrong mix of tax cuts.\n  This chart shows it a different way. A typical taxpayer, one right in \nthe middle of the income distribution in the country, under this \nscenario got $685. This is from the Center on Tax Policy, the average \ntax cut in 2004. In 2004, those earning over $1 million got $127,000 in \ntax cuts. That is a stunning difference. The Bush income tax cuts give \nthree times as much benefit to the top 1 percent as the middle 20 \npercent.\n  Looking at the middle 20 percent of the people in the income \ndistribution in this country, they have 11 percent of the benefit of \nthe President's tax cuts. The top 1 percent got almost three times as \nmuch. In fact, they did get three times as much for those earning over \n$337,000 a year.\n  I asked my staff to go back and look at how the top 1 percent of our \ncountry has done compared to the rest of the American people. Here is \nwhat we found looking at increases in average aftertax income from 1979 \nto 2000. Those in the top 1 percent improved their condition by \n$576,000, the middle 20 percent, $5,500. That is 100 to 1.\n  The people who have benefited by the economic growth are the top 1 \npercent. That is fine. I am all for that. We all want people to be able \nto succeed. That is what opportunity is about. That is what freedom is \nabout, the ability to do better, do better for your family, do better \nfor yourself. Great. But when we come along and make tax policy and we \nlook at those people having been the greatest beneficiaries of what has \noccurred on a basis of 100 to 1 and we in this tax policy say that is \nnot good enough of a difference, we want to turn around and give those \nearning over $1 million a year a $140,000 tax cut on top of it in 1 \nyear and the middle-class people get $500.\n  How is that fair? It eludes me how that is fair. I don't think it is \nfair. Not only is it not fair, but it is not good economic policy. Why \nnot? Because the middle-income people are the ones who spend the money. \nWe need people to spend money to get the economy moving. People in the \nhigher income categories are the least likely to spend it. They are \nmuch more likely to save and invest, which is good to do, but that is \nnot what primes the pump. That is not what gets the economy moving.\n  When I look at who got the biggest benefit, many times friends on the \nother side of the aisle say, Hey, wait a minute, the wealthiest folks \npay most of the taxes. That is exactly right. That is true. The wealthy \npeople do pay more of the taxes. We have a progressive tax system, so \nhigher income people pay a greater proportion of taxes, but they do not \npay the same share. They do not pay as much more as we gave in the tax \ncut side of the ledger. As I indicated, they got 33 percent of the \nPresident's tax cuts, but they paid 23 percent of the income and \npayroll taxes. This is the wealthiest 1 percent. They got 33 percent of \nthe benefit, but they paid 23 percent of the taxes. I don't think it is \nfair on any basis what the President chose as the mix of tax cuts and I \ndon't think it is good economic policy either.\n  It is stark when we look at the top 1 percent, those earning over \n$337,000 a year. They got 33 percent of the benefit of the tax cuts. \nThe bottom 60 percent in this country got 15 percent of the benefit.\n  Our friends on the other side will say, Hey, wait a minute, the \nhigher income people pay more. Yes, they do, but they do not pay 33 \npercent of the taxes. Our friends on the other side want to talk about \nincome taxes. They forget that people do not only pay income taxes; \nthey pay income taxes; they pay payroll taxes. The fact is, three-\nfourths of the American people pay more in payroll taxes than they pay \nin income taxes. Yet all of the relief has been to income tax payers \nand done in a way that gives an overwhelming benefit to the highest \nincome tax payer, those earning over $337,000 a year.\n\n  The disparity is even bigger when we look at those who earn over $1 \nmillion a year. As I showed, those earning over $1 million a year got \nthe cake. We talk about the crumbs and the cake. Here is the cake. \nThose earning over $1 million a year, for 2006, will get a $140,000 tax \ncut in that year alone. Here is what the middle-income folks in the \ncountry are going to get: $566. There is something wrong with this \nplan.\n  Again, when we look at what has happened from 1979 to 2000, the \nchange in share of pretax income, this chart is quite stunning. It is \nthe reason there is a lot of anger in the country, I believe. There is \nmuch more anger in the country than I think is generally understood by \npeople in Washington. The reason is middle-income people in this 20-\nyear period have actually lost ground. They are worse off in their \nshare than they were in their pretax income shares in that 20-year \nperiod. The middle-income people have actually lost share, 15 percent. \nTheir pretax incomes have gone down. Look what has happened to the top \n1 percent. Their pretax income has gone up 91 percent.\n  We heard Senator Edwards from North Carolina in his Presidential \ncampaign talking about two Americas. The reason that got such a \ntremendous response is because there is a lot of truth in what he is \nsaying. There are two Americas developing: those who are well-to-do, \nthose who are secure, those\n\n[[Page S2263]]\n\nwho are fully competitive in this global environment; and then middle-\nincome people, who all of a sudden are finding themselves in \ncompetition with people who are earning 25 cents an hour in some other \npart of the world. We are faced with a circumstance that is changing \nvery dramatically.\n  I met a man who is involved with one of the major industries in the \ncountry at a breakfast I attended several weeks ago. He said, Senator, \nsomething is changing structurally in this country. Something is \nhappening that is very dramatic. In the business I am in--he is in the \nmachine tool business--at this stage of an economic recovery, we should \nfind our order books filled. We should see dramatic increases in \norders. Senator, that is not what we are finding. Yes, economic growth \nhas improved. We saw 4 percent the last quarter, 8 percent the quarter \nbefore that. But, he said, our order books are not filling up in the \nmachine tool business. Something structurally is changing here.\n  There are jobs being created, but not jobs in this country. There is \nbusiness being created, but it is not business in this country. The \njobs are being created in China. The jobs are being created in Mexico. \nJobs are being created in India. Business is being created to some \nextent in this country because we see strong economic growth here, but \nit is not as it should be in this stage of recovery.\n  I believe part of it is we have adopted a flawed policy. We have \nhelped with tax policy the very people who have already done extremely \nwell in the last 20 years. Those who are the most educated, the best \ntrained, are doing extremely well. That is great. I am all for that. I \nhope very much everybody gets into that category. That is what \nopportunity is about. Through our policies, we are helping the very \npeople who have already done the best, and we are not doing much for \nthe people who are falling behind.\n  Chairman Greenspan says we ought to focus on education because if we \nare going to compete in this global environment, we must have the best \ntrained, best educated workforce. Yet in this budget, the President \ncuts No Child Left Behind $9 billion.\n\n  Does that make sense for our country? Does it make sense to cut \neducation for what was promised by $9 billion when in that same year we \nare giving the top 1 percent a $45 billion tax cut? Does that make \nsense? Is that good judgment to strengthen our country for the future? \nI do not think so.\n  If we look at what has happened, again, from 1979 to 2000, to those \nin the middle 20 percent, their share of pretax income has dropped. \nLook at what has happened to the top 20 percent. Their share has almost \ntripled.\n  If people are not paying attention, they are going to get swamped. \nThere is anger in this country because when Senator Edwards talks about \ntwo Americas, he is exactly right. Those at the top are doing better \nand better. I am delighted they are doing better. But those in the \nmiddle, they are falling behind.\n  Why? Because this global economy is great for the people who are the \nbest educated and the best trained. That is why we, as a society, ought \nto make certain we are doing everything we can to make Americans the \nbest educated and the best trained because if you are not, you are not \ngoing to be able to compete. You are not going to do well in this \nglobal competition, and your share of the national income pie is going \nto get cut. Those who are well educated and well trained are going to \nprosper. They are going to soar. We have to somehow fashion a policy \nthat gives all Americans a chance to compete and to do well and to be \nwinners.\n  We hear a lot from the other side that the biggest beneficiaries of \nthe top rate cut are the 23 million small businesses; that is where \nmost of the jobs are generated. I agree, most of the new jobs are \ngenerated by small business. But I do not agree that the top rate cut \nbenefits most businesses. In fact, only 2 percent of businesses qualify \nfor that top rate. Ninety-eight percent got no benefit from the top \nrate cut.\n  I hope very much as this debate goes forward that we think very \ncarefully about what we are doing because it is abundantly clear, while \nthere is economic recovery underway, it is an uneven economic recovery. \nIt is a recovery that is not generating jobs in the same way we have \nseen in the nine previous recessions. We are 5.4 million jobs behind \nwhere we typically have been in other recoveries since World War II.\n  Something is wrong. Something is not going right. I believe one part \nof that is the tax policies that have been put in place that have \nbenefited primarily the top 1 percent. The top 1 percent got a third of \nthe benefit--those earning over $337,000 a year. Those are the very \npeople who have done the best in the last 20 years on every scale. They \nhave increased their incomes by over half a million dollars. They have \nseen their pretax income go up 91 percent, while those in the middle \nhave seen theirs shrink.\n  I think that is right at the heart of why we see a jobless recovery \nunderway. The people who are the very ones who would spend the money \nare not getting the money. The people who are getting the money, under \nthe President's plan, are the wealthiest among us. They are the least \nlikely to spend it. They are the most likely to put it in the bank. And \nwhile savings is a good thing, and I am delighted to always see people \nsave because that helps investment for the future--and we need to have \nmore savings in order to have more investment, to have more growth for \nthe future--in the short term, to get people back to work and to fuel \nthe economy, you need people spending money. The people most likely to \nspend money are the people in the middle class.\n\n  Of course, we have also seen somebody else spend money. That is Uncle \nSam. Uncle Sam has been spending a lot more money. From 2001 to 2003, \nFederal spending went up 20 percent. From 2001 to 2004, Federal \nspending has gone up almost 30 percent.\n  Where is the increased spending going? Ninety-one percent of the \nincreased spending is going in just three areas. Most of it is defense. \nThe next biggest is homeland security. The third biggest was a response \nto the attacks of September 11--rebuilding New York, bailing out the \nairlines, and the international programs that have been adopted to deal \nwith the crisis in Afghanistan and Iraq. That is where the increased \nspending has occurred.\n  We will hear a lot from the other side that spending is out of \ncontrol. It really is not. We have seen a big bump up in the 3 years of \nthis President, but where has it been? The increases have been for \ndefense, homeland security, and the response to the September 11 \nattack.\n  The place where the deficits have really opened is on the revenue \nside. It is the revenue side of the equation that has collapsed. We are \ngoing to have the least revenues as a share of gross domestic product \nsince 1950. So if we are going to be honest and straight with the \nAmerican people about diagnosing the problems we have, we have to \naddress the circumstances as we know them, as we face them.\n  Let me just quickly say, on the revenue side of the equation, I know \na lot of people's impulse is, well, if you are talking more revenue, \nyou are talking tax increases. That would not be the first place I \nwould look for more revenue. The first place I would look for more \nrevenue would be the tax gap, the difference between what is owed and \nwhat is being paid.\n  I met with the head of the Revenue Service in the last 2 weeks, and \nhe told me the tax gap, as of 2001--the difference between what is owed \nand what is paid--was $255 billion in that year alone. We ought to have \na concerted effort to go after those who are not paying what they \nlegitimately owe under this Tax Code--those companies, those \nindividuals who are dodging what they legitimately owe, to the tune of \n$255 billion in 2001 alone. It is totally unfair to the rest of us who \npay what we legitimately owe to let others--a small percentage--escape \nwhat they owe.\n  A previous Revenue Commissioner did an analysis and said the rest of \nus paid 15 percent more because of that small group of companies and \nindividuals who are not paying what they legitimately owe.\n  I hope we shine a bright light on this tax gap because I believe it \nis the first place we ought to look to start to fill in this revenue \nhole that has been created. Instead of going to a tax increase, the \nfirst thing we ought to do is close the tax gap so everybody can be \nassured everyone else is paying what they fairly owe under the law.\n\n[[Page S2264]]\n\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I ask the Senator, are you ready to proceed or should I put in a \nquorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, Senator \nConrad, for his remarks. I agree with some of them, not necessarily all \nof them. Let me make a few comments on the budget. And I, again, \nappreciate his patience in waiting for me so I could have a bite to eat \nand also get prepared for this presentation.\n  The budget is a difficult challenge. To write a budget for the United \nStates of America, the largest government in the world, the largest \neconomy in the world, is not easy.\n   President Bush has written a budget. We produced a budget out of the \nBudget Committee. I hear a lot of complaints about how bad the \nPresident's budget is or how bad the resolution on which we will be \nvoting on the floor is, but I have not seen alternatives. I would urge \npeople, show me your alternative. Show me how much money you would \nspend, how much money you would tax. That is basically what a budget \noutline is: how much money we are going to spend and how much money we \nare going to tax. What is our objective? How are we going to achieve \nit?\n  We use assumptions. A lot of times the assumptions are wrong. I have \nheard a lot of complaints: Well, President Bush missed the assumptions \nbig time. In 2001, we projected enormous surpluses, and now we have \nenormous deficits--trillions of dollars of difference. What happened? \nWe don't understand.\n  Well, a lot of things happened. Let me just say there have been a lot \nof inaccurate assessments made. And I go back to the year 2001. In \nJanuary 2001, everybody missed--everybody missed--big time, not just \nPresident Bush. President Clinton, the Congressional Budget Office, the \nOffice of Management and Budget all missed more than you can imagine.\n  I will just make a couple comments on a little history.\n  The NASDAQ collapsed in the year 2001, and it continued to decline a \nlittle bit in 2002. But a big collapse was really in the year 2000.\n  I might mention that President Clinton was still President. Yet I \nwill show you the next thing. His forecast for 2001--this was given in \nJanuary of 2001--estimated about an additional employment of almost 2 \nmillion jobs.\n  Frankly, the economy was already falling into recession, which was \nshown by the fact that NASDAQ went down by almost 50 percent in 2000. \nYet the budget experts, Democrats and Republicans, CBO and OMB--CBO is \nthe Congressional Budget Office and OMB is the Office of Management and \nBudget--projected that revenues would continue to climb, employment \nwould continue to climb, as President Clinton did. They all missed it. \nThey missed it by an enormous amount. They were forecasting trillions \nof dollars in surpluses. They were way wrong. Of course, they also \ndidn't know, and could not have expected, the hit we had in September \nof 2001. But there were enormous mistakes that were made.\n  The market collapse, or the crash of the market and NASDAQ declining \nby that much was missed. They didn't estimate what the impact would be \non revenues and to the economy.\n  We had trillions of dollars in market value that was lost in the \ncollapse. If you look at the NASDAQ chart again, in March, that \ncollapse started in March of 2000. Individuals, investors know that. \nThey remember that is when the bubble popped. NASDAQ was almost 5,000. \nThen all of a sudden it was going down to 4,000, 3,000, and it ended up \nthat year at 2,500. So there was an enormous decline of market value. A \nlot of it was inflated. Chairman Greenspan called it ``irrational \nexuberance,'' and he was probably right. It flowed through as a real \nloss and decline of revenue coming into the Federal Government.\n  In the year 2000, we had over $2 trillion of revenue. That declined \nto last year's $1.78 trillion in revenues. Part of that was tax cuts, \nbut the bigger part of it was the recession.\n  Look at this chart. Where did the deficits come from? Most of the \ndeficits came from economic and technical changes. That is 40 percent, \nfrom the assumptions made in 2001. New spending comprised 37 percent. \nSo you had economic and technical changes of 40 percent; new spending, \n37 percent; tax cuts, 23 percent.\n  Again, this is comparing 2001 to the forecast of today. My point is, \nI want to give people a perspective of what happened. The new \nspending--we had big supplemental changes--changes were made as a \nresult of the war. We had two very large supplementals to fight the \nwars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and a big supplemental to help New York \nCity and Virginia. That totaled almost $250 billion in new spending \njust to take care of those who were injured and to rebuild New York \nCity and fight the war on terrorism.\n  That is kind of what we inherited last year. Last year, the previous \nyear, we didn't have a budget. Last year we had to pass a budget, and \nthe economy was still rather flat. Besides, Democrats and Republicans \nsaid we needed a stimulus package, we needed to grow the economy. We \nhad different ideas of how to do it. I think some of what we did last \nyear helped a lot.\n  I have heard criticism. I will make a couple of comments. I think the \nchanges we made last year did grow the economy, did make a difference. \nIf you look at the GDP, gross domestic product, you can see what we \nwere looking at last year. It was rather stagnant. The economy started \ndropping in 2000, a negative quarter in 2000, and in 2001 it was \nstill pretty negative.\n\n  Then we started to have a growing economy. When we passed the tax \nbill last year--when we started talking about it, we started to notice \nthe GDP started rising dramatically.\n  The last three quarters were very positive. The third quarter of last \nyear is the largest economic growth period we have had in any quarter \nin decades--not in years but decades. So the tax bill changes we made \nwere positive.\n  Some people say I think we want to make changes to grow the economy. \nWe did. We basically accelerated the tax cuts that were already in \nprogress and moved the rates to the rates they are today. That was \npositive, in my opinion, and very beneficial. We cut in half the tax on \ndividends. Chairman Greenspan and others said we should go to zero.\n  The Senate passed a bill that would take the tax on dividends to \nzero, i.e., they should only be taxed once. We found out then in \ncomparing it that we taxed the contribution distributions from \ncorporations higher in the U.S. than in any other country in the world. \nWe tied with Japan for the highest tax rate on taxing proceeds from \ncorporations, higher than anybody else in the world. We cut that tax in \nhalf, to 15 percent.\n  We cut the capital gains rate from 20 percent to 15 percent. It has \nmade a big difference. You see these economic growth figures--GDP going \nup by 4, 5, 8 percent. Those are very positive and good numbers.\n  If you look at what was done in the stock market, there was over a \n$4.5 trillion increase, almost on a straight line basis, since the tax \nbill we passed last year. That is astronomical--great, good news. That \nis good news for all Americans.\n  Some people say, well, that only benefits the Warren Buffetts or the \nwealthy people who invest. That is not correct. It benefits the entire \neconomy. That means the wealth of these companies is growing. These \ncompanies are owned by, frankly, almost all Americans. I think over 50 \npercent of the households have direct ownership, if you looked at the \ninvestments they have, such as the teachers public employee trust \nfunds, all kinds of retirement plans, 401(k)s, almost all of which have \ninvestments in the stock market. That means instead of having declining \nmarket value in their retirement accounts, they have increasing ones, \nescalating amounts. That is all good news. We want to continue that \ngood news.\n  The point is, very seldom can you say--we passed a budget last year \nand, if we had not done that, we would not have had a growth package, \nwe would not have cut the tax on dividends to 15 percent, or reduced \nthe tax rate on capital gains 25 percent, from 20 to 15 percent. That \nwould not have happened. But we passed a budget and it made it possible \nfor that to happen. As a result, I think we have good news to share.\n  When people think about whether budgets make a difference, they make\n\n[[Page S2265]]\n\na world of difference. Can you impact the economy? Yes. We proved that \nand we did.\n  If you look at the unemployment rate, for example--and we have heard \na lot of discussion on it--it is now 5.6 percent. It was up to 6.3 \npercent. It has been declining ever since we passed the bill. We made \nsome good progress. We have not had the increase in employment \ncertainly that I would like to see, but it is moving in the right \ndirection.\n  As far as the employment rates or the number of people employed, we \nare making progress. I think one of the reasons it has not been as good \nas we would like in many cases is because productivity has escalated \nrather dramatically. That is good for consumers, certainly good for our \neconomy. That keeps us competitive. That means we produce more goods \nper hour and that is all positive. We will see a rise, hopefully, in \nthe employment rates as we continue.\n  The unemployment rate is down and employment rates are up. If you \nlook at the number of people employed, it is an all-time high. It all \nhappened because we passed a budget last year. So I encourage people \nwho are very critical of this budget to come up with their own. This is \nnot an easy job. So I welcome the discussion.\n  I also wish to talk a little bit about tax rates. I have heard a lot \nof complaints about the wealthy benefitting so much from these tax \ncuts, and how terrible it is that they were disproportionately \nbenefiting from this proposal--either the tax cut of 2001--and there is \na lot of discussion and confusion about the 2001 tax cut and the 2003 \ntax cut. I was one of the principal authors of both. Primarily, I was \nvery involved with it. Let me defend it.\n  One, for those people who say it didn't benefit the low-income \npeople, that is not correct. In the 2001 tax cut, we accelerated the \ntax reduction for low-income people and made it effectively \nretroactive. Maybe some people forgot that, but we did that.\n\n  Again, we passed the tax cut in 2001, and we reduced every tax \nbracket--every tax bracket, not just the tax brackets for the higher \nbrackets. We reduced every tax bracket, and we reduced the lower tax \nbracket more than any other bracket.\n  The lowest tax bracket at that time, other than zero, was 15 percent. \nWe made it 10 percent, and we did it retroactive to January. So we took \nthe lowest bracket, cut that tax rate by 50 percent, and we made it \nretroactive.\n  We took the maximum rate, which was 39.6 percent, and we reduced it \nby 1 point to 38.6 percent for 2 years. Last year we finally got it \ndown to 35 percent. It took us from 2001 to the middle of 2003 before \nwe got it down to the 35-percent tax bracket. It was 39.6 percent under \nPresident Clinton. We took it to 35 percent. It is still much higher \nthan it was under President Bush 1 at 31 percent. Thirty-five percent \nover 31 percent, it is almost 20 percent higher than it was under \nPresident Bush 1. But we made the lower income tax bracket reduction \neffective immediately and we did it all in 1 year. We did not phase it \nin over 3 years.\n  We also did some other things. We made the tax cut more refundable. I \ndon't happen to agree with that, but we did, so we write a check to \npeople who do not even pay taxes. In many cases, we write them a check \nmuch greater than their payroll taxes.\n  I hear some people say: You need to include payroll taxes. I \nunderstand there are income taxes and payroll taxes combined, but for \nlow-income people, in many cases we would write a check to them that \ngreatly exceeded their 2001 tax bill. Maybe some people forgot that \npoint.\n  Then we also increased the $500 per child tax credit to $1,000. Last \nyear, we took it from $700 to $1,000. That is a $1,000 tax credit per \nchild. If we do not extend it this year, it will go back to $700. We \nassume in our budget that we are going to extend it.\n  When people say we did not do anything for low-income people, if you \nhave 4 kids, that is $4,000--4 times the $1,000 tax credit on which you \ndo not have to pay taxes.\n  The net impact of that is a lot of people do not pay income taxes \nbecause if you look at the child tax credit and you look at the earned \nincome tax credit and so on, we have a lot of programs for low-income \npeople, so maybe they do not pay taxes.\n  Then we hear the argument of distribution, the class argument: The \nwealthier are the ones who are benefiting. Frankly, people in the upper \n5 percent of income pay half the income tax. Think of that. The upper 5 \npercent of the American people pay half the income tax. Sure, if you \nare going to cut income taxes, they are going to benefit. The point \nbeing, how much should the rate be? What is the right level? I happen \nto think when we talk about a 35-percent rate--that is over a third, if \nmy math is somewhat accurate--that is a lot. Why should the Federal \nGovernment take over a third of anybody's income for any reason? Why is \nthe Government entitled to take half?\n  When I was first elected, the rate was all the way up to 70 percent. \nThe Government could take 70 percent of any additional dollar you \nearned. I think that is wrong. We have gradually reduced it to 28 \npercent, and it went up to 39.6 percent. Frankly, it is even higher \nthan 39.6 percent because there is a tax on all income of 2.9 percent \nto pay Medicare. So you actually add 2.9 percent for these income tax \nfigures. Add 2.9 percent, so the maximum percent is 37.9 percent today. \nMaybe people don't realize that. How much money should the Federal \nGovernment take? The power to tax is the power to destroy. Where do you \ndestroy an individual's or company's incentive to produce more? At some \npoint, I can tell you from my experience in the private sector--I used \nto be in the private sector; I will be returning before too long--at \nsome point, when you work more for the Government than you work for \nyourself, you lose a lot of your incentive to grow, build, and expand, \nand when I say expand, I am talking about hiring more people.\n\n  I found out earlier when I had a janitor service that I was almost in \na 40-percent tax bracket. Why in the world should I get up early every \nmorning or work late at night if Uncle Sam and the State--combined \nbetween the two--are going to take about half? It is a real \ndisincentive to grow. I had several employees and could have had \nseveral more. I had the same situation when I ran a manufacturing \ncompany in Oklahoma. Marginal tax makes a difference.\n  I mentioned the top rate today is 35 percent. If you add the 2.9 \npercent because of Medicare, that is 37.9 percent, and you have not yet \npaid any State income tax. A lot of States have 6 or 7 percent, so you \nadd that. Now you are at 45 percent. Some cities have an income tax. \nYou add that and you are at the 50-percent rate.\n  Why does someone want to continue building and growing and expanding? \nExpanding is where jobs are created.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. No, I will not yield. I am going to make a fairly \nsignificant statement.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I want to clarify one point.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Not at this point.\n  Some people say that is a big benefit for the wealthy. I say why in \nthe world should the Government take half? I don't think they should. \nMaybe some people believe they should. I disagree.\n  What we have assumed in the budget is we are going to continue \npresent law; that we are not going to have a tax increase. Some people \ndon't want that to be in there. We assume we are going to continue \npresent law, where we have several provisions that are due to expire at \nthe end of this year. Some of those, frankly, are targeted toward low- \nor middle-income people. They would expand the child tax credit. As I \nmentioned, if we do not extend it, the child tax credit will go from \n$1,000 to $700. There is a $1,000 tax credit today. If we do not extend \nit, as assumed in the budget, it goes to $700. So they will lose. If \nthey have 4 kids, they are going to have to pay $1,200 more in taxes \nnext year than they pay this year.\n  What about the marriage tax penalty? We assume we are going to extend \nthe marriage penalty relief we put in last year's bill. That is very \nsignificant for middle-income tax relief.\n  I heard my good friend Senator Conrad talk about the middle-income \nclass does not get anything. That is not accurate, in my opinion. The \nmiddle-income class people do very well. If you have a taxable income \nof $58,000, your tax bracket is 15 percent. We want to keep it at 15 \npercent. If we do not pass the extension, it is going to revert\n\n[[Page S2266]]\n\ndown and people will be paying 25 percent if they make $58,000. As a \nmatter of fact, the savings on that income category is about $900. So \nif a married couple and their combined, joint taxable income is \n$58,000, the marriage penalty relief we passed last year which we want \nto extend is $900. So you have $900 there. If they have 4 kids, that is \nanother $1,200 difference. That is $2,100 of tax relief for a couple \nwith 4 kids. That is a rather typical American family. I happen to have \nfour kids. I don't qualify for this, but most American families have \ntaxable incomes of $58,000 and would qualify for it. My kids are too \nold. My point being, this is real tax relief for American families.\n  We also expand the 10-percent bracket, and we continue that \nexpansion, or we assume that will be continued under our resolution. \nThat is another $100.\n  If you look at the savings, we have $900 on marriage penalty relief \nwe would extend; we have $1,200 for the child tax credit we would \nextend; another $100 for the 10-percent expansion. We expand the amount \nof income that would be taxed at 10 percent. By continuing those \nprovisions, we save the American family which has $58,000 in taxable \nincome and 4 kids about $2,200. That is real relief. Percentage-wise, \non the amount of taxes they pay, it is probably a greater percentage \nrelief than anyone. It is very significant. So I want to put some of \nthe tax equity arguments in perspective.\n\n  I will make just a couple of other comments about the budget. I \nmentioned what we assume on the tax side. I tell my colleagues if they \nare bent out of shape, we have a reconciliation package instruction \nthat would make all of those things I just mentioned be extended \nthroughout the 5-year window of this bill.\n  This is a 5-year budget. I am assuming all those things would be made \npermanent, or at least be extended through this resolution. Things \ncannot be made permanent in budget resolutions. A lot of people say we \nwant to make those tax cuts permanent. I said fine. We just have to do \na tax bill outside of reconciliation.\n  I am happy to do the tax bill, I tell my friend and colleague. I \nthink he knows that. I have the pleasure of serving with him on the \nFinance Committee. This Senate has done many tax bills, many inside \nreconciliation and many outside. By definition, if they are inside a \nreconciliation they are terminated. I do not like that. Frankly, I want \nto do something this year on the death tax or the estate tax. If we are \ngoing to do something on the death tax, it ought to be done outside of \nreconciliation so it is not temporary, so it is permanent, so tax \nplanners and others can figure out what they want to do and they can \ncount on it. So maybe we will have the opportunity to do that if we do \nbills outside of reconciliation.\n  I have looked at it more or less as a fallback, and I told Senator \nGrassley, who is the very able chairman of the Finance Committee, that \nwe might have this as a fallback but hopefully we could do these things \noutside of reconciliation. That would be a couple of options.\n  That is $81 billion that we are assuming in reconciliation. We assume \nabout $12 trillion in the next 5 years in revenues. So the amount of \nmoney we are trying to direct through the reconciliation process is \nvery small in proportion to the total amount of money that is expected \nto be raised under current law. So I just mention those things on the \nrevenue side.\n  What about on the spending side? I showed the chart where spending \nhas gone up and revenues have gone down, mostly because of the economy, \nsomewhat because of the tax cut. Expenditures have gone up rather \ndramatically.\n  We believe it is time to be responsible. We think it is time to make \nsome reductions, to at least cap the growth on spending. So the \nresolution we have makes some tough choices. In many cases we have not \nmade tough choices in the past.\n  I am sure I am going to hear from my colleagues: Well, too much is \ncut, too much is assumed. Basically, we still assume spending will \ngrow, but it is going to grow by less. In some cases, for the \nassumptions we have that defense would grow about 5 percent, I have \nalready heard--very strongly I might add from Chairman Stevens and \nChairman Warner--that they want 7 percent. The President requested a 7-\npercent growth in defense. We have assumed 5.1 percent, and I expect \nthere will be efforts to--I might even say I know there will be efforts \nthat will be coming to increase that level.\n  We assume the President's number in homeland defense. I have heard \npeople say that is not enough; he did not do enough on first \nresponders; he did not do enough for port security, and so on. But we \nassumed a 15-percent increase in homeland security, according to CBO. \nIf we take out the bioshield, which was actually funded last year, it \nis about a 10-percent growth. Again, 10 percent when looking at the \nrest of the budget, nondefense, nonhomeland security grows by basically \na freeze. We could say .5 percent or a freeze. The President's budget \nsaid it would grow by about .5 percent. Our budget is very close to a \nfreeze.\n\n  These programs are not used to a freeze. I can show program after \nprogram, going all the way back since 1990, that has been growing in \nannual expenditures in double digits continually. They are addicted to \nthat kind of spending growth.\n  If we try to say, I am sorry, you may have to live with a freeze, \nthat is not going to be easy. I know a lot of the appropriators are \nlooking at it and saying: Whoa, we are used to having a lot more money \nthan that. I know this will not be easy. I tell my friend and colleague \nfrom North Dakota, it will not be easy because I know there is a lot of \ndemand to spend somebody else's money. Frankly, I do not think $500 \nbillion deficits are acceptable.\n  The administration estimated the deficit for this year at $521 \nbillion. I hope they are incorrect. We use the Congressional Budget \nOffice. There are differences and they are legitimate. There are \nprofessionals both at the Congressional Budget Office and OMB, and I \nrespect them all. They have different estimates, for different reasons. \nWe can spend a lot of time on that, but the Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that this year the deficit will be about $477 billion.\n  The President said he wanted to get the deficit down by half over 5 \nyears. That is very significant. The President is estimating $521 \nbillion. To try and get that in half over 5 years is a very significant \ndeficit reduction, not easily obtained.\n  Since we use the Congressional Budget Office, we start at $477 \nbillion. Under our budget resolution, next year the total deficit will \nbe $338 billion. That is a reduction of about $140 billion--actually \n$139 billion in 1 year. That is a very significant decline. The next \nyear goes down again about $80 billion, a very significant deficit \nreduction, not easily done.\n  If we are successful in doing that, we will be very close to the \nhalfway mark in 2006. We will be there in 2007. So we are bringing it \ndown.\n  Looking at it as a percentage of gross domestic product, the estimate \ntoday of the deficit is 4.6 percent of GDP. In past years, even in the \nearly 1980s or 1990s, we had deficit figures of as much as 6 percent of \nGDP. We are bringing it down in a couple of years to 2 percent, which \nis much more sustainable. In the year 2007, it will be 1.7 percent of \nGDP. So we are making significant progress in deficit reduction. We \nwould meet this target either nominally through dollars or through a \npercentage of GDP in 3 years.\n  I know there are going to be a lot of amendments that say we are \ncutting too much too fast. Frankly, we are not cutting. We are saying \nwe should allow defense spending to grow as much as necessary, but \nother than that we need to tighten our belts. We have not done that in \nthe past. As a result, I know people are going to say we need more \nmoney, and we will be happy to look at the requests. In many cases we \ncan fund more money, but we may have to cut other places to do it.\n\n  I have heard some people say, well, we need money for veterans, for \neducation, for first responders, for defense, or the COPS Program, or \nwhatever. Fine. They can have more money, but between us on the Budget \nCommittee and the appropriators, we are going to have to reduce some \nmoney or spending in other areas to pay for it. That is making tough \nchoices. We have not done that.\n  I remind our colleagues, and I think Senator Conrad would join me, in \nthis budget we do not micromanage where\n\n[[Page S2267]]\n\nthe money is going to be spent. We can assume that money will be spent \nin education or it might be spent for the COPS Program, but, frankly, \nwe give a number to the appropriating committees and they have to live \nwith that number.\n  They can change the number. So we might assume one thing for \neducation--actually, we have assumptions in this bill for significant \nincreases in several areas in education. We assume fairly significant \nincreases in veterans programs. Somebody else could assume it \ndifferently, or they could say well, we want more money for veterans. \nFine. They may have to make some reductions in housing or make \nreductions elsewhere in the budget to make it equal that total number.\n  I mention this for our colleagues' information. Doing this budget \nwill not be easy. I am sure we will have lots of amendments. I concur \nwith Senator Conrad, I would prefer to manage it in a way that we would \nbe more direct in handling the amendments, trying to have more \namendments throughout the course of the budget debate and not have so \nmany stacked up at the end. I do not think that speaks well for the \nSenate and our management of this challenge.\n  This is a challenge. This is not easy.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the very able chairman of the Budget \nCommittee has just given his review of his proposal on both the revenue \nand the spending side. Let me put up this chart which shows a bit of a \ndifferent perspective.\n  The chairman put up a chart which shows the deficit being cut in half \nover the next several years. This is the problem I have with that \nchart. I think it fundamentally misleads the American people about the \nfiscal condition of the country.\n  The chairman's chart is entirely accurate about the unified deficit. \nWhat does that mean? That is when you put all the money in the same \npot, all the income tax collections and all the payroll tax collections \nto support Social Security, Medicare, and then you take all the \nspending out of that same pot. That is how we have done the budget here \nfor years.\n  The problem now is we are in a different situation. The different \nsituation is Social Security, in the 1980s, was changed to run large \nsurpluses during this period in preparation for the retirement of the \nbaby boom generation. So when you put all the money in the same pot, it \ngives a misleading result. It misleads you as to your true fiscal \ncondition.\n  Let me take this chart from the chairman's own budget. It shows, for \n2004, that the overall debt is going to increase by $612 billion \nbetween 2004 and 2005. It is going to increase by $612 billion.\n  Let's go out. Under the chairman's mark, I think he is saying that \nthe deficit will be cut in half in--Mr. Chairman, 4 years or 3 years? \nThe deficit will be cut in half in 3 years.\n  But look at this. When you look at the total picture, you see a \ndifferent result. You see, between 2004 and 2005, the debt being \nincreased by $612 billion; in the next year, $569 billion; in the next \nyear, $553 billion; and in what was supposed to be the third year, \nwhere it is supposed to be cut in half, the debt is increasing by $563 \nbillion. There is almost no difference here in how much the debt is \nincreasing. In fact, in the 5 years the debt is increasing $2.86 \ntrillion under the chairman's mark.\n  The chairman is putting the most positive complexion on this budget \nhe can, and I understand that. But when you look at what he is \nproposing, he is talking about the unified deficit, he is talking about \njackpoting all the money, he is talking about the so-called unified \ndeficit being cut in half. To me, that does not give an accurate \npicture of the fiscal condition of the country.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I understand this point the Senator is making is \ncompounded by the fact that what we are looking at with this budget is \njust a 5-year projection.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is my understanding it includes within it the idea \nof making these tax cuts that were passed permanent instead of \ntemporary. Of course, the people who put the tax cuts in place were the \nones who made them temporary. Now they are coming back, seeking a \nchange in the law to make them permanent. They, in effect, are changing \nthe tax structure. Otherwise, they would expire.\n\n  But they are only projecting a 5-year period. As I understand it, if \nyou do the 5-year period, this is the increase in the deficit here, \njust this amount. But the full brunt of this doesn't hit home until the \nsubsequent period. So if you take a 10-year period, which we have done \nin the past--we have used 10-year projections rather than 5--if you \ntake the 10-year period, look what happens to the cost. There is a \ndeficit explosion. It is just staggering.\n  Of course, we are only being shown this part of the picture instead \nof being shown all of the picture, which shows a $1.6 trillion 10-year \ncost. There is a $1.6 trillion 10-year cost to extending the tax cuts \nover this next 10-year period.\n  So the Senator is making one point about the understatement of the \nsituation we are moving in, but this also dramatizes another very \nimportant point. We are being set on a fiscal course that spells \ndisaster for the country, and we need to recognize that. It is one of \nthe reasons I joined with the Senator in the Budget Committee in voting \nagainst this budget. This is not a sound, solid, steady course to be \non, in terms of the Nation's fiscal policy.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator makes a very powerful point. As you can see \njust on the tax side of the ledger, the President's tax cut proposal \nexplodes right beyond the 5-year window.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is right. Exactly.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If the Senator will put the chart up again, what that \nshows----\n  Mr. SARBANES. You see it runs along here like this. This is as far as \nthe chairman's budget projects it, right to there. Then it stays on \nthat line a little bit and then look what happens to it--it is \nincredible. It is the shooting star deficit, the way this thing is \ngoing.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is truly stunning. It is not just the tax cuts that \nhave that same pattern. Fixing the alternative minimum tax, which was \nthe original millionaire's tax, is rapidly becoming a middle-class tax \nincrease that has that same pattern.\n  In addition, they are hiding the cost of the war. The war, they say, \nhas no additional cost. The war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan, and \nthe war on terrorism has no additional cost past September 30. Who \nbelieves that? We know right now they are preparing a request for \nadditional funding, a vote to be held after the election in which they \nare going to ask for another $50 billion.\n  Mr. SARBANES. At least.\n  Mr. CONRAD. At least. The Congressional Budget Office tells us the \ntrue ongoing cost of the war over the 10-year period will be $280 \nbillion. There is not a dime of it in the President's budget.\n  The Senator is quite right. It is this pattern of hiding from the \nAmerican people the full cost of these budget proposals that is a great \nconcern.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I would like to pick up on the Senator's point about \nthe cost of adjusting the alternative minimum tax. Of course, the \nalternative minimum tax was put in place in order to tax wealthy people \nwho are using various deductions and exemptions, and so forth, not to \npay taxes. The idea was, at a minimum you ought to pay a certain amount \nof tax. There was a huge public outcry about that--justifiably so in my \nopinion. So we put it into place. Of course, as the economy evolves, \nyou have inflation and so forth and so on, and you have to keep \nadjusting it; otherwise, it is going to work its way down further into \nthe middle class. It was never intended to do that. So it has been \nadjusted from time to time.\n  In fact, the President is proposing in his budget, as I understand \nit, a 1-year\n\n[[Page S2268]]\n\nadjustment--not projecting it out. Of course, that raises the question \nimmediately in your mind: Why a 1-year adjustment? I think it is \nobvious why, if you do this, because it shows if you really adjust it \nas it ought to be adjusted, you are projecting out $658 billion in a \n10-year cost to reform the alternative minimum tax. There is a $658 \nbillion 10-year cost to reform the alternative minimum tax. Here you \nhave $1.6 trillion to extend and make permanent the existing tax cuts, \nthe sum total of which is $2.2 trillion.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Real money.\n  Mr. SARBANES. You are telling me it is real money. Absolutely. The \nSenator is absolutely right. This budget is kind of you see this, but \nyou do not see what is behind the scenes, what is coming. We cut off \nthe picture and look at a certain point. It works pretty good. You cut \nit off here before this line takes off. You see what we are showing--\nthis part. It is an exercise in prudence to come along and say: Wait a \nsecond; let us see how that works in the outyears. All of a sudden, you \nsee it just takes off like that.\n  The Senator is absolutely right.\n  Mr. CONRAD. You have the same pattern on the alternative minimum tax, \nas the Senator showed. Interestingly enough, that costs $658 billion \nover the 10 years. The President only provides for 1 year in his \nbudget--$23 billion. He shows the $23 billion necessary to keep this \nthing from cutting more and more into the middle class. In fact, we \nhave 2 million or 3 million people affected by the alternative minimum \ntax. By the end of that 10-year period, 40 million people are going to \nbe caught up in the alternative minimum tax. Boy, are they in for a big \nsurprise. They thought they were getting tax cuts. They are going to \nget a whooping tax increase. What the President's budget does, and the \nbudget from the Republican side in the Budget Committee, is just deal \nwith this problem for 1 year.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is interesting. If you deal with the first year of \nthe 10-year period, it is $23 billion, as I understand it. But you \ncan't assume, well, we will just project that out at $23 billion a \nyear, each year. So the cost over 10 years would be $230 billion, which \nis what someone just coming to it at first blush might assume. The fact \nis that the cost escalates rapidly. So over the 10-year period, it is \nnot 10 times $23 billion, or $230 billion; it is $658 billion, almost \ntriple what you might suppose it would be.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. The reason for that is, as the Senator knows, more and \nmore people are getting sucked into this alternative minimum tax \ndesigned to catch millionaires. Now it is going to be catching middle-\nclass people. In fact, there was an excellent article in the Washington \nPost this weekend by a young journalist whose family just got sucked \ninto the alternative minimum tax. It cost his family over $2,000 in \nthis year alone to get sucked into this alternative minimum tax \nproblem.\n  Our friends on the other side are saying they have tax cuts for the \nmiddle class which they want to continue. I support continuing those \nmiddle-class tax cuts. But they are not dealing with the alternative \nminimum tax that used to be the millionaires' tax and rapidly becoming \na middle-class tax trap. They only deal with that for 1 year.\n  They have tax increases, as well, built into this budget that are \nvery disguised. It is going to affect millions and millions and \nmillions of people.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator enumerated the three concerns: a 10-year \nprojection of the cost of the tax cut, the alternative minimum tax; the \nSenator mentioned the failure to reflect in the budget any cost for our \ninvolvement in Iraq or Afghanistan. I want to be clear on this point. \nAm I correct in understanding that the budget which the President sent \nto the Congress for the next fiscal year beginning on October 1 of this \nyear, 2004--the budget he submitted to the Congress, the spending \nblueprint--has zero for the cost of Iraq and Afghanistan? Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. It is hard to believe, but it is true. The President \nis telling us he has put nothing in the budget because he says it is \nhard to estimate how much it will be. I have said to these \nrepresentatives, the thing we know is the right answer is not zero. \nThat is the thing we know for sure. Zero is not the right answer.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Absolutely. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Congressional Budget Office tells us that the 10-year \neffect of the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan, the war on terror is \n$280 billion. But the President's budget has nothing for it.\n  That is part of the reason I have said this budget doesn't reveal to \nthe American people our true financial condition. You have the \nexploding cost of the tax cuts beyond a 5-year window, you have the \ncost of fixing the alternative minimum tax to prevent it from sucking \nin more and more middle-class taxpayers, you have the cost of the war \nthat is not in the President's budget, then the biggest one of all, the \nPresident is going to take over the next 10 years $2.4 trillion from \nSocial Security. He is borrowing it from Social Security with no plan \nto pay it back. If you were running any other enterprise, if you were \nrunning a private company, you could not take the retirement funds of \nyour employees and use it to pay the other expenses of the enterprise. \nYou would be in violation of Federal law if you did that.\n  That is what this chart shows under the President's budget and under \nthe chairman's mark. Here is a chart that shows it very well. This is \nwhat is entirely hidden from people's view with respect to what is \nhappening to our fiscal condition. This shows the Social Security \nsurpluses by year. You can see the surpluses are exploding. The reason \nfor that is to get ready for the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration. But what our friends on the other side of the aisle are \ndoing with their plans is taking all of this money and using it to pay \nfor tax cuts and other expenditures now, leaving the cupboard bare for \nthe future. How are they going to pay back this money?\n  Mr. SARBANES. They are already talking about that around town. The \nother day, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve himself talked about \ncutting back on the benefits under Social Security.\n  Here is what has happened. It needs to be understood. There is a \ndirect connection.\n  These large tax cuts that primarily benefit very wealthy people--\nthere is some benefit for others, no question. The chairman talked \nabout that today, but in the total picture of where the benefits are \ngoing, that is a relatively small portion. Most of the benefits go \nright up to the top group in society by income and wealth. They say we \nare running deficits, so to cover the deficits they have to use up the \nSocial Security surplus. Then they say to correct the using up of the \nSocial Security surplus, we have to cut Social Security benefits.\n  It must be understood, these things are linked. The reason they have \nthe deficit which now says they must cut Social Security benefits is \nbecause they gave the very large tax cuts to the elite, producing the \ndeficit, which resulted in drawing down the Social Security surplus \nwhich then leads them to say, we have to cut the Social Security \nbenefits.\n  These are choices. This administration has made a choice. The choice \nthe administration has made is to put tax cuts for the elite ahead of \nsustaining Social Security benefits. That is the choice they have made. \nIt needs to be understood.\n  Does the Senator agree there is a direct connection in this regard?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. I knew we were going to get into this debate at some \npoint so I asked my staff to see if we could put together some charts \nand try to explain what is happening. It is the part of this discussion \nthat has received almost no attention, and the Senator is exactly \nright. Here is what is happening.\n  We have a dramatic increase in people eligible for Social Security. \nThis chart shows the number of Social Security beneficiaries exploding \nwith retirement of the baby boom generation. This is the increase in \npeople eligible. We will see in short order a doubling of the people \neligible for Social Security.\n  The President told us repeatedly:\n\n       None of the Social Security surplus will be used to fund \n     other spending initiatives or tax relief.\n\n  He broke that promise.\n\n[[Page S2269]]\n\n  He said:\n\n       Every dollar of Social Security and Medicare tax revenue \n     will be reserved for Social Security and Medicare.\n\n  He broke that promise.\n  Then he said:\n\n       We're going to keep the promise of Social Security and keep \n     the government from raiding the Social Security surplus.\n\n  He said that in a radio address in March of 2001.\n  Then he said in 2002:\n\n       None of the Social Security surplus will be used to fund \n     other spending initiatives or tax relief.\n\n  I went back and I said, let's add up how much money the President in \nhis budget is taking from the Social Security trust fund. He is \nborrowing $2.4 trillion. Compare that to the income tax cuts of the \nsame period, $2.5 trillion. Amazing how close these things are.\n\n  In effect, what he is doing is taking money from Social Security, \nraised by payroll taxes paid overwhelmingly by middle-income people. He \nis using it to fund tax cuts that are income tax cuts for \noverwhelmingly the wealthiest, and 33 percent of the benefit goes to \nthe top 1 percent, those earning over $337,000.\n  We have the spectacle of people, through their payroll taxes, funding \nan income tax reduction that goes primarily to the wealthiest among us \nand then creating a circumstance in which the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve comes in and says, Oops, we are overcommitted; we now have to \ncut Social Security benefits.\n  That is really kind of a stunning policy if one thinks about it, if \nyou think about who is adversely affected when you talk about cutting \nSocial Security benefits. Two-thirds of retirees rely on Social \nSecurity for more than half of their income; 31 percent get at least 90 \npercent of their income from Social Security; 50 percent to 89 percent \nof their income is 33 percent.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In other words, a third of the Nation's retirees get at \nleast 90 percent of their income from Social Security, another third \nget from between 50 and 90 percent of their income from Social \nSecurity. It demonstrates how dependent retired people are on Social \nSecurity to keep them out of poverty so they can lead a reasonable \nlife.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Chairman Greenspan now says we have to cut these benefits \nbecause we are overcommitted, because we have, in part, taken the \nmoney, the President has taken the money under his plan from Social \nSecurity to finance income tax cuts that have gone overwhelmingly to \nthe wealthiest of the people among us. That is the reality we confront.\n  Interestingly enough, they say, you have the shortfall in Social \nSecurity which is $3.8 trillion over the next 75 years. That is \nabsolutely true. We have a shortfall in Social Security of $3.8 \ntrillion over 75 years. Interestingly enough, the cost of the \nPresident's tax cuts over that same period is three times as much: \n$12.1 trillion.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Does that chart mean if one-third of the tax cuts that \nare being proposed to be made permanent, if only one-third of them \nremain not made permanent, that would more than cover the shortfall in \nSocial Security?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. If you look at this chart, it goes back to the point \nthe Senator was making about choices. This is all about choices. The \nchoices the President has made are, yes, to have tax cuts in a time of \neconomic weakness. That we could all understand and even support. We \nwould choose a different package of tax relief than he chose. We would \nhave targeted, clearly, more to the middle class because that would \nhave given us more of an economic boost than diverting so much of it to \nthe highest income in the country.\n\n  However, the President is digging a very deep hole. More and more \ndebt. More and more deficits. Deficits that explode right beyond the \nbudget window, right at the time the baby boom generation retires.\n  What happens? A future Congress and a future administration will have \nto make very tough choices, which I outlined earlier in my \npresentation. Very deep cuts in spending, very large tax increases, or \nsome combination to fill in these holes. That is where I fault the \nPresident for taking us on a course that is reckless and fundamentally \nnot conservative. This is a course that is reckless.\n  The Senator is right, we are talking about choices. These are the \nchoices that are made in the budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I appreciate my distinguished colleague \nfrom North Dakota joining with me in this exploration of the \nimplications of this budget.\n  I will talk about job creation for a moment, and to indicate any \nbudget we deal with, which is the most important Government document we \nact upon, contains thousands of decisions that are critical to our \nnational life. Those decisions reflect important choices in terms of \nthe priorities for our country.\n  We have just been engaged in a discussion about tax breaks for the \nwealthiest among us. Are we more concerned with strengthening Social \nSecurity to make sure that people in retirement are adequately covered \nor making the necessary investments in education, transportation, and \nthe environment? All of those decisions are involved in crafting the \nbudget.\n  In its composite, the budget is a very important macroeconomic \ndocument because it sets the fiscal path for dealing with the overall \neconomy.\n  We ask the question, Will the budget fund the programs, create jobs, \nand strengthen our economy? Will the budget have long-run structural \ndeficits? What will be the impact of those deficits on our future \neconomic performance? Will it move us toward full employment or away \nfrom it?\n  We talked about the credibility of the President's budget and the \nfact that it fails to account fully for what the projections should be. \nWe talked about the budget's failure to project for 10 years to show \nthe full cost of making these tax cuts permanent, the failure to adjust \nfor the alternative minimum tax, and the fact that the budget has zero \nin it for our involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Who are they kidding? Everyone knows that our involvement in Iraq and \nAfghanistan is going to cost something. Then they say: Well, we cannot \nreally estimate. They should make a good-faith estimate for inclusion \nin the budget. We are confronted with these facts, and again and again \nwe are not getting the full picture. It is a little bit like things are \nunder shells. If you lift off the cover, all of a sudden you discover \nanother problem.\n  When the President proposed his first massive tax cut, he told us, \n``We can proceed with tax relief without fear of budget deficits.'' \nThat is what President Bush said when he came into office.\n  In the first budget he submitted, he predicted, for fiscal year \n2004--the year we are now in--that we would have a $262 billion \nsurplus. This was the President's prediction.\n  The following year, with a budget already in deficit, the President \nadvocated another tax cut. At that time, he said, ``Our budget will run \na deficit that will be small and short term.'' And the President's \nbudget at that time--that is, the next year--stated the deficit would \nbe so short term that by fiscal year 2004--the year we are now in--the \nGovernment would be back in surplus by $14 billion.\n  Last year, on the brink of war with Iraq, the President proposed yet \nanother tax cut. He also submitted a budget that did not include the \ncost of the war. He predicted that the deficit for fiscal year 2004 \nwould be $307 billion.\n  Now, in 3 years, the President had shifted from predicting a surplus \nof $262 billion for 2004 to the next year when he predicted a surplus \nof $14 billion for 2004. Then, when he submitted the 2004 budget, he \npredicted a deficit of $307 billion. So over the 3-year period, we went \nfrom a $262 billion surplus, predicted for the year we are in, to a \n$307 billion deficit. That is a change of $569 billion.\n  It is pretty clear that although the President said, when he \nsubmitted the 2004 budget, he was predicting a deficit of $307 billion, \nit looks now as if the 2004 deficit will be about $520 billion. That is \n$780 billion more than the President predicted in 2001, $535 billion \nmore than he predicted in 2002, and $214 billion more than he predicted \nwhen he sent this year's budget--the budget we are in--to the Congress.\n\n[[Page S2270]]\n\n  So we are told we can do these big tax cuts and that it will not \nmatter because we are not going to have a deficit. And here we are \ndeeply in the hole.\n  What is the consequence of this? Some might say: Well, he is \nproducing jobs. We had an economic slowdown, and now we are producing \njobs. We are putting the country back to work.\n  Let's look at those predictions and what has actually happened.\n  In the 2002 Economic Report of the President, the administration \nforecasted that in 2004 the economy would have 138.3 million jobs. Last \nyear, the President lowered that estimate to 135.2 million jobs. And in \nhis most recent economic report, he lowered it again to 132.7 million \njobs. In other words, in just 2 years, the forecast for jobs in the \ncountry has been lowered by 6 million.\n  When the President passed the 2003 tax cut, the administration \npredicted that by January 2004, the economy would create over 2 million \njobs. In the fall of 2003, Secretary Snow predicted the U.S. economy \nwould create 2 million new jobs from the third quarter of 2003 until \nthe third quarter of 2004--an average of over 200,000 jobs a month.\n  What has happened? We just got the figures on Friday for the month of \nFebruary. For the month of February, it was reported that the economy \ncreated 21,000 new jobs in February--21,000--none of them in the \nprivate sector, incidentally; zero private sector jobs were created.\n  When Secretary Snow made this prediction of just over 2 million new \njobs last fall, we would have needed an average of about 200,000 new \njobs a month in order to meet his prediction. The performance has been \nso dismal, we have only averaged 59,000 new jobs per month over the \nlast 2 months. We have to produce jobs 444,000 a month from now until \nthe third quarter of this year for Secretary Snow's prediction to be \nborne out.\n\n  The economy is not creating these jobs. We face a real difficult jobs \nsituation.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I was looking at this same data, looking at the \nPresident's claim that they are going to create 2.6 million new jobs, \nand looking at where we are since they made that prediction. It is \nquite stunning.\n  In February, of these new jobs that were created, some 20,000, as the \nSenator indicated, not a single one was in the private sector, not one. \nThe whole assertion by the President, on his tax cut plans, has been, \nif you cut these taxes, you will get more jobs. He was not saying more \njobs in Government; he was saying more jobs in the private sector. Yet \nthe only new jobs we got in February were in Government. They were \nGovernment jobs. There was not a single new job in the private sector.\n  So if the President's plan is working, I do not see the evidence for \nit. The evidence is, it is failing, and it is failing by a big margin.\n  I believe one of the reasons maybe it is failing is that the tax cuts \nhe chose were tax cuts that were geared to the highest income people, \noverwhelmingly.\n  The Senator might be interested to know, I put up a chart that \nshowed, for 2006, the average tax cut going to somebody earning over $1 \nmillion a year is $140,000.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The tax cut alone.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The tax cut for that year alone, 2006. Under the \nPresident's plan, the tax cut for those earning over $1 million a year \nis $140,000.\n  The average middle-class individuals, those who are in the middle 20 \npercent of the income spectrum--you break it down into five 20-percent \ngroupings--the middle 20 percent, they get about $560 of tax benefit in \nthat year. The person earning over $1 million gets $140,000.\n  If you were going to put it on a graph and have the two related--the \ntax cut for those in the middle 20 percent and those earning over $1 \nmillion a year--the chart would have to be 35 feet tall to make a \ncomparison between what the wealthiest get and what the middle class \nget.\n  Maybe that is part of the reason this JOBS program is not working, \nbecause it has been so tilted to the highest end that we are not \ngetting money into the hands of middle-income people who would be more \nlikely to spend it, thereby spurring the economy.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Well, I say to my colleagues it is classic trickle-down \ntheory. It has been discredited before. Yet here it is back before us \nagain, classic trickle-down economics. Every administration since \nHerbert Hoover, which was, of course, classic trickle-down economics, \nDemocratic and Republican, has had a net creation of jobs over the \ncourse of its administration. In other words, over that 4-year period, \nevery administration were able to have a net gain in jobs.\n  This administration is about 2.3 million jobs below where the Nation \nwas when they came into office--down about 2.3 million jobs. It is the \nfirst administration since Herbert Hoover that will not show a net gain \nin jobs over the course of its 4-year tenure. That fact needs to be \nlaid out before the American people.\n  This recession we experienced began 35 months ago, the first few \nmonths into the Bush administration. The economy today has fewer jobs \nthan it did then. This is the first recession since the Great \nDepression in which the economy failed, over a 35-month period, to \nrecreate all the jobs that were lost in that recession. In a typical \nbusiness cycle, we long ago would have recouped those jobs and gone on \nfrom there. That has been the case--and this is a long time period--in \nevery recession we have experienced since the Great Depression.\n  But here we have a situation in which jobs are not being created to \nclose the gap, and there is no real prospect, in the few months \nremaining, of meeting Treasury Secretary Snow's prediction. To do so, \nwe would have to average about 444,000 jobs per month out into the fall \nof this year. Over the last 3 months, we averaged only 42,000 new jobs \nper month, as opposed to 440,000.\n  This, of course, raises a number of difficult problems. We have seen \nmanufacturing jobs continue to fall and they have now fallen for 43 \nconsecutive months. We see temporary jobs increasing. We see people \ndropping out of the labor force. Last month, 392,000 people left the \nlabor force. People come in and say, you know the unemployment rate \ndidn't go up. But if people drop out of the labor force and are not \nlooking for work, they are not counted as unemployed. One of the \nreasons is they become so discouraged they drop out. That helps to keep \nthe unemployment rate flat, but the exodus from the labor market is \nreflected in the job figures.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I was reading the New Yorker magazine last night and they \nhad two guys talking. One said:\n\n       I have quit looking for work; I understand that will help \n     the economy.\n\n  Well, it will help the economy because they quit counting him. That \nis the point the Senator is making. The Senator wasn't on the floor \nwhen I showed this chart. I would like the Senator to see this because \nit really makes a point he is making. This looks at the last nine \nrecessions since World War II, what happened in terms of job \nproduction. The Senator was making the point we are now 35 months into \nthis recession, and that is right here, this line, which shows the job \nrecovery this time compared to the last 9 recessions. You can see, in \nevery recession since World War II, 17 months after the peak of the \nbusiness cycle, job recovery started in a very healthy way. This time, \nit has not happened. We are 35, 36 months past the peak of the business \ncycle. Now we see we are 5.4 million jobs short of the typical \nrecovery.\n  If that isn't a warning sign to all of us that something is wrong \nhere, something is not working here--after every recession since World \nWar II we saw a healthy job recovery beginning 17 months after the \nbusiness cycle peak. Now we are at 36, 37 months past the business \ncycle peak and we still are not seeing job recovery.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, it is not only that we have \nnot been able to get up to here, we have not been able to even get back \nto the jobs we had at the beginning of the recession. We are still well \nbelow, about 2.3 million jobs, where we were when the recession began \nin the early months of 2001, absolutely.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. The chart says ``smallest share of the population at work \nsince 1994.'' That is really stunning. My\n\n[[Page S2271]]\n\ncolleague, the chairman of the committee, talked about having more \npeople at work than ever before. That is one way of looking at it. \nAnother way of looking at it is, what is the share of our population at \nwork. Of course, more people are at work; we have a much larger \npopulation than we have had before but jobs have not grown. If you look \nat the percentage of the people who are at work, we are at the lowest \nwe have been in 10 years--the smallest share of the population at work \nsince 1994.\n  I have another chart that shows the duration of unemployment, which \nis the highest in over 20 years. That is, when people become \nunemployed, they are taking the longest they have taken in 20 years to \nfind a new job. Something is not right here. Anybody who comes out on \nthe floor and asserts everything is fine, the economy is growing, jobs \nare being produced--no, no, no, things are not fine. There is something \nvery seriously wrong in this recovery. I just had a gentleman, I said \non the floor earlier, in business who told me, ``Senator, there is \nsomething very different from what we have seen in different \nrecoveries.'' He is in the machine tool business. He said, ``We should \nsee our order books filling up, and they are not.'' He said, ``I \nsuspect that the jobs being created are in China, Mexico, and India, \nand not here.''\n  That goes right to the heart of the point the Senator was making.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The last chart my colleague presented is an extremely \nimportant one because it shows the percent of long-term unemployed \namong the unemployed is at record levels, higher than it has been since \n1984. In fact, close to 23 percent of the unemployed workers have been \nunemployed for more than 26 weeks. It has been above 20 percent now for \n17 consecutive months. For a year and a half, the percent of unemployed \nwho are long-term unemployed is above 20 percent, which is an important \nbenchmark. The last time we had a period that ran that long was 20 \nyears ago. The Senator's chart showed exactly that. That was back in \n1984.\n  That is why this effort that has been repeatedly made on the floor of \nthe Senate and in the committee just last week to address extending \nunemployment insurance benefits is so important. That effort has been \nturned back. I plead with my colleagues on the other side to move ahead \non extending unemployment insurance benefits.\n  We still have a serious labor market weakness. We have not recovered \nthe jobs. It is not as though you could say a lot of job opportunities \nhave opened up and people can go back to work. That has not happened in \nthis instance.\n  Long-term unemployment is at record levels. Nearly 2 million people \nhave been unemployed for more than 26 weeks. Twenty-six weeks is the \nperiod that the traditional unemployment benefits cover. In the past, \nwe have always extended unemployment insurance benefits so people can \nmeet the problem of providing for their families. We have actually \nprovided more benefits in the past than we have in this recession.\n  In the previous Bush administration, the program was extended and \nthen extended again. We built up the unemployment insurance trust fund \nfor this purpose: to fund these benefits when we encounter an economic \ndownturn. There is over $15 billion in the unemployment insurance trust \nfund specifically collected for the purpose of paying unemployment \ninsurance benefits in an economic downturn.\n  I joined with my colleague in the committee the other day to offer an \namendment to make a provision within the budget for extending \nunemployment insurance benefits. Regrettably, it was turned down on a \nstraight party-line vote. I anticipate that amendment will be offered \nagain on the floor, and I hope my colleagues will reflect upon it \nbefore that occasion arises.\n  We need to do something. These are people who were working. You \ncannot collect unemployment insurance benefits unless you have a work \nrecord that entitles you to collect them. These are not, if you want to \nsay, malingerers or people who don't want to work. These are people who \nhad jobs. They lost their jobs through no fault of their own. If it is \ntheir fault, they cannot get unemployment insurance benefits. If they \nare to blame, if they have not performed on the job, they do not get \nunemployment insurance benefits. These are people who were working, in \nmany instances had a long working career. They are out of a job. They \nare in a labor market where jobs are not being created, as my colleague \ndramatically illustrated with the chart he showed. How are they going \nto provide for their families? What are these responsible, hard-working \nAmericans to do in terms of meeting the needs of their families?\n  Yet we have been turned back on the effort to extend unemployment \ninsurance benefits, and I very much hope when the issue comes before us \nthat Members will reflect and agree we need to do something about this \npressing problem.\n  I will make a couple more points before I close.\n  This fiscal situation of the United States in which we find ourselves \nand the magnitude of it has drawn very sharp comment from objective \nobservers. Listen to what the IMF said only recently:\n\n       U.S. Government finances have experienced a remarkable \n     turnaround in recent years. Within only a few years, hard-won \n     gains of the previous decade have been lost, and instead of \n     budget surpluses, deficits are again projected as far as the \n     eye can see.\n\n  Let me repeat that. This is the IMF commenting about U.S. Government \nfinances:\n\n       Within only a few years, hard-won gains of the previous \n     decade have been lost, and instead of budget surpluses, \n     deficits are again projected as far as the eye can see.\n\n  The President says he is going to cut the deficit in half by 2009. My \ncolleague pointed out, I think with great perception, that was not in \nthe cards. It is not sustained by the numbers.\n  If we are going to have a debate, we cannot just play around with the \nnumbers as though they do not mean anything. We have to have some hard \nfacts upon which to work. These structural deficits that are built in \nthis budget are extremely harmful to the economy as we move ahead--a \npromise to raise interest rates, reduce economic growth, decrease the \nnumber of jobs, increase our vulnerability to a sudden economic crisis. \nA responsible budget would not encompass a structural deficit, and if \nthere is a structural budget deficit, a responsible budget would seek \nto correct the imbalance.\n  I could go on at some length about the choices made within the budget \nwith respect to what our priorities ought to be, but I make this \nfundamental point: In every instance, there is a choice. You do not \nmake one decision, for instance, to cut taxes for very wealthy people \nwhich then results in a larger deficit and then turn around and say to \neducators who say, We cannot carry through on the No Child Left Behind \nlegislation, that there is no funding to address your complaint. That \ncomplaint is coming from all over the country. Out in the Rocky \nMountain States, we have educational officials telling us they cannot \ncarry through on that program. They are making that point very \nforcefully.\n  I was reading about it only today or yesterday in the paper. They \nsaid: We can't carry through on it. They are told, We can't carry \nthrough on it because we have this deficit to worry about. Why do we \nhave the deficit to worry about? We have this big deficit because we \nare doing these big tax cuts for wealthy people. So the choice that was \nmade in the President's budget was to do the tax cuts for the elite \nrather than fund the No Child Left Behind program. That was the choice.\n  I think that is a bad choice. I think the country thinks it is a bad \nchoice. But there is a need to understand when you put this budget \ntogether, whatever you do on the one hand has an impact on the other \nhand. You cannot avoid that.\n  If you did not do these extensive tax cuts--which the President wants \nto make permanent--with those huge costs, the deficit would not run up; \nyou would be able to hold the deficit down and do something about \neducation and health care. But the President has put the Nation in an \nabsolute deficit box.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. CONRAD. As part of my presentation earlier, I showed this \ntradeoff very directly. If we look at 2005, the cost of the tax cuts \nfor those who are in the top 1 percent, those who earn over $337,000 a \nyear, for the 1 year it is $45 billion. The amount the President is \nshorting No Child Left Behind for that same year is $9 billion.\n\n[[Page S2272]]\n\n  In fact, this is the chart. Ask and ye shall receive. This kind of \nreveals the President's priorities. Mr. President, $45 billion is the \ncost of the Bush tax cut for those making over $337,000 in 2005.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think that is less than 1 percent of the American \npublic; is it not?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The top 1 percent earns over $337,000. That costs $45 \nbillion. But he does not have the money, he says, to fund No Child Left \nBehind.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What that says is he could fund No Child Left Behind \nand he would still have $36 billion left of the tax cut; is that right?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is exactly what it shows. It shows he would only \nneed to reduce the tax cut to the wealthiest 1 percent by 20 percent in \norder to fund No Child Left Behind.\n  I said earlier I am in this category. We are very fortunate. My wife \nand I are in this category. I asked myself, would I be willing to give \nup 20 percent of my tax reduction to fund No Child Left Behind? I \nwould, because it is the future.\n  Chairman Greenspan has said if we are looking ahead to the \ncompetitive position of our country, the absolute key is education. Our \npeople have to be the best educated and the best trained if they are \ngoing to succeed in this highly competitive global environment.\n  This is about choices. The President is saying it is more important \nto have all of this $45 billion tax cut for those earning over $337,000 \nthan to take even one-fifth of it to provide for better education in \nthe country. I do not think that is the right priority. I think the \nSenator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. There are other examples of this. I offered an \namendment in the Budget Committee to fully fund the firefighter grant \nprogram. That amount is $900 million--not billions as we are talking \nhere but just $900 million. Two years in a row, the Congress has \nappropriated $750 million. So we have not appropriated the fully \nauthorized amount but we have gotten up fairly close to it at $750 \nmillion.\n  The President's budget submitted to the Congress had $500 million. In \nother words, it cut the program by one-third, $250 million, from the \nlevel it had been for 2 successive fiscal years. These are grants that \ngo out to firefighters across the country to try to enhance their \nprofessionalism, upgrade their equipment, better prepare them to deal \nwith the threats we confront.\n  One of the things we are very anxious to deal with is that one-third \nof all the firefighters in the country do not have the equipment, the \nbreathing equipment to protect them in a serious fire, from smoke \ninhalation. That is one of the things we would like to take care of. \nYet the President's budget proposed to the Congress cut the funding for \nthis program by one-third.\n  The President is now running political ads showing firefighters on 9/\n11 moving out of the wreckage, and there is a stretcher with a flag on \nit. We know what the firefighters did. We know the heroism they have \nshown.\n  Every year, I go to the National Fallen Firefighters ceremony, which \nis held at the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial, which is in \nEmmitsburg, Maryland, the location of the U.S. Fire Academy. Families \ncome from all over the country. There is a weekend of events and \nceremonies to mark the memory and the heroism of fallen firefighters. \nThe year after 9/11 we could not do it in Emmitsburg. There were too \nmany people and so the ceremony was held at the MCI Center in \nWashington because the number jumped so tremendously as a consequence \nof those deaths in New York.\n  In money terms, that is not a big item, but in its significance and \nin what it stands for, I think it is very substantial. We know our \nfirst responders place themselves at risk. They are the first called \nupon.\n\n  There were firefighters going up the steps of the World Trade Center \nin an effort to rescue people when people in the building were coming \ndown the steps in order to escape. In effect, they were placing \nthemselves in further danger in order to save their fellow human \nbeings. They did not know these people. They were all strangers to them \nbut they were responding to their duty. It is extraordinary when we \nstop and think about it.\n  The impact of it is obviously recognized by some of the President's \npeople because they are putting it in this political ad. But I would \nlike to see them take the program up to $900 million to do the \nfirefighter grants so we could provide firefighters across the country \nwith the protective equipment which they need as they carry out this \nvery dangerous occupation. That would require only $400 million. The \nPresident's tax cuts provide $45 billion for the top 1 percent. Will \nthe top 1 percent, those making over $337,000, who are getting an \nenormous--what is the tax return they are getting? Does the Senator \nhave that figure in his mind, $120,000 or something?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is those earning over $1 million.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Those earning over $1 million get $127,000 per year. As \na category, they get $45 billion. Would they be willing to reduce that \nto $44,600,000,000 in order that we could fund these firefighter grants \nat the full authorization level of $900 million instead of the $500 \nmillion that is in the President's budget, which itself represented a \ncut of $250 million from what Congress had appropriated in each of the \nother 2 years?\n  Is it unfair, inequitable, unjust to say that in the order of \npriorities, funding those firefighter grants should come ahead of a \nsmall portion of these tax cuts for those making $337,000 a year? I \ndefy anyone to argue the equities of that case.\n  That is why this is not a good budget. That is why we voted against \nit in the committee and that is why over the coming days, under the \nleadership of our very able colleague from North Dakota, we will put \nbefore this body--I and others and certainly the Senator from North \nDakota himself--amendments that will frame the choice in terms of \npriorities. Those are the choices we need to face. Let's put the \nchoices out there.\n  Do my colleagues think it is reasonable to take a small portion of \nthis tax cut and use it for this purpose, or must every single penny of \nwhat the President is seeking for the very elite go to the very elite, \ndespite these other pressing needs?\n  As I understand it, in the coming days this week, opportunities will \nbe presented to offer amendments which will frame those choices. The \nSenator has framed one. Everyone talks a good game about education, \nincluding the President. The question is, will you put the resources \nthere to do the job?\n\n  As the Senator points out, fully funding education is more costly \nthan the example that I have been citing. But nevertheless, for just \nover $9 billion we could fully fund No Child Left Behind, which would \naddress what we are hearing from the States, who are saying now, We \ncan't do this job. You have saddled us with a job without the \nresources. The $9 billion is one-fifth of this tax cut that is going to \nthose making over $337,000 each and every year.\n  Those amendments framing those choices need to be put to this body. I \nlook forward to the responses my colleagues will make to them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to \nrespond to some of the comments that have been made. I have been \nlistening to the debate for the last 3 or 4 hours. It brought back a \nlot of memories to me.\n  I ran for Congress about 12 years ago, to the House of \nRepresentatives. I got elected and spent 6 years there before I then \nran for the Senate. In my first race for the Congress we had a giant \ndeficit. We had deficits in the hundreds of billions of dollars range \nfor years. I ran on a platform of balancing the Federal budget. This is \nthe debate we had at that time.\n  First, there were those who said you can't balance the Federal budget \nor, if you could, it would be bad for the management of the Federal \nbudget and we couldn't run the Federal Government very well if we \ndidn't use deficit spending. That argument was debunked when, after \nabout 6 or 7 years of effort starting in about 1994, we did balance the \nFederal budget. Frankly, we did very well running the Federal \nGovernment, paying down the national debt, and making a lot of fiscal \nprogress.\n  The other argument that was made back then when I ran for Congress, \nand which is still being made and is the argument that is being made \ntoday, only in a different way, was we had to have\n\n[[Page S2273]]\n\nhigher taxes and higher spending in order to have a successful society \nin America. We could not stop the tax increasing, we could not stop the \nincreased Federal spending, because it was best for all Americans that \nwe have a large, powerful, centralized Federal Government that had \nincreasingly more control over the economy; that we nationalize our \nhealth care system; that we increasingly find Federal solutions to \nproblems as they exist throughout society; and that the private sector \nsimply could not provide the solutions that were needed.\n\n  It was the age-old battle of taxing and spending and a centralized, \nlarge, powerful Federal Government versus those who believed we should \nget the tax rates reduced, lower the tax take of this Federal \nGovernment from our economy, let the economy have the stimulus that \nwould thereby be generated by letting people and businesses have more \ncontrol of the individual decisions about the use of their resources, \nand try to control the deficit and the size of the Federal Government \nby controlling spending.\n  Those were two objectives for which many of us fought. I was there in \nCongress when we fought for and got a balanced budget. The first \nobjective was to balance the Federal budget, to stop spending more than \nwe were raising in revenue. The second objective was to reduce the size \nof the Federal Government. Many of us felt it had grown too large, that \nits reach was too far, and that it impeded the ability of the American \npeople to have the kind of choices in their own lives, in their own \nbusinesses, they needed in order to achieve the American dream. It was \na classic, age-old battle in American politics, and we are hearing it \non the floor today.\n  As I have listened during the last number of hours, I have heard \nattacks primarily on the President. There has not been a lot of mention \nof the actual budget that is on the floor today. There has been some, \nbut not a lot. Most of the attacks have been on the President, saying \nthe economy is in bad shape, we don't have as many jobs as we want, we \nhave a terrible circumstance facing us fiscally in this country, the \ndeficit is high and we need to do something about it. It has been posed \nhere that everybody should see we have a problem and, in fact, I think \nwe all do see we have a problem. But as I have been listening to the \nsolutions that have been proposed by those who attack the President, I \nhave seen two solutions. One is they attack the tax cuts in the last 2 \nor 3 years and apparently would like to see those taxes raised. In \nother words, increase taxes. That is one of the proposed solutions. The \nother solution is spend more money.\n  There are a lot of very important programs that will be brought up. \nSome have been brought up today. Others will be brought up throughout \nthis week.\n  As we debate this budget, I think you will see it will come down to \nthat age-old argument I debated when I first ran for Congress 12 years \nago and that we have debated virtually every year in one guise or \nanother since that time. There will be those who want to blame every \nproblem we have in this country on the fact we cut taxes a few times in \nthe last 3 years and that we are not spending enough money in the \nFederal budget, that we need higher taxes and more spending, and that \nwill solve our social and fiscal ills.\n  There are others of us who will argue that by cutting taxes we are \nable to stimulate the economy, stimulate investment in capital, give \npeople the ability to consume, and thereby give greater confidence and \nstrength to the economy, and certainly give people more control over \nwhat happens with the dollars they earn than they would have had if \nthey were taxed on those dollars and sent those dollars to Washington.\n  The budget we actually have before us today is one that does maintain \nour effort to stimulate our investment in capital. It does give and \nstrengthen and protect the tax relief to all taxpayers so we can have \nstronger consumer spending and stronger consumer confidence. It builds \nup and focuses on strengthening the infrastructure, especially in our \nrural areas where we need so much to have a strong investment in the \ninfrastructure so we can have stronger economic development potential. \nThis budget focuses on controlling spending.\n\n  Remember, I said there were two objectives we fought for early on. \nOne was to balance the budget, the other was to control the immense \ngrowth of the Federal Government. You can actually balance this budget \nby simply raising taxes. It is a mathematical calculation. You figure \nout how far you are out of balance, how much spending you have done \nbeyond your means and beyond your revenue, and raise taxes to meet it. \nYou can balance the budget. But by doing so you have totally ignored \none of the more important priorities we should have here, and that is \nto identify the right size of the Federal Government; to recognize the \ntenth amendment that said there was an important role for the Federal \nGovernment, but that those powers not specifically given to the Federal \nGovernment were reserved to the States and to the people respectively. \nThat is the kind of debate you will see played out in one context or \nanother throughout the remainder of this week.\n  It has been said there is no provision for the war against terror in \nthis budget. Actually, the budget we are debating on the floor today \nprovides for a $30 billion threshold for a supplemental appropriation \nfor our spending, if we need it, in the war against terror.\n  It has been said the tax cuts that were passed by this Congress in \nthe past few years are the problem we are dealing with today. I think \nthat is interesting because I believe most Americans realize the tax \ncuts that were passed in the last few years all had expiration dates on \nthem because, as a result of some of the procedures here in the Senate, \nwe could not get permanent tax relief. So those tax cuts over the next \n10 years are going to start expiring. The first three of those tax cuts \nto expire, to go away, will happen this year. If this budget is not \nadopted, then the people who got that tax relief are going to lose it \nand their taxes are going to go back up.\n  To listen to the debate you would think the tax relief that was \npassed by this Congress was solely focused on the wealthy.\n  As a matter of fact, it has been pointed out that because the wealthy \nin this country pay so much of the taxes, when there is tax relief they \nget a large part of the tax relief that comes back to them. But the tax \nrelief we passed was weighted percentagewise more for the lower and \nmiddle classes. You can either look at it in terms of dollars or in \nterms of percentages. But the percentage the wealthy pay of the income \ntax in this country went up after the last tax cut--not down--because \nthe greater percentage of focus was on the middle and lower classes.\n  It is three of the taxes that hit and support those middle and lower \nclasses that are coming up for expiration this year. The first is the \nexpansion of the 20-percent income tax bracket by expanding the amount \nof income tax at the 20-percent level. We gave a broad level of tax \nrelief to those who pay the lowest level of tax in this country. That \nwill expire this year if this budget is not adopted.\n  The second is the marriage tax penalty. The elimination of the \nmarriage tax penalty will expire this year if this budget is not \nadopted.\n  Third, the $1,000 child tax credit.\n  Those who stand on the floor here and say all the tax relief we \npassed in the last few years is devastating this economy are going to \nget a chance to vote this year on whether to let those tax cuts stay in \nplace. I predict the support on both sides of the aisle for maintaining \nthose tax cuts is going to be very broad. Those tax cuts were directed \nat those in the very middle and lower income classes which the tax \nrelief bills focused on in an effort to reform the code.\n  But then it is true there were other parts of that tax relief which \ndid benefit those who are in upper income brackets. If you listen to \nthe debate today, I guess you would assume if we went back and \neliminated those tax cuts, the economy would be fine, employment would \ngo back, the deficit would be eliminated, and probably all other ills \nwe have heard about today would go away.\n  What are these tax cuts we are talking about? There are a number of \nthem. But one of the most important, in my mind, was cutting in half \nthe tax rate on dividends, undoubtedly one of the\n\n[[Page S2274]]\n\nstrongest things we could do to encourage investment in the capital \nstructure in our Nation.\n  Another was the acceleration of depreciation for small businesses so \nthey could get a little bit better handle on growing their small \nbusinesses rather than sending their small business revenues to the \nGovernment in Washington.\n  Another was to give those sole proprietorships--those small \nbusinesses that were sole proprietorships--the opportunity to have \ntheir tax brackets reduced.\n  I believe if you eliminate those tax relief measures, you are going \nto reduce the ability of our small businesses in this country to be \nresilient and you are going to reduce the investment in capital in this \neconomy, and you will see the strength of the economy go down, not up.\n  But that is the debate we are having over whether we should have more \ntaxes and that is better for the economy or whether we should have \nreform of our Tax Code and reduce taxes in those areas that discourage \nproper tax policy.\n  I would like to talk for a minute about what did happen.\n  Again, to hear the debate in the last few hours you would think the \nentire economic difficulty we face today in our Nation is a result of \nthat portion of the tax relief we gave previously which went to those \nwho were not in the lower and middle-class tax categories. What in \nreality happened was we had a stock bubble growth in this country that \npopped. The confidence in the stock market dropped precipitously. \nFollowing that, there was an attack on 9/11 in which terrorists \nattacked us on our homeland soil in one of the rare times in the \nhistory of our country where that has happened. As a response to that, \nthe economy dipped even further. Consumer confidence waned. Following \nthat, we have had some scandals--some debacles with the WorldCom \nproblem, the Enron problem, and consumer confidence in the marketplace \nwent even further into the tank and the economy started dipping even \nfurther.\n\n  Frankly, to blame all of the problems we have had on tax relief for \nthe wealthy is a vast oversimplification. What happened as a result of \nall of these things is the economy went way into the tank, and revenue \nto the Federal Government went through the floor. As a result of that, \nwe did not have the kind of revenue we had projected we would have.\n  In addition, our spending went through the roof. We responded to the \nwar against terrorism by rebuilding New York and Washington, DC, giving \nsupport to those who had been attacked here on our homeland soil by \ndeveloping a new Department of Homeland Security, increasing the \nmeasures and the support we put into defending our homeland, and we \nhave prosecuted a war against terror across the globe which has \ninvolved two wars, not to mention the overall extent of the cost of \nfighting terrorists on many fronts. As a result, spending has gone \nthrough the roof.\n  There is one other thing, by the way, that made spending go through \nthe roof. About two-thirds of the Federal budget is on autopilot, \nmandatory spending this budget can't control with much success, and \nthat simply goes on growing regardless of the state of the economy. The \nentitlement programs of this country have an autopilot status that \ncauses increased growth regardless of what is happening in the economy. \nThat is another one of the big pressures on the spending in Washington.\n  Those are the things that are really going on here which we ought to \nbe debating. But instead, it is a Presidential election year and \neverything is the fault of the President because he cut taxes, because \nhe won't support enough new spending. The President would love to \nsupport spending on all of the pet projects and all of the very \nimportant and valuable items in the budget which because of these \ndeficits we face he has had to control. The President, I am sure, would \nlove on a number of these issues to support additional funding. But he \nhas said that outside of our national defense and outside of our \nhomeland security, he is going to try to hold the growth of the \nspending at the Federal level to less than one-half of 1 percent on the \nrest of the budget. He is going to do so because in addition to \nrecognizing we have to deal with our deficit problems through good tax \npolicy and through stimulation of the economy, because it is a strong \neconomy that will help us get out of this, if anything will, he also \nrecognizes the other side of the coin is we have to solve this problem \nthrough focusing on the spending side of this budget.\n  Last year, when we had a similar budget before this Congress and \nbefore this Senate, we had something in the neighborhood of 80 \namendments to the budget. I would bet there are going to be dozens and \ndozens of amendments to this budget. Last year we defeated most of \nthose amendments because we had budget points of order and a \nrequirement of 60 votes in order to break this budget. Last year, we \ndefeated almost every one of those 80 or 81 amendments. If my memory \nserves me correctly, there was something in the neighborhood of $800 \nbillion in new spending over a 10-year cycle in those 80 to 81 \namendments which we defeated. Certainly, every one of them had a \nconstituency, every one of them had a valid reason why it was a good \nproposal for a good cause for some spending to be made. But we had to \ntry to control this deficit. That is what we did. That is what we will \ndo again.\n\n  I am sure as these proposals are made and as efforts to attack this \nbudget are made, almost all of them will be couched in the argument \nthat it is the tax cut on the wealthy which has made this problem for \nus, and simply taxing the wealthy more will solve this problem for us. \nWe can tax the wealthy and spend the money and we will be fine in this \ncountry.\n  You can only pursue that line of thought to a certain point. I am \nsure it has already been said here on the floor by others, but that top \n1 percent and that top 5 percent already pay the vast majority of the \nincome tax in this country. The last tax relief we gave made their \npercentage share of the taxes in this country grow, not go down. At a \ncertain point, we have to realize we will have a strong economy, and we \nwill have a strong Federal budget if we hold the line on tax increases \nand hold the line on spending and pay attention to both balancing the \nbudget and trying to maintain the correct size of this Federal \nGovernment.\n  There are many more things that need to be said. I unfortunately have \nan appointment in just a few minutes to which I have to go. But there \nwill be a lot of debate that will go on during this week as we clash \nover the proper fiscal policies of this Government.\n  I encourage everyone in this country who listens to the debate this \nweek to listen to it with an understanding of what is really being \ndebated. It is the age-old fight between those who want higher taxes \nand higher spending and a more powerful, centralized Federal Government \nwith an increasing reach into the economy, and those who want to keep \ntaxes lower, who believe that is a stimulus to the economy, and who \nwant to downsize and rightsize the Federal Government. In one way or \nanother, virtually all of the debate we will have this week will focus \non that issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, my colleague keeps referring to pet \nprojects. We on our side do not believe it is a pet project to educate \nthe children of this country. We on our side do not believe putting \ncops on the street is a pet project. We do not believe funding our \nfirefighters is a pet project.\n  But I am very glad the Senator has talked about the record on debt. \nHere is the Republican record on debt. When the President took office, \nthe projection for the publicly held debt was $36 billion. In the \nPresident's 2002 budget, that increased to $1.2 trillion. After his tax \ncut passed, that increased to $1.6 trillion. In the President's 2003 \nbudget, the debt went up to $3.3 trillion. In the President's 2004 \nbudget, it went up to $5 trillion; with the Senate GOP budget for next \nyear, $5.5 trillion.\n  If our friends want to have a debate about who is responsible for the \ngrowth of the debt, it is squarely on their shoulders. Their budgets \nhave passed. They have shredded this deficit and debt. They can say \nthey are interested in fiscal responsibility. They have not\n\n[[Page S2275]]\n\nwalked the walk and they have not voted the votes.\n  I wish our colleague had not had to leave because he has come back \nwith this old canard that I heard again in the committee saying that we \noffered amendments that added to the debt last year, or would have if \nonly the Republicans had not defeated them. The problem with that \nargument is it is not true.\n  Here is what happened. Democratic amendments on the Budget Resolution \nwere all paid for last year, and more than paid for, so that we would \nactually reduce the deficits, reduce the growth of debt. If you took \nall of the amendments we offered, they did not increase the deficit. \nNo, no. Let's go to the record. What actually happened? Our amendments \non the Budget Resolution would have reduced the deficit by $687 \nbillion.\n  I am so glad the Senator brought this up because I have a list of \nevery Democratic amendment to the Budget Resolution, that I will print \nin the Record, offered last year, what the cost was, and what the \noffset was. If any Member wants the opportunity to go back and check \nthe record, here is their chance. What they will find is on every \namendment, Democrats paid for their amendments, and Democrats also \nincluded deficit reduction. At the end of the day, if all of our \namendments would have been adopted, we would have reduced the deficit \nby $687 billion.\n  In addition, our friends on the other side are trying to rewrite \nhistory. They are trying to act as though our amendments last year were \na package. They were not a package. They also want to act as though \nthey were amendments for 10 years. Half of them were not. Half of them \nwere 1-year amendments. In each and every case, we not only paid for \nour amendments on the Budget Resolution, we had additional deficit \nreduction.\n  For example, Senator Biden offered an amendment to fund the COPS \nProgram, $1 billion in cost, and he provided $2 billion of offset. He \npaid for the amendment, plus he provided $1 billion of deficit \nreduction.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record so \nhopefully our colleagues will not keep repeating these false claims \nthey have made in the past.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n DEMOCRATIC SPENDING AMENDMENTS TO 2004 SENATE GOP BUDGET PROVIDED FOR $687 BILLION IN DEFICIT REDUCTION OVER 10\n                                                      YEARS\n                                              [Dollars in billions]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                      10-year\n     Amendment No.                 Sponsor                      Purpose              spending     10-year offset\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n278....................

Every single time I have heard our friends on the other \nside claim the Democratic amendments to the Budget Resolution would \nhave increased the deficit, it is absolutely false. Go back and read \nthe amendments. The deficits would have been reduced under our \namendments because we provided fully the offsets for each of those \namendments.\n  We can go down the list. In fact, I had an amendment to fund IDEA and \ncompletely paid for it. Senator Lautenberg had an amendment restoring \nthe defense cuts. Members will recall, there were defense cuts last \nyear. Senator Lautenberg fully funded defense and provided the money to \ndo so. On homeland security, there were increases offered to better \nprotect the country. It was fully paid for, plus an amount for deficit \nreduction. Every single amendment was fully paid for. Accumulate the \ntotals, it is $687 billion of deficit reduction.\n  Our friends on the other side talked about the record on deficit \nreduction. I am glad he did because here is what has happened to the \ndeficits over time. We can see on this chart going back to 1969, the \nlast time we had record deficits was in the administration of the \nprevious President Bush. President Clinton came in 1992, and we can see \nthe deficit went down each and every year until we were back in \nsurplus. It was only when this new Republican President took office \nthat we again went back into deficits and now have gone into record \ndeficit territory, the biggest deficits in the history of the country.\n  Here is what has happened to Federal spending. The Senator from Idaho \nwants to posture this as a question of spending, who is responsible for \nspending, and that spending is the reason we have deficits.\n  No, we have deficits because we spend more than our income. Deficits \nare a function of spending and revenue, not just a factor of spending \nbut a question of spending, the relationship between spending and \nrevenue.\n  This chart shows going back to 1981 spending as a share of our gross \ndomestic product. Go to 1992 when a Democrat took control, and what \nhappened to spending as a share of our gross domestic product? Spending \nwent down each and every year from about 22 percent of gross domestic \nproduction to 18 percent of gross domestic production. Spending has now \ngone back up with our friends on the other side in charge of the White \nHouse. And I don't fault them for the increases; 91 percent of the \nincreases in spending were for defense, homeland security, and \nresponding to the attack on September 11. We all supported that \nincrease in spending, as well we should have. We had to defend this \ncountry.\n  However, I remind my colleagues, when Democrats were in charge in \n1993, we put in place a 5-year deficit reduction plan without a single \nRepublican vote, and we reduced spending each and every year of that 5-\nyear plan. In 1997, we had a bipartisan plan. Thankfully, that was a \nnice moment in time. We\n\n[[Page S2276]]\n\nhad a bipartisan agreement. We continued to take spending down. \nSpending has now bumped up because of what has happened.\n  Let's look on the revenue side. On the revenue side, again, President \nClinton came in and revenue went up. It was that combination of \nspending going down under the Democratic plan, and revenue going up \nthat got us back into balance, and stopping the use of Social Security \nfor other purposes. That is the Democratic record on spending and \nrevenue. We lowered spending. We raised revenue so that we balanced the \nbudget, and stopped the raid on Social Security.\n  Our friends on the other side have raised spending--and I don't fault \nthem for that because it had to be done to respond to the attack on \nthis country--but they also dramatically cut revenue. Here is what has \nhappened to revenue. It has been shredded. We will have the lowest \nrevenue this year as a percentage of GDP since 1950. It is that \ncombination of increased spending and reduced revenue that has \nmushroomed the deficits.\n  Let's be honest. I don't think the deficits we are facing at the \nmoment are the basis for our strongest criticism of the President's \nproposals. Anyone who is honest would acknowledge once we had been \nattacked, once we had to increase defense spending, increase homeland \nsecurity spending, the economy took a hit, we would expect budget \ndeficits.\n  Our criticism of the President and his preliminary is that he is \nsuggesting deficits from now forward as far as the eye can see. He \nnever wants to balance the spending and the revenue. Oh, he wants to \nkeep the spending going. They say he is going to restrain spending.\n\n  Please, the spending he is restraining in his budget is 17 percent of \nFederal spending. He is going to save about $7 or $8 billion when the \noperating deficit, this year, is $700 billion. That is a 1-percent \nsolution the President has come with. He is solving 1 percent of the \nproblem.\n  Now, let's get serious. Let's be direct and honest with people. \nTalking about that restraining spending is going to solve the problem, \nand you come in here and save $7 billion, when you have a $700 billion \nproblem, and suggesting you are solving the problem? That is not real. \nThat is not serious. That is not credible. That does not stack up.\n  What the President is proposing is increasing spending and cutting \nrevenue, when we already have record budget deficits. And what does it \ndo? It balloons the deficits and the debt at the worst possible time, \nright before the baby boomers retire. That is the President's plan: to \nput us deeper and deeper into the deficit ditch, to take every penny of \nSocial Security surplus over the next 10 years--$2.4 trillion--every \npenny of which has to be paid back. The President has no plan to do it.\n  The President says he is cutting the deficit in half over the next 5 \nyears? The only way he is cutting the deficit in half is if he leaves \nout things, he leaves out that there is a war going on. He says there \nis no war cost past September 30. That is what his budget says: zero to \nfund this war past September 30; nothing for Iraq, nothing for \nAfghanistan, nothing for the war on terror.\n  He says he is going to fully and aggressively prosecute the war on \nterror, but he has no money to do it. Zero is not the right answer. \nThat is what is in the President's budget to fight the war in Iraq, to \nfight the war in Afghanistan, to fight the war on terror. The President \nhas a big goose egg past September 30 of this year.\n  And tax cuts? The President says: Do not worry. Do not worry, my \nbudget will cut the deficit in half over the next 5 years. What he does \nnot tell people is, beyond the 5-year window, the cost of his tax cuts \nexplode.\n  He also leaves out the alternative minimum tax. It affects 3 million \npeople now, the old millionaire's tax that is now becoming a middle-\nclass tax trap. The President deals with that crisis for 1 year, does \nnothing for the next 4 years--a problem that is growing geometrically. \nIt is going to affect 40 million people by the end of this budget \nperiod. The President does nothing past the first year.\n  The President's budget adds $3 trillion to the national debt in the \nnext 5 years. This is the President who told us he was going to have \nmaximum paydown of the debt, and he is increasing the debt by $3 \ntrillion over just the next 5 years, and all of it at the worst \npossible time--right before the baby boomers retire.\n  I have shown chart after chart today showing the long-term \nimplications of the President's plan. The long-term implications are to \ndig this deficit hole deeper and deeper and deeper as you go out into \nfuture years. The cost of his tax cuts explode at the very time the \ntrust funds of Social Security and Medicare go cash negative. He is \nputting us in a situation that will require the most agonizing of \ndecisions in the future.\n\n  No, our chief complaint against the President's budget is not the \ndeficits being run now, although they are of record proportion. Our \nchief criticism of the President's budget is he has us on a course to \nballoon the deficits and the debt in future years, right before the \nbaby boomers retire, compelling a future Congress and future President \nto make tough choices.\n  On the question of the tax choices the President has made, when I \nhear it said, ``Oh, really, the wealthy in the country are paying \nmore,'' please, the wealthy in the country are paying more? I do not \nknow how anybody can stand on the floor of the Senate and seriously \nassert the wealthy are paying more. I have just shown that those \nearning over $1 million a year, under the President's proposal, in \n2006, are going to get a $140,000 tax cut, on average, in that year.\n  The wealthy are paying more? Who are we kidding? In 2005, the top 1 \npercent, those earning over $337,000, are going to get a $45 billion \ntax cut. That is the cost of the tax cut going to the wealthiest 1 \npercent. The cost of the tax cut for those earning over $1 million a \nyear, in 2005, is $27 billion. The President chose a set of tax \npolicies that overwhelmingly go to the wealthiest among us.\n  I put up a chart earlier that showed the top 1 percent--those earning \nover $337,000--get 33 percent of the benefit of the tax cut in 2005--33 \npercent, the top 1 percent.\n  The President said this is all to get the economy moving. Look, I \nbelieve it was important to have tax reductions to get the economy \nmoving. Of course, it is not just the tax reductions, it is also the \nspending. About half the stimulus in the last 3 years has been \nspending; about half of it has been tax cuts. Both of those were \nwarranted.\n  The problem is, the tax cut mix the President chose did not give us \nthe biggest bang for the buck at creating jobs or growing the economy. \nAnd that is not just my view, that is the Congressional Budget Office's \nview. They were asked to look at all of the tax cut proposals and tell \nus what kind of bang for the buck you would get. Interestingly enough, \nthe tax cut on personal capital gains, they said, would give you a \nsmall bang for the buck--small--yet that was singled out as one of the \nimportant areas for tax reduction.\n  The same is true on the dividend tax reduction that our colleague \nmentioned. He said that was a centerpiece. Well, it was a centerpiece \nin terms of what it cost. It was not a centerpiece in terms of what \nmost economists would tell you is bang for the buck at getting economic \ngrowth and job creation. I believe that is a fundamental reason we are \nin the circumstance of today.\n  Yes, we should have stimulated the economy. Yes, we should have had \ntax cuts. Yes, we should have had increased Government spending to give \na lift to the economy. But the tax cuts should have been geared to \nprimarily the middle class. They are the folks who spend the money. \nInstead, this tax cut proposal has gone primarily to the wealthiest \namong us, those who are the most likely to save the money rather than \nspend it. However laudatory it is to save money, the thing that \nstimulates the economy, at least in the short term, is to spend it. \nThis is a bad set of choices.\n  In addition to that, going forward, the President's proposal will dig \nus into a deeper and deeper deficit ditch, creating a circumstance, \nwhen the baby boomers start to retire, that will become more and more \ndifficult and require tough choices.\n  What is going to be needed is not just tax increases, no. We need \nmore revenue. The first place we ought to look is not tax increases but \nclosing the tax gap, the difference between what people owe and what \nthey pay because we\n\n[[Page S2277]]\n\nknow the vast majority of people pay what they owe. But we have a small \ngroup of people and companies who do not. We now know that is costing \nus $255 billion a year. That is not a tax cut. That is somebody \ncheating on their taxes, cheating all the rest of us, cheating the \nability of this country to meet its requirements of national defense \nand homeland security. That is the first place we ought to go to begin \nto close this gap.\n  Yes, we are going to have to be tough on the spending side, too. It \nis going to take both. We are going to have to restrain the growth of \nspending, and we are going to have to get more revenue. It is as clear \nas it can be. Anybody who tells you something other than that is not \nbeing straight.\n  I hope before we are done we will have a healthy debate on the \npriorities of the country. I believe one of our top priorities is to \nget our fiscal house in order. Now that we have economic recovery \nunderway, we have to move back to fiscal balance. We have to reduce \nthese deficits that are at record levels, and not just by make believe.\n  The President says he is cutting the deficit in half in the next 5 \nyears. He says the deficit is only going to be $237 billion in that \nfifth year. But when we total up the things we know are going to be the \ncosts, including the war and fixing the alternative minimum tax and the \nmoney that he is taking from Social Security and Medicare that has to \nbe paid back, what we see in that fifth year is not $237 billion being \nadded to the national debt; it is $600 billion. It is $600 billion the \nnext year and $600 billion the next year and $600 billion the next \nyear. What we see happening is, right before the baby boomers retire, \nan explosion of the national debt under this President's plan. That \ncannot be the answer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield the Senator such time as he may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Nickles, for his leadership. \nWe will miss him desperately in this Senate. He has chosen not to seek \nreelection, which he would have handled easily, and we are certainly \ngoing to miss him. His handling of this budget process this year was \nparticularly skillful, principled, filled with integrity and good \njudgment.\n  I also appreciate the ranking member, Senator Conrad. He is a skilled \nman with the numbers of this budget. He can find more bad numbers in \nthis budget than most anybody I know, but a lot of those numbers need \nto be talked about. He is correct. We have some long-term problems with \nfinancial stability. It is great to debate and have people discuss our \nchallenges and have the numbers put out there and not hide anything as \nwe go forward.\n  I believe we have produced a budget that is responsible, that the \nAmerican people, if they understand it, could appreciate and would \nsupport in general. We will continue to debate it, and it will pass I \nbelieve, much as it has been written.\n  What we had to do is confront the situation of declining revenue to \nour Government. It has come from a number of different reasons, \nprimarily because the economy has not been as healthy as we would like \nit, although we have seen some positive rebound. We ought to talk about \nthat and we should consider that as we evaluate how we are going to \nhandle the country's financial situation.\n  To sum up where we are, President Bush submitted a budget he believed \nfunded the Government's discretionary accounts, including defense and \nhomeland security and all other discretionary accounts, at $818 \nbillion.\n  We were operating in the Senate under a budget of last year that \ncalled for us to stay at $814 billion, $4 billion less. So we decided \nthe right thing for us to do was produce a budget at 814. Then, as we \ncontinued to score the proposals in the President's budget, that budget \ncame in at $823 billion. So to go from $823 billion to $814 billion \nthere was $9 billion we had to confront as we worked from the \nPresident's budget.\n  Unfortunately, we had to take a sizable sum from the proposed \nincrease in defense spending. The budget called for an increase of $26 \nbillion for defense, 7 percent, the largest aggregate increase in the \nbudget. We were forced to come in at a $20 billion increase for \ndefense. We made other decisions and reduction changes. Certainly, I \nhope this Congress will support the President's proposals to eliminate \nsome 50 or 60 programs that need to be eliminated.\n  Everybody knows that we too seldom confront spending programs that \nhave a certain value on the surface but, if examined carefully and with \nan eye toward efficiency and productivity and wise use of the \ntaxpayers' dollars, don't meet the test. But we seldom, if ever, \neliminate one. The President said it is time to do that. I, too, \nbelieve it truly is.\n  I spoke to the National Association of State Treasurers this morning \nand shared with them, a story of when I became attorney general of \nAlabama in 1994. My predecessor had left our office in a colossal, \ndisastrous situation financially. We were forced, because we had a \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment in the State of Alabama, to \nterminate the employment of one-third of the employees of the \nattorney general's office. It was a very difficult and painful decision \nfor me. All those terminated were noncivil servants. They were hired \nunder the political system that the attorney general could use at that \ntime. But still many of them were good people, and I hated to terminate \ntheir employment.\n\n  But we reorganized that office. We worked hard. I believe we \nthereafter produced as much or more good legal work, even though we \nlost one-third of the employees.\n  I say that to illustrate there is a myth in this Senate, in this \nCongress, that somehow money only tells whether something is being \nproductive, and if you don't give an agency more money, somehow they \ncan't do as much work as they were doing before. That is wrong. It is \nnot so. Every business in America understands they can do more for less \nwork hard to do so. I think that is one reason why so many Americans \ntoday are cautious and concerned about how our Government spends their \nmoney.\n  It is because they are at their workplaces every day, working with \ningenuity and technology and training and new systems to produce \nwidgets better and cheaper for the consumer so they can stay in \nbusiness. They expect the same out of Government, and they have every \nright to.\n  This budget comes in at 814. I believe we can make that work, but \nthere will be, throughout this process, a host of amendments to spend \nmore for every item you can imagine. Many of them have every resonance \nof good and worthwhile programs. In fact, some of them will be. But we \nsimply don't have the money we want to spend on all these programs. We \nneed to show discipline. If we show discipline, and we do this for \nseveral years, we can bring this budget back into balance again.\n  Senator Nickles believes, if we stay at this constrained spending \nrate, we will cut the deficit in half within 3 years. That is a good \ngoal. I would like to exceed that. Maybe we can exceed that. We will \njust see. I will share my personal view that economic growth will be a \nbig part of accomplishing our goal.\n  When President Bush was elected President, the economy was in \ntrouble.\n  In the third quarter of President Clinton's last year in office, \nnegative growth occurred. The first quarter that President Bush was in \noffice--had negative growth. Not good. But, that is what he inherited \nfrom his predecessor.\n  I say that because people say this slowdown was President Bush's \nfault. The NASDAQ exchange had lost one-half of its value by the time \nPresident Bush took office. The bubble had already burst and that value \nout there, on paper at least, was gone, leaving companies strained and \nunable to borrow and hurting the economy in a\n\n[[Page S2278]]\n\nnumber of different ways. The economy began to come back, and in \nSeptember 2001 we had the attack on the Trade Towers and the Pentagon. \nThat hurt us, too. So we are bouncing back from that.\n  The President did not sit around and not do anything. He acted. He \nhad a number of programs. One was to stimulate this economy through \nallowing the American citizens to keep more of the money they earn. I \nthink that was a good idea. First of all, it is always good policy in \nthis land of freedom and individual responsibility to allow the people \nwho earn their wages to keep as much of it as they possibly can. That \nis who we are as a people. We are not part of the socialist ideal of \nEurope, other countries. We have a heritage of freedom and individual \nresponsibility. First, I thought President Bush's actions were good \nphilosophically.\n  Secondly, it has helped our economy. We have seen continual growth \nsince. The third quarter of this past year, the growth of GDP in \nAmerica was at 8.2 percent. That is the highest growth in over 20 years \nin this country. The fourth quarter of last year was over 4 percent. \nThe combined two quarters were higher than any two quarters President \nClinton had when he was in office, I have been told. It was a good end \nto last year.\n  I think we are going to have good growth this year. The stock market \nis coming back up. Mr. Greenspan said interest rates are expected to \nstay low. He expects growth to continue. Jobs have continued to \nincrease for the last three or four quarters. Not as much as we would \nlike; we need to see more growth in the job area. But the household \nsurvey numbers look a lot better than the numbers that are most often \ncited, the wage number. Regardless, we want to see continued growth in \njobs. Economists tell us as the economy grows, it takes some time \nbefore employers start adding permanent employees. In other words, they \nwill pay overtime and do other things before they hire a permanent \nemployee. But if their business stays healthy and continues to grow, \nthey will hire people over a period of time. Jobs lag behind growth. \nDespite the fact that we have people running for President who have \nbeen going around for months saying how terrible everything is, how \nunemployment is hurting us so badly, how the economy has been damaged \nby President Bush, consumer confidence is up there pretty healthy and \nstrong. So we have to be pleased with that.\n  With regard to the unemployment numbers, in June of last year, the \nunemployment rate was 6.3 percent. The fourth quarter's unemployment \nwas reported at 5.6 percent--which is a significant drop--is about the \naverage over 20 years for unemployment in America. Do we want it to get \nbetter? Absolutely. Do we need to take steps to continue the growth and \ncontinue job enhancement in America? Yes. I am willing to consider any \ngood proposals toward that idea.\n  Mr. President, this economy seems to be coming back on solid footing \nand trusting the individual American citizens who work hard, manage \ntheir money carefully, and businesses to increase productivity. Oddly, \nincreased productivity is not good for jobs. If businesses improve \nproductivity, they can make more widgets with less employees. I think \nalmost every economist who would be consulted on this subject would say \nthat in the long run productivity increases are good because \nproductivity is what will allow us to be competitive in the world \nmarketplace. Without increases in productivity, we will not be able to \ncompete with low-wage nations.\n\n  So productivity is a good and bad thing. In the long run, it is going \nto be good. But I think it has delayed the surge of hiring we would \nlike to see, but I think we will see hiring increase as time goes by. \nThere are a lot of reasons our country had a decline in revenue. A \nsmall portion of the decline--maybe a quarter--was the tax cut. But the \ntax cuts, I am absolutely convinced, were key cause of that 8-percent \ngrowth we saw--4 percent in the last quarter--which is surging out \nthere and which will lift us out of this slowdown.\n  I believe the fundamental problem with the lack of income to America \nhas come about because our taxes in this country are focused on the \nhighest income wage earners. I know my colleague on the other side said \nwe are reducing taxes on the rich. But after all the tax cuts, the \nhighest 1 percent, highest 10 percent will still pay a larger \npercentage of the total taxes to America than the lower income people \nwill pay--a higher percentage of total tax revenue will still come from \nthe rich. But the deal is this: If you have money invested in the stock \nmarket and the market drops by one-half or more, as NASDAQ did, and you \nsell your stock, what can you do? You take a loss. You don't show a \ngain and pay a tax on the gain. You show a loss. The loss claim is \nlimited to $3,000. But $3,000 for a lot of people who sell stock means \nloss of revenue to the Government. For those in the top brackets who \nare paying 38 percent, that is a large loss in tax revenue to America.\n  Corporations that were making profits in good times and who are now \nshowing losses are not paying taxes. People who were being paid bonuses \nbecause companies were doing fine, they don't get those now, and they \nare not paying more taxes. So it seems to me that by taxing heavily our \nhighest income people and depending on them substantially for our base \nrevenue from income taxes, we have created a pretty volatile situation \nin how the income comes in.\n  If you have 6 months of growth like we are having now, I don't think \nyou will see a lot of bonuses to executives. But if you have a year, 2 \nyears, of growth, and improvement and profits begin to come back in a \ncompany, you will see other things happening that will generate profits \nfor the corporation. More people will be hired, more people will be \nworking overtime making that extra money, and they get taxed at the \nhigher bracket rate. All those things, to me, indicate the President is \ncorrect to decide to take strong action, to inject an infusion of \nAmerican ingenuity into the economy by allowing them to keep their \nwealth, what they have earned.\n  As a result of that, we will get growth and, as the growth stays out \nthere, I hope our budget numbers are going to look better. Will growth \nsolve all our problems quickly? I don't think so. I think we are going \nto have to sustain a long period of managing our spending habits, \nkeeping spending growth down. Some areas need to be reduced. Some areas \nneed to be increased modestly. We are going to have to resist starting \na whole lot of new programs, and I am indeed troubled by the expansion \nalready of the expected cost of the prescription drug program.\n  If we do those kind of things, and this economy comes back and we \nhold the line, we will begin to see the deficit be reduced. That is \nwhat we desperately need to do. We simply cannot sustain the size of \nthe deficits we have today, and it is not necessary that we have the \nkind of deficits we have today. I feel that strongly. I believe we will \nsee progress happen.\n  I offer as support for my belief the fact that as of June last year, \nthe experts--CBO or OMB--predicted the deficit would be $450 billion \nfor the fiscal year ending September 30 of last year. But when the \nnumbers came in, it was not $450 billion, it was $375 billion, $75 \nbillion less than they were predicting a few months before, and that \nwas because of some containment in spending and because of the economy \ncoming back.\n  We are not going to see huge, dramatic improvements, but we can \nbelieve and hope that if this economy remains strong and we remain \nfirmly in control of spending, we will see some good things happen. \nThis budget does that. It is less than a 4-percent increase overall, \nabout a 3.5-percent increase in spending.\n  Frankly, we would have done better coming in with lower spending, but \nmost of our spending is entitlement spending that goes up on its own on \na trajectory we have not figured out how to control. We are going to \nneed to figure out how to control it as the years go by and bring \nsanity and wisdom to that process.\n  I think our President has submitted a good budget that does not go \nhog wild. I believe our committee, after a long period of intense \ndebate--Republicans and Democrats engaged in offering amendment after \namendment and their philosophies and debates--has produced a frugal \nbudget, even more frugal than the one the President submitted; that if \nwe pass this budget and do not lose our discipline with the inevitable \nproposals for spending that are\n\n[[Page S2279]]\n\nabout to come, then we will be in good shape to chop away at this \ndeficit.\n  We must not do it, however, at the threat or expense of those \nmarvelous tax cuts that are so important to our economy and to our \nAmerican family. First, the child tax credit. Instead of $700, we \nraised it to $1,000 per child. I believe that is important.\n  The marriage tax penalty. The very idea that this Congress would \npenalize people who get married by increasing their taxes is just an \nanathema to me. I cannot believe we would do that. This marriage \npenalty fix went a long way toward eliminating that problem. It is not \na gift to married people; it is simply allowing them to get back on a \nlevel playing field. A tax is a penalty. We should not penalize \nmarriage.\n  The third provision up for renewal is expanding the lowest bracket, \nthe 10-percent bracket, covering a lot of people who were paying 15 \npercent on their income taxes, the lower income bracket. That bracket \nwill be increased so more people will be paying at 10 percent rather \nthan 15 percent.\n  All of these provisions are critical. They will strengthen the \nfamily. In fact, we need more young couples to have children today. \nSomebody has to take care of us when we become aged. A lot of people \nare not having children. One reason is they do not think they have the \nmoney to raise children, and the child tax credit and the marriage \npenalty might well strengthen our families in ways we cannot measure in \nterms of economics but, in the long run, will be good for this country. \nI believe that very deeply. That is why I am particularly supportive of \nthose two reductions in taxes.\n  I thank Senator Nickles for his leadership. I appreciate this \nopportunity to share a few words at this time. I see Senator Nickles, \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee, is back in the Chamber. I, again, \ncongratulate him for the extraordinarily capable way in which he \nhandled this process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank our colleague, Senator Sessions \nfrom Alabama, not only for his statement but also for the outstanding \nwork he has done on this committee. It is not easy reporting out a \nbudget resolution. It is not easy defending a budget. I encourage our \ncolleagues who want to throw rocks at it all the time to put one \ntogether.\n  I compliment our colleague from Alabama. He has been an invaluable \nmember of this committee. He has worked very hard. We touch every \nsingle dollar in the Federal budget in this committee. We review all \nthose dollars. I compliment the Senator from Alabama for being an \noutstanding member of a challenging working committee.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Colorado such time as he \ndesires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nyielding. I wish to say how grateful and what an honor it has been to \nserve with the current budget chairman. He has done a great job. He has \nbeen a great leader in the Senate. This is the last budget with which \nhe is going to be involved in the Senate. He is thorough, he is \nstraightforward, meticulous and has put together some good budgets \nsince working with him as chairman on the Budget Committee. We are \ngoing to miss him in the Senate. He has done a yeoman's job in putting \ntogether this budget.\n  Like he said, putting together a budget is not simple. It is always \neasy to criticize a budget, and that is what I pointed out during the \nBudget Committee hearings. All we are hearing is criticism about this \nitem and that item, but nobody is putting together a total budget, \nlaying it before us and explaining what they are going to do to \neliminate deficit spending.\n  I think back to last year, for example, on the floor of the Senate \nwhen we were debating the budget. It was the same situation. The \nchairman and Budget Committee members had worked hard to put together a \nbudget and bring it to the floor of the Senate. Colleagues were \nconsistently complaining and criticizing the deficits, but the fact is, \nwe had amendment after amendment presented calling for more spending. \nIt totaled up to about $1.6 trillion in amendment after amendment \ncalling for more spending.\n  Where were they getting a lot of the money? They were getting the \nmoney by wanting to increase this tax and increase that tax to pay for \nit. The rebuttal is: Well, we pay for it by increasing taxes.\n\n  I do not think the answer to this economy and the long-term solution \nto this budget is to increase taxes. I think the long-term solution is \nwe need to hold down spending.\n  One of the problems we have run into in recent years, since about \n2002, since many of the provisions which held spending in check are no \nlonger before us, is we have seen spending increase, and we are \ncontinuing to see spending as a problem as we move forward and debate \nthis budget.\n  We cannot deny the role the recession has had in revenues coming into \nthe Federal Government. Our deficits are a function in any 1 year of \nthe amount of money that is coming in and the amount of money that is \nbeing spent. In any 1 year, when spending is greater than the revenue \ncoming in, we end up with a deficit.\n  Sometimes in our discussions, we interchange the terms ``debt'' and \n``deficit.'' There is a difference. Debt is the accumulation of the \ndeficit spending over the years, so it reflects that. Deficit is when \nwe spend more than what we bring in in revenue.\n  I have some information. When we look at the economic downturn--and \nthe President in his budget had come up with a figure in the economic \ndownturn--he held 49 percent of the current deficit. I looked at a \nchart--this is from the President, the Executive--and it comes up with \nsimilar figures. This is put out by the Joint Economic Committee. \nSenator Bennett is chairman. It is equally balanced between Republicans \nand Democrats out of the Senate. They point out what has happened to \nthe surplus.\n  Using our CBO figures and using the figures we use in the legislative \nbranch, we come up with the weak economy could be attributed to greater \nthan 40 percent, and that increased spending was attributed to 36 \npercent of the loss of the surplus. Then we have our tax cut in 2001, \n18 percent. The economic stimulus was 1 percent, and then the tax cut \nwe put in place again was 5 percent. So the total is about 24 percent \nof the loss of surplus that would be attributed to tax cuts; 36 due to \nan increase in spending of the Federal Government, and the weak economy \nanother 40 percent. This is by the Joint Economic Committee. This is \nnot me. This is not the President putting that out. This is a \nbipartisan committee we have which looks at these kinds of figures.\n\n  Then we look at what happens year after year with spending as \ncompared to the tax cuts we have put in place. Let's take a look at \nthat. We start in fiscal year 2005. Here is a good example. The tax \ncuts reduced revenues by $212 billion. Spending increases enacted since \n2002 will total $268 billion. We have $212 billion tax expense to the \nsurplus, but spending is $268 billion.\n  Let's see what happens in 2006 as we move out in time in this budget. \nThe gap we see between spending and tax cuts and its impact on the \nsurplus grows even more. The 2006 tax cut reduces revenues by $163 \nbillion and spending increases enacted since 2001 will total $314 \nbillion. That gap is growing with each year as we move out. Over the \nnext 5 years, 2005 to 2009, revenue decrease due to tax cuts is going \nto run a total of $979 billion.\n  What happens during the same time period with our spending as it \nmoves out in time, $1.722 trillion. That is what happens to the growth \nin spending.\n  The point I am making is when there is a tax cut and that money is \nreturned to the American people, it does not escalate and grow as an \nexpense against the surplus, but the spending grows considerably.\n  I happen to believe our budget process is prejudicial against holding \ndown taxes. The way the budget rules work, it is always easier to \nincrease spending than it is to cut taxes. I think one of the most \nimportant ways to continue to stimulate this economy is to make sure we \nhold down our tax burden. I know the other side is advocating that we \ngo ahead and increase taxes, but I think that is wrong. It is the wrong \nthing to do now, when the economy is starting to come back. We are \nstarting\n\n[[Page S2280]]\n\nto see very encouraging figures about the economy in response to the \nstimulus plan we passed in the two previous tax cuts we put in place. \nThey were put there to stimulate the economy.\n  When this President came into office, he inherited an economy that \nwas starting to go down. Then we went through an unprecedented period \nof an economic downturn, which we had never seen during modern times, \nwhere revenues decreased at least for 3 consecutive years as we looked \nout. This had a profound impact on the amount of revenues coming into \nthe Federal Government.\n  If we had not made those tax cuts, my personal judgment is this \neconomy would still be struggling. Those tax cuts stimulated the \neconomy, and now I think once we start getting the revenues in from \nthis year, we are going to see a growth and the budget reflects that. \nOur economy is going to be on the way. With the recovering economy, we \nare going to see a regrowth in revenues coming to the Federal \nGovernment. The best way to grow revenues to the Federal Government is \nto stimulate the economy, not to increase taxes. Increasing taxes has a \ndepressing effect on people's willingness to produce because they do \nnot see themselves keeping that money in their pocket. They see it \ncoming back to Washington and being spent. If the citizens of this \ncountry can see the money they are earning staying in their own pocket \nand paying for their needs, meeting their family's needs, meeting the \nneeds of their local economy, they see it as a much more beneficial \nprocess and something that would motivate them to be more productive. \nWhen they are more productive, they are going to be paying more Federal \ntaxes. Then that return comes back to the Federal Government and is \nreflected in increased revenues and helps us eliminate deficit \nspending.\n\n  The last parameter to change in our economy is unemployment. \nUnemployment is going down and we are continuing to see job growth. \nThis last report was not as much as was hoped, but we are continuing to \nsee a growth in jobs. According to the payroll survey, jobs have \nincreased 6 months in a row. The household survey remains higher than \nprior to the recession and more Americans have jobs than at any other \ntime in our history. This is a result of those tax cuts.\n  Where do we go from here? We have the economy beginning to grow, and \nwe have a budget before us that begins to eliminate the deficit. I will \ntalk a little bit about that because the President had planned to \neliminate the deficit within 5 years of his budget. He said we can cut \nthe deficit in half either as a percent of gross domestic product or in \nnominal terms--in other words, actual dollars.\n  We have done better than that in the Budget Committee, thanks to the \nleadership of the chairman. We are getting out of deficit spending \nwithin 3 years, depending on how one wants to talk about it, or even as \nsoon as 2 years. This is in real dollars, and we are doing better than \nthe President. I think this is a phenomenal step in the right \ndirection.\n  We started taking this deficit seriously in the last budget. In fact, \nit was important to me, and I know a lot of other members on the Budget \nCommittee, that we start taking an early step in eliminating the \ndeficit, so we started putting this plan in place in the last budget. \nIt is important to me that when I look at today's budget I want to make \nsure we are staying with that plan, or doing better.\n  I am happy with what the President has proposed. I am especially \nhappy with what has come out of the Budget Committee. We need to stay \nwith that commitment and move forward. In order to continue to hold \ndown spending, we are going to have to put in place some budget rules \nin order to have a disciplined approach to deliberating the budget so \nspending does not get out of hand.\n  I know the chairman of the Budget Committee is looking at such a plan \nand giving it some serious thought. We have part of that plan currently \nin the budget proposal before us, and I think that is something we need \nto focus on. In fact, from a long-term strategy standpoint the most \nimportant thing might be to do something legislatively that would put \nin place, with the President's signature, some real rock-solid rules on \nhow we can control spending.\n  There need to be some provisions in case of an emergency, but we \ncannot be so flexible that we allow the emergency spending to be \nabused. I have observed in the short time I have been in the Senate \nthat emergency spending bills get abused. Again, with some good, \nthoughtful provisions, and if we can get this budget passed, I think we \nwill have in place some rules that will help us try to stay on board in \norder to eliminate the deficit.\n  I am convinced with the economy starting to grow that we can get back \nto where we have surpluses. I would like to be back in a position where \nI was a number of years ago where I could propose amendments on the \nSenate floor on appropriations bills to pay down the surplus, to pay \ndown the public debt. I am glad we did that, because if we had put some \nof that money aside toward paying down the public debt, then it gave us \nsome money in reserve.\n  We got to the point where we had an unprecedented time in our \nhistory, which we just experienced when this President came into \noffice. We had an economic downturn that was getting well on its way, \nwe had 9/11, and then we had some major conflicts we had to pay out of \nthis budget.\n  I would hate to think what our deficits would be like today if we had \nnot made an effort to pay down part of the public debt when we had an \nopportunity to do that. At first, it was not very easy to get those \namendments adopted on the floor, but after staying with them we were \nable to get those so we could make some significant steps toward paying \ndown the public debt.\n  I am hoping in the not too distant future we will be in a position \nagain where we can pay down the public debt and eliminate deficit \nspending so we are back out of the red on an annual basis and then \nbegin to work to pay down that public debt because that gives us sort \nof the reserve. I am glad we had that there. That is responsible \nmanagement of the taxpayers' dollars, responsible management of our \nbudget resources we have that come from hard-earned dollars that our \ntaxpayers, American citizens, are earning for the Federal Government \nand sending back to Washington.\n  Then, once we are in a position to get this budget passed, I think we \nalso need to look at ways in which we can take care of emergency \nspending provisions. There are some dollars that are put in this budget \nto try to take care of some predictable emergency spending that we \nthink we are going to have.\n  We will have an emergency surplus bill. It will be either the end of \nthis year or in the next fiscal year. It is right and proper and good \naccounting to begin to take that into consideration.\n  I hope at some point in time we can begin to develop a pot of money \nover here for emergency expenses only. Then, once we have developed \nthat, we will not have to come in for emergency supplementals where \nspending gets out of control and people get around our budget rules. We \nneed to work and modify those, in my view, in order to have long-term \nresponsible budgeting, at least out of the Senate and in the Congress.\n  I think the solution is no tax increases. I think we could help our \neconomy even more if we would take some of these--in fact I would take \nall these recent cuts we passed, which were the economic stimulus \npackage and the 2001 tax cut as well as the 2003 tax cut--and make \nthose all permanent. I think that would stimulate our economy to \ncontinue growing and we would go through another unprecedented period \nof economic growth, bringing revenues into the Federal Government, and \nthat would be part of our solution as far as getting out of deficits.\n  I think the fact that businesses and families, individual taxpayers, \ncould plan ahead with the understanding that those tax cuts were going \nto stay in there for some time would build confidence in the economy. \nThen they would be willing to go out and make their investments and, as \na result of that, create more revenue. When the tide rises, everything \nrises and everybody benefits.\n  I hope at some point in time we can make all these permanent, \nespecially the inheritance tax. The death tax is not part of those we \nhave in here, although I think we extend that out for a year or two in \nthis budget. But we\n\n[[Page S2281]]\n\nneed to permanently eliminate the death tax because it is silly to \nthink people are going to plan for their death. They are not going to \ndo that. The elimination expires toward the end of this decade and then \nit goes way back to previous levels, which are extremely high. That is \nnot fair. If nothing else, just out of fairness we need to permanently \neliminate the death tax.\n\n  I see my time is running out. I thank the chairman, again. I see \nSenator Domenici on the floor. He was the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee before Senator Nickles took over that responsibility. I think \nboth of them have been very responsible and have worked very hard on \nthe budget. I think we have a good piece of legislation. It is a \nresolution, an agreement between the House and Senate. It doesn't \nrequire the President's signature, but it is a commitment of both the \nHouse and Senate to eliminate deficit spending and hold down our tax \nburden and spending. I think we are heading in the right direction. If \nwe can accomplish what is in this budget, I feel good about the future \nof this country and the future of our economy.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank our colleague from Colorado for not only his \nstatement but the outstanding job he does as a member of the Budget \nCommittee. He works hard. He does his homework. He is one of the more \nknowledgeable persons on our committee about a lot of issues on the \nbudget. I compliment him for his statement and his contribution in \nputting this budget resolution together.\n  I note my predecessor as chairman of this committee, Senator \nDomenici, is seeking the floor. It is always a pleasure to work with \nhim. I yield him such time as he desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have to go to a chairmen's meeting \nnow, so I cannot speak very long. I did not want to let the first day \ngo by without saying a couple of things.\n  Senator Don Nickles has done an outstanding job, as have the Members \nwho serve with him, working for our country, joining him in doing the \nvery best possible job they can do.\n  I think the budget before us, under the circumstances, is as good as \nwe are going to get. I only hope not only do we pass it but at the end \nof the year we look back and say, with the exception of things that \nwere outside of our control, it truly was enforced; we carried it out. \nI hope that is the case.\n  I will come back tomorrow to make a few more remarks. When you get a \nbudget and it is deficit time, and the debts are as big as they are, \npeople generally are too gloomy. There are too many people running \naround saying how bad things are. I have been there when the deficits \nwere bigger than they are now. I have been there when they were less. I \nhave been there when it was balanced, believe it or not. Frankly, I \nthink what is good to know is that the American economy, the engine of \nwealth day by day, is in pretty good shape.\n  We are in a world economy that makes it very tough for America \nbecause we are trying to let the whole world get rich right alongside \nus. America is not looking to try to keep the world poor. It is pretty \nobvious that whatever globalization means to others, they have it wrong \nif they think the United States wants everybody else's wealth.\n  The truth is, we buy from everybody because we want them to grow and \nprosper. We want their workers to make money. We want their businesses \nto prosper. That is beginning to happen in a rather phenomenal way. In \nfact, I have never asked anybody to check carefully what has happened \nto China in a decade, but I imagine it would be phenomenal what is \nhappening to their people, to their prosperity, and to their \nopportunity to make the world a better world for everyone.\n  While all that is going on in poor countries, America has trouble \nbecause we have to compete. We have a lot of people thinking we ought \nto pull out of this world. Not only pull out of wars, a lot of people \nthink we ought to quit negotiating treaties of trade and just come \nhome.\n  I think we are very lucky we have a cadre of leaders for the most \npart who do not believe that is the way. I would be very worried if we \nwere going to move in that direction, all of a sudden say we are \nstaying home, we are not selling our goods, and we are not buying \ntheirs; it will just be fortress economic America. If that were the \ncase, it would not take us along until we would have one broken down \nfortress.\n  From my standpoint, I will join with those who are trying to help \nAmerica do a better job of producing goods and wealth cheaply and more \ncompetitively, getting our universities, our laboratories, and great \nscientists to produce out of the research room, out of their \nlaboratory, into the technology room, and then onto the manufacturing \nfloor. What we need is to move those faster. The great research has to \nturn into production in America. If only we could dream up some way to \nsensitize that so it would happen better and more rapidly. Researchers \nlike researching but they would like it more if they could produce a \nproduct.\n  If we are not there yet, there are plenty of people who do not feel \nthat way about research. But I submit that we are going to have more \nand more researchers in every sense of the word who believe they are \nnot successful until they have solved the problem, produced the \nproduct, and let America take cutting edge advancement to work at \nmaking products.\n  Having said that, tomorrow I will return and talk a little bit about \nthis specific budget and the deficit we have and the debt we have.\n  But I want to close by saying I sure hope the average American is not \ntoo worried about the future. When you go through a recession for a \ncouple of years, have two wars going on, and terrorists who ripped the \nheart out of your major city, and you are still in as good a shape as \nyou are today with our economy growing, productivity growing, and more \npeople working than any comparable day in history, you have to feel \nproud. For those who want to lead our country, the best way to do it is \nto convince them they have something to be proud of and that the future \nis bright.\n  I am down here on a tough budget with a tough chairman who worked \nhard to get us here, and probably with many people who won't agree with \nit. But I am here because I also want to let people know we are going \nto do the best we can. We have cut taxes not only because we like to \ncut taxes--that is true, we do--but because we think an economy in \nrecession needs to have taxes cut if it is going to get out of \nrecession. We think that happened. We are proud of that. We don't want \nto do away with the taxes that are about to occur right now because \nthey are the right kinds of taxes. If we are going to do pay-as-you-go, \nlet us at least let those taxes that we cut take effect.\n  I want to repeat in closing that I am going to start working tomorrow \nwith a bipartisan group of Senators to produce a pay-as-you-go plan. It \nwill include taxes, but it won't include the taxes that we have already \npassed that are waiting to be enforced but look 4 or 5 years from now, \nno more free rides for anything--no free rides for taxes, no free rides \nfor defense, no free rides for anything. We are going to increase \nthings. If you cut something, you also pay for it. If we can do that \nfor 4 or 5 years and start the process so that it is credible, what a \nchange it will have. It will be a very positive day for America and for \nthose who invest if we do.\n  For today, I said about as much as I can. I yield the floor. I thank \nthe chairman for yielding. I thank the Senate for listening. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Domenici, former chairman \nand very distinguished member of the committee, and someone to whom we \nall look for wisdom on budget issues.\n  Let me pick up on the last point he made, the pay-go provision. What \nthe Senator is talking about are rules that we used to have that were \nallowed to lapse in 2002 which required if you wanted to add spending \nor cut taxes, that was fine, but you had to pay for it. You had to pay \nfor it. I think that budget discipline that was lost is unfortunate. We \nought to renew those budget disciplines as quickly as possible.\n  I think it is fine to say there are certain taxes we should cut. In \nfact, I have\n\n[[Page S2282]]\n\nindicated publicly that I will vote to extend the 10-percent bracket. I \nwill vote to extend the marriage penalty relief. I will vote to extend \nthe expansion of the child care credit. I will vote to extend the small \nbusiness expensing. I personally believe--and I think Senator Allard \nand I may agree--those are provisions that we ought to continue. There \nmay be some more that Senator Allard wants to continue that I would not \nwithout paying for it.\n  But I would say on any spending that is new and any tax cuts that are \nnew, we ought to pay for them. This deficit ditch is so deep now that I \nthink we ought to impose that discipline on ourselves. We did it \nbefore. It helped. I don't think it solved the problem, but it \ncertainly made a contribution. It provided a discipline on both the \nspending side and the taxing side that was important. That doesn't mean \nyou can't, on an emergency basis, spend more or tax less. It requires a \nsupermajority vote. It requires 60 votes to break that discipline. I \nthink it helped us immeasurably. I think it saved hundreds of billions \nof dollars.\n  I was on this floor last year with Senator Nickles siding with him in \nstopping some spending by raising budget points of order that apply on \nthe spending side of the ledger.\n  I think it is very important that we reintroduce those disciplines as \nsoon as possible.\n  Let me talk a little about this budget. I talked earlier about the \nPresident's budget. I also want to talk a little about this budget and \nwhy I think it is deficient.\n  The first thing that concerns me is it adds $2.86 trillion to the \ndebt over the next 5 years. I think one of the things that is being \nmissed in these discussions is something that is flying right below the \nradar. It is the amount of money that is being taken out of Social \nSecurity to pay for other things, money that has to be paid back but \nthat gets lost in this discussion of deficits. The reason for that is \nthey are talking about what is called the unified deficit. That is when \nyou put all the money in the pot and you treat it all the same. All the \nSocial Security revenue goes into the pot along with the income tax \nrevenue and every other kind of revenue. All the spending comes out of \nthat pot. The problem with that approach is at this moment in time, \nSocial Security funds are running big surpluses in preparation, \nsupposedly, for the retirement of the baby boom generation. But we are \nnot using that money to pay down the debt or prepay the liability. We \nare taking that money and using it to fund tax cuts and other \nexpenditures of Government, and those Social Security surpluses are \ngrowing dramatically, by the end of this 5-year budget the Social \nSecurity fund surplus just for the fiscal year 2009, is going to be up \nover $235 billion. I think it is hiding, basically from all of us, and \nfrom the American people, our true fiscal condition.\n\n  Let me make this point. If we take the chairman's mark--I have high \nregard for the chairman. I respect him. I have found that he is \nsomebody I can trust. I also like him. This does not have anything to \ndo with personalities. This has to do with the fiscal situation we face \nas a country. Under the chairman's mark, the total debt of our country \nat the end of this year is going to be $7.4 trillion. But this year, \n$612 billion will be added. Next year, we will have $8 trillion of \ndebt. The next year, $569 billion is being added to the debt; the next \nyear, $553 billion; the next year, $563 billion; the next year, $564 \nbillion. Do you notice a certain sameness as to how much is being added \nto the debt every year? Yet at the same time, the chairman and other \nMembers have said it is cutting the deficits in half. And both \nstatements are true. The deficit--which is calculated on a unified \nbasis with all funds going into the pot, all revenue and all spending \ncoming out of that same pot--is being reduced in half over 3 years by \nthe chairman's mark. The problem is the increases in the debt are not \nbeing cut in half. The increases in the debt are virtually unchanged.\n  The debt is increasing this year by $612 billion under the chairman's \nmark. By the third year it is going to increase by $563 billion.\n  The debt increases are not being reduced by this plan in any \nsignificant way.\n  As a result, for the 5 years, the debt is being increased by $2.860 \ntrillion.\n  This is, in many ways, the good times because the baby boomers have \nnot started to retire yet. They start to retire in 2008. When we couple \nthe increased expenses which flow from the baby boomers retiring with \nthe reduced revenue by making the tax cuts permanent--and, by the way, \nthat cost explodes right outside this 5-year budget window--what we see \nis under any growth scenario, any reasonable growth scenario, this debt \nproblem, this deficit problem, is going to get much more serious in \nthis next 10-year period. It is not getting better.\n  Those who say, gee, with some more growth this will all work out--no, \nit does not work out. That is what the Comptroller General of the \nUnited States is warning us about, that is what the International \nMonetary Fund is warning us about, that is what budget group after \nbudget group is warning us about. We cannot grow our way out of the \ndeficits that are coming because we are stacking up debt at the time \nthat is most favorable. We are stacking up debt when we have the trust \nfunds throwing off huge cash surpluses.\n  What is going to happen when those trust funds go cash negative? \nInstead of $160 billion of Social Security surplus, which will happen \nthis year, instead of $235 billion of Social Security surplus which \nwill happen in the fifth year, when those trust funds go cash negative, \nthen what happens, and the baby boomers have retired and the full cost \nof the President's tax cuts have been phased in? Then these deficits \nlook like child's play. Then we have a real chasm which has to be dealt \nwith.\n  As I see it, the chairman's budget simply does not do the job. When \nwe look at the chairman's mark and we put back in the war costs CBO \nsays will be there, and we look at addressing the alternative minimum \ntax, here is what we see the operating deficits looking like over the \nnext 5 years. They are enormous. The operating deficits are enormous. \nWe see very little reduction in them under the chairman's mark. There \nis $638 billion going down in 2009 to $520 billion, and I don't believe \nthat is an accurate reflection. I believe by the time we get to the \nfifth year we will add another $600 billion to the debt, based on my \nown analysis.\n  Our colleagues on the other side have talked about this proposal \nreducing the deficit. Actually, this proposal does not reduce the \ndeficit. The deficit is going down on a unified basis, not counting the \nmoney that is being taken from Social Security, if we do nothing. The \ndeficit is going down if we do nothing. But if we adjust the baseline \nfor the one-time expenditures that were made last year, when we had a \nsupplemental appropriations bill for over $85 billion last year--that \nis in the so-called baseline going forward--if we take that out, which \nthe chairman has done--and, by the way, I commend him for doing that \nbecause otherwise we build in spending that should not repeat itself. \nIt is one-time spending that should not be added to the base. The \nchairman has taken it out of the base. He is absolutely right to do so.\n  Once we have done that and then we look at what is happening with the \ndeficits under the chairman's proposal, what we see is it increases the \ndeficit by $177 billion over the next 5 years. He is adding $177 \nbillion to the deficit over the next 5 years. That is a mistake. We \nhave record deficits now. We have the baby boomers coming. They will \nretire. We should not be adding to the deficit by the policy decisions \nwe make here. We ought to be reducing it.\n\n  The chairman says the deficit in the fifth year under his plan will \nbe $202 billion. That is only true if we leave out certain things. \nNumber one, he is leaving out additional war costs in that fifth year. \nThe Congressional Budget Office says residual war costs in the fifth \nyear will be $30 billion. He leaves out the alternative minimum tax \nfix, that costs $55 billion in the fifth year. He leaves out the $22 \nbillion he will borrow from the Medicare trust fund that year which he \nhas to pay back. He is leaving out the $235 billion he is borrowing \nfrom the Social Security trust fund in that fifth year. In that year \nalone, he will borrow $235 billion from Social Security. He will borrow \nanother $22 billion from Medicare trust funds so he is borrowing $257 \nbillion in that year and that is being stacked on the debt. So instead \nof adding $202 billion to the debt in that fifth\n\n[[Page S2283]]\n\nyear, he is adding at least $545 billion to the debt. That is my own \nconclusion.\n  What is wrong with, for example, this budget in terms of revealing \nour full fiscal condition? One of the first problems we have is the war \ncosts. The President has zero for war costs past September 30th. The \nchairman has put in a reserve fund of $30 billion which is certainly \nmore forthcoming than the President's plan. But the chairman does not \ninclude it in his actual budget so he does not add to the deficit \ncalculations by that $30 billion. He just says it is in a reserve fund. \nIt may be spent, but we are not counting on it.\n  That is not a budget. It is not a budget when you say we may spend \nthis money, and if we do, we will find someplace to get it. I guess we \nwill have to borrow it because he is not providing the funding for it. \nHe is not adding it to the deficit totals for that year. He is not \nbudgeting for it.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says for the 10 years from 2005 to \n2014, the residual war cost is $280 billion. We are not facing up to \nthe real costs we all know are coming.\n  Then we look at priorities. In 2005, the tax cuts going to the top 1 \npercent cost $45 billion, those earning over $337,000. If we were to \nkeep the promise of No Child Left Behind in that year according to the \nchairman's budgets--this is a different number compared to the Bush \nbudget because this budget before the Senate, the chairman's mark, is \nsomewhat more generous in dealing with No Child Left Behind than the \nPresident's budget--but looking at this budget, he is $8.6 billion \nshort of meeting the amount committed to No Child Left Behind. That is \nless than 20 percent of the money that is going in the tax cut to the \nwealthiest 1 percent.\n  The same is true as we look at other priorities. Veterans medical \nfunding. If we were to increase veterans medical care funding to meet \nthe 2004 service levels, it would cost $521 million. Instead, we are \ngiving $45 billion of tax cuts to the wealthiest 1 percent.\n  This is a question of priorities. What is more important? They are \nsaying it is 90 times as important. We will spend 90 times as much \nproviding a tax cut to the wealthiest 1 percent than to restore medical \ncare funding to the 2004 service levels in 2005. If we took a poll of \nthose who are the wealthiest 1 percent in this country and they were \nasked, Would you be willing to give up 1\\1/3\\ percent of your tax cut \nso we could match the medical care funding of our veterans in 2005 with \nwhat we did in 2004, there would be a resounding yes, I would give up 1 \npercent of my tax cut in order to provide decent medical care for our \nNation's veterans.\n  The COPS program. It would take $700 million to restore the cuts \nbeing made in the COPS program. COPS program is the program that has \nput 100,000 police officers on the street. It costs $700 million to \nrestore those cuts that are in this chairman's mark. Again, I compare \nit to the $45 billion being provided in tax cuts to the wealthiest 1 \npercent.\n  Does it make sense to cut the COPS program, reduce the number of \npolice on the street, when we are threatened by terrorist activity in \nthis country?\n  I do not think that makes sense. I do not think those are the right \npriorities for the country.\n  We look at the firefighters in the same way. It would cost $246 \nmillion to restore the cuts to the firefighters that are included in \nthis budget. Again, if one looks at a comparison of the tax cuts \nprovided to the wealthiest 1 percent--those earning over $337,000--it \ncosts $45 billion for that same year.\n  If you asked the people who are in this category: Gee, would you be \nwilling to give up one-half of 1 percent of your tax cut so we do not \ncut the firefighters, I think overwhelmingly people in that category \nwould say, yes, that is a priority that we fund the firefighters at \nlast year's levels and not cut them, not cut them dramatically.\n  This is a debate about choices. It is about choices of what is the \nfuture course for our Nation. I believe the deficits and debt that are \ncontained in these budgets are simply too large and we need to take \naggressive action to deal with them, and this is all happening at the \nworst possible time, right before the baby boomers retire.\n  But I am not focused on this year's deficit. That concerns me, but \nthat is not the focus of my concern. I am much more worried about where \nthis is all headed under the President's plan. I am much more worried \nabout where this is all headed under the chairman's plan than the \nimmediate deficits.\n  One would expect deficits at a time we have been attacked. One would \nexpect it at a time we have been recovering in the economy. The problem \nwith the President's plan, the problem with the chairman's plan, is \nthey never plan to get out of deficit. Instead, they keep adding to the \ndebt, and by hundreds of billions of dollars a year, not just this \nyear, but next year, and the next year, and the next year, and the next \nyear--every year by over $500 billion of added debt, and every year \nthereafter, taking every penny of Social Security surplus, borrowing \nit, using it to fund tax cuts and other expenditures, with no plan to \npay it back.\n  No, this does not add up. This does not add up. This does not come \nclose to adding up. It has enormous implications for our long-term \neconomic strength.\n  Now I understand this is an election year and things are unlikely to \nbe changed very dramatically this year. I have had probably a dozen of \nmy colleague say to me, what we need is a big plan for next year. I \nwish we could take more aggressive action this year, but I am realistic \nand know it is probably true that our best opportunity to deal with \nthis problem in a fundamental way will come next year, and that is when \nwe need to be prepared to act in a serious way and quit just hoping \nagainst hope that somehow this all goes away.\n  It is not going away. It is not going away under the chairman's plan. \nHe is adding $500 billion to the debt every year of this plan. It is \nnot going away under the President's plan. He is adding even more. The \nPresident adds $3 trillion to the debt over the next 5 years--$3 \ntrillion. This plan is a little bit better. It adds $2.860 trillion to \nthe debt. None of this is sustainable, especially in light of the \nretirement of the baby boom generation, which starts in 2008, and of \nthe cost of the President's tax cuts that absolutely explode beyond the \n5 years of this budget plan.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the budget. I \nfirst commend my ranking member, the Senator from North Dakota, for his \nincredible leadership and the way in which he has presented all of \nthese issues and the challenges facing our country. There is no \nquestion that a huge hole has been dug with deficits as far as the eye \ncan see.\n  I remember coming onto the Budget Committee as a new Member of the \nSenate in 2001, when the debate was what to do with the largest surplus \nin the history of the country. I remember when the Senator from North \nDakota was talking about the baby boomers retiring and the need to put \nmoney aside to meet our obligations under Social Security and Medicare, \nand the need to look to the future.\n  Unfortunately, instead, what we saw were very short-term decisions \nthat turned the largest budget surplus in the history of the country \ninto the largest budget deficit in the history of the country, in only \n3 years. It is astounding to see what has happened in the last 3 years.\n  But I thank him for his courage and his willingness to fight for what \nis important to my family and the people of Michigan and the people of \nNorth Dakota and people all across the country, for fighting for the \nright priorities for the future of our country.\n  I also want to take a moment to thank our chairman, who convened his \nlast budget hearing and budget resolution markup this year. I \nappreciate the fact that he conducted a fair markup, as he has done \nsince being chairman. We came to the conclusion and voted on a budget \nresolution that now is in front of us. He did it in a very fair way.\n  I also commend him for a couple of tough decisions he made that the \nadministration was not willing to make. Chairman Nickles, unlike the \nadministration, put funding in the budget for ongoing activities in \nIraq. He put in a reserve fund of $30 billion. While I am concerned \nthat is not enough to meet the request that will come back to us, I \ncommend him for his leadership in understanding the number certainly is \nnot zero, that there needs to be an\n\n[[Page S2284]]\n\namount that is put aside into a reserve fund.\n  But this budget is so flawed in the end analysis, I am not sure where \nto begin in talking about it. It reminds me of Yogi Berra when he said: \nThis is deja vu all over again. Because that is exactly where we are, \ngiven the direction we have gone in the last 3 years. Once again, we \nsee a budget that is skewed to a privileged few while leaving middle-\nincome families behind. It fails the credibility test, and it does not \nreflect our Nation's values and priorities. I hope the Senate will \ndecide to reject it and go back to the drawing board and get it right.\n  Our Nation's budget is our chief economic tool. This is the fourth \ntime President Bush has submitted a budget to Congress containing his \neconomic plan for the Nation. Unfortunately, the President's last three \nbudgets have led to major job loss, soaring deficits, rising debt, the \nlooting of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, and have \nfailed to provide the necessary resources for our domestic priorities.\n  It seems every day we hear more and more economic bad news. Certainly \nin the State of Michigan every day there are headlines of job loss.\n  On Friday, the Labor Department said there were only 21,000 jobs \ncreated in February. This is anemic, according to many economists, and \n285,000 jobs short of what the President said would happen just a \ncouple of months ago. At this rate, it will take 9 years to recover all \nof the jobs lost under President Bush.\n  Unfortunately, the people of the State of Michigan can't wait that \nlong. Our people need jobs now. Under the Bush Presidency, we have lost \n2.8 million manufacturing jobs, many of them in the State of Michigan. \nOur manufacturing sector is in crisis. Every day we hear about another \ncompany shipping its jobs overseas to China or India or Mexico. In \nfact, the State of Michigan had the highest number of jobs lost last \nyear.\n  Just last Friday, our Democratic Policy Committee held a hearing on \nthe topic of shipping jobs overseas. At that hearing we heard testimony \nfrom Dave Doolittle who works at the Electrolux Refrigerator plant, \nGreenville, MI. They announced they were going to close and export \n2,700 jobs to Mexico.\n  Despite major concessions offered by the workers and over $70 million \nin economic incentives from the State and the community--the community \ndid everything right; the workers did everything right--Electrolux \nannounced it will close next year, and 2,700 workers will be out of a \njob. That means 2,700 families will be without a breadwinner in a town \nof 9,000 people; 2,700 people losing their jobs out of 9,000. This type \nof job loss is devastating to these families.\n  In addition to that, when we look at the ripple effect and the \nsuppliers involved and others, this can reach as high as 8,000 good-\npaying jobs with health care and pension plans throughout the entire \nregion. This type of job loss is devastating for our families, and it \nis devastating to Dave Doolittle.\n  Mr. Doolittle has worked at the plant for over 23 years. He has a \npension. He has health benefits. He has one child in college and two in \nhigh school. The plant closing will devastate his family. He asked us, \nwho will pay for his two high school children to go to college? What is \nhe going to do about health care for his family? Will they be able to \nkeep their home?\n  To add insult to injury, Dave Doolittle and other employees will be \nworking on an assembly line that has just received major investments of \n$100 million to improve it so the company can see what problems it has \nso they can then rebuild that and take it to Mexico. This highly \nproductive, highly skilled workforce is working out all the kinks in \nthe equipment that they will then pack up and send to Mexico.\n  Unfortunately, the President's budget and the budget before us will \ndo nothing for Dave Doolittle and his family. He is a one of a growing \nnumber of hard-working families making up a part of another America. \nThe other America includes not only the unemployed but millions of \nworkers who have simply given up trying to find a job. If you include \nthem in the unemployment rate, these discouraged workers push the \nunemployment numbers up to 9.6 percent, almost 1 in 10 of our workers.\n  People such as Dave Doolittle are not interested in a handout. This \nis a hard-working, skilled individual. What he is looking for is a good \njob and a chance to give his children and his grandchildren-to-be a \nbetter future. They want to provide their children with health care and \nan education so they can live the American dream. Isn't that what we \nall want for ourselves and for our children? They want the country to \nbe strong and safe from terrorist attacks. They are counting on us to \ndo what is right at home and abroad.\n\n  Unfortunately, the Bush economic policies have failed Dave Doolittle \nand his family on all counts. The President's budget has no plan to \ncreate jobs. It does nothing to help the uninsured and make health care \nmore affordable. It contains proposed cuts for our schools, our police \nofficers, our firefighters who are trying to protect us on the front \nlines against terrorist attacks.\n  On these priorities and more, Democrats tried to improve this budget \nin committee but were voted down on a party-line vote every time.\n  This budget also lacks credibility. For the last 3 years we were told \none thing; yet something very different has happened over and over. The \nfirst tax cut produced massive deficits and harmed our economy. Despite \nall that, the President continues to push the same trickle-down \neconomics that have failed. If these tax cuts were done by trial and \nerror, they were an error.\n  Consider everything that was said and what actually has happened. We \nwere told that the administration's tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 would \ncreate jobs, but we have lost jobs, almost 3 million. We were told we \nwould have a surplus, but we now have the largest deficit in the \nhistory of the country. We were told we would pay off the national \ndebt, but now our national debt is higher than when President Bush took \noffice. We were told the President's budget would not use Social \nSecurity trust funds, but now we are using every penny of the Social \nSecurity surplus to pay for tax cuts for the privileged few. We were \ntold we needed to modernize Medicare and add a prescription drug \nbenefit, with which I agree, but now we have a law that will privatize \nMedicare, hurt one in four seniors on Medicare, and cause them to lose \ntheir private insurance. It does little to help seniors purchase \nprescription drugs and does nothing to lower prices for all Americans.\n  We were told we would fund Leave No Child Behind and special \neducation, but now we have failed to fully fund them. School districts \nare making cuts, shortening their school years, and laying off \nteachers. We were told we would have a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity that would help protect us, but in only the second budget \ncycle for this agency, we are already seeing budget cuts from last \nyear, and we are falling far short of what is needed to protect our \ncountry.\n  We tried to make some changes to this budget in committee to have it \nbetter reflect our Nation's values and priorities. Unfortunately, we \nwere unsuccessful. We tried to add fiscal discipline and reduce the \ndeficit, but we lost on a party-line vote. We tried to fully fund Leave \nNo Child Behind, but we lost on a party-line vote. We tried to restore \nthe cuts to our firefighters, but we lost on a party-line vote.\n  Unfortunately, the Democrats were not the real losers, though. The \nAmerican people were the losers by those votes.\n  We are in this budget and economic mess because this administration \nhas valued wealth over work and the privileged few over our children's \nfuture. For the privileged few, this administration has given so much: \nmost of the tax breaks, subsidies for insurance companies and HMOs, and \n$139 billion in profit for the pharmaceutical industry. For working \nfamilies there has been very little. In fact, working men and women and \ntheir families are worse off than they were 3 years ago.\n  Three million workers have lost their jobs. As of the end of January, \nwe have over 400,000 people who have lost their jobs who have been cut \noff of unemployment insurance. Eight million will see their pay cut \nbecause of new overtime regulations. Seven million people who work for \nthe minimum wage have seen their pay eroded, and 12 million children \nwere too poor to get the child tax credit.\n\n[[Page S2285]]\n\n  Three years ago, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan gave the go-\nahead for massive tax cuts for the top 1 percent, and this Congress, in \nconjunction with the President, enacted them, and now we have the \nlargest deficits in history.\n  Unfortunately, now Chairman Greenspan is urging Congress and the \nPresident to make cuts in Social Security because we have these \ndeficits. This means tax cuts for the privileged few are paving the way \nfor cuts in Social Security for middle-income families. This is wrong.\n  How can we ask people who have worked their entire lives to have \ntheir Social Security cut to pay for tax cuts for our privileged few?\n  I mentioned earlier that budgets are all about values and priorities, \nand I truly believe that. We have to decide, do we want more tax cuts \nfor the privileged few or do we want all Americans to be safe by \nproviding full funding for firefighters, police officers, and other \nfirst responders?\n  Do we want more tax cuts for the privileged few or do we want a real \ncomprehensive Medicare prescription drug benefit and lower prescription \ndrug prices for everyone?\n  Do we want more tax cuts for the privileged few or quality schools \nwith highly educated teachers and small class sizes and state-of-the-\nart technology for all of our children?\n  More tax cuts or quality education? More tax cuts or quality health \ncare for our veterans who have served us and continue to serve us \ntoday? More tax cuts or hundreds of thousands of new jobs, rebuilding \nour Nation's highways?\n  We need a new vision. We need new priorities for America. We need a \npositive budget that will help all Americans raise their families, get \naccess to health care, and enjoy their lives and their retirement. We \nneed to restore our fiscal discipline, make critical investments to \ncreate jobs, and strengthen Medicare and Social Security. In short, we \nneed to make the needs of American families our top priority again.\n  I will be supporting a number of amendments that will do that in this \nbudget debate. I am hopeful we will be able to get bipartisan support \nto be able to do those things that American families are asking us to \ndo, so at the end of the day we will have a budget that reflects what \nis important to the people we represent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I want to set the record straight. We have \nheard a lot of discussion from the other side about the burden or about \nhow these tax cuts are somehow favoring the rich and somehow implying \nthat the rich are getting some sort of an advantage.\n  I share with my colleagues some facts. This factsheet was put out by \nthe Tax Foundation. It talks about the Federal individual income tax. \nIt takes us up to 2001. The top 1 percent of the earners in this \ncountry, the top 1 percent who pay the highest taxes, pay 40 percent of \nthe individual income tax in this country. The top 5 percent pay 53.3 \npercent. The top 10 percent pay 64.9 percent. The top 25 percent pay \n82.9 percent. The top 50 percent of the individual income taxpayers in \nthis country pay 96.1 percent.\n  That means the bottom 50 percent only pay 4 percent of the total \nindividual income tax that comes in. That is the individual taxes that \nare filed.\n  I was looking to see what happens when we look at all income classes \nand all returns. These are taxable returns, itemized tax liability, at \nthe 2003 rate and the 2003 law and 2003 income levels. If we look at \nthose returns that show $100,000 to $200,000 in taxes, they pay 25 \npercent, a little over 25 percent. If we look at those who pay over \n$200,000 in taxes, they pay 49 percent. So if we total all the income \nclasses and all returns--these figures are put out by the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation--and we look at all these returns, and this is a \ncurrent document--the previous document I referred to was up to 2001--\nput out by the Tax Foundation--if you take those who are $100,000 or \nmore, they pay over 75 percent of the taxes in this country.\n  Now, it seems to me those individuals with those tax returns reflect \nhard work and productivity. They are doing their fair share in \nsupporting the economy of this country. I think this needed to be made \npart of the record. That is why I wanted to take a little time to talk \nabout the tax burden, because the story we keep hearing from colleagues \non the other side is that somehow the rich are getting off easy.\n  The lowest 50 percent of our individual taxpayers pay 4 percent and \nthe top 50 percent are paying 96 percent of the taxes. That tells you \nwho is paying the taxes.\n  Then, if we look at all the returns filed in 2003, and then look at \nwho is paying those, all those who paid $100,000 or more are paying \nover 75 percent of the taxes. That is phenomenal. The producers and \nearners are paying their fair share.\n  I might add that a large percentage of these individuals, as well as \nothers, are coming from small business. That is where our economic \ngrowth occurs, where our new ideas come from. If we can continue to \npromote and encourage the growth of small business, then that means our \neconomy is going to do well. That is why I think the tax cut that we \nput in place was the right solution, and it has worked. I don't think \nanybody can deny that the tax cuts we put in place have worked. They \nhave worked.\n  If we increase taxes, which is being encouraged on the other side, \nsupported by the other side, it is the wrong thing to do at the wrong \ntime--particularly when our economy is beginning to show growth. I \nthink it is important, again, that we ought to actually extend these \ntaxes permanently. If we would do that, I think that sends a message to \nthe producers of this country that we are open for business and they \nwill get out and they will produce. When the economy grows, I think it \nwill help work us out of where we are now in deficits. I think it will \nincrease revenues to the Federal Government substantially, and it will \nbe easier for us to work our way out of the deficits we now face.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, if I might respond to my colleague's \ncomments, we certainly have heard similar comments before. There are a \ncouple of concerns that I have. Like everything, it depends on how you \nlook at the numbers and how you look at what is happening in terms of \ntax burden. The debate that has gone on relates to the income tax. It \nhas nothing to do, first, with all of the taxes.\n  In this debate, there is always a conscious desire not to look at the \npayroll tax, which everybody pays and, in fact, it is skewed more to \nlower and middle-income people, because above a certain income you \ndon't pay the payroll tax anymore.\n  So let's look at who is paying the payroll tax. Let's look at who \npays sales tax, which is based on what you buy. It has no relationship \nto your income specifically, in terms of what the sales tax burden is. \nWe know it falls more on low- and moderate-income individuals.\n  We can also look at property taxes. We look at a wide array of taxes \nin this country and we see that low- and middle-income people have a \nhuge burden. When taxes get cut, it is not on the things they are \npaying; it is on those taxes--in this case, the income tax--which is \npaid by those who make higher incomes, higher percentages.\n  When we look at the total tax burden, we see that it is the middle-\nincome people in this country who get squeezed on all sides. We should \nnot add to that by extending a tax cut that continues to do that.\n\n  Let us look at the numbers, how the tax breaks stack up. The combined \neffect of the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, if you make over $1 million a \nyear--that is in a year and a half--if you make over $1 million a year, \nyour combined tax cut is $140,369. The average middle-income-tax payer \nwill get a tax cut of $566. Look at these numbers. This is more than \nthe majority of people in the country earn working hard every single \nyear for their family. They work hard, they play by the rules, they are \nstruggling with sending their kids to college and making sure they can \nbuy their homes and pay the property taxes, and all of the other \npressures on them. They are worried about losing their job now to \noverseas competition. Instead of selling products overseas,\n\n[[Page S2286]]\n\nthey are worried their jobs are going to go overseas.\n  We have individuals who work hard every day, play by the rules, and \nthe vast majority of them are earning less per year than what one \nperson is going to get in an income tax cut who earns over $1 million a \nyear. I do not begrudge in any way someone who earns over $1 million a \nyear. That is not the point. The point is we are looking at this kind \nof a tax cut of $140,000 versus $566. There is a major issue of who is \ngetting the tax benefit and who drives the economy, from where does the \neconomic growth come. We know it is from middle-income-tax payers who \nare as consumers purchasing in the economy, but more broadly we look at \nthis in terms of choices.\n  We know if we were to give them two-thirds of their tax cut this year \ninstead of all of it, we could fully fund what has been reported is \nneeded to keep us safe with homeland security--every single penny. It \nis a large number. We are told by Warren Rudman and the members who \ncame together to look at all of our homeland security needs--not only \npolice and fire and bioterrorism, borders and ports and chemical \nplants, but all of it--it will cost $15 billion, which is one-third of \nwhat those at the top are going to get back this year in a tax cut.\n  Would folks be willing to take a little bit less to know they are \nsafe, that their family is safe, that the borders are safe, that the \nports are safe, that they can call 9-1-1 and know they can get a first \nresponder at their home if there is an emergency, or that the community \ncan respond, that police and firefighters can talk to each other on the \nradio, have interoperability, which they do not have now?\n  All across Michigan, we do not have one system where everybody can \ntalk to each other in case of an emergency. I think most of the people \nwho do very well in this country would say, yes, that is important for \nmy family, and that is a tradeoff I am willing to make; that is a \nchoice I am willing to make.\n  This is about choices. It is not about class warfare. There are huge \ndifferences in what people will be getting back. It is not about \npenalizing or in any way demonizing people who make over $1 million a \nyear. This is about choices. When we see red for as far as the eye can \nsee, when we see that this year's projected deficit, just this year's \ndeficit of $521 billion is more than the entire investments outside \ndefense--take defense away--all of our domestic investments, all of our \ndomestic budget: homeland security, education, health care, law \nenforcement, protecting the environment, parks--we could wipe out the \nentire domestic budget, except for defense, and not equal the deficit \nhole that the administration has put us in just this year.\n\n  It is a matter of choices and saying to someone who is doing very \nwell: We need you to help. We need you to be willing to make sacrifices \njust as every family is, just as our men and women in the armed \nservices are making in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is about choices. If \nthe choice is keeping every American safe, making sure we can protect \nourselves from terrorist attacks across this country, and asking those \ndoing very well, who have reaped the benefits of this country, to help \nshare in paying for that, I think the majority of them would say yes. \nThat is something we all are willing to do.\n  This is always a question of choices. It is a question of priorities. \nIt is a question of values.\n  As the chart shows, it is also a question of fairness for people. If \nwe look at the difference in the average middle-income-tax payer and \nthe cut they will get in 2006, and those with incomes over $1 million \nand the cut they will get, we see that in addition to this disparity, \nthis middle-income-tax payer is paying a payroll tax, sales taxes, \nproperty taxes, and contributing greatly to the payment of services in \ntheir community.\n  This budget is about what is fair for everybody, what is the right \nthing to do to keep us strong fiscally, how do we put ourselves on a \npath of not asking our children to pay the burden of the debt that is \nbeing accumulated, how do we make sure we are smart in terms of our \ninvestments in the economy to grow jobs, put money in the pockets of \nmiddle-income people, small businesses that drive the economy--the \nmajority of new jobs are coming from small business--how do we make \nsure that is a priority for us, and how do we make sure we are creating \na set of priorities and a vision for the future that our families are \nasking us to do?\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I listened to this particular debate for \na while. I have a few observations. I am not prepared to make a \nsignificant economic statement. I will be doing that at some point \nduring the debate. But I think I will respond to a few comments that \nhave been made.\n  If I may quote Paul Samuelson in a recent article in Newsweek and the \nWashington Post, he said most of the debate about jobs that is \ncurrently going on is bogus, and he makes the point that if a President \ncould create jobs, the unemployment rate would be permanently at 3.2 \npercent. If a President could create jobs, every President would. If a \nCongress could create jobs, every Congress would. No one wants to go \nhome and address his constituents at a time when jobs are difficult.\n  The fact remains, however, that the Congress or the President cannot, \nwith a wave of the hand or the passage of legislation or the adoption \nof a political slogan, create jobs. Jobs are created in the economy. \nJobs are created because of two things: There first must be accumulated \nwealth, accumulated capital of some kind, and then there must be \nsomeone who holds that capital who is willing to take a risk.\n  All wealth is created by the combination of accumulated capital and \nrisk taking. When we tax people, we tax their accumulated capital. We \nhave to do that. We should do that. I am not suggesting in any sense \nthat taxes are not appropriate, but if we tax capital too much, capital \nflees. It goes some place else. If we regulate risk taking too heavily, \nit goes some place else or it is killed altogether.\n  As a consequence, if we are going to have jobs, we want an economic \nsituation where accumulated capital is allowed to work and where risk \ntakers are rewarded for their risk and where they receive the incentive \nnecessary to compensate them for the risk they take.\n  I do not mean to be overly personal, but I hear people talking about \ntwo things. One, they talk about small business and how wonderful small \nbusiness is, and then they talk about millionaires and how millionaires \nshould be willing to sacrifice a little of their money so everybody \nelse can have a job.\n  It is very interesting that those who talk about let's not make the \ntax cuts permanent then praise small business in the next breath. \nPerhaps they do not realize most of the tax returns that show income in \nexcess of a million dollars are, in fact, the tax returns of owners of \nsmall business.\n  Let me give my own personal example to illustrate the point. I have \ndone it before, but I have discovered since I have come to the Senate, \nthere is no such thing as repetition in the Senate. We always give \nevery speech as if it is brand new.\n  Before I came to the Senate, I was the president of a privately held \ncorporation that filed its taxes under the S section of the Tax Code. \nTherefore, it was known as an S corporation. It used to be called a \nsubchapter S corporation, but they changed the law a little and it is \nnow just an S corporation.\n  When that phrase is used, people's eyes glaze over and they say, what \ndoes that mean? Well, it is very simple. If the corporation earns $1 \nmillion and it has 10 shareholders, instead of the corporation paying \ntaxes on that $1 million, as an S corporation it pays no taxes, but \neach of its 10 shareholders, assuming their shareholdings are equal, \npays taxes on $100,000. Why would any shareholder want to do that? Very \nsimple. It avoids double taxation.\n  If the corporation made $1 million, had 10 shareholders and it paid \ntaxes, it would pay taxes at 36 percent. The Federal Government would \nget 36 cents out of every dollar it earned.\n  At the time I was doing this, the top tax rate was 28 percent. By \nsaying, all right, we are going to register as an S corporation so the \ncorporation does not pay any taxes on the $1 million, it comes to the \n10 shareholders and each one of us will pay taxes on our share of the \nearnings, which in my case was 28 cents, that is a very significant \ndifference--the difference between paying\n\n[[Page S2287]]\n\n28 cents on every dollar you earn and 36 cents on every dollar you \nearn.\n  During the period of time Bill Clinton was President, that number \nwent up to 42. I had said before if we had started that company at a \ntime when the effective tax rate was 42 percent, we probably would not \nhave survived, but because we started it during the Reagan years when \nthe top individual tax rate was 28 percent, we got to keep 72 cents out \nof every dollar we earned.\n  What did we do with that? We put it back into the corporation and we \ncreated jobs, real jobs. The company had four full-time employees when \nI joined it as the chief executive--not a very big company, frankly, \nnot a very big deal. It eventually grew to 4,000 jobs. The reason it \nhad that kind of momentum as a small business is because we only paid \n28 cents back to the Federal Government out of every dollar we earned. \nWe put the 72 cents into growing the business and from a base of 4 jobs \nwe created 4,000 jobs. If we add up all of the income taxes that were \npaid by those 4,000 employees and the corporate taxes that were paid by \nthe company when it finally went public and ceased to be an S \ncorporation, it became a C corporation, and the taxes that were paid by \nthe suppliers of our company and the taxes that were paid by their \nsuppliers and all the rest of it, we come up with a very large number \nthat came into the Federal Government because that company was started.\n\n  As I said in the beginning, it was started because of two things: \naccumulated capital and risk taking. How much accumulated capital did \nwe have? We borrowed $175,000 from the bank. It was the bank's capital. \nThat was our accumulated capital. How big a risk did we take? Every one \nof us signed away everything we owned in the form of a personal \nguarantee to make that company go. After about 9 months of operation, I \nremember the principal shareholder of the company saying to me, Bob, \nare we going to make it? Are we going to survive?\n  I said to him, well, it depends on whether we get repeat business. We \nsold a product that had a year's life and the question was would the \npeople at the end of the year come back and buy the product at the end \nof the year. I said, if we get 55-percent repeat business, we are going \nto survive. If we get less than that, your next phone call has to be to \na real estate broker because you are going to have to sell your house. \nThe bank is going to show up and take everything you own.\n  On that pleasant note, we went ahead with the business. It turned out \nwe got more than a 55-percent renewal rate. We got a 95-percent renewal \nrate and the business doubled. It continued to grow and we funded it \nwith internally generated funds because we were able to keep 72 cents \nout of every dollar we earned and put every dime of that 72 cents back \ninto the business.\n  Because we were an S corporation and the profits we were earning \nshowed up on our individual tax returns, I filed tax returns that \nshowed I was earning over $1 million a year. Now, in fact, my salary as \nthe CEO of that company was $140,000, but there was the other million \nthat was added to it as my share of the company's earnings reported on \nmy personal income tax return.\n  If we go to the chart that was shown by the Senator from Michigan, I \nwould be one of those who would be earning $1 million a year. In fact, \nmy take-home stayed exactly the same at the $140,000 figure. The rest \nof it was all a bookkeeping entry. We did it because we wanted to avoid \ndouble taxation and because we wanted to take advantage of the fact \nthat the effective rate for individuals was lower than the effective \nrate for corporations. We built the business and we created the jobs \nbecause the tax situation was as I have described it.\n  We hear all of these comments about how wonderful small business is \nand how small business is the engine that is driving the economy, and \nthey are right. We hear all of these comments about how small business \nis where the new jobs are, and they are right. It is interesting that \nalmost unanimously those who represent small business are saying to us, \nkeep the President's tax cuts in place. If you do not, you will stifle \nsmall business.\n  On this floor we are seeing our colleagues say, let's let the \nmillionaires pay for the things we want to do, let's take a little off \nthe top from the millionaires and then we can afford all of these \nwonderful Federal programs we want to fund, all of the time while we \nare saying, gee, we are spending too much money, but we should spend \nmore money here and we should spend more money there and we should \nspend more money in the other place. And where are we going to get it? \nWell, we will let the millionaires pay it.\n  Then they say, all of this will help small business. The small \nbusinesspeople are saying, we are the millionaires and it is not coming \nto us in personal income, it is showing up on our tax returns in K-1 \nforms filed to deal with an S corporation, and you are stifling job \ngrowth, you are stifling small business if you do it this way.\n  We do not hear from the real small business man and woman. We hear \nfrom those who say, I am speaking for small business while I am saying \nsmall business is wonderful, and at the same time I am saying increase \nthe taxes on those small business men and women who have sole \nproprietorships or S corporations or limited liability corporations.\n  The other point I want to make in this debate has to do with jobs. We \nare hearing over and over, where are the jobs? Once again, it is the \nPresident's fault. President Bush has presided over the loss of more \njobs than anybody since Herbert Hoover. He must have done it \ndeliberately is the implication. As I said at the outset, Paul \nSamuelson said if a President knew how to create jobs, we would never \nsee the unemployment rate go above 3.2 percent.\n\n  What is the basis of the creation of jobs? Let me give a statistic. \nWhen economic activity goes up, obviously there is a need for more \njobs. There is a need for more people to work at businesses, at firms \nthat are involved in the economic activity growing. So the economic \nactivity has gone up.\n  We had a great year in 2003. The gross domestic product grew by 4.3 \npercent, which in historic terms is terrific. The President said we \nwill get good growth if we have these tax cuts, and we have gotten good \ngrowth. We have added something like $3 trillion to $4 trillion worth \nof wealth on the stock market--and that involves over 50 percent of our \npopulation.\n  The stock market is not just for the privileged few at the top now. \nTeachers' pensions, labor union pensions, veterans' pensions, people \nwho have invested for their children's college funds--over half of \nAmericans are now invested in the stock market. They have seen, since \nthe President's program went into place, an increase in the overall \nvalue of the stock market in the multiple trillions of dollars. This is \nnot a small accomplishment.\n  But where are the jobs if GDP is at 4.3 percent, historically a high \nposition? The stock market has come back, creating a tremendous amount \nof accumulated wealth, and where are the jobs?\n  There is another statistic that answers the question we need to pay \nattention to. In 2003, once again GDP increased by 4.3 percent. \nNormally that is a time when you would see the creation of many jobs. \nHowever, in that same year productivity increased by 4.4 percent: a \nstaggering number in historic terms. But the net effect is that it was \nhigher than GDP.\n  Whenever productivity grows faster than the economy grows, something \nwe don't like happens and that is we lose jobs. For all of the efforts \non this floor and in the White House and in the Federal Reserve to get \nthe economy growing, to get the traction in the recovery growing--and \nwe produced a year of 4.3 percent growth in 2003--with that strong \ngrowth, we lost 60,000 jobs. The reason was productivity grew at 4.4 \npercent while GDP was growing at 4.3 percent.\n  Some will say the solution to the problem is to get productivity \ndown, to have GDP growing and productivity falling. That, of course, is \na prescription for long-term economic disaster. The most significant \nthing we want to do in our economy is keep it as productive as \npossible, to have productivity growing rapidly here so we can outgrow \nthe rest of the world. That is what America has done for 100 years or \nmore.\n  Go back to the middle 1800s and look at the productivity figures for \nthe then leading economy in the world, which was Great Britain, and the \nproductivity figures for the young upcoming\n\n[[Page S2288]]\n\ncountry in the world, which was the United States. You see that over \nthe years the United States had a higher productivity than Great \nBritain by about a half a percent. That was enough, over the decades, \nand then the century, to see America eclipse Great Britain and see \nGreat Britain ultimately disappear as a major world economic \nfactor. America now stands as the strongest economy in the world. We do \nnot want our productivity to go down.\n\n  The thing that has happened in this recession and recovery, something \nthat has not happened before, is that through the quarters of recession \nand recovery productivity remained strong. Productivity simply means \nyou are getting more value out what the workforce is producing. You are \ngetting more goods; you are getting more services; you are getting more \nto sell. If you can get more out of the workforce in this fashion, it \nmeans ultimately your society has a higher standard of living and your \nconsumers pay less for the goods they use. But if productivity is \ngrowing faster than the economy is growing, that means you are getting \nthat result, higher standard of living and lower cost, with fewer \npeople.\n  This is the real dilemma we are facing that is not being discussed \nwhen we talk about economics. The real dilemma we are facing is how do \nwe get the GDP to grow faster than productivity\n  I believe productivity will come down from the high of 4.4 percent \nthat we saw in 2003. I don't think that is sustainable. I think the GDP \nwill eventually cross over the line so the GDP is growing more rapidly \nthan productivity does, and when that happens the jobs will \nautomatically come into play. They will appear. It will not be because \nof anything we do or not because of anything President Bush does or of \nanything that a potential President Kerry might do. It will happen \nbecause the economy is strong enough that the GDP will grow faster, \nthat productivity will be passed by the GDP number. Whoever holds \noffice at that time, be he or she, Republican or Democrat, will take \nfull credit for it. They will say, since it happened on my watch, I did \nit.\n  But let us, at least for a moment, in the rhetoric of this election \nyear, pause and recognize what is happening. We are in the midst of the \ninformation revolution. It is as fundamental to changing the economy as \nthe industrial revolution was in the late 1800s. We have not yet \nlearned quite how to cope with it and deal with it. But the potential \nfor good for our citizens, and for the world, is enormous.\n  I don't want to peddle fear and pessimism because, in fact, we should \nbe optimistic and excited about the future that this represents to us. \nIt will be filled with challenges, just as the industrial revolution \nbrought enormous challenges. But it will be filled with opportunity and \nit should be filled with optimism.\n  I close with this observation. If we had been having this debate 100 \nyears ago, in 1904 instead of 2004, and some economist with a great, \nclear crystal ball had come before us and told us the following we \nwould all have panicked, but it would have been true if he had said \nthis 100 years ago. He would have said: Sixty-nine percent of America's \nlabor force works on the farm; 69 percent of America's labor force is \ninvolved in agriculture, which is civilization's oldest economic \nactivity. One hundred years from now, in 2004, that number will be two. \nYes, you heard me, it is now 69 percent; 100 years from now it will be \n2 percent.\n  If that were all he had said, the sense of panic would be enormous. \nOf course, he would have been accurate because agricultural jobs now \nhave gone from 69 percent of the labor force to 2 percent.\n  What in the world have we done with all of those people who are out \nof work? The industrial revolution took hold and their productivity \nbecame greater and greater and greater, and today the 2 percent of \nAmericans who are involved in agriculture produce more food and fiber \nthan Americans can possibly eat or wear, even though obesity is our \nlargest health problem. We have to export food to keep the farmers busy \nand only 2 percent of our working force is in agriculture.\n  We have enormous productivity.\n  Here is another statistic and cautionary tale in that same situation. \nThe percentage of workers involved in manufacturing has been going \ndown, just like the percentage of workers involved in agriculture for \n50 years--not just in this country but all over the world. As we now \nsee the percentage of workers going down in manufacturing and we get \nall excited because it is going down in one President's term, or in the \n8 years of Bill Clinton, or in the first President Bush's term, or in \nJimmy Carter's term, or wherever it might have been going down, it has \nbeen going down on a steady basis for over 50 years here and in Europe \nand in every other industrialized country in the world.\n  What have we done with those workers? How have we been able to find \njobs for them? The son of the steelworker who no longer has a job \nbecause about 10 percent of the number of steelworkers is necessary to \nrun a steel mill now compared to the number that was necessary when we \nhad open hearth furnace steel mills, the sons and grandsons of those \nsteelworkers who worked in the open hearth furnaces are now working for \nMicrosoft, or Verizon, or in a startup that will become the next e-Bay, \nor whatever company you want to speculate. They are earning more money \nthan their grandfather and their father earned, and they are providing \nfor their families better. We are in the midst of the information \nrevolution, as I said, that is transforming the economy as \nfundamentally as the industrial revolution did.\n  As we deal with this recession and this recovery and talk about what \nwe need to do, let us understand the environment in which we are \noperating.\n  There are many things we don't know about the information revolution. \nThere is much to understand before we can make sound policy. But we \ncome back to a fundamental truth which was true during the agricultural \nage, which was true during the industrial age, and which is true now \nduring the information age; that is, in order to get economic activity, \ngrowth, and wealth creation, you need two things--accumulated capital \nand the willingness to take a risk.\n  If we can always remember those two fundamentals--that all growth and \nall wealth comes from the combination of accumulated capital and taking \na risk--we will make wise decisions.\n  If we fall for the siren song that says the way to deal with our \nproblem is to share the wealth and take the accumulated capital and \nspread it all around in a way that nobody then has any risk--Karl Marx \nsuggested that and we have seen what has happened to the economies that \nfollowed his economic advice--we will kill the goose that has been \nlaying golden eggs in this country for over 240 years.\n  That is a dramatic condemnation of some of what I have heard on the \nfloor, and it is over the top. But, frankly, much of what I have heard \nhere on the floor is over the top.\n  Let us stay with the basics. Let us do our tax policy in a way that \nencourages accumulation of wealth. Let us do our regulatory policy in a \nway that encourages the taking of risks. Then as the wealth is created \nby the combination of accumulated capital and risk taking, let us \ndevise a tax system that does not kill the golden goose but that does \ntake out of the economy the money we need to deal with the proper role \nof government. I am not one who says we shouldn't have taxes. I am not \none who says people shouldn't pay their fair share. I am not one who \nsays just because you are successful you should be left alone. But my \nfundamental goal is a tax system that functions to raise enough money \nto pay for the legitimate needs of government, not one that picks \nwinners and losers, not one that tries to set social policy by tax \nincentives. Let social policy be set by Congress. Let the taxes be \ndrawn in a way that produces the greatest efficiency in the economy. \nThen the gross domestic product will grow more rapidly than \nproductivity, even though the information age will keep productivity \nhigh. At that point the jobs will start to come and we will have done \nour jobs.\n\n  We cannot create jobs. The President cannot create jobs. But what we \ncan do is create an economic circumstance where jobs are discouraged \nand economic activity is dampened. When that happens, we will all pay \nthe price.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n[[Page S2289]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I agree with much of what the Senator from \nUtah has indicated. There are basic fundamentals to the functioning of \nour economy. Right at the heart of the determination of how successful \nwe are as an economy and the role the Federal Government plays is first \non the monetary side with the Federal Reserve Board and on the fiscal \npolicy side what we do with our spending and taxing decisions.\n  The problem I have with the President's budget and the budget offered \nby the majority is it contemplates deep additions to the debt even at a \ntime of economic strength leading into the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration which will explode the cost of the Federal Government. When \nwe overlay that with the President's tax proposals, it explodes the \ncost of revenue lost to the Federal Government at the very time the \nbaby boomers retire, taking us right over a fiscal cliff.\n  Those are not just my views. Those are the views of many who have \nstudied the President's plan. That is why we have the Comptroller \nGeneral of the United States warning us we are heading in a direction \nthat is unsustainable. That is why we have the head of the Federal \nReserve Board saying to us we are overcommitted and tough choices are \ngoing to have to be made. That is why responsible budget group after \nbudget group has said to us you are overcommitted. You have massive \ndeficits--the biggest we have ever had in dollar terms--and you are \nheaded for even more trouble in the future.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator about the size \nand terrifying nature of what we are facing with retirement of the baby \nboomers. But I disagree with him about the connection between this \nbudget and that kind of disaster. I feel even as we are running \nsurpluses right now, the disaster that is facing us is exactly the same \nsize regardless of where we are right now.\n  My question to the Senator is when he references the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Board, with whom he and I both have had this \ndiscussion--we know how strongly Chairman Greenspan feels--is the \nSenator not aware Chairman Greenspan is of the opinion that the \nPresident's tax proposals did indeed help produce the recovery in which \nwe now find ourselves, and indeed Chairman Greenspan has endorsed \nmaking the President's tax proposals permanent? Is the Senator aware of \nthe fact Chairman Greenspan, even as he warns about the same things the \nSenator and I agree upon in terms of the problems of the future, says \nin the present context making the President's tax proposition permanent \nis a good idea?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am fully aware of that. I say to the Senator the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Board has also told the Congress to \nconsider cutting Social Security benefits. That is part of the logic of \nwhere it all leads. The 75-year shortfall in Social Security is one-\nthird the 75-year cost of the President's tax cuts. To suggest these \ntwo things are not related is to avoid reality--an unpleasant reality, \nbut, nonetheless, a hard fact we have to cope with.\n  The fundamental problem we have here is our appetite for spending is \ngreater than our appetite to tax ourselves to pay for it. I believe it \nis going to take an approach on both sides of the equation. I believe \nwe are going to have to restrain our impulse to spend, and I believe we \nare going to have to be more disciplined on the revenue side of the \nequation.\n  The revenue side of the equation is what has really fallen out. We \nnow look at this year and we see revenue will be at the lowest \npercentage of gross domestic production since 1950. While it is true we \nhave seen an up-tick in spending largely because of the needs for \nadditional money for defense and homeland security and responding to \nthe September 11 attacks, it is still true even with that increase in \nspending that we are well below the levels of Federal spending in the \n1980s and the 1990s as a share of our national income.\n  As I diagnose this problem, I come to a different conclusion than the \nSenator from Utah. I share with the Senator the conclusion we have to \ndiscipline spending. I also believe we have to work on the revenue side \nof this equation. I say the first place we ought to look is not to a \ntax increase but to the tax gap, the difference between what is owed \nand what is being paid that the revenue commissioner now tells me for \n2001 was $255 billion for the 1 year alone. We have not had any serious \naggressive effort to go after this tax gap.\n  I was also told by the former revenue commissioner that he \nanticipates those in the vast majority who pay what they legitimately \nowe are paying 15 percent more because we have some--both companies and \nindividuals--who are failing to pay what they legitimately owe. I am \nconfident the Senator from Utah pays what he legitimately owes. I know \nI do.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, if I could respond, I have no idea if \nwhat I pay is what I legitimately owe or not because the Tax Code is so \nimpenetrable I did not get an answer out of two different people as to \nwhat the amount is. I pay the amount my tax preparer tells me I owe and \nso far the IRS has accepted that as legitimate.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to review the Senator's returns and \nrender another judgment.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Give me a third opinion.\n  If I could make a quick comment without the Senator losing his right \nto the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I recognize fully the level of revenue currently coming \ninto the Federal Treasury is at a distressingly low historic point. But \nI go back again to a comment that Chairman Greenspan once made to a \ngroup of us. I am not sure whether the Senator from North Dakota was \npresent. It fits in with the area of agreement that we have. He said to \nus: You can set the level of spending just about wherever you want. You \ncan pass a law and be pretty sure spending will be where the law says \nit will be. You cannot set the level of income where you want. That is \na function of the economy.\n  If we look at the period which we all look back on with such great \nsatisfaction--that is, the years in which we were in surplus--one of \nthe major reasons we were in surplus was that the economy unexpectedly, \naccording to the computers at CBO, produced far more revenue than CBO \nscored. This came as a result of the balanced budget agreement, the \nagreement entered into with the Republican Congress and the Democratic \nPresident after the 1996 election, an agreement that the Speaker of the \nHouse in 1995 tried to enforce with heavyhanded political methods and \ngot himself in trouble in 1995. But after the election, the leadership \nof the Senate and the House and the leadership in the White House with \nPresident Clinton sat down and we got the balanced budget agreement, \nthe balanced budget proposals, and in that process the Congress \ninsisted, the President resisted but finally agreed to cut the capital \ngains tax rate.\n\n  The CBO scored the amount of revenue we would get from that tax cut. \nThe actual revenue, I believe, was five times as great as CBO scored \nit. No one had anticipated the rivers of cash that would come in.\n  Now, rivers of cash came in, in my view, because there was capital \ntied up in mature investments that wanted to find more entrepreneurial \nkinds of investment but believed that it could not move it--that is, \nthe owners of capital believed they could not move it with the capital \ngains rate of 28 percent. When the capital gains rate came down to 20 \npercent, they figured that was enough to allow moving the capital out \nof mature investments and into entrepreneurial investments and we saw \nFederal revenue go above 22 percent of gross domestic production, which \nI don't think has ever happened before.\n  Now we are in a recession. There are no capital gains. The revenue \nhas gone down into the teens in percentages of gross domestic \nproduction. The recovery, historically, can be depended upon to take \ncare of that and the more the recovery persists, the more Federal \nrevenue as a percentage of gross domestic production will rise.\n  I thank the Senator for his courtesy and will not continue this \ndialog because I am intruding on the good will of others, but I \nappreciate the opportunity to have engaged in this exchange.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n[[Page S2290]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I might say for my part I always enjoy visiting with the \nSenator from Utah and his questions. He thinks about these subjects in \na very careful and disciplined way. I always enjoy these chances to \nhave a serious discussion and a serious debate that is all too lacking \nin the Senate.\n  Just momentarily, because I know the Senator from Nevada has a \npresentation he would like to make, and I know the Senator from \nWashington also has something, for the record I will provide the other \nside of the story with respect to something Senator Allard presented.\n  Senator Allard was making the argument that those at the highest \nincome levels are actually going to bear a greater proportion of the \ntotal tax bill going forward than they did before the tax cuts. The \nanalysis we have seen by others reaches a different conclusion. Let me \nshare that with my colleagues.\n  This is done by the Tax Policy Center which is run jointly by the \nUrban Institute and the Brookings Institution. Their conclusion is \nthose with very high incomes will be paying a smaller share of total \ntaxes as a result of the Bush tax cuts.\n  Let me give three examples. Those with taxable incomes above $1 \nmillion who constitute 0.2 of a percent of taxpayers would pay 12 \npercent of total taxes in 2006 without the Bush tax cuts. With the tax \ncuts, these same pairs will pay 11.2 percent of total taxes in that \nyear. This includes not only income taxes but payroll taxes.\n  Second example. Those with taxable incomes above $500,000, who \nconstitute one half of 1 percent of taxpayers, would pay 17.4 percent \nof total taxes in 2006 without the Bush tax cuts. With the tax cuts, \nthese same taxpayers will pay 16.4 percent of total taxes in that year.\n\n  Finally, those with taxable incomes above $200,000, who constitute \n2.4 percent of taxpayers, would pay 30.7 percent of total taxes in 2006 \nwithout the Bush tax cuts. However, with the tax cuts, these same \ntaxpayers will pay 30.1 percent of total taxes in that year.\n  The Senator from Colorado was arguing that those who are at the high \nincomes will pay more of total taxes as a result of the Bush tax cuts. \nThis independent analysis by the Tax Policy Center reaches just the \nopposite conclusion. When you look at income taxes and payroll taxes, \nhigher income people, those at $1 million, those at $500,000, those at \n$200,000, all will pay less than they would have paid without the tax \ncuts.\n  Finally, looking at it in a different way, under the Bush income tax \ncuts, the top 20 percent of income earners got 68.7 percent of the \nbenefit. More striking, the top 1 percent of income earners, those \nearning more than $337,000, got 33 percent of the benefit of the Bush \ntax cut. That is much more than any other income class.\n  Finally, looking at 2006, how the tax benefits stack up, in that \nyear, middle-income taxpayers, those who are right in the middle of the \nincome stream, the 20 percent right in the middle, will receive an \naverage tax cut of $566. Those with incomes over $1 million in 2006 \nwill get an average tax cut of $140,369. If these bars were actually \nproportionate, the bar representing the tax cuts received by those with \nover $1 million of income would have to be 35 feet tall. It would have \nto be 35 feet tall in order to compare proportionately with what the \nmiddle-income taxpayers will receive in that year.\n\n  I thank my colleagues and yield the floor so the Senator from Nevada \ncan speak.\n  I ask the Senator, will you give us an idea how long you intend to \nspeak?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Maybe 10 or 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Ten or 15 minutes. And then for the information of our \ncolleagues, I ask the Senator from Washington, how much time would she \nlike?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. After that, we will then probably close down the shop. We \ndo not have any other speakers on our side, I say to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I want to make a couple of comments about \nthe budget we have before us today.\n  It was an interesting process, once again, in the Budget Committee \nlast week. We had a lot of amendments that went pretty much down party \nlines. But one comment I will make about the Budget Committee that is \nmaybe a little more encouraging this year is the rhetoric was not \nnearly as harsh. And that, in an election year, I think is something \npositive to take out of the whole discussion in the Budget Committee. \nWhile there were differences, I thought it was at a little higher level \nthis year--my second year on the Budget Committee--than my first year. \nI thought there was a little less rancor and a little more agreeing to \ndisagree type of attitude on the Budget Committee.\n  There are differences between the two sides, and sometimes even \nwithin our own parties, as we look at making policy. The ranking member \non the Budget Committee has made a lot of issues about deficits. I echo \nthat. I think it is very important we get the looming deficits in the \noutyears under control because they are a huge threat to the long-term \nhealth of our economy.\n  Having said that, there are reasons for deficits, and there are \nacceptable reasons for short periods of time to run deficits. The two \nbiggest reasons would be being in a recession and having a war. \nUnfortunately for our country, those both hit at the same time.\n  We had, obviously, the recession which started at the end of the \nClinton administration and continued on into the early parts of the \nBush administration. Then we had September 11 and the global war on \nterrorism. We had the huge costs for New York City, the huge cost to \nour economy 9/11 has had, as well as the cost in increased spending the \nglobal war on terrorism has had. Given all of that, it is \nunderstandable why we have a $500 billion deficit.\n\n  Where I would disagree with my colleague, though, is what are we \ngoing to do with it now. How are we going to go into the future to get \nour hands around this deficit, to bring it down to an acceptable level? \nI think an acceptable level is to do what we were doing; and that is, \nto start paying down some of the long-term debt. With the baby boomers \nout there, we have to have a growing economy. We have to get some of \nthis debt under control so we will be able to afford some of the things \npeople want to be able to afford, as far as our Government spending is \nconcerned.\n  But we have to look at how do we go forward. What are our priorities? \nThat is what the budget we have before us attempts to set. We have more \nmoney for education. We have more money for veterans benefits. We have \nmore money for the defense of our country. We wish we did not have to \nbe spending all this extra money on the defense of our country, but \nthat is the primary role for the Federal Government, according to the \nConstitution, to defend the United States of America. This budget \nreflects that primary role of the Federal Government.\n  Having said that, I want to look at how we have gotten to the present \ndeficit so we can have a document that takes us forward.\n  This pie chart we have shows the various reasons why we have the \ndeficit we have today. About 40 percent of it, shown on the yellow \nportion of the chart, the largest chunk, is because of the poor \neconomy. Some of that can be blamed on September 11. Some of it is \nbecause of a downturn in the business cycle, and we are coming out of \nit. But the fact is, that is a big part of the reason we are in this \ndeficit.\n  Almost 40 percent--37 percent--comes in the red area on this graph, \nand that is because of new spending. That is everything from the war, \neducation programs, veterans benefits, environmental programs, roads, \neverything you can think of. That is new spending. That is almost 37 \npercent.\n  The tax cuts have reduced revenues--out of a total of 100 percent of \nthe reason for the deficit, it accounts for about 23 percent of the \ndeficit.\n  You can also make the argument, though, that the economy would be \nworse without the tax cuts. Therefore, the yellow-shaded portion, which \nis the 40 percent, would be even higher without the tax cuts. Because \nwhat the tax cuts did--and Alan Greenspan has testified to this--is \nthey stimulated the economy so fewer people were on the unemployment \nrolls and more were working. That is the reason we have a lower \nunemployment rate today. That includes self-employed people. That is a \nbig part of what people are doing. They are starting their own \nbusinesses.\n  One of the big things we heard from a lot of States is their State \nbudgets\n\n[[Page S2291]]\n\nare in trouble. We saw a dramatic decline in the value of the stock \nmarket. The NASDAQ, toward the end of the Clinton administration, was \ntanking. Then we had September 11. All of that, with the bad economy, \nkind of combined and we saw huge losses in the stock market.\n  Since the tax cuts we passed last year, we have had an increase \nbetween the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ of $4.5 trillion in \nvalue. We would see an increase in tax revenues at this point except \nthere are so many people who had losses from before when the stock \nmarket tanked that we do not have a huge amount of increased revenues. \nBut the fact is, as the stock market continues to go up, we are now \npoised to start reaping the benefits in new revenues to the Federal \nGovernment from the stock markets and capital gains taxes.\n\n  By the way, in the State of California, one of their biggest budget \nproblems was the lack of capital gains taxes. The more the stock market \ngoes up and the value of property goes up and the value of a lot of \nthings goes up, the more State budgets are going to be helped, \nespecially States that rely on revenue sources such as that, such as \nthe State of California does.\n  I wish we could get more of a handle on Federal spending. I believe \nit is out of control.\n  I want to run through a few charts to show that when we were in \nsurpluses, people got a pretty strong appetite. The ranking member on \nthe Budget Committee talked about how we all have big appetites around \nhere for spending. It is an easy way to get reelected, to keep giving \nthat money out. It is hard for people to say no. When we were in those \nsurpluses, the appetite increased. Federal spending went up fairly \ndramatically. You can argue for every one of these programs, it was \njustifiable. But we have to realize we got to this point.\n  A couple of examples. These are simple examples. The Low Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program. You can see in the last several years how it \nhad gone up. Then it went down for a few years. Now it has gone back \nup.\n  For the Centers for Disease Control, there have been dramatic \nincreases in the last several years. The increases started in about \n2000, and went forward pretty rapidly.\n  The child nutrition programs, you can see, continued, but with a \nfairly good uptick in the last few years.\n  The child care funding in around 2000 had a huge jump compared to \nwhat it was during the 1990s. It was fine when the economy was \nproducing a lot of tax revenues.\n  This is the National Institutes of Health. Their spending, as you can \nsee, has had a very rapid rise.\n  There are a lot of great programs, but the fact is, we have built a \nlot of spending into our budget now.\n  As Ronald Reagan said--and I am paraphrasing him--he discovered, when \ntrying to eliminate Federal programs or Federal spending: The closest \nthing to eternal life in Washington, DC, is a Federal program.\n  That was a true statement back then and remains so today.\n  Both sides of the aisle are going to have to come together and \naddress the problem of Federal spending. The ranking member of the \nBudget Committee has argued that we need to start looking on the \nrevenue side.\n  I have a philosophical difference of opinion because I believe \nincreasing tax rates takes away the incentive for businesses to invest. \nI remember when I was in business as a small businessperson, and I \nmaybe wanted to do an expansion on my animal hospital. As a practicing \nveterinarian, if the Government was taking more money, I would have \nless money to be able to make that decision. Maybe I couldn't add that \nextra employee or I couldn't do the expansion to add on to my building. \nThe more money I had in my pocket because the Government was taking \nless, the more money I could pump back into the economy by doing an \nexpansion of the building or by hiring another employee. Even if I \ndidn't hire an internal employee, doing an expansion obviously puts \nother people to work.\n  That is why there is a philosophical difference between the two sides \nof the aisle on taxes and tax cuts. I want to put it in the hands of \ninvestors and entrepreneurs to stimulate the economy. It can be that \nlow-income tax cuts, child tax credits, things such as that, help the \neconomy because then those folks go out and spend money.\n  The bottom line is, we have to have a strong economy and have tax \nrevenues going up. We are not going to cut spending around here--we all \nknow that--but at least slow the rate of growth down to the point where \nthe tax revenues start outpacing what we are doing spending-wise so \nthat we can start taking care of these deficits and eliminate them \nwithin a few short years.\n  I am not a person who thinks that 7, 10, 12 years out is acceptable \nto have deficits where they take a dip down and then they start going \nback up. I believe we have to take it down as we did in the 1990s, take \nit all the way down to where we start actually paying off some of the \nlong-term debt so that we leave our children and grandchildren with a \nsmaller Federal debt than we currently have. If we don't, with the \nretirement of the baby boomers, our children and grandchildren will \nhave to pay higher taxes.\n  It is important we join together across party lines and work out the \ndifferences we can, understanding there are philosophical differences. \nThe one place we both agree is that we need to hold the line on \nspending. We will have different priorities of where that spending is, \nbut we need to hold the line on Federal spending, especially over the \nnext couple of years until the economy starts becoming robust.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada. He is \nalso a valuable member of the Budget Committee. I enjoy these \ndiscussions with him. He is thoughtful. We disagree, but we will have a \nchance to talk about some of those disagreements as we go through the \ndebate.\n  I am going to take a moment to talk about some of these issues now, \nbut I believe he does share a fundamental commitment to the notion that \nwe have to get these deficits down. We may have some differences about \nhow to do that. I believe we have to both restrain spending and work \nthe revenue side of this equation. I don't think it is going to work \nwithout that.\n  Let me start with a little different take on what has caused this \ndramatic flip in where we are with respect to deficits and what we \nearlier projected to be surpluses. We have had, for the period from \n2002 to 2011, a $9 trillion reversal. As we look at the causes, here is \nwhat we see. The tax cuts are 33 percent of the difference.\n  The Senator from Nevada had a chart. I think it showed 23 percent. I \ndon't quite know what the difference is, although I will bet in his \nchart he did not include the additional debt service as a result of the \ntax cuts. My recollection is it was 23 percent in his chart. We may \nalso have a different timeframe.\n  Our analysis from 2002 to 2011 is that 33 percent of the \ndisappearance of the surplus was from tax cuts. The second biggest \nreason was technical changes, primarily lower revenues--lower revenues \nthat were not caused by the tax cuts; lower revenues that were because \nthe projections were overly optimistic.\n  The third biggest reason was other legislation. It is spending. Most \nof the spending went to increased defense spending, increased homeland \nsecurity spending, and the response to the 9/11 attack, rebuilding New \nYork, the airline bailout, and the rest. Only 8 percent of the \ndisappearance of the surplus for the years 2002 to 2011 is the result \nof the economic downturn. In our analysis, the biggest reason for the \ndisappearance, the biggest single reason, is the tax cuts.\n  I am much less concerned about the tax cuts in the short term. I \nthink all of us know you have to run deficits in the short term with an \neconomic downturn, with the attack. It is the longer term policy of \ncontinuing to run these deficits that is truly dangerous and reckless.\n  When we look at where the increase in spending occurred, we can see \nthat 91 percent of it is in these three areas: The increase in defense \nspending, which is by far the biggest, the increase in homeland \nsecurity, and the response to the attack.\n  Here is what has happened to the debt under the President's plan. The \ndebt is taking off like a scalded cat;\n\n[[Page S2292]]\n\nagain, right before the baby boomers retire. The problem I see with the \nbudget the President has put before us is there is no real progress on \nreducing the increases in the debt. The President says he is going to \ncut the deficit in half, but that is only because he leaves out whole \nareas of expenditures. But if you look at increases in the debt, what \nyou see is quite a different picture. The debt keeps getting increased \nunder the President's plan by $600 billion a year, each and every year, \nfor as far as the eye can see. At the end of the budget period it is \nincreasing by $700 billion.\n  The Senator from Nevada says we have to get back to reducing the \ndeficit so we stop accumulating debt and so we are in a position to \nstart paying down debt. That isn't where the President's plan takes us.\n  This is from the President's own budget document.\n  What it shows is record deficits, the biggest deficits in dollar \nterms we have ever had, a slight improvement in terms of the so-called \nunified deficit where all the funds are jackpotted, Social Security \nmoney is used to pay for tax cuts and other expenditures. But then look \nwhat happens. As the baby boomers retire and the President's tax cuts \nexplode in cost, we are taken right over the cliff. That is the problem \nwith the President's plan. It doesn't add up in the long term. It does \nnot add up in the short term, and it takes us in a very reckless \ndirection, one in which we will not be able to meet the long-term \nobligations of the country.\n  With that, I yield the floor and thank the Senator from Washington \nfor being here this evening and for her invaluable contributions to the \ndeliberations of the Budget Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his tremendous \nleadership on the Budget Committee over the years and for his \nleadership in making sure we do the right thing in terms of deficits \nand also investments for this country.\n  I have served on the Budget Committee for the past 11 years, through \nrecessions and economic expansions and during periods of surplus and \nperiods of deficit. I know what responsible budgets look like because I \nhave worked with chairmen from both parties.\n  I believe this Republican budget doesn't do what we must do to create \njobs, improve our security, and to meet our country's needs. I think we \ncan do better. That is why I am speaking out on the floor this evening. \nIt is why I offered amendments in committee last week, and it is why I \nwill be offering amendments on the floor this week.\n  Mr. President, this is a critical time for our country, and we need a \nFederal budget that meets our needs. We are facing many challenges \ntoday, from supporting our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, to \nimproving our security at home, to recovering all the jobs that we have \nlost, and addressing the growing deficit.\n  This budget resolution should help us meet those challenges, but \ninstead it offers the wrong priorities. It favors tax cuts over our \nNation's security. It favors boardrooms over classrooms. It favors \ndeficits over job creation. Frankly, this budget offers too little help \nfor families in my State of Washington. My State still has the fourth \nhighest unemployment in the Nation. This budget does not give families \nin my State the support they deserve as they work to turn our economy \naround and build for the future.\n  The people of Washington deserve a real Federal commitment because \nthey work to create jobs and provide health care and improve our \nsecurity and transportation. On the issues important in my State, this \nbudget comes up short. I am particularly disappointed that the \nPresident's budget doesn't fulfill the Federal commitment to secure our \nports, care for our veterans, to invest in education, to improve health \ncare, or to provide the infrastructure we need to move our communities \nforward.\n  Not only is this budget bad for Washington State, but it is also bad \nfor our country's economic future, lining up massive deficits for years \nto come. I hear many in the majority speak of the need for ``fiscal \ndiscipline,'' but the rhetoric in this budget doesn't meet the reality. \nThis budget continues the fiscal policies that have put our Nation's \npriorities in jeopardy.\n  Two weeks ago, Americans learned that the majority's policies are \nthreatening America's retirement security in order to pay for their own \nirresponsible fiscal policies. Rather than backing away from a \nmisguided economic policy that has cost us millions of jobs, the \nadministration now appears ready to cut Social Security benefits for \nmillions of hard-working Americans. I am not willing to tell the people \nof my State that they must suffer because of the fiscal mistakes of \nthis administration or this majority in the Congress.\n  I want to turn to a few of my top concerns with this budget: port \nsecurity, veterans, education, health care, and transportation.\n  In Washington State, we depend on our ports. One in 4 Washington jobs \nrely on international trade, and our ports are critical economic \nengines. Unfortunately, as we all know, in today's world, America's \nports are vulnerable. A terrorist attack launched on or through our \nports could bring our commerce to a standstill, threatening lives and \njobs and really our economic future. We have an obligation to improve \nthe security of our ports.\n  Unfortunately, this budget tells our communities that the Federal \nGovernment will not be a full partner in port security. This budget \nliterally sticks our local ports and communities with unfunded mandates \nat a time when local and State budgets are already stretched incredibly \nthin.\n  The President's budget undermines port security in 4 ways:\n  First of all, it eliminates Operation Safe Commerce.\n  Second, it underfunds the Maritime Transportation Security Act by 93 \npercent.\n  Third, it doesn't provide the Coast Guard with the funding it needs \nto meet its growing missions.\n  Finally, the President's budget cuts port security grants by 63 \npercent.\n  Last week in the Budget Committee markup, I offered an amendment to \nstop the President's cut to port security grants. My amendment failed \non a party-line vote. This fight is not over. I will continue to push \nthis White House to pay its share of port security instead of passing \nthose bills on to our local communities.\n  Mr. President, this budget also shortchanges our veterans. Washington \nState is home to more than 670,000 veterans today. They rely on \nservices they were promised when they signed up for service to our \ncountry. But the President's budget is $2.6 billion below the \nindependent budget recommendation for the VA.\n  The VFW, in fact, called the President's budget ``harmful to \nveterans.'' The Disabled American Veterans called it ``utterly \ndisgraceful.''\n  This is the wrong message to send at a time when the next generation \nof combat veterans is today risking their lives in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  Last week, I offered an amendment in the Budget Committee to increase \nthe VA construction account by $400 million. Last year, Congress \nauthorized the VA to take money out of its health care budget for these \nconstruction projects that will begin in this fiscal year. Unless we \ncan increase that construction account, our veterans are going to face \na $400 million cut in their health care services.\n  The amendment I offered in committee would have protected our \nveterans from that cut. Unfortunately, the veterans amendment was \ndefeated in the committee on a party-line vote.\n  Our American veterans deserve better, and I will keep fighting for \nthem.\n  Let me talk about education. I really believe this budget fails, as \nwe all know, to provide the funding that was promised in the No Child \nLeft Behind Act. This Republican budget comes up $8.6 billion short of \nwhat our local schools need to fully fund No Child Left Behind. I \nrepresent nearly 28,000 Washington State students who will be denied \ntitle I services this year under the President's budget request.\n  The President's budget falls $84 million short of the title I funding \nthat was promised to my State under the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  The President's budget also freezes funding for impact aid, dropout \nprevention, school counseling, afterschool programs, teacher quality, \nmigrant education, and rural education.\n\n  How can we expect our students and teachers to succeed when we fail \nto\n\n[[Page S2293]]\n\nprovide them with the resources they need? That is why I offered an \namendment to provide $8.6 billion to help our local schools implement \nthe No Child Left Behind Act.\n  Once again, in committee my amendment failed on a party-line vote. We \ncannot expect our schools to do everything we required of them under \nthe No Child Left Behind Act without the support we promised to them.\n  Let me talk about health care. I believe this budget also seriously \njeopardizes health care for many in my home State of Washington. This \nbudget could jeopardize critical support for community health centers, \nthe community access program, NIH, and the CDC.\n  This budget also reduces our commitment to Medicaid. That is a \nprogram we should be expanding and strengthening to address the rising \nnumber of uninsured and increasing costs of health care.\n  Today, Washington State is struggling to keep its commitment to low-\nincome children through the Medicaid and CHIP programs. Medicaid cuts \ncould result in another 74,000 uninsured individuals in my home State \nalone. We need more help from the Federal Government and, frankly, this \nbudget falls short.\n  Finally, let me say a word about transportation. Less than a month \nago, this Senate passed a strong, bipartisan bill to invest in our \nFederal highways, transit, and transportation safety programs for the \nnext 6 years. Unfortunately, despite the overwhelming support of the \nSenate, the budget that we see now before us today cuts $62 billion for \ninvestment in our surface transportation needs. That is about jobs and \nabout economic growth.\n  It is estimated that for every $1 billion we spend on transportation \ninfrastructure, we create over 47,000 good paying family wage jobs.\n  We know that investing in our transportation priorities today will \nhelp us not only improve our quality of life but will provide for our \nfuture economic growth. If this Congress truly cares about investing in \njobs, we will provide the funding agreed to by the Senate less than 1 \nmonth ago today.\n  As I see it, as this budget is written today, it fails our families \nin areas such as security, veterans, education, health care, and \ntransportation. I am hopeful that we can improve this resolution \nthrough the amendment process this week and really create a budget that \nmakes the right investments, that is fiscally responsible, and reflects \nthe priorities of working families across this country.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues throughout this week to \naddress those issues.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his \nwork. I see the chairman of the Budget Committee. I know this is the \nlast budget he will shepherd through the Congress. I thank him for his \ncommitment to our country as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wish to speak to the budget resolution \nfor a couple minutes, if I can. I know we are getting closer to the end \nof the day. This budget, obviously, maps out this Nation's fiscal \npresent and future in great detail, but this budget, as all budgets, is \nmore than about numbers. It is about choices. The choices we make in a \nbudget tell us who we are and what we value as a nation.\n  Unfortunately, the budget resolution brought to the floor by our \nRepublican colleagues, like the budget proposed by President Bush last \nmonth, makes the wrong choices, sets the wrong priorities, and fails to \nprepare our Nation for the challenges we will face in the future.\n  Since President Bush took office, 3 million private sector jobs have \nbeen lost. Today, 8.2 million Americans are out of work, and the number \nof long-term unemployed is at the highest point in 20 years. But even \nwith so many Americans looking for work, the Republican budget fails to \nprovide a strategy for creating new jobs.\n  Nearly 60,000 veterans are on waiting lists for care at veterans \nhospitals. When our troops fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan return \nhome, the lines could get even longer. But despite the extraordinary \nsacrifices our soldiers have made for us, the Republican budget offers \nveterans only longer waits and higher fees.\n  School districts across the country are facing an early end to \nclasses because they do not have the resources to offer students a full \nyear of learning. Despite the strain on local school budgets and the \npromises the President made in the No Child Left Behind Act, the \nRepublican budget falls $9.4 billion short of their commitment and \nleaves millions of children behind in the process.\n\n  Al-Qaida and other terrorist groups are still plotting against \nAmericans and still capable of carrying out catastrophic attacks on \nAmerican soil. Despite CIA Director Tenet's warnings of continuing \nthreats, the Republican budget fails to provide our first responders \nand port officials the resources they need to make us more secure.\n  Our Nation is at war, our economy is flagging, our schools are \nstruggling, and our Government is facing record deficits as far as the \neye can see. Despite the tremendous challenge our Nation faces, this \nbudget inexplicably proposes a staggering $1.3 trillion in new tax \nbreaks primarily for those at the very top.\n  When President Bush took office, he inherited record surpluses that \nensured a rock solid fiscal foundation for a generation to come. But in \n3 years, due to these reckless policies and irresponsible choices, this \nadministration has steered our country toward an unprecedented fiscal \nmeltdown. Rather than try to repair the damage caused by these \npolicies, this budget continues these policies and digs an even deeper \nhole.\n  This is not an accident. It is becoming increasingly clear that \nsupporters of these policies have pursued them knowing that--some would \nsay hoping--the record deficits would unravel the Nation's retirement \nsecurity net.\n  Three years ago, the administration and Republicans tried to \nobfuscate this fact with budget gimmickry. During the 2000 campaign and \nnumerous times since then, the President assured us that under his \nwatch none of the Social Security surplus would be used to fund other \nspending initiatives or tax relief. But late last month, Federal \nChairman Alan Greenspan blew the cover off this budget strategy. He, \ntoo, said, in 2001, that the President's tax breaks would not endanger \nSocial Security, but now that the deficits caused by the tax breaks are \nunmistakable, Chairman Greenspan and the Republican leadership say it \nis Social Security that must be cut rather than the tax cuts that drove \nus into deficits in the first place.\n  In the face of the unending flow of red ink, President Bush publicly \nshifted his position as well. When asked his opinion of Chairman \nGreenspan's comments, President Bush responded:\n\n       My position on Social Security benefits is this: Those \n     benefits should not be changed for people at or near \n     retirement.\n\n  The President appears to be indicating that cutting Social Security \nbenefits for the coming generation of retirees, including the baby boom \ngeneration, is an option he is prepared to take. The choice many of our \ncolleagues are making is now apparent for all of us to see. They are \nchoosing tax breaks for the wealthy elite over a strong Social Security \nsystem upon which every American can depend.\n  Democrats have a different set of priorities. In the course of the \ncoming debate, we plan to offer a series of amendments aimed to repair \nour fiscal problems, keep the promises made to our seniors and \nveterans, and prepare our country for the challenges of the future. \nEach amendment will fix a glaring weakness in the Republican budget, \nand each will be fully paid for. In fact, most will actually reduce \ndeficits that the budgets have created.\n  First, we will offer an amendment to strengthen Social Security. As I \nnoted earlier, when President Bush was elected, he promised not to \ntouch the trust fund. The administration flip-flopped on that promise, \nand in the last 3 years has taken $550 billion from Social Security to \npay for the tax breaks. But they are not done yet. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the Republican budget spends every penny \nof the 10-year $2.4 trillion Social Security surplus on tax cuts and \nother Government programs. In other words, in 3 short years, the \nRepublicans have gone from promising not to touch a penny of the Social \nSecurity surplus to proposing that we spend all $2.4 trillion to fund \ntheir tax breaks and other Government spending.\n\n[[Page S2294]]\n\n  We believe the Social Security system represents a solemn promise to \nour seniors, and we will propose an amendment that protects Social \nSecurity for generations to come.\n  Second, we will offer an amendment to help end the jobs crisis and \nget more Americans back to work. On average, more than 80,000 private \nsector jobs have been lost each and every month since this President \ntook office. The manufacturing sector alone has lost 2.8 million jobs. \nWe will offer an amendment that encourages the creation of American \njobs, discourages shipping American jobs overseas, and provides \ndislocated workers the assistance they need.\n  Third, we will offer an amendment to provide the resources necessary \nto ensure that our veterans receive the care and treatment they \ndeserve. According to CBO, the President's request is $257 billion \nbelow last year's level when adjusted for inflation. With 60,000 \nveterans already on waiting lists for health care and tens of thousands \nof military personnel scheduled to return home from Iraq and \nAfghanistan as the newest generation of veterans, this underfunding \nwill only increase an already unacceptable backlog.\n  Moreover, just as the administration last year, the budget also \ncontains policies--higher fees and copayments--that will drive 800,000 \nindividuals out of the system and make those who choose to stay pay \nmore. When our soldiers in uniform come home from Iraq and Afghanistan, \nthey will deserve a parade, and they will get it. But our obligation to \nour veterans does not end with the parade. Our amendment will give all \nMembers of the Senate an opportunity to demonstrate their recognition \nof and appreciation for all these veterans have done for our country.\n  Fourth, Democrats will offer an amendment to fully fund the Leave No \nChild Behind law. This law offered schools a deal. It said, if you hold \nyour students to higher standards, we will guarantee you the funding to \nmeet those standards. Schools are holding up their end of the bargain, \nbut the President has reneged.\n  In the years since the bill was passed, President Bush has failed to \nrequest the funding he committed in this legislation. This year, the \nPresident's budget request is $9.4 billion short. The Democratic \namendment will keep the promise we made to our children. This budget is \na portrait of broken promises, bad choices, and misplaced priorities.\n  At a time when it is critical that we begin to regain a firm fiscal \nfooting, this budget drives us even deeper in the hole. The White House \nand Republican leadership have chosen to continue their reckless fiscal \npolicy all in the name of providing massive tax breaks to the \nprivileged few and giveaways to special interests. As a result, their \nbudget fails our veterans, our seniors, our children, and millions of \nAmericans who are looking for work. We could do better. We must.\n  Our Nation has the resources to fulfill our promises to seniors, our \nveterans, and our schools. We need to make responsible choices. We need \nto honor the promises we have made. Our budget should reflect the \npriorities and choices of the American people. Democrats are ready to \nmake sure it does.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I think we are coming closer to \nconcluding the debate tonight. I urge our colleagues to be aware of the \nfact that this is going to be a busy week. I want to make a couple of \ncomments. I have heard two or three of our speakers say this budget \nshortchanges veterans and education.\n  I will throw out a few facts about what this resolution does. \nSometimes people say they are referring to the President's budget, or \nthey are referring to something they read in the paper. I will just \nthrow out a few facts. The total amount of money we anticipate spending \nin education, mandatory and discretionary, is $68 billion. That is a 9-\npercent increase over last year, mandatory and discretionary combined. \nPeople are acting as if there were significant cuts.\n  I also refer back to what we were spending in the year 2000. Today, \nit is at $97 billion. So it has almost doubled since the year 2000, and \nyet we hear a lot of people saying we are cutting education like crazy. \nEducation has grown, and grown dramatically in the last few years. \nThose are just a couple of the facts. That includes mandatory and \ndiscretionary.\n  On the discretionary side, we are anticipating a little over $3 \nbillion increase between 2004 and 2005. That is in the resolution, and \npeople should know that.\n  I have also heard some comments on veterans. I will restate the \nfacts. What we are assuming in our resolution is an increase of 14.3 \npercent for veterans, mandatory and discretionary, between 2004 and \n2005. That is a big increase. Keep in mind, both in education and \nnondefense we are assuming very close to a freeze, but we are assuming \na big increase for veterans, primarily on the mandatory side.\n  Congress did a lot of things last year to increase payments to \nveterans, including current receipts. So when we add all of these \nthings together on the discretionary side, we are assuming over a $1.4 \nbillion increase, most all of that for medical care. Again, medical \ncare has risen dramatically over the last several years. We are looking \nat programs that have been expanding dramatically. Let me mention a few \nfigures.\n\n  In the year 1990, on the discretionary side for veterans, we spent \n$13 billion. In the year 2000, 10 years later, we spent $20 billion. \nToday we are forecasting $30.5 billion. So it took 10 years, from 1990 \nto the year 2000, for discretionary spending for veterans to go up $7.9 \nbillion. Now, from the year 2000 to the year 2005, 5 years, it has gone \nup another 50 percent.\n  People say you are shortchanging veterans. Maybe no matter what \nfigure we had in the budget there would be those same complaints. \nVeterans, if you add discretionary and mandatory, we have a 14.3-\npercent increase, if you add the two. Combined, discretionary and \nmandatory, $61.45 billion to $70.2 billion, there is a 14.3-percent \nincrease. Yet I have heard three or four speakers saying we are \nshortchanging veterans.\n  I heard one speaker a moment ago say, yes, there are going to be new \nfees. The budget we have before us did not assume there will be new \nfees. The President did recommend a proposal increasing the \nprescription drug copay on priority levels 7 and 8, from $7 to $15. \nThose are mostly nonservice-connected disabled and high-income \nveterans. I think a very good argument can be made they should have a \nhigher copay. That is not assumed in our budget.\n  We also did not include the proposal to establish a $250 deductible, \nagain on levels 7 and 8 nonservice-connected disabled and high-income \nveterans.\n  Those two proposals were not included; yet I have heard two or three \nspeakers already allude to them, so I thought we should point that out.\n  We have significant increases for both education and for veterans. I \nurge our colleagues to become aware of that before they say they are \ngoing to offer amendments to increase funding because we are \nshortchanging education or shortchanging veterans. I think we are fair. \nGiven the amount of deficit we have, I think we have very generous \nincreases in both functions, and I urge our colleagues to look at that \nbefore they say, no matter what that figure is, they are going to be \nvoting for more money. I think that would be a mistake.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/08/senate-section/article/S2294-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2294-S2295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BRAD SEELY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, I rise today to comment on a prestigious \nconservation award that will be bestowed upon Larry Johnson of Reno, NV \nlater this week.\n  Larry is an environmentalist in the most positive sense of the word. \nHe is a sportsman in the most positive sense of the word. He tirelessly \ninvests his time, energy, money and passion in the protecting, \nrestoring and enhancing Nevada's environment. He knows that the \nenvironment is synonymous with wildlife habitat, and that natural \necosystems support the fish and game he values so dearly.\n  As a trustee of the Eastern Nevada Landscape Coalition, Larry has \nworked to restore the native habitats of the Great Basin. This \ninvolvement also reflects his understanding that Nevadans can work \ntogether, through collaboration and innovative partnerships, to make \nour public lands better for wildlife, better for fish, and better for \npeople.\n  Larry Johnson is a conservationist. He works hard to ensure that we \nactively manage Nevada's landscape. He holds public land managers and \nState wildlife officials accountable, but he also views them as allies. \nFor example, he builds ``guzzlers'' where big game can find water in \nthe desert, and he serves on resource advisory counsels for the Bureau \nof Land Management.\n  Indeed, Larry is famous throughout Nevada for his tireless work on \nbehalf of our desert bighorn sheep. He is a trustee and longtime member \nof the board of directors of Nevada Bighorns Unlimited. He raises \nmoney, he donates money, and he donates his valuable time and expertise \nto the noble goal of enhancing bighorn sheep habitat, and preserving \nthe wonderful heritage of the American West.\n\n  Larry is a man of principle, a man of ideas, a man of action, and a \nman exceptionally worthy of the Wayne E. Kirch Nevada Wildlife \nConservation Award.\n  He is a great citizen, a great Nevadan, and a great American.\n  Chief Seattle once said: ``we do not inherit the Earth from our \nparents, we borrow it from our children.'' Larry Johnson fulfills our \nresponsibility to be good stewards of the planet we will pass along to \nfuture generations.\n  Because of his dedication to conservation, our children will enjoy a \nricher legacy of wildlife and recreational opportunities.\n  Today I congratulate Larry Johnson for this much-deserved recognition \nof his work to preserve Nevada's natural heritage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/08/senate-section/article/S2295-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     UNITED STATES-JAPAN TAX TREATY\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of \nratification of the United States-Japan Tax Treaty. As chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, I held a hearing on this treaty on \nFebruary 25, where the committee heard testimony on the treaty's \nbenefits from the Treasury Department, the National Foreign Trade \nCouncil, and the United States-Japan Business Council. Our committee \nvoted to approve the treaty, along with several other items, by a vote \nof 19 to 0 at a business meeting last week.\n  The Japan Tax Treaty is particularly significant due to our expansive \ntrade and investment relationship with Japan. The United States and \nJapan are the two largest economies in the world, and account for \napproximately 40 percent of the world's gross domestic product. Japan \nis the fourth largest source of imports to the United States and the \nthird largest export market for United States goods. The treaty, signed \non November 6, 2003, by Treasury Secretary Snow and Japanese Ambassador \nKato, will improve the ability of United States businesses to expand \nand prosper in Japan. It also will continue to encourage Japanese \ninvestment in the United States that contributes to the growth of our \neconomy.\n  The original Japan Tax Treaty was signed in March 1971 and went into \nforce in January 1973. Since then, both United States and Japanese \ndomestic tax laws have changed dramatically. Until now, the 1971 treaty \nhas not been amended to reflect those changes or the monumental \nexpansion of the United States-Japanese commercial relationship.\n  American companies doing business with Japan are eager for this \nupdate of the bilateral tax treaty. It will guarantee more equitable \ntreatment for United States corporate investors and relief from double \ntaxation; it will strengthen dispute resolution mechanisms related to \ntax issues between our countries; and it will eliminate withholding \ntaxes on all royalty income, certain interest income, and dividend \nincome paid to parent companies.\n  The overall benefit of the treaty is that our companies will become \nmore competitive in the Japanese market. Japan is currently a party to \ntax agreements with several other nations that reduce double taxation \nfor companies from those nations doing business in Japan. Consequently, \nwithout this treaty, United States businesses will continue to face a \ncompetitive disadvantage in the area of taxation.\n  Following transmittal to the Senate this past December, the Foreign \nRelations Committee engaged in a thorough review and analysis of the \ntreaty. Officials from the Department of Treasury briefed the committee \nextensively on the impact of the treaty on business relations between \nthe United States and Japan. The committee also consulted with numerous \ncommercial entities with operations in Japan. These entities all have \nindicated that the treaty will make them even more competitive in a \nmarket where they already are successful. In addition, the committee \nhas had meetings with commercial officers from the Japanese Embassy to \ndiscuss ratification and implementation of the treaty.\n  I understand that the timing of enactment of the Japan Tax Treaty is \ncritical. Therefore, I have prioritized it on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee's agenda, and I am grateful to the majority leader for \nbringing it quickly to the Senate floor. I also have written to the \nJapanese Finance Minister and leaders of the Diet to encourage them to \njoin us in acting swiftly to bring the treaty into force.\n  I want to take this opportunity to thank the Treasury Department and \nits International Tax Counsel Barbara Angus both for their work in \nproducing this agreement and for their cooperation with the Foreign \nRelations Committee during the treaty's consideration. I would also \nlike to salute the business community, and in particular the National \nForeign Trade Council and the United States-Japan Business Council for \ntheir leadership and advocacy on behalf of this treaty.\n  Mr. President, this treaty is good for the United States and good for \nour relationship with Japan. I urge my colleagues to vote to ratify it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/08/senate-section/article/S2295-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2295-S2296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CIVIL COPYRIGHT ENFORCEMENT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, with the advent of the digital age, we had \ngreat hopes that the possibility of distributing music, films, books, \nand software on the Internet would bring us an unprecedented variety of \ncontent online with ever-increasing ease. Unfortunately, those hopes \nhave not yet been realized. The very ease of duplication and \ndistribution that is the hallmark of digital content has meant that \npiracy of that content is just as easy. The very real--and often \nrealized--threat that creative works will simply be duplicated and \ndistributed freely online has restricted, rather than enhanced, the \namount and variety of creative works one can receive over the Internet. \nPart of combating piracy includes offering a legal alternative to it. \nAnother important part is enforcing the rights of copyright owners. \nSenator\n\n[[Page S2296]]\n\nHatch and I have been working with artists, authors, and software \ndevelopers to create an environment in which copyright is protected, so \nthat we can all enjoy American creativity, and so that copyright owners \ncan be paid for their work.\n  In the coming months we will be discussing numerous responses to this \nproblem. One critically important part of the attack on this problem \nwill be to bring the resources and expertise of the United States \nAttorneys' Offices to bear on wholesale copyright infringers. For too \nlong these attorneys have been hindered in their pursuit of pirates, by \nthe fact that they were limited to bringing criminal charges with high \nburdens of proof. In the world of copyright, a criminal charge is \nunusually difficult to prove because the defendant must have known that \nhis conduct was illegal and he must have willfully engaged in the \nconduct anyway. For this reason prosecutors can rarely justify bringing \ncriminal charges, and copyright owners have been left alone to fend for \nthemselves, defending their rights only where they can afford to do so. \nIn a world in which a computer and an Internet connection are all the \ntools you need to engage in massive piracy, this was an intolerable \npredicament.\n  Some steps have already been taken. The Allen-Leahy amendment to the \nForeign Operations Appropriations bill, on Combating Piracy of U.S. \nIntellectual Property in Foreign Countries, provided $2.5 million for \nthe Department of State to assist foreign countries in combating piracy \nof U.S. copyrighted works. By providing equipment and training to law \nenforcement officers, it will help those countries that are not members \nof OECD, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, to \nenforce intellectual property protections.\n  Senator Hatch and I are investigating another needed response to this \nproblem that would give the Attorney General the authority to bring a \ncivil action against copyright infringers. This authority would not \nsupplant either the criminal provisions of the Copyright Act, or the \nremedies available to the copyright owner in a private suit. Rather, it \nwould allow the Government to bring its resources to bear on this \nimmense problem, and to ensure that more creative works are made \navailable online, that those works are more affordable, and that the \npeople who work to bring them to us are paid for their efforts.\n  We hope to introduce a bill on this matter soon, and we look forward \nto continuing our efforts to bring our country's law enforcement tools \ninto the 21st century, just as our technologies have advanced.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/08/senate-section/article/S2296-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2296-S2297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today, on International Women's \nDay, to recognize the contributions that women have made to our world. \nToday, we commemorate the lives of women, the work that women have \ndone, the sacrifices that women have made, and the progress that women \nhave achieved.\n  The past year was a very important one for advancing the rights of \nwomen. In Iraq, American women in the armed services played an integral \npart to the war effort and Iraqi women have now been given a much \ngreater role in governing their country.\n  In Afghanistan, women have rights and liberties not experienced for \nyears. Women and girls are returning to schools and colleges and \nrejoining the workforce.\n  Unfortunately, for many women around the world, the past year has not \nimproved their ability to control their own lives. In many countries \naround the world, women earn less than men for performing the same \ntasks. In some countries, women are prohibited from owning property or \nfrom receiving the same education as men. And many women do not have \nthe same access to health care that men have.\n  On this day, we must reaffirm our dedication to women's rights; we \nmust strive to ensure that all women and girls have every opportunity \nto improve their lives and to make their own choices.\n  On this day, I would like to recognize the accomplishments of one \nwoman in particular.\n  In December of 2003, Shirin Ebadi, an Iranian defense lawyer, became \nthe first Muslim woman to receive a Nobel Peace Prize. She received \nthis honor for her dedication to democracy and human rights.\n  In 1975, Mrs. Ebadi was the first woman appointed to be a judge in \nIran. After the Iranian revolution, she was forced to resign her post \non the court. Since that time, she has fought for an interpretation of \nIslamic law that reflects the importance of human rights and democracy, \nnot just for men, but for all Iranians. I wish to recognize Mrs. \nEbadi's work on behalf of human rights and I wish to congratulate her \non winning the Nobel Peace Prize. She is truly a great woman and a \ngreat human being.\n  I would also like to take some time today to focus on a number of \nareas where women have made recent progress and some areas that still \nrequire significant change.\n  The liberation of Iraq has been a great step forward for Iraqi women. \nToday, the Iraqi Governing Council has agreed on an interim \nconstitution. The constitution, also known as the Transitional \nAdministrative Law, has a number of provisions that protect women's \nrights. For example, the Transitional Administrative Law requires that \nno less than 25 percent of the members elected to the Transitional \nNational Assembly be women. The new consititution also states that \nIraqis are equal without regard to sex, sect or religion.\n  To ensure that the rights of women in Iraq are not violated, the \nCoalition Provisional Authority and USAID worked together to establish \na women's rights center. This is the first of five centers that will be \nestablished throughout Iraq. The center is open to all women and offers \na range of opportunities including literacy classes and English-\nlanguage training, nutrition and health classes, computer skills \ntraining, and courses on living in a democracy. The center will also \nprovide assistance for widowed or impoverished women.\n  While there has been progress, we must remain vigilant in our defense \nof women's rights in Iraq.\n  Since President Bush declared major combat operations over, extremist \nMuslims have tried to suppress women's rights. In December, a group of \nShiite members of the Iraqi Governing Council passed Resolution 137, a \nresolution that would have required the use of Sharia, or Islamic law \nthat limits the rights and opportunities of women. Fortunately, the \nIraqi Governing Council cancelled Resolution 137 on February 27, 2004.\n  With the fall of the Taliban, many people felt that the situation for \nwomen in Afghanistan would improve. While Afghanistan's new \nconstitution contains human rights provisions and mandates better \npolitical representation of women, new rules on female education in the \nAfghan province of Herat prevent men from teaching women or girls. The \nrules also uphold strict gender segregation in all schools.\n  Repression of women is still commonplace in Afghanistan. Let me quote \nfrom a recent report issued by Human Rights Watch. The report says:\n\n     . . . one year after the Taliban's fall, women and girls in \n     Afghanistan still face severe restrictions and violations of \n     their human rights, for in many areas Taliban officials have \n     been replaced by warlords, police officers, and local \n     officials with similar attitudes toward women. In some parts \n     of the country, the same officials who administered the anti-\n     women policies of the Taliban remain in their positions. This \n     has meant the reimposition of extremely repressive social \n     codes that typically have a devastating impact on women.'\n\n  So much more needs to be done on behalf of women in Afghanistan.\n  Another year has gone by and the United States still has not yet \nratified the Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination \nAgainst Women. As Americans, we can no longer afford to ignore this \nimportant document and put in jeopardy our status as a leader in \nadvancing human rights for women and girls.\n  Given that it has been over 20 years since President Carter signed \nthe Convention, one might think that the delay in ratification is due \nto the fact we are dealing with a treaty that requires years of study \nand consideration.\n  Yet the Convention simply requires that participating states take all \nappropriate steps to eliminate discrimination against women in \npolitical and\n\n[[Page S2297]]\n\npublic life, law, education, employment, health care, commercial \ntransactions, and domestic relations.\n  The United States is one of the only leading democracies in the world \nthat has yet to ratify this important treaty. In fact, our partners \noutside the Convention include Iran, North Korea, and Sudan. Are these \ncountries with whom we share the values of democracy, freedom, and \nrespect for human rights? Are those the countries we can count on in \nthe international arena?\n  Women and girls around the world who turn to the United States for \nleadership in advancing their rights are mystified that we do not take \nthe simple step of ratifying the Convention. When we do, the sky will \nnot fall, the sun will rise in the morning, and the Constitution will \nstill be the law of the land.\n  By ratifying the Convention, the United States will reclaim its \nleadership status as a champion of the rights of women and girls and \nsend a strong signal to those states who abuse those rights.\n  On International Women's Day, I call on my colleagues in the Senate \nto move forward and ratify the Convention.\n  While women have made great strides internationally in recent years, \nabuse of women remains a global problem. Worldwide, it is estimated \nthat 1 in 3 women is abused or sexually assaulted in her lifetime. And \nanywhere from 20 to 50 percent of women worldwide have experienced some \ntype of domestic violence. These numbers are astounding.\n  Even in the United States, certainly a leader in promoting women's \nrights, a woman is battered every 15 seconds and battering is the \nleading cause of injury to women between ages 15 and 44. On average, 3 \nwomen are murdered by their husbands every day in the United States. \nAnd as many as 750,000 women and children have been trafficked into the \nUnited States over the last decade. Certainly, we must do more at home \nto protect women from domestic and sexual abuse.\n  On International Women's Day, the United States must also reaffirm \nits commitment to combating HIV/AIDS, an epidemic that has had \ndevastating effects on women and girls.\n  Transmission of HIV from men to women is twice as likely as \ntransmission from women to men and the International Center for \nResearch on Women has shown that there is a high correlation between \nviolence against women and HIV infection.\n  The impact that this disease has had on the lives of women is \nshocking. In 2002, 2 million women were infected with HIV and 1.2 \nmillion women died from AIDS-related illnesses.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the \ncontributions and accomplishments of a dedicated journalist serving \nreaders in my State of South Dakota. For years, Dottie Potter has \nserved as a reporter covering important news impacting South Dakota's \nNative American population. As a writer for the Indian Country Today \nand the Lakota Nation Journal, Dottie is truly a credit to her \nprofession.\n  She has worked hard over the years to educate the general population \nof the talents, accomplishments and skills of Native Americans in South \nDakota. Dottie has helped educate and inform thousands of readers. I \nhave always respected her professionalism and skill as a journalist, \nand her sensitivity to the issues affecting her readers.\n  Her tireless efforts to dig for details and to explore all sides of \nparticular issues symbolizes her dedication to the field of journalism. \nShe is a well-respected reporter in South Dakota. But she is also well-\nknown for her empathy and care when writing human interest stories. \nDottie has delivered stories to her readers on almost every topic, from \nthose that involved the road to success for a favorite son or daughter \nto words of wisdom from a tribal elder to the plight of South Dakota \nIndian families.\n  Among the many awards she has received over the years, she received \nthe South Dakota Education Association Golden Apple Award in October of \n2002, in recognition of outstanding media coverage of public education \nissues and events in South Dakota.\n  Dottie now works on a personal story, a fight to overcome cancer. A \nreporter to the core, Dottie continues to make an impact on her \ncommunity. With remarkable spirit and bravery, she still works as a \nreporter with Lakota Nation Journal as she educates, entertains and \ninforms readers. Her fight against cancer serves as an inspiration to \nothers.\n  I congratulate and commend Dottie Potter on her many years as a \njournalist. Her body of work serves as a long-standing tribute to her \ncommitment to the Native American populations of South Dakota and the \nNation. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/08/senate-section/article/S2297-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need \nfor hate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On May 6, 1999, in Santa Clarita, CA, two men were charged with \nsuspicion of committing a hate crime after they allegedly burglarized a \nresidence and beat three gay men.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/08/senate-section/article/S2297-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2297-S2298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARY F. DIAZ\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last month, this Nation suffered \nthe tragic loss of one of its most effective and most compassionate \nadvocates for women and children throughout the world.\n  Mary Diaz was only 43 when she died on February 12 in New York after \na long battle of cancer. I know she will be profoundly missed by all \nwho knew her and worked with her and were helped by her.\n  For the last 10 years, Mary was executive director of the Women's \nCommission for Refugee Women and Children, an affiliate of the \nInternational Rescue Committee. She was there whenever she was needed \nand wherever she was needed--in Serbia or Angola or Rwanda or Pakistan \nor Nepal or Haiti and in many other places, often putting her own \nsafety at risk to see firsthand the hardships of women and children \ndisplaced by war or fleeing persecution.\n  After each of her travels, Mary would return and eloquently share the \nstories of those she saw who needed help the most. She met with \nlawmakers and government agencies to urge them to respond. She worked \nwith President Clinton to create a fund for refugee women in Bosnia. \nVisiting Tanzania, she worked to change the rules allowing Burundian \nwomen to distribute food with the men. Even in the all too short time \nshe had, Mary inspired us all with her dedicated and tireless work on \nbehalf of the disenfranchised.\n  It is easy to see where Mary learned her passion for helping others. \nHer father was a doctor and her mother is a nurse. Her two brothers are \ndoctors. One sister is an inner-city teacher and another is a \nlibrarian. After studying international relations at Brown University, \nMary worked for a television station in Philadelphia and volunteered in \nher free time to help refugees settle in the city. As her interest in\n\n[[Page S2298]]\n\nhelping refugees grew, she enrolled at Harvard to pursue a master's \ndegree in international education. A few years later, she became \ndirector of refugee and immigration services for Catholic Charities in \nBoston.\n  She was always there to help. Once, when 112 Haitian children arrived \nin Boston on a military plane, Mary was there to greet them with a \nfriendly face. The children had lost contact with their families. They \nwere barefoot, in a country they had never seen before. Mary comforted \nthem, and took them to eat at a local restaurant called Buzzy's \nFabulous Roast Beef. After that, she took them to a local swimming \npool, and then she began the effort to reunite them with their families \nor place them in foster care. Stories like this about Mary are well \nknown to all her colleagues.\n  Last year, Mary was honored for her work in protecting the rights of \nrefugee women by Rudd Lubbers, the United Nations High Commissioner on \nRefugees. When Commissioner Lubbers learned of Mary's death, he spoke \nfor us all when he said that it ``left a void in the refugee and \nhumanitarian world, where she touched many lives.''\n  Sadly, Mary died too young. But she made the world a better place, \nand we will always have our warm memories of her and her inspiring \nlegacy to guide us as we carry on her mission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/08/senate-section/article/S2298-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING RICHARD PARSONS\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on February 16, 2004, a good \nfriend of mine and a distinguished farm leader from my State was a \nvictim of heart failure. At the age of 56, Richard Lynn ``Rick'' \nParsons died at his home in Vance, MS, where he managed a family \nfarming operation and served in numerous capacities of leadership for \nhis community and the State.\n  Rick was a native of Water Valley, MS. He was an elder at the Sumner \nPresbyterian Church and a member of the local Rotary Club. In 2001, he \nwas appointed by President George W. Bush and served with distinction \nas a member of the State Farm Service Agency Committee, which oversees \nthe implementation of Federal farm programs in Mississippi. Rick was \nalso a leader in Delta Council and the National Cotton Council, in \naddition to being on the Board of Directors of Delta Wildlife and Delta \nF.A.R.M., which are local organizations that promote wildlife \nconservation on the farm.\n  Additionally, Rick Parsons was selected to represent Mississippi as a \nfinalist in the Southeastern Farmer of Year competition, and he was \nelected by his peers to serve on the board of directors for the \nsuccessful Mississippi Boll Weevil Management Program and the Cotton \nLeadership Program for the National Cotton Council.\n  Rick was an unselfish and dedicated leader on behalf of agriculture \nin Mississippi. My office always relied on his sound judgment and good \ncounsel in matters which affected farmers. We extend to his wife \nCarlisle, his son Scott, and the entire Parsons family our sincerest \ncondolences.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/08/senate-section/article/S2298-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           HONORING THE AMADOR VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL CIVICS TEAM\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on May 1-3, 2004, more than a \n1,000 students from across the United States will converge on \nWashington, DC to compete in the national finals of the We the People: \nThe Citizen and the Constitution program. Administered by the Center \nfor Civic Education, the We the People program has a primary goal of \npromoting civic competence and responsibility among our Nation's \nelementary and secondary school students. It is the most extensive \neducational program in the country designed to educate young students \nabout the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and since its inception \nin 1987, more than 26 million students and 86,000 educators have \nparticipated.\n  I am very proud to announce that Amador Valley High School in \nPleasanton will represent the State of California in this year's We the \nPeople national final. Four years ago I had the honor of recognizing \nAmador Valley for winning California's contest, and am proud to be able \nto do so again today. On February 6, this year's class from Amador \nValley placed first in California's statewide contest. The school has a \nrich tradition of excelling in this program, having won California's \ncompetition five times from 1992-2000, and even winning the national \nchampionship in 1995.\n  During the national final, the class from Amador Valley will again \nhave to testify as experts before a panel of judges on a wide variety \nof historical and contemporary constitutional issues. They will also be \nquizzed by the judges in an effort to illustrate depth of \nconstitutional understanding, and ability to apply that knowledge. The \ncompetition is designed to resemble what hearings would be like in the \nU.S. Congress.\n  I congratulate the civics class at Amador Valley High School for \nwinning this year's California We the People competition, and wish them \nbest of luck as they conduct research and prepare for the national \nfinals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/08/senate-section/article/S2298-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DANIEL L. MIHALKO\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, public service is a long and honored \ntradition in the United States. Through the dedicated commitment and \ntireless service of our Nation's Federal workforce, our country is \nsafer and more secure than ever. I wish to take this opportunity to \nhonor one such person, Daniel L. Mihalko, who since January 28, 1978, \nhas served as a postal inspector in the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. \nAfter serving as a postal inspector for the past 26 years of his 31-\nyear career with the Postal Service, Inspector Mihalko retired on March \n2, 2004.\n  Inspector Mihalko was known to many in congress as their contact with \nthe Postal Inspection Service in his capacity as the inspector in \ncharge of congressional and public affairs. He was also known to the \nAmerican public as the face of the Inspection Service when discussing \nissues such as the anthrax attacks through the U.S. mail in 2001 or \npipe bombs in midwestern mailboxes. He professionally represented the \nInspection Service in television appearances ranging from shows such as \n``60 Minutes'' and ``Larry King Live'' to all the major television \nnetworks.\n  In addition to Inspector Mihalko's service as spokesman for the \nPostal Inspection Service, he was the guiding force behind several \nhigh-profile publicity campaigns: Project kNOw Fraud, National Fraud \nAgainst Seniors, and Awareness and Operation: Identity Crisis--\nimportant educational programs directed at increasing consumer \nawareness of mail fraud and deceptive mailing practices. His official \nappearances added to public confidence in the mail, and it is fitting \nthat upon Inspector Mihalko's retirement from the Postal Inspection \nService, we take a moment to recognize the Federal agency he promoted \nso well.\n  The United States Postal Inspection Service protects the integrity of \nour Nation's postal system and is one of the country's oldest law \nenforcement agencies. Founded in 1772 by the first Postmaster General, \nBenjamin Franklin, the Postal Inspection Service is the primary law \nenforcement arm of the U.S. Postal Service. Initially the Inspection \nService helped regulate and audit postal functions, but in 1830, these \nfunctions were expanded and its auditors became special agents. By the \nlate 1800s, special agents were renamed postal inspectors, and, in \n1916, solved the last known stage-coach robbery in the United States. \nThe modern Postal Inspection Service enforces more than 200 Federal \nlaws relating to the U.S. mail, including identify fraud, mail bombs, \nchild pornography, controlled substances, counterfeit stamps, money \nlaundering, robbery, and mail theft. Because of overlapping \njurisdictions, postal inspectors work closely with U.S. Attorneys, \nother law enforcement agencies, and local prosecutors to investigate \npostal cases and prepare them for court. Inspectors are aided in their \nwork through five regional forensic crime labs strategically located \nthroughout the United States which support field office operations.\n  As the former chairman of the Senate Postal Subcommittee, I have had \nthe privilege of supporting this distinguished Department and have had \nto postal inspectors/attorneys as detailees on my staff. Inspector \nMihalko is a fine example of the men and women who make up the Postal \nInspection Service, and I wish Mr. Mihalko and his family well.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/08/senate-section/article/S2299-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2299]]\n             THE DAUGHTERS OF SUNSET OF SOUTHEAST MISSOURI\n\n Mr. BOND.

The \nmembership is a unique group of women dedicated to maintaining a clean \nand safe community for all. The organization has been successful in its \nschool and summer lunch programs for needy children, community cleanup \nand revitalization efforts, fire and natural disaster assistance, and \ntransportation programs to aid the sick and elderly. The Daughters of \nSunset have also been responsible for assisting the homeless and \ndestitute as well as convey sympathy to bereaved families.\n  The Daughters of Sunset also have provided 41 academic scholarships, \nand have publically recognized the efforts of outstanding community \nleaders in and around Southeastern Missouri.

Mr. President, I am pleased to have the \nopportunity to commend Mr. Jim Wanamaker of Greenville, MS, for his \ndistinguished public service as the chief engineer for the Board of \nMississippi Levee Commissioners. Jim graduated from Mississippi State \nUniversity in 1963 and moved to the Mississippi Delta after serving in \nthe Navy for 2 years. For the past 40 years, he has been a key advocate \nand one of the most knowledgeable experts in flood control in the Yazoo \nbasin.\n  Flood control in the Mississippi Delta is fundamental to the quality \nof life and economic viability of the region. The Mississippi Levee \nBoard has been the local sponsor and a leader in bringing improved \nflood protection to the citizens, property owners, and communities \nthroughout the region. The Mississippi River Levee Enlargement Project, \nthe Upper Steele Bayou Project, the Big Sunflower River Maintenance \nProject, and the Yazoo Backwater Project have all benefited from the \nprofessional and wise counsel of Jim Wanamaker in his capacity as chief \nengineer of the Mississippi Levee Board.\n  Jim has set an excellent example for future generations who aspire to \nexcel in public service. I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating Jim Wanamaker upon his retirement, which is scheduled \nlater this year, and to thank him for the valuable contributions which \nhe has made toward the quality of life of the citizens in this very \nimportant part of our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/08/senate-section/article/S2299-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE INTENT TO ENTER INTO A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT (FTA) WITH \n                    THE GOVERNMENT OF MOROCCO--PM 71\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with section 2105(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 2002 \n(Public Law 107-210; the ``Trade Act''), I am pleased to notify the \nCongress of my intent to enter into a free trade agreement (FTA) with \nthe Kingdom of Morocco.\n  This agreement will create new opportunities for America's workers, \nfarmers, businesses, and consumers by eliminating barriers in trade \nwith Morocco.

A bill to make technical amendments to the provisions of the \nIndian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act relating to \ncontract support costs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nTribal Contract Support Cost Technical Amendments of 2004, a much-\nneeded bill that strengthens the highly successful policy of tribal \ncontracting and compacting under the Indian Self Determination and \nEducation Assistance Act of 1975, Public Law 93-638.\n  Beginning in 1970, with President Nixon's now-famous Special Message \nto Congress on Indian Affairs and the 1975 enactment of the Indian Self \nDetermination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, Public Law 93-638, \nCongress has systematically devolved to Indian tribes the authority and \nresponsibility to manage Federal programs and reassume control over \ntheir own affairs.\n  For good reason, tribal contracting and compacting has been embraced \nand expanded by Congress and the Executive by repeatedly amending the \n1975 Act in 1984, 1988, 1994 and 2000.\n  Contracting and compacting has resulted in a reduction in the Federal \nbureaucracy and an improvement in the quality of services delivered to \ntribal members. Instead of Federal micro-management, the tribes can \ntailor programs to unique local conditions and better serve their \nmembers.\n  Unfortunately, the ability of Indian tribes to continue to contract \nprograms and services is severely hampered by the chronic under-funding \nof contract support costs.\n  Without such funding, tribes are forced to cut back on services to \npay for their administrative costs.\n  The bill I am introducing today will require the Indian Health \nService and the Bureau of Indian Affairs to provide the funds for \ncontract support costs which those agencies negotiated and contracted \nto pay to their tribal contractors.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2172\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to further the purposes of the Sand Creek Massacre \nNational Historic Site Establishment Act of 2000; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I take great pride in introducing \nthe Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site Trust Act of 2004, a \nbill to establish the Sand Creek National Historic Site in Kiowa \nCounty, CO.\n  The bill I am introducing today follows the Sand Creek National \nHistoric Site Establishment Act of 2000, Public Law 106-465, which \nrecognized the tragic events of November 28, 1868 and made it clear \nthat America has the strength and resolve to face its past and learn \nthe painful lessons that come with intolerance.\n  Much has been written about the horrors visited upon the plains \nIndians in the territories of the Western United States in the latter \nhalf of the 19th century. However, what has been lost for more than a \ncentury is a comprehensive understanding of the events of that day in a \ngrove of cottonwood trees along Sand Creek.\n  This bill I am introducing today builds upon the Act of 2000 and \nauthorizes the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes of Oklahoma to take the land \non which these tragic events took place into trust for traditional, \ncultural, and historical purposes only.\n  The indisputable facts are these: 700 members of the Colorado \nMilitia, commanded by Colonel John Chivington struck at dawn that \nNovember day, attacking an encampment of Cheyenne and Arapho Indians \nsettled under the U.S. flag and a white flag which the Indian Chiefs \nBlack Kettle and White Antelope were told by the U.S. would protect \nthem from military attack.\n  By day's end, almost 150 Indians, many of them women, children and \nthe elderly, lay dead. Chivington's men reportedly desecrated the \nbodies of the dead after the massacre, and newspaper reports from \nDenver at the time told of the troops displaying Indian body parts in a \ngruesome display as they rode through the streets of Colorado's largest \ncity following the attack.\n  The 2000 legislation authorized the National Park Service to enter \ninto negotiations with willing sellers only in an attempt to secure \nproperty inside a boundary which encompasses approximately 12,470 acres \nas identified by the National Park Service for a lasting memorial to \nevents of that fateful day.\n  The Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site has come into being \nbecause all of those involved have exhibited an extraordinary ability \nto put aside their differences, look with equal measure at the \nscientific evidence and the oral traditions of the Tribes, and come up \nwith a plan that equally honors the memory of those killed and the \nrights of the private property owners who have been faithful and \nresponsible stewards of this site.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2173\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Sand Creek Massacre National \n     Historic Site Trust Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \ninclude podiatrists as physicians for purposes of covering physicians \nservices under the medicaid program; to the Committee on Finance.\n   Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a very \nimportant piece of legislation with Senator Mikulski from Maryland. Our \nbill will ensure that Medicaid beneficiaries in all States have access \nto the services of top-quality podiatric physicians.\n   Podiatrists play a vital roll in keeping feet and ankles healthy. \nThis is critical to keeping people mobile and productive, which is a \nkey to good long-term health.\n   Proper foot care is particularly important for individuals with \ndiabetes, which is a severe problem in my State. According to the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 18.2 million people--\nor 6.3 percent of the population--have diabetes in this country, and it \nis the sixth leading cause of death. If not managed properly, diabetes \ncan cause several severe health problems, including blindness, kidney \ndisease and heart disease. Too often, diabetes can lead to foot \ncomplications, including foot ulcers and even amputations.\n   In fact, the CDC estimate that ``more than 60 percent of \nnontraumatic lower-limb amputations occur among people with diabetes,'' \nwhich equals about 82,000 amputations a year.\n   These numbers are startling.\n   Podiatrists, however, can play a vital role in recognizing and \ncorrecting foot problems among diabetics to help avoid amputations and \nother complications.\n   Our bill is fairly simple. It amends the Medicaid's definition of \n``physicians'' to include podiatric physicians. This will ensure that \nMedicaid beneficiaries have access to foot care from those most \nqualified to provide it.\n   Under Medicaid, podiatry is considered an optional benefit. However, \njust because it is optional, doesn't mean that the need for these \nservices is\n\n[[Page S2305]]\n\neliminated or that the services aren't performed by other providers. \nInstead, Medicaid beneficiaries will have to receive foot care from \nother providers who may not be as well trained as a podiatrist in \ntreating lower extremities.\n   According to the American Podiatric Medical Association, 43 States \ncurrently recognize and reimburse podiatrists under their Medicaid \nproblems. Also, podiatrists are considered physicians under the \nMedicare program, which allows seniors and disabled individuals to \nreceive appropriate care.\n   I urge my colleagues to give careful consideration to this important \nbill and to support it. It will help many Medicaid beneficiaries across \nthe country have the guaranteed access to podiatrists that they need.\n   Finally, I want to thank the Senator from Maryland for helping me \nintroduce this legislation today. I hope that by working together we \ncan see this important change made.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Bunning to \nintroduce this important bill to make sure that Medicaid patients have \naccess to care provided by podiatrists.\n  This bill ensures that Medicaid patients across the country can get \nservices provided by podiatrists. This is a simple, common sense bill. \nThis legislation includes podiatric physicians in Medicaid's definition \nof physician. This means that the services of podiatrists will be \ncovered by Medicaid, just like they are in Medicare. Podiatrists are \nconsidered physicians under Medicare. They should be under Medicaid. \nMedicaid covers necessary foot and ankle care services. Medicaid should \nallow podiatrists who are trained specifically in foot and ankle care \nto provide these services and be reimbursed for them.\n  Currently, the services of podiatrists are considered optional under \nMedicaid. The Medicaid programs in 43 States, including Maryland, \nrecognize and reimburse podiatrists for providing foot and ankle care \nto their beneficiaries. During times of tight budgets, States may cut \nback on these optional services. Last year Connecticut, Michigan, Utah \nand Texas discontinued podiatric services. Even though podiatrist \nservices are considered optional, Medicaid patients need foot and ankle \ncare regardless. If podiatrists do not provide the care, patients will \nsee providers who may not be as well trained in the care of the lower \nextremities as podiatrists. I want the over 560,000 Medicaid patients \nin Maryland to have access to the services provided by over 400 \npodiatrists in Maryland.\n  Podiatrists receive special training on the foot, ankle and lower \nleg. They play an important role in the recognition of systemic \ndiseases like diabetes, and in the recognition and treatment of \nperipheral neuropathy, a frequent cause of diabetic foot wounds that \ncan often lead to preventable lower extremity amputations. Over 18 \nmillion people in this country have diabetes, but an estimated more \nthan 5 million of these people are not aware that they have the \ndisease.\n  Ensuring Medicaid patient access to podiatrists could save Medicaid \nfunds in the long term. According to the American Podiatric Medical \nAssociation, 75 percent of Americans will experience some type of foot \nhealth problem during their lives. Foot disease is the most common \ncomplication of diabetes leading to hospitalization. About 82,000 \npeople have diabetes-related leg, foot or toe amputations each year. \nFoot care programs with regular examinations and patient education \ncould prevent up to 85 percent of these amputations. Podiatrists are \nimportant providers of this care.\n  This bill will make sure that Medicaid patients across the country \nhave access to care provided by podiatrists. It has the support the \nAmerican Podiatric Medical Association. I urge my colleagues to \ncosponsor this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 2175. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to support the \nplanning, implementation, and evaluation of organized activities \ninvolving statewide youth suicide early intervention and prevention \nstrategies, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an important issue \nthat holds great meaning to me--the issue of youth suicide in our \ncountry.\n  Youth suicide is both a public and mental health tragedy--an acute \ncrisis that knows no geographic, racial, ethnic, cultural, or \nsocioeconomic boundaries. According to the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention (CDC), over 3,000 young people take their lives each \nyear, making suicide the third overall cause of death between the ages \nof 10 and 24. Young people under the age of 25 accounted for 15 percent \nof all suicides completed in 2000. In fact, more children and young \nadults died from their own hand than from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, \nbirth defects, stroke and chronic lung disease combined.\n  Equally alarming are the numbers of young people who consider taking \nor attempt to take their lives. Recent CDC figures estimate that almost \nthree million high school students, or twenty percent of young adults \nbetween the ages of 15 and 19, consider suicide every year. And over \ntwo million children and young adults actually attempt suicide. I find \nthese figures to be staggering and simply unacceptable.\n  And, sadly, we rarely find these facts disseminated widely amongst \npublic audiences. We rarely read them in newspapers or hear them on \ntelevision. We know that youth suicide is intricately linked to mental \nhealth issues like depression and substance abuse. Yet, we also know \nall too well that both youth suicide and children's mental health \ncontinue to carry an unfortunate stigma--a stigma that all too often \nkeeps these crucial issues unspoken and discourages children and young \nadults from seeking the help they so desperately need.\n  We have a societal obligation to break through the stigma attached to \nyouth suicide and children's mental health. We have an obligation to \nreach out to our young people--to help them understand that whatever \ndifficulties or illnesses they might be experiencing are only temporary \nand treatable in a comfortable setting. And, most importantly, we have \nan obligation to instill in our young people a sense of value, self-\nworth, and resilience. All too often, children and young adults \nconsidering suicide lose sight of themselves, their talents, and their \npotential in life. All too often they lose sight of the love their \nfamilies, friends, and communities have for them.\n  I am pleased that our Nation has already taken several positive steps \ntoward better understanding the tragedy of youth suicide and its \nemotional and behavioral risk factors. Several recent reports like the \nPresident's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, the National \nStrategy for Suicide Prevention, and the Surgeon General's Call to \nAction To Prevent Suicide have made youth suicide a top national public \nand mental health priority. Today, hundreds of community-based programs \nacross the country offer a variety of early intervention and prevention \nservices to thousands of children and young adults--services that \ninclude comprehensive screening, assessment, and individualized \ncounseling. Nearly thirty states, including my home State of \nConnecticut, have developed or already implemented statewide youth \nsuicide early intervention and prevention strategies that coordinate \nappropriate services in schools, juvenile justice systems, foster care \nsystems, mental health programs, substance abuse programs, and other \nyouth-oriented settings. Furthermore, the Federal Government has \nstepped up its role in both supporting these community-based activities \nand conducting relevant research and data collection. Several mental \nand public health agencies have shown a growing interest in youth \nsuicide, including the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration, the Health Resources Services Administration, the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institute \nof Mental Health.\n\n  However, despite these important gains, we still face significant \nchallenges. Today, a large number of states and localities are finding \nthemselves with unprecedented budget deficits--making the establishment \nof new services and the retention of existing services increasingly \nmore difficult. Statewide strategies are often underfunded or \nunderstaffed to be properly effective. And while a number of Federal \nagencies have supported youth suicide\n\n[[Page S2306]]\n\nactivities, there has been no comprehensive inter-agency strategy \nimplemented to share data, disseminate research, or evaluate the \nefficacy of youth suicide early intervention and prevention programs.\n  Today, I am introducing bipartisan legislation with my colleagues \nSenator DeWine and Senator Smith. The Youth Suicide Early Intervention \nand Prevention Act of 2004 will further support the good work being \ndone on the community level, the State level, and the Federal level \nwith regards to youth suicide. This legislation will support, through \nnew grant initiatives, the further development and expansion of \nstatewide youth suicide early intervention and prevention strategies \nand the community-based services they seek to coordinate. It will \nencourage greater Federal support in the planning, implementation, and \nevaluation of these strategies and services. And it will create a new \ninter-agency collaboration that will focus on research, policy \ndevelopment, and the dissemination of data specifically pertaining to \nyouth suicide.\n  Finding concrete, comprehensive and effective remedies to the \nepidemic of youth suicide cannot be done by lawmakers on Capitol Hill \nalone. Those remedies must also come from individuals--doctors, \npsychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, nurses, teachers, advocates, \nsurvivors, and affected families--who are dedicated to this issue or \nspend each day with children and young adults that suffer from \nillnesses related to suicide. I feel that we have made an important \nfirst step with this legislation today. However, I also know that our \nwork is not done. I hope that, as a society, we can continue working \ncollectively to both better understand the tragedy of youth suicide and \ndevelop innovative and effective public and mental health initiatives \nthat reach every child and young adult in this country--compassionate \ninitiatives that give them encouragement, hope, and above all, life.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2175\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Youth Suicide Early \n     Intervention and Prevention Expansion Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) More children and young adults die from suicide each \n     year than from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, \n     stroke, and chronic lung disease combined.\n       (2) Over 4,000 children and young adults tragically take \n     their lives every year, making suicide the third overall \n     cause of death between the ages of 10 and 24. According to \n     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suicide is the \n     third overall cause of death among college-age students.\n       (3) According to the National Center for Injury Prevention \n     and Control of the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, children and young adults accounted for 15 \n     percent of all suicides completed in 2000.\n       (4) From 1952 to 1995, the rate of suicide in children and \n     young adults has tripled.\n       (5) From 1980 to 1997, the rate of suicide among young \n     adults ages 15 to 19 increased 11 percent.\n       (6) From 1980 to 1997, the rate of suicide among children \n     ages 10 to 14 increased 109 percent.\n       (7) According to the National Center of Health Statistics, \n     suicide rates among Native Americans range from 1.5 to 3 \n     times the national average for other groups, with young \n     people ages 15 to 34 making up 64 percent of all suicides.\n       (8) Congress has recognized that youth suicide is a public \n     health tragedy linked to underlying mental health problems \n     and that youth suicide early intervention and prevention \n     activities are national priorities.\n       (9) Youth suicide early intervention and prevention have \n     been listed as urgent public health priorities by the \n     President's New Freedom Commission in Mental Health (2002), \n     the Institute of Medicine's Reducing Suicide: A National \n     Imperative (2002), the National Strategy for Suicide \n     Prevention: Goals and Objectives for Action (2001), and the \n     Surgeon General's Call to Action To Prevent Suicide (1999).\n       (10) Many States have already developed comprehensive youth \n     suicide early intervention and prevention strategies that \n     seek to provide effective early intervention and prevention \n     services.\n\n     SEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES ACT.\n\n       Part P of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 280g et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 399O.

Mr. President, today I join my good friends and \ncolleagues Senator Chris Dodd and Senator Gordon Smith in introducing \nthe Youth Suicide Early Intervention and Prevention Expansion Act of \n2004. As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Substance Abuse and Mental \nHealth Services, I recently held a hearing on youth suicide. At that \nhearing, it became painfully clear that we need thorough and actionable \nplans to deal with this tragic issue.\n  Statistics tell us that approximately every 2 hours a person under \nthe age of 25 commits suicide. We also know that from 1952 to 1995, the \nrate of suicide in children and young adults has tripled and that \nbetween 1980 and 1997, alone, the rate of suicide in 15 to 19 year olds \nincreased by 11 percent. According to the National Institute of Mental \nHealth, suicide was the 11th leading cause overall for death in the \nUnited States in 2001. However, it was the 3rd leading cause of death \nfor youth ages 15 to 24. We also know that more boys are killing \nthemselves than girls at a ratio of 5 to 1 in the 15 to 19 year old age \ngroup and at a ratio of 7 to 1 in the 20 to 24 year old age group. \nHowever, while boys are dying at a higher rate, girls in these age \ngroups are attempting at a much higher rate. Estimates suggest that \nthere may be from 8 to 25 attempts made for every suicide death.\n  These alarming numbers emphasize the need for early intervention and \nprevention efforts. Too often, the signs may be subtle or hidden until \nit is too late. While research has created improved medications and \nmethods for helping those with mental health problems to recover, there \nis still much work to be done in the identifying those who need help.\n  A great deal of study has focused on identifying and categorizing the \nrisk factors related to suicide. In children and youth, these risk \nfactors include depression, alcohol or drug use, physical or sexual \nabuse, and disruptive behavior. Of people who die from and who attempt \nsuicide, many suffer from co-occurring mental health and substance \nabuse disorders. Children with these risk factors, as well as children \nwho are know to be in situations at risk for acquiring them, should be \nincluded in comprehensive state plans. Children and youth specifically \naddressed in State plans should include those who attend school, \nincluding colleges and universities, those already receiving substance \nabuse or mental health services, those involved in the juvenile justice \nsystem, and foster children.\n  As a result of the need for increased attention to the problem of \nsuicide and access to help, I am pleased to join Senators Dodd and \nSmith in introducing the Youth Suicide Early Intervention and \nPrevention Expansion Act of 2004. With the establishment of a $25 \nmillion grant initiative, this bill would encourage the development of \nstatewide youth suicide early intervention and prevention strategies \nthat coordinate agencies and non-profits in providing mental health \nservices to and screening of youth in a variety of settings. The \nsettings would include schools, substance abuse and mental health \nservice programs, the juvenile justice system, and foster care \nprograms. The bill would also provide $5\n\n[[Page S2308]]\n\nmillion for relevant technical assistance and research.\n  Candidly, State plans for suicide intervention and prevention need to \nbe created and expanded to help stop these heartbreaking losses. We \ncommend the States that already have created such plans and encourage \nall states to take this important step. I thank Senators Dodd and Smith \nfor their leadership on this issue, as well as others like Senator Jack \nReed, who is dedicated to helping increase and improve much-needed \nmental health services for our Nation's youth.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Alexander):\n  S. 2176. A bill to require the Secretary of Energy to carry out a \nprogram of research and development to advance high-end computing; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, along with \nSenator Alexander, the High-End Computing Revitalization Act of 2004. \nHigh-end computing, also known as high performance computing or \nsupercomputing, is a critical component to the scientific advances, \ndefense capabilities, and commercial competitiveness of the United \nStates in the 21st century. Several recent developments in high-end \ncomputing have stimulated a re-examination of current U.S. policies and \napproaches. These developments include: 1. the deployment of Japan's \nEarth System Simulator, which now occupies the number one position on \nthe Top 500 list of the world's fastest computers; 2. concerns about \nthe difficulty in achieving substantial fractions of peak hardware \ncomputational performance on high-end systems; and 3. the ongoing \ncomplexity of developing, debugging, and optimizing applications for \nhigh-end systems. In addition, there is growing recognition that a new \nset of scientific and engineering discoveries could be catalyzed by \naccess to very-large-scale computer systems--those in the 100-teraflop \nto petaflop range. Lastly, the National Academies of Sciences and \nEngineering, the Office of Science and Technology Policy's High End \nComputing Revitalization Task Force, and the national security \ncommunity have each released interim or final comprehensive reports \nexpressing serious concern over the current U.S. position in high-end \ncomputing research. Without government support, market forces are \nunlikely to drive sufficient innovation in high-end computing, because \nthe private sector would not capture the full value of its innovations \non a short enough time scale.\n  In supercomputing, innovation is important in architecture, in \nsoftware, and in application strategies and solution methods. The \ncoupling of these aspects is equally important. Major architecture \nchallenges stem from the uneven performance scaling of different \ncomponents. In particular, as the gap between processor speeds, memory \nbandwidth, and memory and network latency increases, new ideas are \nneeded to increase bandwith and mitigate latency. Additionally, as new \nmechanisms are introduced to address those issues, there is a need for \nways to supply a stable software interface that facilitates exploiting \nhardware performance improvements while the changes in mechanism. A new \nlarge-scale computer system exceeding the capability of Japan's Earth \nSimulator would provide an excellent test-bed for promising new \nadvancements in these areas as well as provide science, industry, and \ndefense with an extraordinarily powerful new tool for advancing the \ninterests of the United States.\n  The need for software innovation is motivated by its role as an \nintermediary between the application, the problem being addressed, and \nthe architectural platform. Innovation is needed in the ways that \nsystem software manages the use of hardware resources, such as network \ncommunication. New approaches are needed for ways in which the \napplications programmer can express parallelism at a level high enough \nto reflect the application solution and without platform-specific \ndetails. Novel tools are needed to help application-level software \ndesigners development their solutions at a more abstract and problem-\nspecific level. Software technology is also needed to lessen future \ndependence on legacy codes. Enough must be invested in the creation of \nadvanced tool and environment support for new language approaches so \nthat users can more readily adopt new software technology.\n  Importantly, advances in algorithms can sometimes improve performance \nmuch more than architectural and other software advances do. A center \nfor high-end computing software would aid immensely in spurring \ninnovation in this underdeveloped research area, an aid in coordinating \nthe federal government's efforts with industry, academia, and between \nits national laboratories.\n  The department of Energy (DOE) and its Office of Science research \nprograms are uniquely qualified to lead research in these fields. They \nhave played an important role in the development of high-end computing, \nnetworking, and information technology. These capabilities have been \nreadily accessible to the U.S. scientific community for a diverse set \nof grand challenge scientific computational problems. Contributions by \nthe DOE include pioneering the concept of remote, interactive access to \nsupercomputers (developing the first interactive operating system for \nsupercomputers, establishing the first national supercomputer center); \ndeveloping the mathematical foundations for high performance computing \nwith numerical linear algebra libraries used worldwide; leading the \ntransition to massively parallel supercomputing by developing software \nto allow processors to communicate with each other; and contributing to \nthe development of the Internet with software that dramatically speeds \nup the transmission of messages.\n  Many challenges are associated with modeling complex physical, \nchemical, and biological phenomena, especially on massively parallel \ncomputers with peak speeds in hundreds of teraflops. These challenges \ninclude the management and analysis of petabyte-scale data sets. A \nprogram to address these challenges will require multi-disciplinary \ncollaborations between theoretical and computational scientists, \ncomputer scientists, and applied mathematicians at universities, \nnational laboratories, and industry. Such a program will enhance the \nability of the DOE to meet its mission goals and advance the state of \nthe art for the U.S. economic and industrial base in the fields of \nenergy, genetics, pharmaceuticals, nanotechnology, chemical processing, \nelectronics, geology, and transportation. This bill will be a major \nstep toward addressing today's greatest needs and, to creating the \nhigh-wage jobs of the future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2176\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       [This Act may be cited as the ``Minor Use and Minor Species \n     Animal Health Act of 2003''.\n\n     [SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       [Congress makes the following findings:\n       [(1) There is a severe shortage of approved new animal \n     drugs for use in minor species.\n       [(2) There is a severe shortage of approved new animal \n     drugs for treating animal diseases and conditions that occur \n     infrequently or in limited geographic areas.\n       [(3) Because of the small market shares, low-profit margins \n     involved, and capital investment required, it is generally \n     not economically feasible for new animal drug applicants to \n     pursue approvals for these species, diseases, and conditions.\n       [(4) Because the populations for which such new animal \n     drugs are intended may be small and conditions of animal \n     management may vary widely, it is often difficult to design \n     and conduct studies to establish drug safety and \n     effectiveness under traditional new animal drug approval \n     processes.\n       [(5) It is in the public interest and in the interest of \n     animal welfare to provide for special procedures to allow the \n     lawful use and marketing of certain new animal drugs for \n     minor species and minor uses that take into account these \n     special circumstances and that ensure that such drugs do not \n     endanger animal or public health.\n       [(6) Exclusive marketing rights and tax credits for \n     clinical testing expenses have helped encourage the \n     development of ``orphan'' drugs for human use, and comparable \n     incentives should encourage the development of new animal \n     drugs for minor species and minor uses.\n\n     [SEC. 3.

MINOR USE AND MINOR SPECIES ANIMAL HEALTH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There is a severe shortage of approved new animal drugs \n     for use in minor species.\n       (2) There is a severe shortage of approved new animal drugs \n     for treating animal diseases and conditions that occur \n     infrequently or in limited geographic areas.\n       (3) Because of the small market shares, low-profit margins \n     involved, and capital investment required, it is generally \n     not economically feasible for new animal drug applicants to \n     pursue approvals for these species, diseases, and conditions.\n       (4) Because the populations for which such new animal drugs \n     are intended may be small and conditions of animal management \n     may vary widely, it is often difficult to design and conduct \n     studies to establish drug safety and effectiveness under \n     traditional new animal drug approval processes.\n       (5) It is in the public interest and in the interest of \n     animal welfare to provide for special procedures to allow the \n     lawful use and marketing of certain new animal drugs for \n     minor species and minor uses that take into account these \n     special circumstances and that ensure that such drugs do not \n     endanger animal or public health.\n       (6) Exclusive marketing rights for clinical testing \n     expenses have helped encourage the development of ``orphan'' \n     drugs for human use, and comparable incentives should \n     encourage the development of new animal drugs for minor \n     species and minor uses.\n       (b) Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \n     Act.--\n       (1) Definitions.--Section 201 of the Federal, Food, Drug, \n     and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(nn) The term `major species' means cattle, horses, \n     swine, chickens, turkeys, dogs, and cats, except that the \n     Secretary may add species to this definition by regulation.\n       ``(oo) The term `minor species' means animals other than \n     humans that are not major species.\n       ``(pp) The term `minor use' means the intended use of a \n     drug in a major species for an indication that occurs \n     infrequently and in only a small number of animals or in \n     limited geographical areas and in only a small number of \n     animals annually.''.\n       (2) Three-year exclusivity for minor use and minor species \n     approvals.--Section 512(c)(2)(F) (ii), (iii), and (v) of the \n     Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended by striking \n     ``(other than bioequivalence or residue studies)'' and \n     inserting ``(other than bioequivalence studies or residue \n     depletion studies, except residue depletion studies for minor \n     uses or minor species)'' every place it appears.\n       (3) Scope of review for minor use and minor species \n     applications.--Section 512(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new paragraph:\n       ``(5) In reviewing an application that proposes a change to \n     add an intended use for a minor use or a minor species to an \n     approved new animal drug application, the Secretary shall \n     reevaluate only the relevant information in the approved \n     application to determine whether the application for the \n     minor use or minor species can be approved. A decision to \n     approve the application for the minor use or minor species is \n     not, implicitly or explicitly, a reaffirmation of the \n     approval of the original application.''.\n       (4) Minor use and minor species new animal drugs.--Chapter \n     V of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 351 \n     et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n    ``Subchapter F--New Animal Drugs for Minor Use and Minor Species\n\n     ``SEC. 571.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) it is estimated that--\n       (A) approximately 2 percent of adults and about 5 percent \n     of infants and young children in the United States suffer \n     from food allergies; and\n       (B) each year, roughly 30,000 individuals require emergency \n     room treatment and 150 individuals die because of allergic \n     reactions to food;\n       (2)(A) eight major foods or food groups--milk, eggs, fish, \n     Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and \n     soybeans--account for 90 percent of food allergies;\n       (B) at present, there is no cure for food allergies; and\n       (C) a food allergic consumer must avoid the food to which \n     the consumer is allergic;\n       (3)(A) in a review of the foods of randomly selected \n     manufacturers of baked goods, ice cream, and candy in \n     Minnesota and Wisconsin in 1999, the Food and Drug \n     Administration found that 25 percent of sampled foods failed \n     to list peanuts or eggs as ingredients on the food labels; \n     and\n       (B) nationally, the number of recalls because of unlabeled \n     allergens rose to 121 in 2000 from about 35 a decade earlier;\n       (4) a recent study shows that many parents of children with \n     a food allergy were unable to correctly identify in each of \n     several food labels the ingredients derived from major food \n     allergens;\n       (5)(A) ingredients in foods must be listed by their \n     ``common or usual name'';\n       (B) in some cases, the common or usual name of an \n     ingredient may be unfamiliar to consumers, and many consumers \n     may not realize the ingredient is derived from, or contains, \n     a major food allergen; and\n       (C) in other cases, the ingredients may be declared as a \n     class, including spices, flavorings, and certain colorings, \n     or are exempt from the ingredient labeling requirements, such \n     as incidental additives; and\n       (6)(A) celiac disease is an immune-mediated disease that \n     causes damage to the gastrointestinal tract, central nervous \n     system, and other organs;\n       (B) the current recommended treatment is avoidance of \n     glutens in foods that are associated with celiac disease; and\n       (C) a multicenter, multiyear study estimated that the \n     prevalence of celiac disease in the United States is 0.5 to 1 \n     percent of the general population.\n\n     SEC. 203.

FOOD ALLERGENS IN THE FOOD CODE.\n\n       The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, in the \n     Conference for Food Protection, as part of its efforts to \n     encourage cooperative activities between the States under \n     section 311 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 243), \n     pursue revision of the Food Code to provide guidelines for \n     preparing allergen-free foods in food establishments, \n     including in restaurants, grocery store delicatessens and \n     bakeries, and elementary and secondary school cafeterias. The \n     Secretary shall consider guidelines and recommendations \n     developed by public and private entities for public and \n     private food establishments for preparing allergen-free foods \n     in pursuing this revision.\n\n     SEC. 210. RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING RESPONDING TO FOOD-\n                   RELATED ALLERGIC RESPONSES.\n\n       The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, in \n     providing technical assistance relating to trauma care and \n     emergency medical services to State and local agencies under \n     section 1202(b)(3) of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 300d-2(b)(3)), include technical assistance relating \n     to the use of different modes of treatment for and prevention \n     of allergic responses to foods.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support both of the important \nprovisions in this legislation, the Minor Use and Minor Species Animal \nHealth Act and the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act.\n  Veterinarians now treat many animals with drugs approved for other \nanimals or even for humans. Such use is sometimes illegal, and it is \nnot always guided by the best evidence available on the safe and \neffective use of the drug in particular species. The animal health \nlegislation will provide new ways for drugs for minor uses and minor \nspecies to become available to treat animals for which very few drugs \nare now approved.\n  The bill allows conditional approval by the Food and Drug \nAdministration of all minor use drugs and minor species drugs. It also \npermits the use of unapproved drugs, if they are for use in nonfood \nproducing minor species, and in certain circumstances, even in the \nearly life stages of food-producing minor species. Safeguards are \nincluded so that these drugs will be safe for humans, just as any other \nanimal drug must be safe for humans, and will not lead to antibiotic \nresistance in humans.\n  The legislation also allows new animal drugs to become ``designated \nnew animal drugs,'' for which research grants and 7 years of market \nexclusivity will be available if they are approved or conditionally \napproved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n  Overall, this title of the bill will help to improve the health of \nfamily pets, zoo animals, and farm animals, and I commend Senator Gregg \nand Senator Sessions for their leadership in developing this \nlegislation and enabling the Senate to consider it today.\n  The second title of the bill will give families greater confidence \nthat the food they eat is safe. Under the Food Allergen Labeling and \nConsumer Protection Act, 7 million Americans with\n\n[[Page S2375]]\n\nfood allergies will be able to identify a product's ingredients more \neasily and avoid foods that may harm them. One-hundred and fifty \nAmericans die each year from food allergies, and this legislation will \ngreatly reduce that number.\n  It requires the labels on food packages to identify ingredients \nrelated to one of the eight main food allergens, and to do so in easily \nunderstood words. The FDA is required to provide for ``gluten-free'' \nlabels on foods, to help people with celiac disease avoid the glutens \nthat cause their disease.\n  The bill also requires the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nto monitor deaths related to food allergies, and directs the National \nInstitutes of Health to develop a plan for research on food alleries.\n  I commend Senator Gregg and my colleagues on the HELP Committee for \ntheir leadership on this title as well, and I urge the Senate to \napprove this legislation.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee substitute amendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 741), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/08/senate-section/article/S2375-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, MARCH 9, 2004\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the budget resolution. When the Senate resumes debate, \nwe will have 40 hours remaining of the 50-hour time limit for debate. \nIt is the intention of the bill's managers to begin the amending \nprocess tomorrow morning. It is my hope that Members who wish to offer \namendments will do so and also contact both myself and the ranking \nmember, Senator Conrad, in order, if at all possible, to prevent a \nvote-arama being drawn out at the conclusion of the debate.\n  I would also like to inform my colleagues that rollcall votes will \noccur throughout tomorrow. Senators will be notified when those votes \nare scheduled.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me add my voice to the Chairman's \nvoice on the question of amendments. We have gone back and looked over \npast budget resolutions, and we have seen that there has been \nsubstantial duplication in amendments, all of them included in what the \nchairman calls a vote-arama.\n\n  We believe if we all use a little more discipline we can reduce the \nnumber of amendments considered and still have a thorough debate on the \nkey issues and the key differences between us. I am urging my \ncolleagues to think if they have an amendment that is on No Child Left \nBehind, that they group together with other Senators who might be \nsimilarly inclined and offer an amendment together rather than three or \nfour different amendments on the same subject.\n  I ask our colleagues that we have a good, full debate, we use this \nweek well, we express the differences between us in a responsible way, \nbut at the end, that we do not have a whole series of relatively minor \namendments or repetitive amendments so we can have the best expression \nof the Senate's position on the budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I concur with my colleague, Senator Conrad. He is \nexactly right. The Senate can manage debate on the Senate resolution \nand conduct itself much better than we have in the past. Senator Conrad \nhas been very helpful in making that happen. I think the debate we had \ntoday was a very good debate. We were expecting to yield back a lot of \ntime. Frankly, we did not yield back much time because there was good, \nsignificant debate. We did not have prolonged quorum calls. We had a \nlot of speakers on both sides to present their views. I thank our \ncolleagues for doing that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/08/senate-section/article/S2375-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
