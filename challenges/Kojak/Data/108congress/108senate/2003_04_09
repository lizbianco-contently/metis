Mr. President, as we have been doing over the last several \nweeks, we are devoting a few moments each morning to pay respect to the \ntremendous work our troops are doing overseas. Evidence continues to \nbuild that American and coalition forces are advancing, that they will \nprevail in this war.\n  Coalition aircraft destroyed a complex believed to be the site of an \nIraqi leadership meeting.\n  Coalition forces are conducting operations at will throughout \nBaghdad, and British forces now control most of Iraq's second largest \ncity.\n  The threat of Chemical Ali, the Iraqi general responsible for the \natrocious chemical attacks on the Kurds in the 1980s, has reportedly \nbeen eliminated.\n  We have captured more than 7,000 Iraqi prisoners of war.\n  Of the more than 800 tanks in the Iraqi Army when this conflict \nbegan, all but a few, a couple dozen, have been destroyed or abandoned.\n  Coalition forces continue to generate good will among the Iraqi \npeople, as we saw on the television early this morning, by delivering \nhumanitarian supplies the country so desperately needs.\n  I applaud a very special group of people in Iraq, and that is the \nmedical workers, the medical personnel, the troops who are responsible \nfor delivering care, both in Iraq and the surrounding region. They are \nproviding\n\n[[Page S4998]]\n\nsuperb care, not only to fellow Americans who have been wounded on the \nbattlefield but also to nearly 300 wounded Iraqi soldiers, as well as \ncivilians. On the hospital ship Comfort in the northern Arabian Gulf, \nwe are treating 75 Iraqi prisoners of war.\n  Yesterday, the Pentagon quoted one doctor who said:\n\n       We do not differentiate between patients, whether they are \n     friends or foes.\n\n  I cannot imagine a more powerful statement about the compassion of \nour men and our women in uniform and our country.\n  On Monday, GEN Tommy Franks paid a visit to the 101st Airborne in \nNajaf. He awarded Bronze Stars to two 1st Brigade soldiers: SGT James \nWard of the 1st Battalion and SGT Lucas Goddard of the 3rd Battalion. \nPFC Miguel Pena of the 2nd Battalion will also receive a Bronze Star at \na future date.\n  In closing, General Franks said in a brief speech during the ceremony \nsomething that really captures, I believe, the feelings of all \nAmericans when he said:\n\n       There's something real special to stand with these two \n     young noncommissioned officers back here--and stand with \n     these heroes.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       What I meant when I said stand with ``these heroes'' is I \n     meant all of you.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/09/senate-section/article/S4998-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent).

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  The majority leader mentioned the 101st Airborne Division in his \nremarks. Both he and I feel a special pride in that division because it \nsits on the border of Tennessee and Kentucky. The majority leader was \nthere 10 days ago with the families over a weekend, and I was there \nover the past weekend with the Secretary of the Army at a luncheon in \nhonor of the families there.\n  I suppose this must be said of every part of our military today, but \nno one can go to Fort Campbell without being enormously impressed with \nevery single military person one meets, especially the family members. \nAmong those was Holly Petraeus, who is the wife of the commanding \ngeneral of the 101st Airborne Division.\n  We talked about a great many things on Saturday. We talked about the \nbravery of the men and women from the 101st and from the Army Special \nForces Divisions who have been in Iraq even longer. We talked about the \nnumber of Tennessee reservists, American reservists, and National Guard \nmen and women who have been deployed since 9/11.\n  If I remember correctly, the Secretary of the Army estimated that \nnearly two-thirds of all of our reservists and National Guard men and \nwomen have been activated in one form or another since 9/11. We owe \nthem enormous gratitude.\n  We talked about one other thing at Fort Campbell last Saturday, and \nthat was the debt we owe to our allies because we are not in Iraq \nalone. We talk about the coalition of the willing. So today, I rise not \njust to talk about our brave men and women at Fort Campbell, about whom \nI will have more to say later this week, but I want to express our \nappreciation for and salute our allies in the military action in Iraq.\n  Many of our colleagues have noted the leadership of Great Britain and \nPrime Minister Blair, and rightfully so. Great Britain has long been a \ngreat ally of this country, and we are deeply grateful for that. But \nanother ally has contributed significantly to military resources in \nthis effort, a country we sometimes might overlook. That country is \nAustralia.\n  Although their military is not as large as Great Britain, their \ncontribution is significant and they deserve our thanks. Australia has \nlong been a friend and ally to the United States. Not only did they \nsend troops to support us in the 1991 war in the Persian Gulf, they \nalso joined us in military action in Korea and in Vietnam. Australians \nshare our values of democracy and a pioneering spirit. Australia also \nshares our history of being a former British colony with a strong \nindependent streak. The British may be our ancestors, but the \nAustralians are our first cousins.\n\n  Today, Australia is standing with us again. In fact, they have \ncommitted more troops to our current efforts in Iraq than they did 12 \nyears ago in 1991. Australia's commitment includes: 14 F-18 jet \nfighters, 3 C-130 transport aircraft, three naval vessels, one \ntransport and two frigates, CH-47 troop-lift helicopters and \naccompanying troops, and a Special Forces task group of 500 troops.\n  In total, Australia has committed about 2,000 army, air force, and \nnaval personnel--their second largest military deployment since \nVietnam. And they have been very active.\n  Australia's Special Forces have seen combat in what their commander \ndescribes as ``shoot and scoot'' missions. They have destroyed \ninstallations behind enemy lines and provided important reconnaissance \ninformation.\n  An Australian diving team has been instrumental in clearing \nunderwater mines at the Iraqi port of Umm Qasr, making it possible for \nthe arrival of humanitarian aid.\n  Their ships aided in the capture of an Iraqi vessel that was trying \nto lay more mines in the Gulf.\n  And their F-18 fighter aircraft have joined ours in air strikes on \nenemy military targets.\n  Australian Prime Minister John Howard told his Parliament on March \n18:\n\n       We have supported the Americans position on this issue \n     because we share their concerns and we share their worries \n     about the future if Iraq is left unattended to.\n       Alliances are two-way processes and, when we are in \n     agreement, we should not leave it to the United States to do \n     all of the heavy lifting just because they are the world's \n     superpower.\n\n  Now that is a true friend. Australia may not have the largest \nmilitary in the world, but that won't stop them from sending what they \ncan to help our brave men and women fighting in Iraq. They do not want \nto leave us to do all the ``heavy lifting.'' And, as I noted earlier, \ntheir help has been real and significant.\n  Australia, led by Prime Minister Howard, has taken a courageous stand \nby supporting us in this war and committing so many of its troops. They \nare a true friend and ally of the United States, and I know we are all \ngrateful for their help and support.\n  If I may say, in 1987, after I left the Tennessee Governor's office, \nmy family\n\n[[Page S4999]]\n\nand I moved to Australia. We lived in Sydney for 6 months. We did that \nto get to know each other as a family even better, after so many years \nin politics. It gave us a chance to know our first cousins in Australia \nand to see our country at home in an even different way.\n  In 1992, when I served in President Bush's Cabinet, the President \nasked then-Secretary of Defense Cheney and me to go to Australia to \nhelp celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea. I \nhave been reminded many times that our Australian friends remember that \nthe United States of America stood with them during World War II, and \nthey stand with us today. That is why on last Saturday, at Fort \nCampbell, we were not only talking about the bravery of American men \nand women and about our own National Guardsmen and reservists, we were \ntalking about how much we respect and appreciate the support our \nfighting men and women have received from our allies overseas, \nespecially from the brave men and women in Australia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nGeorgia is recognized.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I rise this morning to share with my \ncolleagues the story of one of my Georgia constituents. It beings with \na brave young 3rd Infantry soldier named Diego Rincon.\n  Diego was a native of Colombia and he came to the United States in \n1989 with his family when he was 5 years old. He enjoyed a life of \nfreedom and safety that might never have been possible in Colombia.\n  Diego was extremely loyal to the country that welcomed him. And after \nthe September 11 attacks, he decided it was time to repay his adopted \nNation.\n  Upon graduation from Salem High School in Conyers, GA, Diego enlisted \nin the Army. He became a member of the ``Rock of the Marne,'' Fort \nStewart's 3rd Infantry Division.\n  Sadly, PFC Rincon was killed March 29 in Iraq by a suicide bomber at \na military checkpoint. Diego was 19 years old. Three other members of \nhis 1st Brigade were also killed.\n  In late February, Diego wrote his final letter home to his mother \njust as his brigade was getting ready to move out. I would like to read \njust a couple of paragraphs from that letter:\n\n       So I guess the time has finally come for us to see what we \n     are made of, who will crack when the stress level rises and \n     who will be calm all the way through it. Only time will tell.\n       I try not to think of what may happen in the future, but I \n     can't stand seeing it in my eyes. There's going to be \n     murders, funerals and tears rolling down everybody's eyes.\n       But the only thing I can say is, keep my head up and try to \n     keep the faith and pray for better days. All this will pass. \n     I believe God has a path for me.\n       Whether I make it or not, it's all part of the plan. It \n     can't be changed, only completed.\n\n  This 19-year-old young man, was wise beyond his years. Diego joined \nthe Army for the noblest of reasons. He fought and died in Iraq while \ndefending our Nation's freedom.\n  And after his death, when I talked with his family, they asked one \nlast request of the Government in return for their son's life--to be \nable to bury him this Thursday as a U.S. citizen.\n  I am very pleased and proud to announce today that, with the help of \nthe INS, PFC Diego Rincon has been awarded U.S. citizenship. Tomorrow, \nthis brave soldier will be buried in Georgia as a citizen of this great \ncountry.\n  But there are thousands of noncitizens fighting in our military right \nnow. So I, along with my fellow Senator from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss, \nhave introduced legislation calling for citizenship to be granted \nimmediately to any soldier who fights in our armed services and dies in \ncombat.\n  For those among our troops who are not citizens and who die on the \nbattlefield, I believe the least we can do is to honor them with \nposthumous citizenship. I believe it should be done automatically by \nthe Government, with no delay and no burden on the families.\n  Under our bill, the families of these brave soldiers would not have \nto fill out any forms or make any phone calls. This citizenship would \napply only to the deceased soldier, and it would not make the soldier's \nfamily eligible for any extra benefit or any special treatment. It is \nsimply a final gesture of thanks and gratitude for the ultimate \nsacrifice these immigrant soldiers have made for their adopted country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair wishes to announce there are 2 \nminutes 49 seconds remaining on the Republican side and 6 minutes 14 \nseconds on the Democratic side.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have moved into morning business, is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if there would be any objection to adding 10 \nminutes to this period of time, given the number of speakers we have on \nthe floor. I would not want to do that without the leadership knowing \nabout it. I wonder if somebody could check to see if there would be any \nobjection to our adding 10 minutes to this particular period.\n  Mr. President, one of my greatest pleasures and privileges of serving \non the Armed Services Committee has been the close working contact I \nhave had with the men and women who make up America's Armed Forces. \nThey truly represent the best our Nation has to offer. Whenever I visit \nthem, no matter where they are stationed or deployed, I come away proud \nand impressed by their courage, their professionalism and their \ncommitment.\n  Across the country, Americans have rallied, volunteered, and sent \ndonations to show their support for our military members serving in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. This generosity of heart has been apparent in \nevery corner of my home State of Michigan.\n  Michigan has a long tradition of giving its all in support of young \nAmericans waging a war overseas. Over 60 years ago, Michigan's \nautomotive factories were the heart of the ``Arsenal of Democracy'', \nwhich helped to bring an Allied victory in World War II. As President \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt said at that time, Americans at home were a \ncrucial component of the war: ``We must apply ourselves to our task \nwith the same resolution, the same sense of urgency, the same spirit of \npatriotism and sacrifice'' as those serving on the front lines.\n  And Michiganders have always stepped up to that challenge, giving of \ntheir time, their resources, their energy, and their love in support of \nour troops. Since the war in Iraq began, in countless ways, \nMichiganders have sought to express their thanks to our service \nmembers.\n  There are currently over 3,400 Michiganders from National Guard and \nReserve units who have been activated, in addition to many active duty \nservice members for Michigan serving in support of ongoing military \noperations. In February, I traveled to Kuwait, Qatar, and other places \nin the region and had the honor of meeting with a group of about 20 \nMarines from Michigan at Camp Commando. These dedicated, professional \nmen and women were highly motivated, well prepared, and their morale \nwas high. They are remarkable representatives of America and the values \nwe stand for.\n  To show our gratitude for their work, thousands have rallied across \nMichigan in support of the troops. At the Capitol in Lansing, at \nCentennial Park in Holland, at Calder Plaza in Grand Rapids, at \nVeterans Memorial Park in Ann Arbor, and St. Mary's Park in Monroe--\namong many other locales--groups have gathered to voice support for the \ntroops and wish them a quick, safe return home.\n  In Jackson, people lined the streets for a parade to send off members \nof a local Army Reserve unit mobilized to active duty. A parade was \nheld in Houghton, where uniformed men and women displayed their colors \nfor the troops, and a similar event in support of the service members \nis planned in Cheboygan. Bowen Holliday Post 35 of the American Legion \nin Traverse City is giving out Blue Star Service Banners to military \nfamilies as a visual reminder of sons and daughters serving the \ncountry.\n  And Rudyard, Michigan--a town of 1,315 in the Upper Peninsula--has \nseen more than ten percent of its population mobilized on active \nmilitary duty.\n  Although the Defense Department prohibits sending care packages to \n``any servicemember'' due to security concerns and transportation \nconstraints, Michigan residents have found many ways to provide service \npeople with a piece of home.\n\n[[Page S5000]]\n\n  Girl Scouts in the Upper Peninsula are conducting a campaign called \n``Cookies From Home.'' The scouts are collecting donations from U.P. \nresidents, and the money will be used to buy boxes of Girl Scout \ncookies which they will send to the troops. Last year, Girl Scouts in \nthe Upper Peninsula sent 2,076 boxes of cookies to Bosnia and Saudi \nArabia as part of the campaign.\n  Students at Ishpeming High School in the U.P. have started a letter \nwriting campaign to Ishpeming graduates who are now serving in the \nmilitary overseas. The Gogebic County Sheriff's Department is \nparticipating in Operation Adopt-A-Family, which is intended to help \npeople who need assistance as the result of the deployment of a spouse \nor parent. Many groups--including the Milan Area Chamber of Commerce--\nhave ``adopted'' soldiers, sending them correspondence, thoughts and \nprayers. Two Jackson, Michigan, men have teamed up to write ``Heroes \nPiano,'' a song supporting the troops.\n  A group of Wayne schoolchildren is showing their support by making a \nspecial video in appreciation of U.S. service members. Similarly, but \non a larger scale, the ABC television station in Detroit is traveling \naround town with a camera for a project called ``To Our Troops,'' in \nwhich they provide residents with an opportunity to send a message \ndirectly to the men and women in the battlefield.\n  Unfortunately, war is a dangerous business and it grieves me to \nreport that four Michigan service members have made the ultimate \nsacrifice in the service of their country in Operation Iraqi Freedom: \nMarine Major Kevin G. Nave of Union Lake, Army Sergeant Todd J. Robbins \nof Pentwater, Army Sergeant Michael F. Pedersen of Flint, and Private \nFirst Class Brandon Sloan of Fraser. I want to close my remarks this \nmorning by paying tribute to their sacrifice and the sacrifice of their \nfamilies. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families as they cope \nwith their loss. They should know that a grateful Nation will never \nforget their loved one and the sacrifice they have made.\n  On behalf of all of the people of Michigan, I say thank you to all \nthe men and women of our armed forces who are carrying out the \ndangerous mission of disarming Saddam Hussein and his regime. May God \nspeed you home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas.\n  First, for the purpose of the information of the Democratic \nleadership, there are 17 seconds remaining on the Democratic side.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \njunior Senator from Michigan be allowed 5 minutes extra. I am going to \nwithhold, and then my colleague from North Carolina will follow Senator \nStabenow because there is a very important speech and a timetable for \nthe Senator from North Carolina. I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Michigan be recognized for 5 minutes, after which the \nSenator from North Carolina be recognized for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to commend my colleague from \nMichigan for his comments and rise to support and join him in praising \nour men and women in uniform who are putting their futures on hold and \ntheir lives on the line to defend our Nation and protect and advance \nfreedom around the world.\n  The military action is going very well. We expect no less from our \nmen and women in uniform; they are highly prepared and trained and \ndedicated.\n  Already many of these dedicated men and women have made the ultimate \nsacrifice.\n  Across the Nation last week we rejoiced at the dramatic rescue of \nArmy PFC Jessica Lynch.\n  Sadly, among the bodies found in or near the hospital where Lynch was \nheld was the body of Private Brandon Sloan of Fraser, MI--one of \nLynch's comrades in the 507th Ordnance Maintenance Company that was \nambushed by the Iraqis on March 23.\n  Others from Michigan who have given their lives in Iraq are: Marine \nMAJ Kevin Nave of White Lake Township, Army SGT Michael Pedersen of \nFlint, MI, and Army SGT Todd Robbins of Pentwater, MI.\n  And in the continuing operation in Afghanistan, Michigan mourns the \nloss of Air Force SrA Jason Plite of Grand Ledge who died in a \nhelicopter accident as he flew on a mission to rescue two injured \nAfghan children.\n  Our hearts and prayers go out to the families of these men and the \nfamilies of all the other men and women who, as Lincoln said, ``gave \nthe last measure of full devotion'' for their country.\n  Our troops who wear the uniform of this Nation with such honor \ndeserve to know they are held in honor here at home.\n  My father was in the Navy during World War II and my husband served \nin the Air Force during the first Gulf War. Both have told me how \nimportant it was for the morale of all those who served to know they \nhad the support of their Nation.\n  Military officials tell me there are things Americans can do right \nhere at home to let our troops overseas know they are in our thoughts \nand prayers--things that will make life a little better for people \nright in our hometowns as well.\n  I commend, as did Senator Levin, all who are reaching out to support \nour troops.\n  Unlike previous conflicts, the Defense Department is asking people \nnot to send care packages or letters not addressed to specific military \npersonnel. Since the anthrax attacks of October 2001, these kinds of \nmailings just pose too much of a security risk.\n  However, the military encourages individuals or groups to show their \nsupport for the troops abroad by showing support at home for our \nveterans and the families of current National Guard and Reserve \npersonnel whose loved ones are deployed far away--and then sharing your \nefforts with our troops in Iraq.\n  For instance, my home State of Michigan is home to almost 875,000 \nveterans of conflicts going all the way back to World War I. Volunteers \nare always needed at veteran's hospitals and veteran's homes.\n  Volunteers are also needed to help family readiness groups that \nassist the families of the National Guard and Reserve personnel who \nhave been deployed far from home.\n  From my home state of Michigan, the men and women of the 127th Air \nNational Guard Wing in Selfridge, the 110th Fighter Wing in Battle \nCreek and the Combat Readiness Training Center in Alpena have been \nmobilized and deployed to bases around the world, including Kuwait, \nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, South West Asia, and Turkey.\n  Army National Guard and Reserve units from Owosso, Taylor, Grand \nLedge, Grayling, Sault Ste. Marie, Midland, Pontiac, Three Rivers, \nAugusta, Selfridge, and Ypsilanti have been mobilized and are awaiting \ntheir deployment orders.\n  Many of these men and women leave families and well-paying jobs \nbehind--creating hardships for themselves and their families just so \nthey can serve their Nation.\n  Family readiness volunteers help families of Guard and Reserve units \nwith everything from arranging for baby sitting and lawn care to \nstaffing phone trees that keep families informed of the most recent \ndevelopments regarding the deployment of their loved ones.\n  Once you have volunteered, military officials encourage you to go to \na special website called www.operationdearabby.net.\n  There you can post a note to our troops letting them know what you \nand your neighbors are doing here at home to show your support as they \nserve abroad.\n  Military mail officials sort these messages so they can be delivered \nto soldiers who would be the most interested.\n  Mr. President, over the past 2 weeks our men and women in uniform \nhave put on an amazing display of bravery and toughness. We have all \nseen the picture of our troops standing up against not just the enemy--\nbut pounding sandstorms and blistering heat.\n  But something about the scene is very familiar--and very American. In \nfact, it is a scene as old as our Republic itself, as old as the brutal \nwinter at Valley Forge in 1777.\n\n[[Page S5001]]\n\n  Listen to the words of George Washington when he bid farewell to his \ntroops when the war was finally over.\n  Against all odds, including that bitter winter and Valley Forge, \nthese soldiers had won their freedom and created a new Nation.\n  It was almost with a sense of awe that Washington said to them:\n\n       The unparalleled perseverance of the Armies of the United \n     States, through almost every possible suffering and \n     discouragement, was little short of a standing miracle.\n\n  The spirit of that first American army lives on in our men and women \nin uniform today.\n  It is still little short of a standing miracle, it still inspires \nawe, and it commands us to do whatever we can do here at home to show \nour unwavering support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/09/senate-section/article/S5001-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5001-S5004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BOB DOLE\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nremarkable accomplishments of a former Member of this body, a friend of \nmany Senators, who delivered his first speech in this Chamber 34 years \nago next week.\n  It was April 14, 1969, when the gentleman from Kansas, Senator Bob \nDole, stood not far from here to address his Senate colleagues for the \nfirst time. He spoke eloquently about a group of Americans who were \nvery close to his heart . . . Americans who, prior to his involvement, \nhad largely been ignored.\n  It was a group of Americans he had joined exactly 24 years earlier, \nwhen on April 14, 1945, he was wounded in the hills of Italy as he led \nhis men in battle. As a result of his wounds, Bob spent 39 months in \nvarious hospitals, and doctors operated on him eight times. Eventually, \nhe was left without the use of his right arm.\n  So it was that Senator Bob Dole who rose on April 14, 1969, not just \nto speak as a U.S. Senator, but as one of the millions of Americans who \nhave a disability.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a copy of the April 14th speech.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Handicapped Americans\n\n       Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, my remarks today concern an \n     exceptional group which I joined on another April 14, twenty-\n     four years ago, during World War II.\n       It is a minority group whose existence affects every person \n     in our society and the very fiber of our Nation.\n       It is a group which no one joins by personal choice--a \n     group whose requirements for membership are not based on age, \n     sex, wealth, education, skin color, religious beliefs, \n     political party, power, or prestige.\n       As a minority, it has always known exclusion--maybe not \n     exclusion from the front of the bus, but perhaps from even \n     climbing aboard it; maybe not exclusion from pursuing \n     advanced education, but perhaps from experiencing any formal \n     education; maybe not exclusion from day-to-day life itself, \n     but perhaps from an adequate opportunity to develop and \n     contribute to his or her fullest capacity.\n       It is a minority, yet a group to which at least one out of \n     every five Americans belongs.\n       Mr. President, I speak today about 42 million citizens of \n     our Nation who are physically, mentally, or emotionally \n     handicapped.\n\n\n                        who are the handicapped?\n\n       Who are the handicapped?\n       They are persons--men, women, and children--who cannot \n     achieve full physical, mental, and social potential because \n     of disability.\n       Although some live in institutions, many more live in the \n     community. Some are so severely disabled as to be homebound, \n     or even bed-bound. Still others are able to take part in \n     community activities when they have access and facilities.\n       They include amputees, paraplegics, polio victims. Causes \n     of disability include arthritis, cardio-vascular diseases, \n     multiple sclerosis, and muscular dystrophy.\n       While you may have good vision and hearing, many persons \n     live each day with limited eyesight or hearing, or with none \n     at all.\n       While you may enjoy full muscle strength and coordination \n     in your legs, there are those who must rely on braces or \n     crutches, or perhaps a walker or wheel chair.\n       While you perform daily millions of tasks with your hands \n     and arms, there are many who live with limited or total \n     disability in theirs.\n       And in contrast to most people, thousands of adults and \n     children suffer mental or emotional disorders which hinder \n     their abilities to learn and apply what is learned and to \n     cope adequately with their families, jobs, and communities.\n       Then there are those who are affected with combination or \n     multiple handicaps.\n\n\n                         not just the handicap\n\n       For our Nation's 42 million handicapped persons and their \n     families, yesterday, today, and tomorrow are not filled with \n     ``everyday'' kinds of problems which can be solved or soothed \n     by ``everyday'' kinds of answers. Their daily challenge is: \n     accepting and working with a disability so that the \n     handicapped person can become as active and useful, as \n     independent, secure, and dignified as his ability will allow.\n       Too many handicapped persons lead lives of loneliness and \n     despair; too many feel and too many are cut off from our \n     work-oriented society; too many cannot fill empty hours in a \n     satisfying, constructive manner. The leisure most of us crave \n     can and has become a curse to many of our Nation's \n     handicapped.\n       Often when a handicapped person is able to work full or \n     part time, there are few jobs or inadequate training programs \n     in his locale. Although progress is being made, many \n     employers are hesitant to hire a handicapped person, ignoring \n     statistics that show he is often a better and more dependent \n     worker.\n       The result is that abilities of a person are overlooked \n     because of disabilities which may bear little or no true \n     relation to the job at hand. The result to the taxpayer may \n     be to support one more person at a cost of as much as $3,500 \n     per person a year. To the handicapped person himself, it \n     means more dependency.\n\n\n                               statistics\n\n       Consider these statistics: Only one-third of America's \n     blind and less than half of the paraplegics of working age \n     are employed, while only a handful of about 200,000 persons \n     with cerebral palsy who are of working age are employed.\n       Beyond this, far too many handicapped persons and their \n     families bear serious economic problems--despite token \n     Government pensions and income tax deductions for a few, and \n     other financial aids. I recall a portion of a letter received \n     recently from the mother of a cerebral palsy child in a \n     Midwestern urban area: ``There are the never-ending \n     surgeries, braces, orthopedic shoes, wheelchairs, walkers, \n     standing tables, bath tables and so on . . . we parents \n     follow up on every hopeful lead in clinics and with \n     specialists; we go up and down paths blindly and always \n     expensively . . . I have talked with four major insurance \n     companies who do not insure or infrequently insure CP \n     children . . . although our daughter is included in her \n     father's group hospitalization plan, many families are not as \n     fortunate. These are just a few of the problems, compounded \n     by the fact we must try to adequately meet the needs of our \n     other ``normal'' children. In many cases, some kind of \n     financial assistance would enable us and others like us to \n     provide for our children in our homes, avoiding overcrowding \n     of already overcrowded facilities and further adding to the \n     taxpayer's burden costs for complete care.''\n       There are other problems--availability and access of health \n     care personnel and facilities at the time and place the \n     individual with handicaps needs them. In my own largely rural \n     State of Kansas, many handicapped persons travel 300 miles or \n     more to receive the basic health services they require.\n       Education presents difficulties for many parents of \n     handicapped children. Although a child may be educable, there \n     may be few, if any, opportunities in the community for him to \n     receive an education. Private tutoring, if available, is \n     often too expensive. Sadly to date, the Council for \n     Exceptional Children estimates less than one-third of the \n     Nation's children requiring special education are receiving \n     it.\n       In rehabilitation, the Department of Health, Education, and \n     Welfare said recently 25 percent of America's disabled have \n     not received rehabilitation services and do not know where to \n     seek such help. They estimate that at least 5 million \n     disabled persons may be eligible for assistance.\n       Other problems the handicapped person faces each day \n     include availability and access of recreation and \n     transportation facilities, architectural barriers in \n     residences and other buildings, and many, many more.\n\n\n                       still a promising outlook\n\n       We in America are still far from the half-way point of \n     assuring that every handicapped person can become as active \n     and useful as his capacities will allow. The outlook for the \n     handicapped person in 1969, however, is not altogether bleak. \n     Unparalleled achievements in medicine, science, education, \n     technology as well as in public attitudes have cemented a \n     framework in which the handicapped person today has more \n     opportunities available to him than ever before. Consider \n     first what government is doing.\n\n\n                          the government story\n\n       The story of what the Federal Government, hand in hand with \n     State governments, is doing to help meet the needs of the \n     handicapped is not one that draws the biggest and boldest \n     headlines. Broadly, the story is a ``good'' one, consisting \n     of achievements in financial assistance, rehabilitation, \n     research, education, and training of the handicapped--a \n     massive effort to help many disabled Americans live as \n     normal, as full and rich lives as possible.\n       It is, in part, the story of a man who, at age 21, became a \n     paraplegic after sustaining\n\n[[Page S5002]]\n\n     injuries to his spinal cord and head in an accident while on \n     the job.\n       In 1968, he joined over 2,300,000 other disabled men and \n     women who have been restored to more productive, useful lives \n     since the State-Federal vocational rehabilitation program \n     began 48 years ago.\n       In 1964, the young man--a high school dropout with a wife \n     and child--was referred to his State's division of vocational \n     rehabilitation where a thorough program of total \n     rehabilitation began. In addition, he was enrolled in a \n     training school and was graduated as a fully licensed \n     insurance agent.\n       Today--4 years later--he has his own successful insurance \n     business. He and his wife have built a new home and adopted a \n     baby.\n       It is a measure of America's concern for its handicapped \n     citizens that even 50 years ago, this story could not have \n     been told.\n       It takes place now because the Congress and the Federal \n     Government initiated and guided a vital, vigorous program of \n     vocational rehabilitation.\n       Mr. President, vocational rehabilitation is one of many \n     ways of the Federal Government works to aid the handicapped. \n     But none of the Federal programs necessarily reaches or helps \n     every handicapped person.\n       Nevertheless, the role of the Government has been basically \n     successful in terms of numbers assisted, basic research \n     performed, and the movement of increasingly large numbers of \n     persons into more productive, satisfying channels. It \n     demonstrates what Congress and Federal and State governments \n     are doing to help America's handicapped better participate \n     and achieve.\n       Mr. President, at this point, I ask unanimous consent to \n     have printed in the Record, at the close of my remarks, a \n     brief summary of Federal programs for the handicapped.\n       The PRESIDENT OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n       (See exhibit 1.)\n\n\n                           the private sector\n\n       Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, it is in the American tradition \n     and spirit that parallel to Government effort there has \n     developed the vital and growing effort for the handicapped by \n     individuals, business and industry, churches and private, \n     voluntary organizations. It is a herculean task to properly \n     assess the many, far-reaching effects of the private sector--\n     in health care, education, employment; in research, \n     rehabilitation, by fundraising drives and through \n     professional organizations and groups for the handicapped \n     themselves. But it is here in the private sector--with its \n     emphasis on the creativity, concern, and energies of our \n     people--that America has become the envy of the world. Our \n     private economy and the resources of our people have combined \n     to improve the quality of life in America in ways and for \n     persons the Government could not begin to match or reach.\n       For the handicapped, their achievements have been no less. \n     I shall not today, detail or single out the achievements of \n     the voluntary groups and private enterprise involved in \n     aiding the handicapped. But let the record show that without \n     the sincerity, scope, and success of their efforts--in public \n     information, employment and training, in upgrading health \n     care and education personnel and facilities, in fundraising \n     and in supporting research to conquer or at least minimize \n     the effects of handicapping conditions--the prospects for the \n     handicapped individuals would not be as hopeful as they are \n     today.\n\n\n                       where do we go from here?\n\n       Mr. President, as new public and private programs are \n     developed, as old ones are strengthened and some, perhaps \n     eliminated, as we in Congress allocate comparatively limited \n     funds to help the handicapped, the responsibilities and \n     opportunities loom large before us.\n       We must insure our efforts and money are not misplaced or \n     misdirected--that they do not just promise, but really do the \n     job.\n       Are we all doing our best to see that all the knowledge, \n     information, money, and other help is consolidated and \n     available to the handicapped person in the form he can use \n     and at the time and place he most needs it?\n       Is there sufficient coordination and planning between and \n     among the private groups and the Government agencies to avoid \n     multiplicity and duplication so that we best serve America's \n     handicapped?\n       Are we sometimes engaged in a numbers race--attending to \n     cases that respond more quickly in order to show results to \n     donors, members, and taxpayers, thus sacrificing some \n     attention which should be focused on the really tough \n     problems?\n       Many handicapped persons of our Nation are no longer \n     helpless or hopeless because of private and public efforts \n     which have helped them to better help and be themselves.\n       But the fact remains that some of our Nation's handicapped \n     and their families are attacking the very programs and \n     projects created to help them.\n       Some are disillusioned and disaffected by the programs.\n       Too often, the information, the services, the human help \n     and encouragement are not reaching the person for whom they \n     were intended and at the time and place he needs them.\n       Some sincerely believe there may be better ways we can \n     demonstrate our concern and thereby better achieve for the \n     person with handicaps the independence, security, and dignity \n     to which he is entitled.\n       I am reminded of a statement given recently by the 1968 \n     president of the National Rehabilitation Association: ``It is \n     the person, not the program that is of overwhelming \n     importance. It is not the disability that claims our \n     attention, it is the person with handicaps. It is not the \n     maintenance of prestige of a particular profession that \n     matters. It is the contribution of the profession to solving \n     the complex problems of the individual who has handicaps.''\n       When more of this emphasis on the individual better \n     influence the agencies and professions dealing with the \n     handicapped, I believe we can begin to open new, more \n     meaningful vistas for more persons with handicaps.\n       We have been involved in efforts which have been creditable \n     to date. Of this, there is no doubt.\n       But are we doing our best?\n       A highly respected official of the U.S. Department of \n     Health, Education, and Welfare summed up the problem this \n     way: ``I do not feel we are spending our dollars--public or \n     voluntarily--as effectively as we could. We need to take a \n     whole new look at what is going on, where the service is \n     given. We need to try to design new methods and clearer \n     purposes for our efforts. We need to relate our efforts more \n     closely to the needs of a community, to the needs of its \n     individuals. And we need to try to measure, as concretely and \n     specifically as possible what is actually achieved by our \n     expenditures.''\n       Our handicapped citizens are one of our Nation's greatest \n     unmet responsibilities and untapped resources. We must do \n     better.\n\n\n                        presidential task force\n\n       With this in mind, I suggest the creation of a Presidential \n     task force or commission to review what the public and \n     private sectors are doing and to recommend how we can do \n     better.\n       Composed of representatives of the public and private \n     sectors, this task force or commission could provide an \n     overview of how to provide the handicapped more help and \n     hope.\n       Such a task force or commission could provide valuable \n     assistance to Congress and the administration as we develop \n     programs and allocate comparatively limited funds for the \n     handicapped.\n       It could also help private organizations and voluntary \n     groups conduct their efforts more efficiently and \n     effectively.\n       The goal of a task force or commission, to achieve maximum \n     independence, security, and dignity for the individual with \n     handicaps, should encompass the total needs of the \n     handicapped, not just employment or education or any other.\n       Rather the task force or commission should concern itself \n     with the whole broad spectrum of needs and services, because \n     as I have pointed out the problems of the handicapped do not \n     begin and end with the handicap itself.\n       Although there are hundreds of areas a task force or \n     commission could review, I am hopeful, if created, it would \n     include the following subjects:\n       First. Expansion of employment, transportation, and \n     recreation opportunities for the handicapped.\n       Second. A directory or central clearinghouse to help inform \n     the handicapped person and his family of available public and \n     private assistance.\n       There are many helpful handbooks and information sources \n     available. But most are not comprehensive and are more \n     accessible to professionals in the field than to the \n     handicapped who really need the guidance and information.\n       Third. Removal of architectural barriers.\n       Many persons cannot secure employment or fill their leisure \n     hours because their disabilities bar use of the facilities. \n     It is just as easy to build and equip buildings so that the \n     handicapped and unhandicapped can use them. The Federal \n     Government is doing this now for federally financed \n     structures.\n       Fourth. More development of health care on a regional or \n     community basis.\n       This is a tough, but priority matter and one which cannot \n     be accomplished quickly or inexpensively. But we must begin \n     to move toward more adequate health care facilities and \n     personnel which serve each person at the time and place he \n     needs them.\n       Fifth. Better serving the special educational needs of the \n     handicapped.\n       Both the person and the Nation suffer when any educatable \n     child--handicapped or unhandicapped--does not receive an \n     education.\n       Sixth. Income tax deductions and/or other financial \n     assistance to extend relief to more handicapped persons and \n     their families.\n       Seventh. More attention on the family of the handicapped \n     person.\n       These are the people who often need a degree of \n     encouragement, counseling, and ``rehabilitation'' themselves. \n     Are there services we should provide to family members whose \n     own lives and resources are deeply affected by the presence \n     of a handicapped person?\n       Eighth. Increased dialog and coordination between private \n     and voluntary groups and Government agencies to avoid \n     multiplicity and duplication.\n       What is at stake is not the agency, group, or program. What \n     is at stake is the future of the handicapped person with his \n     own abilities and potentialities.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       This, then, Mr. President, is the sum and substance of my \n     first speech in the Senate.\n       I know of no more important subject matter, not solely \n     because of my personal interest, but because in our great \n     country some 42 million Americans suffer from a physical,\n\n[[Page S5003]]\n\n     mental, or emotional handicap. Progress has been and will \n     continue to be made by Federal and State governments, by \n     private agencies, and individual Americans; but nonetheless \n     there is still much to be done, if the handicapped American: \n     young, old, black, white, rich, or poor is to share in the \n     joys experienced by others. The task ahead is monumental, but \n     I am confident that there are forces in America ready and \n     willing to meet the challenge--including, of course, many of \n     my distinguished colleagues who by their acts and deeds have \n     demonstrated their great interest.\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. I urge my colleagues to read it, because it is as \ncompelling today at it was 34 years ago. It offers a comprehensive \nanalysis of the challenges facing those with disabilities, and the \nsteps needed to fulfill their dreams of full participation in society. \nThanks to the leadership and perseverance of Bob Dole--and thanks to \nthe work of others like Senator Domenici, Senator Harkin and Senator \nKennedy--the dreams of millions of disabled Americans have become \nreality.\n  Indeed, over the course of the past three decades, Bob Dole's \nfingerprints can be found all over every piece of legislation that \nincreased opportunities for the disabled, including, of course, the \nlandmark Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  Bob has described July 26, 1990--the day President Bush signed the \nADA into law--as one of the most rewarding days of his life. He once \nsaid, ``I suppose there were some that day, who saw only a White House \nlawn covered with wheelchairs and guide dogs. But that just goes to \nshow who in our society is truly limited. My own perspective was very \ndifferent. As I looked around, I saw Americans with amazing gifts, who \ncould finally contribute to a nation much in need of their skills and \ninsights.''\n  Bob's concern for individuals with disabilities was not limited to \nthose within America's borders. His leadership prodded the State \nDepartment to include the status of people with disabilities in its \nannual report on human rights.\n  And since leaving the Senate, he has continued his advocacy on behalf \nof disabled Americans. Bob strongly supported the Ticket to Work and \nWork Incentives Act of 1999, which expanded health coverage for persons \nwith disabilities and created a new employment program through the \nSocial Security Administration.\n  And I can attest to the fact that Bob's devoted leadership to \nassisting disabled Americans in his public life is matched by \nleadership in his private life.\n  In 1983, Bob attended a meeting of the Kansas Bankers Association in \nDodge City. Waiting for him outside the room where two severely \ndisabled young people with their parents. The young man was named Tim, \nand he was in a special wheelchair, unable to move anything except his \neyes. The young woman, Carla, was only slightly more mobile. Both \nwanted to talk to Bob about gaining greater access to a more physically \nindependent lifestyle.\n  Bob stopped to talk and to listen, and as his nervous aides looked at \ntheir watches and suggested he was running behind schedule, he stayed \nand talked and listened some more.\n  On his way back to Washington, Bob kept thinking about Tim and Carla. \nAnd when he arrived at our apartment he immediately told me how moved \nhe was by the meeting. ``I've been meaning for years to start a \nfoundation for the disabled,'' he said, ``and I haven't done it. This \nis the time''\n  In the years that followed, the Dole Foundation would raise over $7 \nmillion to address issues like job training and placement for disabled \nworkers. One of the foundation's grants helped New York City's National \nTheater Workshop for the handicapped teach its members advanced \ncommunication skills. In Kentucky, a grant paved the way for a fast-\nfood restaurant that employs the mentally retarded. Disabled students \nin Seattle were taught campground management skills, thanks to another \nDole Foundation grant. A grant to Goodwill Industries of East Central \nNorth Carolina assisted the setting up of a Bank for people with \ndisabilities--and in Raleigh, NC. A grant to Partnerships in Assisted \nTechnology provided Internet training and support for people with \ndisabilities.\n  The focus of that foundation is now being carried on at the Robert J. \nDole Human Development Center at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. \nAnd the Dole Center for Disabilities and the Law at Washburn University \nin Topeka, KS, is leading the way in the study and analysis of the \nlegal rights of individuals with disabilities.\n  I want to take a moment to give special recognition to two groups in \nNorth Carolina who deserve accolades for working every day to help \nthose facing special challenges.\n  The North Carolina Office on Disability and Health has the noble goal \nof increasing awareness and understanding of the health related needs \nof individuals with disabilities. And the North Carolina Governor's \nAdvocacy Council for Persons with Disabilities is a group that lives \nits motto: ``Every person is entitled to equal protection under the \nlaw.'' Both are changing lives in North Carolina, and I look forward to \nworking with these agencies on issues that impact North Carolians with \ndisabilities.\n  Bob Dole is a man of great modesty, and he is only learning of this \nspeech as I speak. Bob doesn't talk about the number of young people \nwho write to him for inspiration, telling him he is their hero. He \nalways writes back or calls with words of encouragement, and often a \npen-pal relationship develops.\n  One of Bob's former staffers, the very talented Kerry Tymchuk, now \nwith Senator Gordon Smith, has shared with me the story of Whitney \nDuggan. Whitney, a young girl from Oregon, was confined to a wheelchair \ndue to injuries sustained in a horse riding accident. She wrote to Bob \nto express her thanks for his work on behalf of persons with \ndisabilities and to encourage him in his 1996 campaign for the \npresidency. Bob responded, and he and Whitney were soon trading letters \nback and forth. Whitney and her mother eventually made their first \nvisit to Washington, where Bob arranged tours of all the landmarks and \nlunch in the Capitol. Whitney became one of Bob's most loyal campaign \nvolunteers, and sent words of encouragement to him when they were \nneeded most.\n  Two days after the presidential election in November of 1996, Bob \nsaid to Kerry Tymchuk, ``I bet Whitney is feeling pretty low. Let's \ngive her a call.'' And Bob called her up to make sure she wasn't taking \nthe loss too hard. Here was a man who just 48 hours earlier had lost a \nPresidential election. And rather than thinking of himself, he was \nthinking about a young disabled girl in Medford, OR. That is Bob Dole.\n  I know my colleagues will agree with Bob in his belief that, despite \nall that has been accomplished, there is still much to be done. While \nwe have eliminated many of the barriers the eye can see, there are \nstill those we can't see and that no law can remove--barriers created \nby attitudes and misperceptions. Too often we overlook the talents of \npeople with disabilities, whether they are physical or developmental.\n  The remarkable Helen Keller once said, ``One must not consent to \ncreep when one feels an impulse to soar.'' To make further progress, we \nmust insist that ignorance not be tolerated, and we must work to ensure \nthat all Americans have a chance to soar as far, and fly as high, as \ntheir skills and talents will take them.\n  This mission is made all the more important by the ongoing courage \nand sacrifice of the men and women who wear the uniform of our country. \nAs I traveled last week with President Bush to Camp Lejeune, in North \nCarolina, I was reminded of a time when Bob and I were dating, and he \nwas visiting with my parents in Salisbury. Bob appeared one morning in \nthe kitchen as Mother was preparing breakfast, with a towel draped over \nhis right shoulder. ``Mrs. Hanford,'' he told my mother, ``I think you \nought to see my problem.''\n  ``That's not a problem, Bob,'' she told him. ``That's a badge of \nhonor.''\n  As courageous American soldiers return home, some will be doing so \nwith their own ``badge of honor.'' It is our duty to ensure that those \nwho return with a disability have every opportunity to live a full and \nproductive life.\n  It is very fitting that the state motto of Kansas is ``Ad astra per \naspera''--To the stars through difficulties. Quite simply, I can think \nof no American who has done more in his life and career than Bob Dole \nto ensure that individuals with disabilities have the opportunity to \nreach their full potential.\n\n[[Page S5004]]\n\n  In doing so, he has earned more than just the pride and admiration of \na loving wife. He has earned the respect of a grateful nation and the \nenduring thanks of millions of individuals he will never meet, but \nwhose lives are better and richer and more productive because of him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Madam President, later today the Senate will take up a \nbill that the House has acted upon; that is, the Clean Diamond Act of \n2003. There are many tragedies in this world, a lot of suffering. This \nbill deals with one of these problems. There are many atrocities that \nare occurring.\n  One area of the world where such atrocities are occurring on a daily \nbasis is in Sierra Leone, Africa. For at least a decade, Sierra Leone, \none of the world's poorest nations, has been embroiled in a civil war. \nRebel groups--most notably, the Revolutionary United Front--RUF--have \nbeen fighting for years to overthrow the recognized government. In the \nprocess, violence has erupted as the rebels have fought to seize \ncontrol of the country's profitable diamond fields which, in turn, \nhelps finance their terrorist regime.\n  Once in control of a diamond field, the rebels confiscate the \ndiamonds and then launder them onto the very legitimate market through \nother nearby nations, such as Liberia. We refer to these as \n``conflict'' or ``blood'' diamonds. These gems are a very lucrative \nbusiness for the rebel groups. In fact, over the past decade, the \nrebels have smuggled out of Africa, we estimate, approximately $10 \nbillion in these diamonds.\n  It is nearly impossible, of course, to distinguish the illegally \ngathered diamonds from legitimate or ``clean'' stones. And so, Members \nof the Senate, regrettably and unwittingly, the United States--as the \nworld's biggest buyer of diamonds--has contributed to the violence. Our \nNation accounted for more than half of the $57.5 billion in the global \nretail diamond trade last year, and some estimates suggest that illegal \ndiamonds from Africa account for as much as 15 percent of the overall \ndiamond trade.\n  Since the start of the rebel's quest for control of Sierra Leone's \ndiamond supply, half of the nation's population of 4.5 million have \nleft their homes, and at least a half million have fled the country. \nBut it is the children, as it usually is--it is the children--of Sierra \nLeone who are bearing the biggest brunt of the rebel insurgency. For \nover 8 years, the RUF has conscripted children--children often as young \nas 7 or 8 years old--to be soldiers in this makeshift army. They have \nripped at least 12,000 children from their own families.\n  As a result of deliberate and systematic brutalization, child \nsoldiers have become some of the most vicious--and effective--fighters \nwithin the rebel factions. The rebel army--child-soldiers included--has \nterrorized Sierra Leone's population--killing, abducting, raping, and \nhacking off the limbs of victims with their machetes. This chopping off \nof limbs is the RUF's trademark strategy. In Freetown, the surgeons are \nfrantic. Scores of men, women, and children--their hands partly chopped \noff--have flooded the main hospital. Amputating as quickly as they can, \ndoctors toss severed hands into a communal bucket.\n  The RUF frequently and forcibly injects the children with cocaine in \npreparation for battle. This is a picture of a little girl who, \nobviously, has had her arm amputated.\n  In many cases, the rebels force the child-soldiers at gunpoint to \nkill their own family members or neighbors and friends. Not only are \nthese children traumatized by what they are forced to do, they also are \nafraid to be reunited with their own families because of the \npossibility of retribution.\n  Madam President and members of the Senate, I cannot understate nor \ncan I fully describe the horrific abuses these children are suffering. \nThe most vivid accounts come from the child-soldiers themselves. I \nwould like to read a few of their stories--their own stories--taken \nfrom Amnesty International's 1998 report entitled: ``Sierra Leone--A \nYear of Atrocities against Civilians.'' According to one child's \nrecollection:\n\n       Civilians were rounded up, in groups or in lines, and then \n     taken individually to a pounding block in the village where \n     their hands, arms, or legs were cut with a machete. In some \n     villages, after the civilians were rounded up, they were \n     stripped naked. Men were then ordered to rape members of \n     their own family. If they refused, their arms were cut off \n     and the women were raped by rebel forces, often in front of \n     their husbands . . . victims of these atrocities also \n     reported women and children being rounded up and locked into \n     houses which were then set [on fire].\n\n  A young man from Lunsar, describing a rebel attack, said this:\n\n       Ten people were captured by the rebels and they asked us to \n     form a [line]. My brother was removed from the [line], and \n     they killed him with a rifle, and they cut his head with a \n     knife. After this, they killed his pregnant wife. There was \n     an argument among the rebels about the sex of the baby she \n     was carrying, so they decided to open her stomach to see the \n     baby.\n\n  According to Komba, a teenager:\n\n       My legs were cut with blades and cocaine was rubbed in the \n     wounds. Afterwards, I felt like a big person. I saw the other \n     people like chickens and rats. I wanted to kill them.\n\n  Rape, sexual slavery, and other forms of sexual abuse of girls and \nwomen have been systematic, organized, and widespread. Many of those \nabducted have been forced to become the ``wives'' of combatants.\n  According to Isatu, an abducted teenage girl:\n\n       I did not want to go; I was forced to go. They killed a lot \n     of women who refused to go with them.\n\n  She was forced to become the sexual partner of the combatant who \ncaptured her and is now the mother of their 3-month-old baby:\n\n       When they capture young girls, you belong to the soldier \n     who captured you. I was ``married'' to him.\n\n  Look at how some of these children have depicted themselves, the \nviolence and bloodshed in their own drawings. That is how they depict \nit. Children strike at the heart of what they see and, more \nimportantly, what they feel.\n  We are losing these children, an entire generation of children, if \nthe situation is not improved. These kids have no future. But as long \nas the rebel diamond trade remains unchallenged, nothing really will \nchange at all. That is why. I have been working with Senator Durbin, \nSenator Feingold, Senator Gregg, and so many others in the Senate and \nthe other body for over 2 years to pass legislation that would help \nstem this illegal trade in conflict diamonds. I thank Senator Grassley \nfor his good work. Together we have worked extensively with our House \ncolleagues, including my good friend and former colleague from Ohio, \nformer Congressman Tony Hall. We have also worked with a champion in \nthis area, my good friend, Frank Wolf from Virginia.\n  We have worked to develop much needed legislation to help remove the\n\n[[Page S5005]]\n\nrebel's market incentive because that is what you have to do is to get \nrid of the incentive. While we have not yet been successful in getting \nthis legislation signed into law--not yet--I credit my colleagues' \ncontinued commitment to this often forgotten issue. I know our \ncountless congressional hearings and meetings, letters, and legislative \ninitiatives have encouraged the administration and the international \ncommunity to keep this issue alive. I thank those in the administration \nwho have kept the issue going and worked so very hard. We have kept the \npressure on. We are beginning to see very positive results.\n  Just this past January, an international agreement called the \nKimberley Process Certification Scheme was launched. Specifically, this \nis a voluntary international diamond certification system among over 50 \nparticipating countries, including all of the major diamond producing \nand trading countries. This is a positive step. I commend the tireless \nwork of human rights advocates and the diamond industry for making this \ncertification system a reality.\n  Because of their success, today we are faced with the urgent need of \nproviding legislative measures to enable effective U.S. implementation \nof the certification scheme. We need to provide the administration with \nthe authorization necessary to ensure U.S. compliance with this global \nregulatory framework. This is why last week I joined with my \ndistinguished colleagues and my friends--Senator Grassley, Senator \nDurbin, Senator Feingold, Senator Baucus, Senator Bingaman, Senator \nGregg, and several additional cosponsors--to introduce the Clean \nDiamond Act, legislation that commits the United States to mandatory \nimplementation of the Kimberley Process Certification. This legislation \nis similar to a measure passed just last night in the House of \nRepresentatives, H.R. 1584. I am optimistic we can pass this \nlegislation in the Senate very shortly, possibly even as early as \ntoday.\n  The whole idea behind this is to commit the United States to a system \nof controls on the export and import of diamonds so that buyers can be \ncertain their purchases are not fueling the rebel campaign.\n  I know there is not one person in this country who goes in and buys a \ndiamond with the intention to fuel a rebel campaign. No one wants to do \nthat. This is a way we can ensure buyers they are not doing that.\n  Specifically, our legislation would prohibit the import of any rough \ndiamond that has not been controlled through the Kimberley Process \nCertification Scheme. Put simply, this means every diamond brought into \nthe United States would require a certificate of origin and \nauthenticity to indicate the rebel or terrorist group has not laundered \nit on to the legitimate market.\n\n  Additionally, the bill calls on the President to report annually to \nthe U.S. Congress on the control system's effectiveness and also \nrequires the General Accounting Office to report on the law's \neffectiveness within 2 years of enactment.\n  Finally, our bill emphasizes the Kimberley Process Certification \nScheme is an ongoing process and that our Government should continue to \nwork with the international community to strengthen the effectiveness \nof this global regulatory framework. As the world's biggest diamond \ncustomer, biggest consumer, purchasing well over half of all the \ndiamonds purchased in the world, our Nation has a moral responsibility \nto show continued leadership on this issue. Quite candidly, there are a \nlot of terrible, tragic things going on we don't have the power to \nchange or fix or have much impact on at all, but today in the Senate we \ncan have impact on this issue. We can make a difference. We have the \npower to help put an end to this indescribable suffering and violence \ncaused by diamond-related conflicts. We have that power, and we must \nuse it.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this much needed \nlegislation. We have a moral obligation to help stop the violence, help \nstop the brutality, and help stop the needless killing and the maiming \ngoing on, to help stop the victimization of these children.\n  No other child should kill or be killed in diamond-related conflicts. \nI believe it is absolutely imperative that we pass the bill we have \nintroduced and pass it quickly to help end these atrocities once and \nfor all. It certainly is the humane thing to do. It is the right thing \nto do. It is the only thing to do.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when I pick up the newspaper, turn on the \nradio, or watch television, almost all of the media's attention is, \nunderstandably, focused on the war in Iraq. As a result, some important \nissues in other parts of the world are being overlooked or unreported. \nI want to call attention to some good news that has received very \nlittle attention: Congress has made some much needed progress on the \nvery important issue of conflict diamonds.\n  The role of diamonds in fueling brutal conflicts in Africa and \nfunding terrorism is well documented, so I will not take much time \nrecounting this history. Suffice it to say, that it is a critical \nproblem and deserves serious attention and resources from Congress, the \nBush Administration, and the international community.\n  It is also well known that the diamond industry, key nongovernmental \norganizations (NGOs), and a number of governments came together to \ncreate an international regime aimed at stopping the trade in conflict \ndiamonds, called the Kimberley Process. In January 2002, the process \nwas launched and now the individual countries involved need to pass \nimplementing legislation.\n  It is important that the Congress pass legislation before the next \nKimberley Process Plenary Meeting on April 28, 2003, to ensure that the \nUnited States continues to play a leadership role on this issue.\n  However, the timing of the bill should not be the only factor. The \nlegislation needs to reflect not just the wishes of the administration \nbut also the views of a bipartisan group of Senators, including \nSenators Durbin, DeWine, Feingold, Gregg, and Bingaman, who have been \nworking on this issue for years. The bill must also incorporate input \nfrom a wide range of NGOs, from Oxfam to Catholic Relief Services, that \nhave dealt first-hand with the devastating consequences of conflict \ndiamonds.\n  S. 760, the Clean Diamonds Trade Act, does just that. I rise today to \nsupport this legislation. And assuming that a word in the section \nconcerning the Kimberley Process Implementation Coordinating Committee \nis changed, I also support the House companion, H.R. 1584, which is \nvirtually identical to S. 760.\n\n  I commend Senators Grassley and Baucus for producing a solid, \nbipartisan bill to implement the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme \n(KPCS), an international system designed to ensure that rough diamonds \nentering the United States are legally mined and traded.\n  When we began drafting this bill several months ago, the \nadministration's proposed legislation was little more than hortatory. \nIt was filled with permissive authorities that would have required the \nadministration to do virtually nothing. It essentially said: ``Thanks, \nbut we'll take care of the problem by ourselves.''\n  Through a consultative, bipartisan process, Senators Grassley and \nBaucus worked with interested Senators, the NGO community, and the \ndiamond industry to shape the administration's proposal into meaningful \nlegislation that contains a number of important provisions.\n  For example, the bill contains a prohibition of the importation of \nrough diamonds; requires Government oversight of the U.S. Kimberley \nProcess Authority--the industry body responsible for issuing \ncertificates for U.S. rough diamond exports; and includes reporting \nrequirements that can be used to gauge the effectiveness of the system \nand monitor attempts to circumvent it. In the administration's original \nproposal, these provisions either did not exist or were seriously \nwatered-down.\n  While S. 760 is a good bill and is one that I am pleased to \ncosponsor, there is room for improvement.\n  There is nothing in this legislation that deals with polished stones. \nAs a result, if an exporter were to make just one ``cut'' to a diamond \nit would be exempt from KPCS and the implementing legislation. I also \nthink improvements can be made to the criminal penalties\n\n[[Page S5006]]\n\nlanguage, the provision on statistics collection, and a handful of \nother sections.\n  But we all know that no bill is perfect and no Senator gets \neverything he or she wants in a broad, bipartisan bill. I mention these \nshortcomings, not to criticize the efforts of the authors of the bill, \nbut rather for two important reasons.\n\n  First, the shortcomings in the S. 760, as well as the KPCS itself, \nhighlight the fact that Kimberley is an ongoing process and that \nadditional regulations, legislation, and other measures will be \nnecessary in the future. I am very pleased that Senators Grassley and \nBaucus have included a sense of Congress in S. 760 that says just that.\n  Second, because the legislation gives the administration a good deal \nof flexibility, it is imperative that the State Department, Treasury \nDepartment, and other agencies follow through and implement the KPCS in \nan effective and timely manner. I can assure you that those of us who \nare co-sponsors of this legislation will be working to ensure this \nhappens.\n  As I have said with countless other pieces of legislation, you can \nhave the best bill in the world, but it is not worth a whole lot if \nCongress and the administration do not put the resources behind it.\n  I applaud the authors of the bill for including a Section in the bill \nthat authorizes the President to provide technical assistance to \ndeveloping nations seeking to implement the KPCS. But, it is up to the \nAppropriations Committee to make sure this initiative is funded.\n  As ranking member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I included \na provision in the fiscal year 2003 bill that appropriated $2 million \nfor this purpose. However, I have been informed that it is unclear if \nthe State Department plans on utilizing these funds for their intended \npurpose, and that the Department might transfer it to other programs.\n  This would be a big mistake. In order to effectively implement \nKimberley, extremely poor nations, where diamonds are mined, will have \nto set up viable export-control and law enforcement systems. Many of \nthese nations simply do not have enough resources to do this.\n  Because of the links between conflict diamonds and terrorism, as well \nas human rights and humanitarian concerns, it is important that the \nUnited States provide technical assistance in order to have the most \neffective system possible. If providing a small amount of funding helps \nstrengthen the KPCS, we should do it.\n\n  Some in the administration might ask how one would go about \nimplementing such a program.\n  Those who ask those questions need to look no further than two \nprograms that the U.S. Government has implemented in the past.\n  The United States Agency for International Development supported a \nsuccessful program in Sierra Leone to improve controls associated with \nthe mining and export of diamonds. In addition, the United States \nprovides technical assistance to nations to implement the World Trade \nOrganization agreement. I am confident that these two programs can \nprovide a model for the use of these funds.\n  Americans buy 65 to 70 percent of the world's diamonds, including \nrough diamonds, polished stones and jewelry containing diamonds. It is \nup to the United States to provide leadership on this very important \nissue. Without us, the world will not make the kind of progress it \nneeds to on this and other human rights related matters.\n  This should not be hard for us to do. It is in our security \ninterests. It is in our humanitarian interests. It is in our economic \ninterests.\n  With the passage of the Clean Diamonds Trade Act, Congress will take \nan important step forward. There is much more work that needs to be \ndone, but I am confident that it can be done.\n  In closing, I would like to thank some of those involved with this \neffort, including Everett Eissenstat and Carrie Clark of Senator \nGrassley's staff, Shara Aranoff of Senator Baucus' staff, Randy \nSoderquist of Senator Bingaman's staff, Laura Parker of Senator \nDeWine's staff, and last but certainly not least Cara Thanassi of Oxfam \nAmerica. Without the help of these individuals, this bill would not \nhave made it to first base. I thank them for their hard work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/09/senate-section/article/S5006-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5006-S5007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EMERALD ASH BORER\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, over the past 450 years, more than 6,500 \nnon-indigenous invasive species have been introduced into the United \nStates and have become established, self-sustaining populations. These \nspecies--from microorganisms to mollusks, from pathogens to plants, \nfrom insects to fish--typically encounter few, if any, natural enemies \nin their new environments, and as a result they can wreak havoc on \nnative species. Invasive species threaten to biological diversity. Some \nexperts consider invasive species and the ecological damage they cause \nto be a greater environmental threat worldwide than chemical \npollutants. Estimates of the annual economic damage caused nationwide \nby these species go as high as $137 billion.\n  In my home State of Michigan, there is a disaster unfolding which \ncould dramatically increase this cost. For the past few years, \nscientists have been concerned with the unusually high number of dead \nand dying Ash trees in the metro-Detroit area. Late last summer, \nscientists determined that the problem is caused by a beetle which came \ninto the country from Asia: the Emerald Ash Borer. This beetle is \nindigenous to Asia and has been found in China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, \nMongolia and Eastern Russia.\n  Like other invasive species, the Emerald Ash Borer is destroying \nnative species. While scientists believe that the insect came into the \ncountry as little as five years ago, it has already left millions of \ntrees in the Detroit area dead or dying. Since there is no economically \nfeasible manner to treat trees, there is concern that all of the Ash \ntrees in the Detroit area will be dead within 5 years.\n  In order to stop the spread of the Ash Borer, last summer the \nMichigan Department of Agriculture imposed a quarantine to stop Ash \ntrees, logs and firewood as well as Ash tree nursery stock from being \nremoved from Wayne, Oakland, Macomb, Washtenaw or Livingston countries \nin Southeastern Michigan. Later in the fall, Monroe country was added. \nThe Michigan Department of Agriculture is currently working with the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture on the creation of a program to \npotentially eradicate the Emerald Ash Borer, yet funds from USDA, for a \ncomprehensive effort, have yet to be provided.\n\n  The presence of this beetle has been allegedly reported in other \nparts of Michigan, and the beetle has recently been positively \nidentified in Toledo, Ohio and Windsor, Ontario. Ohio, Indiana and the \nProvince of Ontario, Canada, are very concerned about the spread of \nthis pest, and the web-sites of their respective Departments of \nAgriculture have contained warnings about the beetle. Now, with the \npresence of the beetle in Toledo and Windsor, those fears have \nincreased.\n  One proposal for stopping the spread of the Emerald Ash Borer would \nbe to create a ``fire break'' by removing trees in a ring around the \naffected area. Since scientists believe that this beetle can only fly \nthree miles, such an approach, which is already underway in the area \nsurrounding Windsor, Canada, could be successful. However, doing so \nwould be expensive and money is desperately needed not only for beetle \neradication and tree removal but also for research.\n  While the effects of the Ash Borer on Southeast Michigan have already \nbeen devastating, the potential results of the beetle's spreading could \nbe catastrophic. As one of the most popular urban trees, Ash trees are \nfound across much of the country. This invasive pest has the potential \nto be as destructive as the historic Dutch Elm Disease. The sad irony \nis that Ash trees were planted in place of many of the Elm trees that \nour State and Nation lost years ago. Should the Ash Borer spread \ncontinue, the Forest Service estimates that the potential impact could \naffect ``up to 2 percent of total leaf area and could impose a value \nloss between $20-60 billion.'' This number is arrived at without \nincluding the cost of replanting deforested areas.\n  This devastation has already crossed state borders and will cross \nmore unless dealt with. State and local governments cannot be expected \nto deal with\n\n[[Page S5007]]\n\nit. They also face budget shortfalls that are necessitating drastic \ncuts in basic services because of declining revenue, increasing demands \nand extensive budget constraints. They are having trouble funding \nexisting obligations to schools and police forces even without having \nto pay to address the new multi-State threat posed by the Emerald Ash \nBorer. I have received letters from cities in Michigan, civic \norganizations and from the Southeast Michigan Council of Government, or \nSEMCOG, which represents 151 local governments in the region all asking \nthat the Federal Government take an active role in stopping the spread \nof the Emerald Ash Borer. Without such active and timely support, \ncoordination and funding from USDA, it is unlikely that this problem \ncan be adequately addressed.\n\n  SEMCOG has stated that ``the Emerald Ash Borer is decimating the Ash \ntree population in a 2000 square mile core area within the counties of \nWayne, Oakland, Macomb, Livingston and Washtenaw.'' Michigan State \nSenator Raymond Basham and State Representative Glenn Anderson have \nwritten to me about this problem. In his letter to me, Representative \nAnderson said that ``Michigan is facing another round of budget cuts at \nthe local levels and local communities simply will not be able to \nafford the added burden of removing and replacing these trees.'' Adding \nto this burden is the fact that local governments are required to \nremove these trees from rights of ways and government properties \nbecause dead trees create significant public health risks and liability \nissues for property and personal damage.\n  Governor Granholm has worked hard to support cooperative efforts that \nare underway between the State of Michigan and United States \nDepartments of Agriculture. In meetings with her, she has said that \nUSDA funding is essential to address this problem.\n  If the spread of the Emerald Ash Borer is not arrested, it will cost \nbillions of dollars to pay for the removal of dead Ash trees and the \nreplanting of new trees. The costs associated with the loss of the Ash \ntree are not merely financial in nature. Habitat will be destroyed, \nscenic vistas will be denuded and residential streets that were once \ntree-lined will no longer have needed shade.\n  It is critical that we address the Emerald Ash Borer before it is \nable to spread across a greater area. It is essential that the United \nStates Department of Agriculture complete its efforts to provide much-\nneeded emergency funding to address the Emerald Ash Borer. The Michigan \ndelegation has written twice to Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman about \nthis matter. In these letters, the Michigan delegation has stated that \nwithout ``swift and sure action, the entire ash tree population will be \nlost. To avoid this tragedy, we asked that USDA provide funds to \n``determine the problem's extent,'' and ``for combating and eradicating \nthis invasive species.''\n  It is imperative that the USDA provide $17 million in Fiscal Year \n2003 emergency funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation to combat \nthe Emerald Ash Borer and that the Office of Management and Budget \napprove these funds as expeditiously as possible. Additionally, USDA \nshould provide research monies that would enable USDA's Animal Plant \nHealth Inspection Service and the Forest Service's North Central \nResearch Station to work with Michigan State University, Michigan \nTechnological University and other world-class schools of forestry to \nfund vital research into this problem. The beetle's larvae hatch in the \nSpring, and while it may not be possible to kill this year's hatch of \nbeetles, time remains of the esssence if the Emerald Ash Borer is to be \neradicated. Addressing the matter now will be costly, but delays in \naddressing the matter will only increase the costs and diminish the \nlikelihood of success.\n  The Emerald Ash Borer's spread can be halted, but action must be \ntaken quickly. It is for that reason that I urge Secretary Veneman to \nimmediately provide the emergency and research funds that will be a \nvital component of any effort to address the problems created by this \npersistent pest.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to speak on the CARE Act. I \napplaud my colleagues, Senators Santorum, Lieberman, Grassley, and \nBaucus, for bringing this bipartisan bill to the Senate floor.\n  The CARE Act comes none too soon. Charities across America are indeed \nfacing tough and challenging times. A sluggish economy, which we all \nfeel in our communities, is hampering in many ways their ability to \nsecure funds to operate. This bill, which we will pass shortly, will \nhelp change that. It is not a total solution but will help move in the \ndirection to change that.\n  I take a moment and ask the question, Why are we doing this bill? \nThis bill is about recognizing that Washington does not have all of the \nanswers; that we in this body do not have all of the answers; that our \nGovernment does not have all of the answers to America's problems. But \nAmerica, her people, and her spirit, all throughout this land do have \nthe answers.\n  Some in Washington, on the right and on the left, prefer to address \nsocial problems with legislative solutions. But many of our Nation's \nproblems simply do not reduce themselves to a solution that can be \ndevised in the U.S. Congress, in the legislature itself. What they need \nare neighborhood solutions, solutions that begin to address problems \nthat are identified in local communities, that are addressed locally, \nthat are addressed by communities and neighborhoods, solutions that are \nnot delivered by a form letter from a government bureaucrat, but from \nthe hand of somebody in that neighborhood--a local neighborhood, \nsomeone who really cares, who understands the problem locally.\n  I am thinking of a wonderful charity down the street from here. For \n20 years the volunteers of the Neighborhood Learning Center at the \ncorner of 9th and Maryland have been tutoring at-risk children. They do \nso without fanfare, without a lot of publicity, without Federal funds. \nThey are faith-based and their service is motivated by their love of \nGod. They are making a difference--yes, one child at a time.\n  I think of LeSharon, who herself was tutored when she was a girl from \na broken family. A few years later, LeSharon was back at the center but \nthis time as a college graduate and one of their instructors. That is \nexciting. Or I think of the Room in the Inn program in my hometown of \nNashville, TN. Over 125 congregations provide nightly housing for \nhomeless adults and children. This is a tangible and compassionate \nresponse to human need.\n  These charities, like the Neighborhood Learning Center, like the Room \nin the Inn program, are only small rays of light in our American \nlandscape. Their service is only part of what makes us a strong and a \nvibrant Nation. Almost 200 years ago Alexis de Tocqueville warned: The \nmorals and intelligence of a democratic people would be in as much \ndanger as its commerce and industry if ever a government wholly usurped \nthe place of private associations.\n  What de Tocqueville understood was that the house of a democratic \nnation does not stand by just government. A healthy nation needs \nvigorous private associations, charities, and civic clubs all coming \ntogether. The CARE Act recognizes this vital fact. That is why it helps \nto foster private charity in our Nation. It encourages more charitable \ngiving--of money, of food, of art, or securities. It provides \nincentives for low-income people to begin saving for a house, a \nbusiness, or education. And it\n\n[[Page S5008]]\n\nhelps small charities learn how to access Federal grants to further \ntheir work.\n  Some might suggest America's problems are much bigger than what the \nCARE Act can handle, that they demand larger and grander solutions. But \nI respond that America's problems--problems like malnourishment, \nilliteracy, domestic violence, broken families, teen pregnancies--are \nproblems that are too big for Government to fix. Some problems are so \nlarge that all the money in the world simply will not fix them. So many \nof these problems are rooted in the soul and Government cannot fix \nproblems of the soul. But people can. And God can.\n\n  This bill empowers people, real people rooted in their communities, \nrooted in their churches, rooted in their synagogues, rooted in their \nmosques, to help, to reach out to their neighbors. And that kind of \nhelp is the type of help that changes hearts.\n  It is hard to feel loved when you are getting a handout from a \ngovernment bureaucrat. But receiving a cold cup of water from a \nvolunteer touches your heart, it changes you, and it changes the person \ngiving that help, as well. For years I have had the wonderful \nopportunity, indeed the real privilege, of being able to travel to \nAfrica to conduct and participate in medical missions. When I go to \nAfrica, I don't go as a Senator. I go there as a physician, as a person \nof faith, as a neighbor, as a friend, as a person who cares about \nothers throughout the world. Those trips have changed me as much, I \npromise, as they have changed any of the people I have helped.\n  My hope, today, is that we help invigorate what Edmund Burke called \nthose ``little platoons,'' those private associations that help us love \nour country, our fellow human beings. We need to strengthen the quiet \nbut profound work of the little platoons of nonprofit agencies, of \ngroups like the Neighborhood Learning Center, the Church of the \nBrethren Soup Kitchen, or the Room in the Inn. And when we strengthen \nthem, we strengthen America.\n  Will the CARE Act cure all our problems? No. Sadly, no, of course \nnot. But it will help us to help ourselves help others. Let's get this \ngood bill moving to the President's desk. It will form a strong part of \nhis faith-based initiative. I know the House is committed to moving \nquickly on a companion bill. I hope we can continue to work together \nacross party lines to empower America's charities and to empower people \nthroughout the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/09/senate-section/article/S5008-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5008-S5044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CARE ACT OF 2003\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 476, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The bill (S. 476) to provide incentives for charitable \n     contributions by individuals and businesses, to improve the \n     public disclosure of activities of exempt organizations, and \n     to enhance the ability of low-income Americans to gain \n     financial security by building assets, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Grassley/Baucus Amendment No. 526, to provide a manager's \n     amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order there will now be 30 \nminutes equally divided for general debate.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, the amendment by Senator Nickles is in \norder, is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Senator Nickles will offer his amendment in just a \nminute. He asked if I would do my speaking on that amendment at this \npoint. I am very happy to do that.\n  I appreciate my friend's continued efforts to reform and reduce long \nterm capital gain tax on real estate. And Senator Nickles is correct--\nby excluding 25 percent of the capital gain on the sale of property we \nreduce the effective capital gain rate on sales for conservation \npurposes.\n  However, that is not the purpose of the provision. We intend to \npreserve precious, environmentally sensitive land from ever being \ndeveloped. I need not remind my fellow Senators that they are not \nmaking any more land and if we do not preserve sensitive wetlands and \nopen space from development it will be lost forever and all of our \nchildren and grandchildren will suffer from our lack of responsibility.\n  Senator Nickles' amendment would literally make it easier to develop \nthe very land we are attempting to preserve. That is certainly not the \nintent of this provision. I will be voting no and I strongly urge my \nfellow Senators to also vote no on Senator Nickles' amendment.\n  I would like to take a few minutes to review the long history of this \nimportant provision. As you all know, the President's budget has \nincluded this proposal. In all of his budgets, in fact, the President \nactually continues to propose the exclusion of 50 percent of the \ncapital gain for the sale of property for conservation purposes. So by \ncomparison, this 25 percent proposal is modest, but still addresses the \nPresident's priorities.\n  In addition, the Senate Finance Committee has a long history of \nbuilding support. In both the 106th and 107th Congresses, we held \nhearings specifically discussing this proposal. We had witnesses from \nthe forests of Maine to the wetlands of Louisiana and the ranches of \nArizona. Besides, this effort brings about bipartisan support for the \nissue.\n  Not only have we heard huge support for this provision from all the \ntraditional conservation organizations, like the Nature Conservancy and \nthe Land Trusts and Iowa's own Heritage Foundation, but I know both I \nand Senator Baucus continue to receive very vocal support from the \nfarmers and ranchers who populate our States. Both the Farm Bureau and \nthe Cattleman's Association have let us know that this gives our \ncitizens choices to stay on the land and yet preserve the open space.\n  The opportunity to give an easement, preserve our farm and ranch \nlifestyles and give up the right to ever develop the land is important \npublic policy and I urge my fellow Senators to vote no on Senator \nNickles' amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I think it is important at the outset to \nknow we are including in the CARE bill incentives to help provide \ncharitable contributions for good voluntary purposes, and I think this \nbill should continue to honor that thrust. The amendment before us does \nnot. The amendment before us essentially is a capital gains tax \namendment and applies generally to all property that would be sold. I \nthink this is not the place for that kind of amendment.\n  The underlying provisions of the bill provide that taxpayers who \nvoluntarily sell land to a qualified conservation organization can \nexclude 25 percent of the gain on that sale from capital gains tax. The \npurpose, obviously, is to help people, most of whom are land rich and \ncash poor and do not have much income from their ranching or farm \noperations--to help by transferring the property to a conservation \norganization.\n  There are many organizations in this country--a lot in my State of \nMontana--such as the Nature Conservancy, lots of very good, solid \norganizations which take land and save it for conservation purposes. \nThis is very important because our country is losing a lot of land to \ndevelopment each day, each year. In fact, in the United States about 2 \nacres of farmland per minute, or about 1 million per year, are lost to \ndevelopment; that is, shopping centers and new homes or what-not that \nare just taking away some of the natural land that we have in our \ncountry and converting it at a very rapid rate to shopping centers and \ndevelopments.\n  That is part of America. We need to build shopping centers. We need \nto also build new homes, housing tracts, and so forth. But we also need \nto remember there are other values in our country, and those are \nprotecting open space and protecting farms and ranches. A lot of our \nfarms and ranches are under great stress. I know the Presiding Officer \nknows that is true in her home State as is the case in every State.\n  We are trying to figure out a balanced way to help those farmers and \nranchers donate a portion of their land to a conservation organization. \nThey cannot do that today because they have no income. Because they \nhave no income, they can't take the usual charitable deduction. To help \nthem, we are saying you don't have to worry about the charitable \ndeduction; you can still\n\n[[Page S5009]]\n\nget a little bit of benefit because we will exclude 25 percent of the \ngain. It is extremely important.\n  I might point out, this is actually a little less generous than \nprovisions suggested by the President. The President, in his budget, \nsuggested an appreciably larger exclusion for this very purpose.\n  The amendment before us, though, is not geared at all toward \nconservation. Essentially, it provides the same benefit, a 25-percent \nexclusion that would be available to anyone who sells property for any \npurpose. It does not have to be conservation. It would be pretty \nexpensive, I might add, too--about a $1.4 billion additional cost to \nthe Treasury.\n  I understand the concerns the Senator has, but this is just not the \ntime or place for capital gains tax reform. This is, rather, a CARE \nbill, a bill that is encouraging conservation, encouraging charitable \ngiving. I urge my colleagues to not accept the amendment because I do \nnot think it is properly placed in this bill.\n  I reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I compliment both my colleagues from Iowa and Montana \nfor bringing up this bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 527\n\n (Purpose: To exclude 25 percent of gain on sales or exchanges of land \n or water interests to any nonprofit entity for any charitable purpose)\n\n  Madam President, this bill has a lot of good provisions in it. It has \ntwo provisions of which I question the value. I decided to do one \namendment.\n  One of the ones I question is, how much good does the above-line \ndeduction do? If you are an individual, you have to donate $500, and \nyou get a $250 deduction. So if you are in the 25-percent tax bracket, \nthat means you get to save $62. And we add a lot of complexity to the \nTax Code in the process. So I question the value of that.\n  There are several other provisions in the bill that are good--\ndonations from IRAs to charities. The purpose of the bill is to \nincrease donations to charities. I compliment the thrust of that. I \ncompliment the President for trying to enact it.\n  I am disappointed this bill does not do more for allowing charitable \nand/or religious groups to be eligible to participate in Federal \nprograms. That is not in the bill. I am not faulting anybody. I \ncompliment Senator Santorum because he worked tirelessly to get this \nbill forward. And I, as a legislator, am willing to take half a loaf.\n  I think the Senator from Pennsylvania has about half of his original \nbill. I compliment him. He has been tenacious. I also compliment my \ncolleague, Senator Lieberman, because he is a cosponsor of the bill. I \nworked with him on other legislation, including the religious liberty, \nfreedom bill that we cosponsored some time ago.\n  One of the provisions I am trying to amend right now is a provision \nthat says you will have a 25-percent reduction in capital gains tax if \nyou sell property for land conservation or sell to an organization that \nqualifies for land conservation. I question the wisdom of doing that. I \nsay, if we are going to have a 25-percent reduction in capital gains \ntax for charitable purposes, make it for all charities.\n  I happen to be a big fan of Nature Conservancy. They have a big \nfacility in my State, with a lot of land, a big buffalo farm or ranch. \nI helped create that. The Nature Conservancy gets support from lots of \ncorporations all across the country and my State as well. I support \nthat.\n  But what I question is, if we want to help charities, let's help all \ncharities, so if people want to sell land to the Red Cross, they would \nget a 25-percent reduction as well, or if they want to sell land to a \nchurch--and the church may want to build a parking lot or build a \nbigger church on that land--let's give them the 25-percent reduction.\n  Why should we say: Well, you are going to get a lower tax rate only \nif you sell to the charity we choose. That is land conservation? I \nquestion the wisdom of that. I do not like trying to micromanage, in \nthe Tax Code, how people are going to spend their money.\n  So I would encourage our colleagues, let's help all charities. I do \nnot think you can defend saying: Well, I think it is fine to donate \nland to the Nature Conservancy or to the Sierra Club or to the Land \nTrust Alliance or a lot of little groups that are going to be created \nas a result of this--you don't donate the land; you sell the land--you \ncan donate your land to anybody in the country--but if you want to sell \nyour land, you can sell it to this group, and you are going to get a \n25-percent reduction in your capital gains tax. So we would rather give \nyou that if you sell it to the Nature Conservancy but not sell it to \nthe First Baptist Church in rural Iowa. To me, that does not make \nsense. Or if you want to help the Red Cross--and the Red Cross has a \nnice facility in Oklahoma, thanks to the Presiding Officer--and they \nneed land, and if a farmer wants to sell that land--they could not \nafford to donate it, but they wanted to sell it--why would we say: You \ncan only sell it for land conservation, and we will give you a 25-\npercent reduction in your tax bill. But if you want to sell it to the \nRed Cross, or if you want to sell it to a church, or if you want to \nsell it to a children's hospital, no, we are sorry, you are out of \nluck. Congress decided that charity does not deserve the same tax \nbenefits as land conservation.\n\n  I disagree. I say, if we are going to give a lower capital gains tax \nrate, and this would be 15 percent--frankly, I think we should do it \nfor all Americans, but if we are going to do it for one charity or two \nor three charities, let's do it for all charities.\n  So that is the essence of my amendment. If we are going to have a \nlower capital gains tax rate on some charities, let's make it available \nfor all charities.\n  We have offsets in this amendment. It does not increase the deficit. \nI urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, is the amendment pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I apologize. I send the amendment to \nthe desk and thank my colleagues for their cooperation. I thought the \namendment was pending. I apologize to my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This began as an attempt to give support to faith-\nbased groups to perform good works.\n\n\n                 Congratulating the UConn Women Huskies\n\n  If I may use that as a segue for a seemingly unrelated comment, I \nwant to express this morning the pride and exultation of the people of \nConnecticut whose faith in our UConn Women Huskies was vindicated last \nnight as they achieved an extraordinary victory over a very tough and \nproud Tennessee team. The UConn Women won another national championship \nfor the UConn Women Huskies, the fourth in the program's history.\n  My congratulations to Coach Geno Auriemma, Assistant Coach Chris \nDailey, and the great UConn women who rebuilt a lot of young talent \nthat came together and made us all proud. They set an extraordinary \nexample for young women all over America who, like my 15-year-old \ndaughter, love basketball, love to play it, and are inspired by the \nskill and grit and team spirit of the UConn Women Huskies.\n  So our faith was redeemed, and you give us faith, Lady Huskies, as we \ngo on.\n  Returning to the CARE Act, I must say that I am proud and, in some \nsenses, relieved to join my colleagues in supporting this act. This act \nis a compromise version of the initial faith-\n\n[[Page S5010]]\n\nbased and community initiative. It comes to the Senate floor after a \ndifficult path. But the important point is that we are here.\n  This is a different plan than the President originally proposed. It \nis different than the plan that Senator Santorum--who I have been so \npleased to work with as lead cosponsor with him--and I negotiated with \nthe White House to address concerns that were blocking its initial \nmovement.\n  Perhaps most notably, it no longer contains any provisions targeted \nspecifically at carving out a larger lawful space for faith-based \ngroups in our social service programs. But despite this evolution, the \nheart of the proposal remains the same; and I guess, I would add, the \nsoul of the proposal remains the same as well.\n  That is why the CARE Act enjoys overwhelming support from America's \nphilanthropic community, with endorsements from more than 1,600 \ncharities of all sizes and denominations, as well, as we can see, \nstrong bipartisan support here in the Senate. And that is why I feel \nconfident this measure will help transform the spirit of good will in \nAmerica today into more good works at a time of growing hardship and \nmake this country as good as its values are.\n  Any doubt about the vitality of America's spirit was firmly laid to \nrest on September 11, 2001, when so many Americans gave so much and all \nof us collectively embraced the values of compassion and community. But \nif we truly hope to keep moving America closer to our founding ideals, \nwe have to extend that commitment to helping those who continue to live \nin a different type of need--children living in poverty and despair; \ndrug addicts desperate for treatment and a better life; low income \nworking families who are struggling for self-sufficiency.\n  Our Government, of course, runs many programs at the Federal, State, \nand local levels that aim to fill those needs as best they can by \nestablishing a safety net. But all of us here, regardless of party or \ngeography, recognize that Government can't do it all on its own, nor \nshould it. We have long relied on a wide network of private charities \nand social service providers, community organizations and religious \ngroups, what you might call the sinews of our civil society, to partner \nwith the public sector, to fill in the gaps of the Government's reach \nand, in particular, to target aid to local priorities and problems. \nThat is what this bill will do.\n  We start with a new focus on building and leveraging the capacity of \nthe small faith-based and community organizations who are often in the \nbest position to help people in need because they are closest to them. \nBut in many cases, they don't have the technical wherewithal to find \nthe public resources to do so. So to help those groups, the CARE Act \ncreates a Compassion Capital Fund authorized at $150 million a year \nthat will underwrite a wide range of technical assistance efforts. But \nthe bill goes beyond just expanding the pool of applicants and enlarges \nthe pie of resources that is available to America's charities and \nsocial services providers. That will be particularly critical at this \ndifficult time in our Nation's economic history when charities are \nstretched.\n  I saw an article in the paper in the last 24 hours that said the \nUnited Way expects a significant drop in its fundraising this year \nbecause of the economic problems America faces. I hope and believe this \nbill will create the incentives for more giving to the United Way and a \nhost of other charities, national and local. It will do so by creating \nseveral well targeted tax incentives over the next years that total \n$10.6 billion which, working from the general rule that most tax \nincentives are worth about 30 cents on the dollar to a taxpayer, should \nlead to new donations to charities, community-based, faith-based, of \nmore than $30 billion over the next 10 years. How much good will come \nfrom that is wonderful to contemplate.\n  Part of the CARE Act that may make as big a difference and of which I \nam particularly proud is the $1.3 billion increase in Social Service \nBlock Grant (SSBG) funding over the next 2 years. The CARE Act will \nfinally make good on our commitment by restoring SSBG funding to its \nauthorized level of $2.8 billion over the next 2 years and in so doing \nwould empower charities across the country to do good for so many \npeople in need.\n  I want to mention one other provision in the bill which has been a \nlabor of love for me and Senator Santorum. That provision would expand \non the use of innovative savings accounts, known as Individual \nDevelopment Accounts (IDAs), to help low-income working families build \nwealth and achieve financial self-sufficiency. There have been a number \nof IDA demonstration projects around America that have proven \nsuccessful in making home ownership, college, and small business not \njust a dream but a reality for thousands of low-income people \nnationwide. The CARE Act aims to build on those successes and \nsignificantly increase the availability of IDAs by offering America's \nfinancial institutions new incentives to help low-income families who \nwant to save for their future which represents a whole new strategy in \nfighting poverty. It is based on a growing body of research that shows \nthe best path to the middle class comes not just from hard work but \nalso through savings and asset accumulation.\n\n  In sum, this CARE Act represents a comprehensive response to a \ncomplicated problem. That is why it is broadly and enthusiastically \nembraced by charities all over America. This bill puts our shared \nvalues into action by elevating the priority we place on helping our \nmost vulnerable citizens. For that I thank my colleagues for their \nsupport.\n  I particularly thank Senator Santorum with whom it has been a \npleasure to work in this long-time effort. His dedication, his \ncommitment, his faith, his persistence, and his willingness to \naccommodate and reach common ground is a good part of the reason why we \nare on the verge of this very significant accomplishment. I thank the \nleaders of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus, \nand I thank my leader, Senator Daschle, who worked with us as we \nnegotiated this logjam-breaking compromise with the administration and \nthen pushed hard among our ranks to have this bill considered on the \nSenate floor. Senator Daschle's staff, particularly Jennifer Duck and \nAndrea LaRue, has been indispensable to this mission.\n  Finally, I thank my own staff for the dedicated work they have done \non this exceedingly challenging but important legislation. \nSpecifically, I am grateful to Laurie Rubenstein, Debbie Forrest, Dan \nGerstein, Chuck Ludlam, and Michelle McMurray. We could not have passed \nthe bill without them.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield such time as he might consume to the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank my colleague from Connecticut for his kind \nremarks and for his steadfast support. It was a struggle and took a lot \nof persistence. That is a virtue we have seen exhibited on this \nlegislation. He has been persistently for it, has worked diligently to \nfind the common ground. That is what this legislation is all about--\nfinding common ground. We have seen very strong bipartisan support for \nthe bill. It is nice to see that every now and then on the floor of the \nSenate. We will help people who are in need of help, people who are out \nthere serving our fellow man. It is a good day in the Senate that we \nare doing something positive to help those in need in society. We are \ndoing it in a bipartisan way, and we are doing it in a fiscally \nresponsible way. It is a win-win-win across the board.\n  I thank my leader, Senator Frist. He has been a steadfast supporter \nas well. He has fought for this priority of our conference. This is one \nof the high priority items we have fought for on our side of the aisle, \nand gratefully we have seen it also as a high priority on the other \nside of the aisle. That is a wonderful thing.\n  I thank Senator Daschle and Senator Reid for their cooperation and \nwillingness to continue to work this issue until we could arrive at a \npoint where we are successful today.\n  I think we will be successful in a very overwhelming way. We have \nalready seen that the House is going through the process of marking \nup--they have\n\n[[Page S5011]]\n\nnot done it yet, but they have a template laid out for their version of \nthe bill. We are optimistic that the House will promptly act to move a \npiece of legislation with which we can go to conference and get a bill \nto the President expeditiously to help many in our society who are out \nthere working on the front lines trying to help people in need--\nparticularly those people of faith.\n  One of the things I have heard is that the faith-based elements have \nbeen stripped. I counter that by saying if you look at the donations we \nare encouraging and some of these provisions that we have--for example, \nmaternity group homes or food donation provisions--food donation in \nthis country is overwhelmingly done by organizations of faith. They are \nthe ones who collect the donations and distribute them. It is the same \nthing with maternity group homes. A large segment of those homes out \nthere are faith based in nature, as well as a lot of the charitable \ngiving provisions that will disproportionately have a positive impact \non faith-based organizations. This will help faith-based organizations \non the giving side, and, as I mentioned yesterday, the compassion \ncapital fund in the bill provides technical assistance to small \ncharities.\n  Again, the principal beneficiaries will be small, inner-city, faith-\nbased organizations, these neighborhoods with many nondenominational \nchurches which are already receiving technical assistance and \ninstruction on how to apply for Federal funds through the charitable \nchoice provisions of the 1996 Welfare Act. Already we are providing \nthat assistance. This will increase that amount and will increase the \ngrassroots, faith-based, inner-city entities, working in many cases in \nthe most difficult neighborhoods, with the opportunity to access funds. \nTheir base of funds isn't that great. They are some of the poorest \nneighborhoods in America.\n  So it is a great day for those who have been working hard and \ncommitting their lives in some of the most difficult neighborhoods of \nthe country that will be getting the resources that are much needed to \nthe grassroots organizations that, as the President has said, are \ndriven by their faith commitment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I move to table the----\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield first? I am not sure we used all \nof our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is time remaining for debate.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to conclude shortly. Correct me if I am \nwrong, but I was thinking the vote was at 12:30, or are we trying to \nmove it up?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I think we should wait until 12:30. I will wait. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator wants to ask consent to move to table the \namendment and have the vote commence at 12:30, I am happy to do that. \nUsually, when you move to table, you conclude the debate.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I move to table the amendment and I \nask for the yeas and nays and then that the vote occur at 12:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time \nremains on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six and a half minutes remain for the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield for a minute?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his amendment. I \nthink it improves the legislation substantially in the context of what \nit is. This bill is not what it was. The CARE Act has all of the right \nreasons for passing the Congress--faith-based organizations gaining the \nbenefit to serve people in a broader sense. We have gone beyond that \nnow.\n  Now we are talking about providing an opportunity for charities and \nconservation groups to buy private land, or acquire private land, and, \nfor the sale of that land, to gain a benefit. In public land States \nsuch as mine, where private land is, and it is the single tax base of \ncounties and local entities of government, as we deplete that land, for \nwhatever reason, we deplete the ability of counties to provide for \nthemselves and their citizens. I am struggling with this bill in the \nfinal analysis because of that.\n  I do not oppose, obviously, the intent of CARE and the intent of \nrewarding and extending for faith-based organizations their ability to \nserve our country and its citizens. I thank my colleague for his \namendment. I hope we will not table it. I think it clearly helps \nimprove the legislation overall.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of my \ncolleague and friend from Idaho. He makes a very good point. Western \nStates have a lot of public land and not a lot of private land. This \namendment says if you are going to sell land to a charity that deals \nwith conservation, you get a 25 percent lower capital gains tax than if \nyou sell to any other charity.\n  My amendment would say if you sell to any charity, you will get a \nreduced capital gains tax. I mentioned the Nature Conservancy. They are \nbig in my State. They bought one of the biggest ranches--a buffalo \nranch--in Oklahoma. It is in the tall grass prairie. I love it. I \nhelped make that happen. The Nature Conservancy is a big group. I don't \nknow how great their assets are, but I guess it is in the millions of \ndollars--lots of land and lots of millions of dollars. If you sell to \nthat group, you get a 25 percent reduction in your capital gains tax. I \ndon't think they need it, compared to a church in Oklahoma, maybe in a \nrural area, which might want to build or expand. But if you want to \nsell to that church, you have to pay a 25 percent higher tax than if \nyou sell it to a conservancy group, or the Sierra Club, that wants to \nbuild a conservancy or other groups that might want to say: Hey, you \nget a lower deal; sell it to us.\n  Let's encourage charitable contributions, but let's also encourage \nsales to charitable organizations. If we are going to do it for one \ncharitable organization, let's do it for all charitable organizations. \nThat is the essence of my amendment. We have paid for it. It is offset. \nI urge my colleagues to support it. If we are going to encourage \ncharitable sales, let's do it for all of them, not just conservation \ngroups. I urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to table.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 527. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, it is my intention to yield back all \nof my time except for 30 seconds.\n\n\n             Welfare Benefit Plans In Relation to title VII\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I rise today to engage the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee in a colloquy regarding \nwelfare benefit plans in relation to title VII of S. 476.\n  Employee Welfare Benefit plans, regulated under ERISA, are employer-\nsponsored plans that provide security to employees at the time of an \nevent that interrupts or impairs their earning power by providing \nbenefits such as death benefits, medical insurance, long-term care and \nchild care.\n  By way of introduction, sections 419 and 419A of the Internal Revenue \nCode set forth special rules for the deduction of contributions to a \nwelfare benefit fund, including limitations on the amount of the \ndeduction that would otherwise be deductible.\n  Moreover, 419A(f)(6) provides that the rules of sections 419 and 419A \ndo not apply in the case of a welfare benefit fund that is part of a \nplan to which more than one employer contributes and to which no \nemployer normally contributes more than 10 percent of the contributions \nof all employers under the plan. This exception for 10 or more employer \nplans, however, does not apply to any plan that maintains experience \nrating arrangements with respect to individual employers.\n  It is my understanding that there is ongoing review of sections 419 \nand 419A as the Department of Treasury seeks to establish further \nguidance relative to 10 or more employer plans. It is my understanding \nthat such considerations have contributed to uncertainty in the tax \ntreatment of these plans.\n  I inquire of Chairman Grassley if he is aware of the concerns \nsurrounding the uncertain tax treatment of 10 or more employer plans, \nand if so, if he would agree to continue discussions with Treasury in \nan effort to achieve clarity.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am aware that the Treasury and Labor Departments are \nalways examining the so-called welfare benefit plans because of \naggressive uses of some arrangements. Taxpayers need certainty and \nclarity from the enforcement agencies that they can rely upon, so they \ndo not run afoul of the rules and operate plans in accordance with the \nrequirements of the law. It would be unwise to exclude a particular \ntype of arrangement from the rules governing tax shelters, however, \nbased upon some the abuses we have seen. But we can urge the Treasury \nDepartment to provide clearer guidance on the many welfare benefit plan \narrangements. I am willing to join you in writing the Treasury \nDepartment to ask them for clearer guidance as soon as practicable.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the chairman for agreeing to work with me on \nthis important issue.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to join with \nmy colleagues today and support this magnificent bill, the Charity Aid, \nRecovery, and Empowerment Act of 2003. This was a long fought \nendeavor--one that is worthy of the effort--and an endeavor that will \ncontinue to promote the act of charity, but also serve as a catalyst \nfor those who need help in gaining self-sufficiency.\n  As you may know, the motto of my State, Kansas, is, Ad Astra Per \nAspera or ``to the stars through difficulty.'' Indeed this is not only \ntrue of my State, but true of our Nation as well. The act of charity \nand benevolence is a hallmark of our great Nation and this bill will \nhelp to continue that legacy and provide a pathway for success for \nthose in need.\n  During the aftermath of the September 11 attacks on our Nation, we \nsaw the best of America in one of the darkest times of our Nation's \nhistory. Though as a Nation we were physically and emotional battered, \nwe were able to rise up and come together as one Nation united, \ndetermined to help those in need. Many organizations such as the \nSalvation Army, the Red Cross and countless other charities and \nnonprofit organizations stood together with the men and women who \nattended to the victims and their families. The strength and resolve of \nour Nation was truly remarkable through the benevolence shown to the \nfamilies of those lost on that tragic day.\n  It is time now that we help these and many other charitable \norganizations continue to help those in need. This bill, the CARE Act, \nwill do just that. This act provides charitable giving incentives in \nthe form of tax deductions for individuals and couples who do not \nitemize their tax returns--$250 for individuals and $500 for couples. \nIt allows IRA holders to make charitable contributions from their \naccounts, and provides an enhanced charitable deduction for donations \nof food and books to charitable organizations.\n  Additionally, it provides an expedited review process for \norganizations seeking a 501(c)(3) status designation, which makes it \neasier to qualify for Federal grants and contracts. Along those same \nlines, the bill requires the IRS to expedite the 501(c)(3) application \nfor any group that needs that status to apply for a government grant or \ncontract. To further help in this arena, the bill requires the IRS to \nwaive the application fee for groups whose annual revenues do not \nexceed $50,000.\n  I am also pleased that we are encouraging savings accounts for those \nin our society who are in the lower income brackets. The Individual \nDevelopment Accounts, IDA, section provides a tangible incentive for \nfolks to save and become self-sufficient, which not only provides \nfinancial security but increases the participants self-esteem which is \npriceless. Participants are able to withdraw these matched funds for a \nfirst home purchase, higher education costs, or to start a new \nbusiness.\n  Lives are dramatically changed by this program and I am pleased to \nsee the Senate backing this important incentive.\n  Lastly, I would like to highlight an issue that I am passionate \nabout, an issue of the value of human life. I am very pleased that this \nbill will provide additional funding--$33 million to be exact--for \nhelping teenage mothers achieve self-sufficiency by strengthening \nFederal support for locally run maternity group home programs. As we \nknow, this was an important agenda item in the 1996 Welfare Reform \nbill. Under the 1996 law, minors are required to live at home under \nadult supervision or in a maternity group home in order to receive \nbenefits. Teenagers who are provided the opportunity to live in these \nhomes are more likely to continue their education or receive job \ntraining--this is paramount for not only economic stability but for the \nefficacy of the participant as well. These young women, who enter this \nprogram are less likely to have a second pregnancy, and more likely to \nfind gainful employment that allows them to end a dependence upon \nFederal Government programs.\n  I am positive that this bill will continue to financially aid those \norganizations that reach out to those in need and will help them to \nbuild on the success they have already seen in their communities.\n  Indeed in my own State, I have, for several years, toured charitable \norganizations such as the Grace Center, which is a home for unwed \nmothers, and Bread of Life, which is an inner-city church that is \nleading community revitalization by partnering with schools and \nneighborhood organizations to provide scholastic, mentoring and bible \nstudy programs.\n  As a nation, we are strongest in our ability to provide assistance to \nthose in need, and to provide individuals with the tools necessary to \nsucceed. Dr. King once said, ``The ultimate measure of a man is not \nwhere he stands in moments of comfort and confidence, but where he \nstands at times of challenge and controversy.'' These organizations \nembody the epitome of Dr. King's statement. I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to support this legislation, support those organizations who \nhave committed their lives to helping others and who are indeed helping \nindividuals through difficulties reach for the stars.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe CARE Act, which is currently before the Senate. This bill is \ndedicated to improving the incentives for individuals and corporations \nto donate to charitable entities.\n\n[[Page S5013]]\n\n  Through their generosity, Americans have shown their true colors as a \ncompassionate, caring people. Unfortunately, many charities have had a \ndifficult time raising money since the tragedy of September 11, as the \neconomy has remained weak. This bill, which is a priority for President \nBush, will help America's charities to continue their invaluable work.\n  I applaud the leadership of Chairman Grassley and Ranking Democrat \nBaucus in getting this bill through the Finance Committee and onto the \nSenate floor. I also applaud the perseverance of Senators Santorum and \nLieberman, who have championed this bill for many months and have kept \nat it despite the discouragement of not being able to get the unanimous \nconsent needed to bring it to the floor until very recently.\n  The CARE Act includes several important incentives to encourage \nadditional contributions to charity. One of the more important ones is \nthe provision to allow individuals who do not itemize to take a \ndeduction under certain circumstances. I am particularly pleased that \nthe Finance Committee chose to craft this incentive as a targeted \nprovision, rather than as a provision that would allow a deduction for \nthe first dollar of contributions. Two-thirds of Americans do not \nitemize their deductions, but most of them do make contributions. \nAllowing a deduction for contributions that were already being made is \nnot an incentive--it is a giveaway. The provision in the CARE Act \nencourages us to stretch and give more. It provides a much bigger \nincentive for Americans to donate that marginal dollar and it also \nlowers the cost of this provision to the Treasury.\n  I am also very pleased that the bill includes two other provision, \nwhich I have been promoting for some time. The first would simplify a \ncomplex area of the current law and eliminate significant roadblocks \nthat now stand in the way of businesses with excess book inventory to \ndonating those books to schools, libraries, and literacy programs, \nwhere they are much needed. Unfortunately, the current tax law benefits \nfor donating such books to schools or libraries are often no greater \nthan the tax benefits for donating such books to schools or libraries \nare often no greater than the tax benefits of sending the books to the \nlandfill.\n  The provision in the CARE Act addresses the obstacles of donating \nexcess book inventory by providing a simple and clear rule whereby any \ndonation of book inventory to a qualified school, library, or literacy \nprogram is eligible for an enhanced deduction. This means that \nbooksellers and publishers would receive a higher tax benefit for \ndonating the books rather than throwing them away and would thus be \nencouraged to go to the extra trouble and expense of seeking out \nqualified donees and making the contributions.\n  The second provision deals with a problem that owners of S \ncorporation have in donating their stock to charitable entities. Under \nthe current law, a donor of S corporation stock worth $500 but having a \ntax basis of $100 would receive a deduction for ony the amount of the \nbasis, or $100. A holder of shares in a C corporation, however, is \nallowed to deduct the full $500 value of the stock. There is no \njustification for this disparity in treatment between S corporation and \nC corporations, and a provision in the CARE Act corrects it.\n  I am also pleased that another provision, which Senator Lincoln and I \nadded as a amendment to the bill in the Finance Committee, is included \nin the CARE Act. Similar to the books provision I mentioned before, \nthis provision provides a larger deduction, and therefore a stronger \nincentive, for businesses to donate their excess inventory to \ncharitable entities, such as schools or churches.\n  The CARE Act includes many worthwhile incentives designed to increase \ncharitable contributions. Its enactment should make a real difference \nin our Nation.\n  There is, however, one portion of the CARE Act in which I am \ndisappointed. As an offset, the bill includes a package of measures \ndesigned to crack down on abusive corporate tax shelters. While I am \ncertainly not in favor of abusive tax shelters, I am concerned that \npart of this package of antitax shelter provisions, known as the \nclarification of the economic substance doctrine, could also close down \nlegitimate tax planning techniques and give the Internal Revenue \nService an unprecedented degree of authority to recast the tax \ntreatment of transactions it does not like, regardless of whether the \ntransactions are otherwise allowed under the tax law. The provision \nwould also override a significant body of case law, some of which \nreaches back almost to the inception of the income tax.\n  I hope that the codification of the economic substance doctrine can \nbe deleted in the conference with the House.\n  All in all, however, the CARE Act is a very good bill, and it \ndeserves the support of the Senate. I urge all of my colleagues to vote \nfor this bill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I am delighted that the Finance \nCommittee has included my volunteer mileage reimbursement legislation \nin the CARE Act, and I want to take this opportunity to thank the \nChairman Grassley and the ranking member Baucus for their efforts to \ninclude this needed provision. I am also pleased that some troubling \nprovisions have been deleted from this legislation. In particular, I \ncongratulate the sponsors for agreeing to drop title VIII before \nbringing the bill to the floor. Doing so strengthens this bill, and \nwill greatly speed consideration of the measure.\n  Under current law, when volunteers use their cars for charitable \npurposes, the volunteers may be reimbursed up to 14 cents per mile for \ntheir donated services without triggering a tax consequence for either \nthe organization or the volunteers. If the charitable organization \nreimburses any more than that, the organization is required to file an \ninformation return with the IRS, and the volunteers must include the \namount over 14 cents per mile in their taxable income. By contrast, the \nmileage reimbursement level currently permitted for businesses is 36 \ncents per mile.\n  At a time when Government is asking volunteers and volunteer \norganizations to bear a greater burden of delivering essential \nservices, the 14 cents per mile limit is posing a very real hardship on \ncharitable organizations and other nonprofit groups. I have heard from \na number of people in Wisconsin on the need to increase this \nreimbursement limit.\n  At a listening session I held in Portage County, WI, representatives \nof the local Department on Aging explained just how important volunteer \ndrivers are to their ability to provide services to seniors in that \ncounty. The Department on Aging reported that in 2001, 54 volunteer \ndrivers delivered meals to homes and transported people to medical \nappointments, meal sites, and other essential services. The Department \nnoted that their volunteer drivers provided 4,676 rides, and drove \nnearly 126,000 miles. They also delivered 9,385 home-delivered meals, \nand nearly two-thirds of the drivers logged more than 100 miles per \nmonth in providing these needed services. Together, volunteers donated \nover 5,200 hours last year, and as the Department notes, at the rate of \nminimum wage, that amounts to over $27,000, not including other \nbenefits.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the senior meals program is one of the \nmost vital services provided under the Older Americans Act, and \nensuring that meals can be delivered to seniors or that seniors can be \ntaken to meal sites is an essential part of that program. \nUnfortunately, federal support for the senior nutrition programs has \nstagnated in recent years. This has increased pressure on local \nprograms to leverage more volunteer services to make up for lagging \nfederal support. The 14 cents per mile reimbursement limit, though, \nincreasingly poses a barrier to obtaining those contributions. Portage \nCounty reports that many of their volunteers cannot afford to offer \ntheir services under such a restriction. And if volunteers cannot be \nfound, their services will have to be replaced by contracting with a \nprovider, greatly increasing costs to the department, costs that come \ndirectly out of the pot of funds available to pay for meals and other \nservices.\n  By contrast, businesses do not face this restrictive mileage \nreimbursement limit. The comparable mileage rate for someone who works \nfor a business is currently 36 cents per mile. This disparity means \nthat a business hired to deliver the same meals delivered by volunteers \nfor Portage County may reimburse their employees over double\n\n[[Page S5014]]\n\nthe amount permitted the volunteer without a tax consequence.\n  This doesn't make sense. The 14 cents per mile volunteer \nreimbursement limit is badly outdated. According to the Congressional \nResearch Service, Congress first set a reimbursement rate of 12 cents \nper mile as part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, and did not \nincrease it until 1997, when the level was raised slightly, to 14 cents \nper mile, as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.\n  The provision included in the CARE Act addresses this problem by \nraising the limit on volunteer mileage reimbursement to the level \npermitted to businesses, currently 36 cents per mile.\n  Once again, I thank the chairman and ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee for their help in including this provision in the CARE Act. \nThis timely measure will help ensure that charitable organizations can \ncontinue to attract the volunteers who play such a critical role in \nhelping to deliver services, and it will simplify the tax code both for \nnonprofit groups and the volunteers themselves.\n  As I noted earlier, I am also pleased that the sponsors of the CARE \nAct agreed to drop title VIII before bringing the bill to the floor. I \nhad two serious concerns about title VIII. First, it threatened to \nundermine our Nation's long-standing public policy against \ndiscrimination in employment. Religious organizations currently enjoy \nan exemption from title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, allowing \nthem to discriminate against individuals on the basis of religion when \nmaking employment decisions about individuals involved in religious \nservices. The bill as introduced was silent on this issue and therefore \nthreatened to extend this exemption and allow religious groups that \nprovide federally funded social services to discriminate on the basis \nof religion in hiring, firing, or promotion decisions.\n  Second, title VIII could have allowed religious organizations \nreceiving Federal funds to proselytize during the provision of the \nfederally funded social service. Faith-based organizations do a lot of \ngood work in our society. But the Founders were right when they crafted \nthe Constitution's separation of church and state provision. We need to \nprotect each American's right to practice his or her religion as he or \nshe chooses. I am troubled by the possibility that, regardless of good \nintentions, in practice, people who are in trouble would feel pressured \nto engage in religious activities that they are not comfortable with in \norder to get access to help, or otherwise be denied the services that \nthey desperately need.\n  Again, I am pleased that title VIII, the problematic faith-based \nprovision, has been dropped from the version of the bill that is before \nthe Senate today. Congress, however, must continue to be vigilant to \nensure that we do not enact legislation that allows taxpayer dollars to \nbe used to promote employment discrimination based on religion, or \nreligious instruction, worship, or proselytization.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to \nChairman Grassley and Senator Baucus for the inclusion of the hospital \nsupport organization provision to the CARE Act. This provision is \nimportant to all teaching hospital support organizations, including \nthose in Hawaii. The provision would treat borrowing by these support \norganizations as qualified exceptions under the unrelated business \nincome rule for debt acquisition.\n  As a requirement for tax exemption status, nonprofit hospitals must \nprovide significant charity services. They do this mainly by treating \nMedicaid and Medicare patients and by running an open emergency room \nthat treats anyone without regard to payment. For example, Medicare and \nMedicaid admissions comprise nearly 60 percent of all admissions at the \nlargest private, nonprofit hospital in my State. The demand for \nindigent or charitable hospital care will continue to grow especially \nin an economic down turn.\n  A number of charitable hospitals, such as the Queen's Medical Center \nin the State of Hawaii, also provide residency training as teaching \nhospitals for our future doctors. In addition, they must extend staff \nprivileges to all qualified physicians in nearly all specialties. \nAccordingly, they cannot be selective as to their patients or to their \nstaff physicians. To pay for these charitable services nonprofit \nhospitals must use their endowment income as well as fees from other \npatients.\n  For-profit enterprises can easily borrow or raise the capital to \nbuild the most up-to-date facilities to compete for the high-profit \npatients. In comparison, charitable hospitals face lower reimbursements \nfor Medicaid and Medicare patients, while at the same time they \nstruggle to cope with rising costs for wages, supplies and insurance. \nIn order to meet the growing demand for indigent care, many charitable \nhospitals postpone updating their equipment and defer modernizing their \nfacilities. As a result, there is a growing trend for charitable \nhospitals to sell off their facilities to for-profit operations because \nthey can easily secure the required capital to update or expand the \nfacilities.\n  In the past, Congress has allowed nonprofit schools, colleges, \nuniversities, and pension funds to invest in real estate with borrowed \nfunds, and the income from real investments has allowed these \ninstitutions to meet their financial needs. Accordingly, with this \nprovision, teaching hospitals' support organizations would also be \nallowed to borrow in order to repair and improve the real property held \nin the portfolio assets of their endowments, thereby increasing the \nvalue of the real property segment of their endowments. The resulting \nincrease of income can then help cover the growing costs for more \ncharitable services.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus for the support \nthey have given me\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I rise today in support of the Charity \nAid, Recovery, and Empowerment, CARE Act of 2003. The tax provisions in \nthe CARE Act will encourage increased giving to charitable \norganizations across the country. In community after community, our \ncharitable organizations have seen donations drop off significantly \nbecause of the sluggish economy.\n  The CARE Act would allow taxpayers who do not itemize tax deductions \nto write off a portion of their charitable donations for 2 years--\nnonitemizers would be limited to $250 for individuals and $500 for \ncouples filing joint returns. The bill would also permit tax-free \ndistributions from IRAs for charitable purposes and would provide \nenhanced deductions for contributions of food, books, computers and \nconservation easements. It is important to note that the $13.1 billion \nin tax allowances in the CARE Act are fully offset by tax shelter \nlegislation that would impose stiff penalties on those who try to hide \nassets from the IRS. I am also pleased that the bill reported by the \nSenate Finance Committee on February 5 contains none of the \ncontroversial ``charitable choice'' provisions that hindered its \npassage in the last Congress.\n  There are a number of bipartisan and noncontroversial tax incentive \nprovisions in the CARE Act that I have supported as stand-alone bills, \nincluding the Artist-Museum Partnership Act, S. 287, that I coauthored \nwith Senator Bennett, and the Good Samaritan Hunger Relief Act, S. 85, \nthat I coauthored with Senator Lugar.\n  Senator Bennett and I introduced the Artist-Museum Partnership Act to \nenable our country to keep cherished art works in the United States and \nto preserve them in our public institutions, while erasing an inequity \nin our Tax Code that now serves as a disincentive for artists to donate \ntheir works to museums and libraries. Under current law, artists who \ndonate self-created works are only able to deduct the cost of supplies \nsuch as canvas, pen, paper and ink--a sum that does not come close to \nthe works' true value. This is unfair to artists and it hurts museums \nand libraries large and small that are dedicated to preserving works \nfor posterity. Our bill would allow artists, writers, and composers who \ndonate works to museums and libraries to take a tax deduction equal to \nthe fair-market value of the work.\n  In my State of Vermont, we are incredibly proud of the great works \nproduced by hundreds of local artists who choose to live and work in \nthe Green Mountain State. Displaying their creations in museums and \nlibraries helps develop a sense of pride among Vermonters and \nstrengthens a bond with Vermont, its landscape, its beauty, and its \ncultural heritage. Anyone\n\n[[Page S5015]]\n\nwho has gained a greater understanding of both the artist and the \nsubject by contemplating a painting in a museum or examining an \noriginal manuscript or composition knows the tremendous value of these \nworks. I would like to see more of them, not fewer, preserved in \nVermont and across the country.\n  I would like to thank Senators Allen, Bingaman, Cantwell, Chafee, \nClinton, Cochran, Daschle, Dodd, Durbin, Feinstein, Graham of Florida, \nJeffords, Johnson, Kennedy, Kerry, Lieberman, Lincoln, Miller, Stevens, \nand Warner for cosponsoring our bill.\n  The Good Samaritan Hunger Relief Act that Senator Lugar and I \nintroduced represents a great partnership between businesses and \norganizations working to alleviate hunger. The bill will increase \ndonations to food banks, soup kitchens, and other hunger relief \ncharities and therefore help local communities and organizations become \nthe first line of defense against hunger in America.\n  Under current tax law, the deduction allowed for donated food does \nnot cover expenses incurred by the business. In many cases, this means \nthat it is cheaper for a business or farmer to throw away leftover food \ninstead of donating it to the hungry. This legislation will make it \neasier for restaurants, food processors, and farmers to contribute food \nto food banks, pantries, and homeless shelters by allowing the \ndeduction of the full market value of food donated.\n  Over the years, the legislation has received the endorsement of \nvarious hunger relief and food community organizations, including \nAmerica's Second Harvest Food Banks, the American Farm Bureau \nFederation, the California Emergency Foodlink, the Council of Chain \nRestaurants, the Grocery Manufacturers of America, Lighthouse \nMinistries Inc., the National Restaurant Association and the Salvation \nArmy. I would like to thank Senators Akaka, Allen, Bayh, Bond, Cochran, \nDayton, DeWine, Dodd, Durbin, Ensign, Fitzgerald, Harkin, Kerry, \nLandrieu, Miller, Roberts, Santorum, Schumer, and Smith for also \ncosponsoring our bill.\n  I want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee for including the Artist-Museum Partnership Act and the Good \nSamaritan Hunger Relief Act in the CARE Act. As we pass this important \nlegislation today, I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nensure that the bipartisan compromises contained in the Senate bill are \npreserved.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I rise today to offer my support for the \nCARE Act of 2003. Now that the objectionable ``charitable choice'' \nprovisions of the bill have been removed, and the Republicans have \nagreed to pay for the tax provisions in the bill, the positives of the \nlegislation clearly outweigh the negatives and the final result is \nworthy of support.\n  There are several aspects of the bill of which I want to make note. \nLet me briefly mention them.\n  First, several elements in the bill were included as amendments after \nseveral Senators, including myself, worked to add them in the Finance \nCommittee. These include an enhanced tax deduction for contributions of \nfood inventory, which will be very helpful for food banks assisting the \npoor; a new market-value deduction for art donated to nonprofit \ninstitutions by an artist during his or her lifetime; and some \nrestoration of funding for the social service block grant program. \nThese are all worthy provisions.\n  Second, I have argued that while we have the largest deficits in \nhistory and face pressing domestic needs and the long-term expense of \nrebuilding Iraq, we should not have any new tax cuts that are not paid \nfor. That is why I have offered a stimulus package whose costs are \noffset in future years, so we can stimulate the economy today without \npassing the bill to our kids. I am pleased that the Finance Committee \nworked in a bipartisan way to pay for the provisions in the CARE Act, \nin order to eliminate any long-term cost. Moreover, I am especially \npleased that the major pay-for provisions in the bill are clarification \nof the economic substance doctrine and other provisions related to tax \nshelters. I introduced legislation to reform these shelters during the \n107th Congress and the Finance Committee took much of the language from \nmy original bill when they needed a more comprehensive offset this \nyear. Most notably, last year's offsets for the CARE Act did not \ninclude the economic substance provision; now it represents the single \nlargest pay-for. At a time when we are learning how far companies will \ngo to abuse the tax system, changes to these shelter provisions come at \njust the right time.\n  Finally, although the nonitemizer deduction for charitable \ncontributions is getting the most attention in this bill, the largest \npermanent provision of the CARE Act will allow tax-free IRA rollovers \nto charitable organizations. Under the bill, people will be able to \nmake planned charitable gifts out of IRAs at age 59\\1/2\\, and direct \ngifts at age 70\\1/2\\, without any tax consequence. This is language \nthat I worked on with Senator Dorgan, and I worked hard in the Finance \nCommittee to have the Dorgan-Kerry language included in the CARE \nmarkup. The new language will be very beneficial to the many colleges, \nuniversities, and cultural institutions throughout my home State.\n  The new law will make a big difference, and it is important that \npeople understand how it works. Under current law, one's itemized \ndeductions are generally limited to one-half of one's income. In the \ncase of a retired worker with $30,000 of annual income, but $150,000 \naccumulated in an IRA, this limitation would prevent the retiree from \nmaking a $30,000 donation from the IRA to the charity of his or her \nchoice. The entire $30,000 withdrawal from the IRA would be taxed as \nincome, but only $15,000--50 percent of annual income--would be allowed \nas a charitable deduction. Under this bill, however, the entire \ncontribution would be free of any tax consequence: The withdrawal would \nnot be taxed as income, and the contribution would not be counted as a \ndeduction. The taxpayer can simply make the transfer to the charity \ncompletely tax-free.\n  If the objective of this bill is to increase charitable giving, this \nis the central provision that will drive that result. I thank the \nsponsors of the bill, Senators Lieberman and Santorum, and the Finance \nCommittee leadership, Senators Grassley and Baucus, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support the CARE Act.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I am disappointed that the \nadministration has put out a statement today opposing the SSBG \nprovisions in this bill, especially after we negotiated a bill with the \nAdministration that included those provisions. The SSBG funding is \ncritically important to this bill. It funds a number of essential \nsocial services that have been harmed by cuts to that program. I'd like \nto put in the record here the results of a survey done by the United \nWay of America.\n  In January 2000, UWA conducted an informal survey to assess the \nimpact cuts to SSBG have had on local United Ways and their community \npartners. This study represents the impact of cuts from a funding level \nof $2.8 billion to SSBG in fiscal year 1995, to $1.9 billion in fiscal \nyear 1999. Since conducting the survey, SSBG funding has been further \nreduced to $1.7 billion.\n  Following summarizes ``The Stories Behind the Social Services Block \nGrant: A Survey by United Way of America.''\n\n       Effect of SSBG Cuts on Health and Human Service Agencies: \n     One hundred thirty-eight agencies from 26 States responded.\n       Effect on budget: 38 percent received less SSBG money in \n     1999 than in the 1995; 42 percent have been level funded for \n     the past 5 years.\n       Effect on services: 17 percent of the total respondents had \n     to cut programs to compensate for SSBG cuts; 29 percent of \n     the agencies that received less SSBG money in 1999 than in \n     1995 were forced to cut programs; 32 percent of the total \n     respondents had to cut staff to compensate for SSBG cuts; 50 \n     percent of the agencies that received less SSBG money in 1999 \n     than in 1995 had to cut staff; 46 percent of the total \n     respondents were forced to serve fewer clients; 73 percent of \n     the agencies that received less SSBG money in 1999 than in \n     1995 were forced to serve fewer clients.\n       Respondents' median 1999 grant: $70,472.00.\n       Median percent of respondents' budget that SSBG represents: \n     10 percent.\n       Median number of people served with respondents' SSBG \n     funds: 180.\n\n  The survey found that further cuts to SSBG would greatly reduce the \nreach and impact programs that provide services for a full range of \nhealth and human services from child welfare and\n\n[[Page S5016]]\n\nchild care to youth development, job training and other work supports \nfor those transitioning off welfare, assistance for domestic violence \nvictims, respite care, home care services and information and referral. \nThe administration's backtracking on its assurances about funding this \nprogram will further damage these efforts.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I would like to express my support for \nS. 476, the CARE Act. The bill before us today contains many important \nprovisions that work toward a single goal of encouraging charitable \ngiving in the United States. The bill does this by making it easier for \nindividuals to deduct their charitable contributions from their incomes \ntaxes, by allowing tax-free distributions from IRAs for charities and \nby encouraging donations of books, food inventory, and computers.\n  I particularly would like to thank the managers of this bill for \nincluding a provision in the Managers' amendment that I had discussed \nin the Finance Committee earlier this year. That provision which will \nbe in effect for certain tax-exempt bonds issued 1 year after the date \nof enactment of this bill, is aimed at making it easier for non-profit \nnursing and elder-care facilities to gain access to tax-exempt bond \nmarkets which might not otherwise be available to it. The provision was \ncrafted to address some of the affordable funding issues facing the \nnon-profit agencies that are attempting to provide these important and \nmuch-needed elder-care facilities, particularly in underserved regions \nof our country.\n  As you well know, Madam President, with the aging of our population, \nthe challenges facing the underserved community of the elderly will \ncontinue to grow. One way that we can contribute to the good work that \nthese non-profit nursing homes are doing is by finding ways to help \nthem gain access to affordable capital so that they can continue to \nserve this important segment of our population.\n  I thank Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus of the Finance \nCommittee and Mr. Santorum, the chief supporter of this bill, and their \nstaffs for their assistance with this issue.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of a \nkey provision in the CARE Act, the restoration of $1.375 billion for \nthe Social Services Block Grant Program or SSBG.\n  As my colleagues know, SSBG is an extremely flexible grant program \nthat states use to pay for a wide variety of social services \nactivities. States have broad discretion over the use of these funds. \nIn recent years, the largest expenditures for services under the SSBG \nwere for child protective services, children's foster care and \nprevention and intervention services.\n  Additionally, SSBG funds go to provide crucial services such as \nrespite care for the elderly, adult protective services, as well as \nadoption programs.\n  In 1996, during the debate over welfare reauthorization, the Congress \nand the States agreed to temporarily decrease SSBG from $2.8 billion a \nyear to $2.38 billion a year, until welfare reform was firmly \nestablished. The agreement further stipulated that SSBG would be funded \nat $2.38 billion per year until fiscal year 2003 when it would be \nrestored to $2.8 billion per year.\n  We have not lived up to our promise. Funding for SSBG has been \nreduced considerably. Currently this vital program is funded at $1.7 \nbillion a year.\n  This program is very important in my State of Iowa.\n  There were over 119,708 children and adults benefitting from SSBG-\nfunded services in the state of Iowa in fiscal year 2000.\n  Iowa spent almost half of their $29 million block grant--48 percent--\non services to persons with disabilities covering both physically \ndisabled and developmentally disabled persons. Services include adult \nresidential care, adult day care, community-supervised living, \nsheltered workshops and work activities.\n  Iowa used $982,078 in SSBG for the prevention of abuse and neglect to \nelderly and disabled persons compared to receiving only $55,927 from \nthe title VII Elder Abuse under the Older Americans Act.\n  I worked very hard to ensure that SSBG was included in the CARE Act. \nThe reason why I felt so strongly that it be included in the bill is \nbecause I see an SSBG increase as one of the ways we can direct fiscal \nrelief to the states.\n  States are currently suffering under the worst fiscal crisis since \nWorld War II. I am committed to finding ways to assist the states \nmanage this fiscal crisis. I view the inclusion of the restoration of \nSSBG funds as a good first step towards assisting the States make it \nthrough this current crisis.\n  I appreciate my colleagues' hard work on this bill and look forward \nto its enactment into law.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the CARE Act is an important piece of \nlegislation that will help those organizations that are always there to \nhelp us. On balance, I believe the bill will encourage more charitable \ngiving. And this is particularly important now, when demand on these \norganizations is out-pacing resources.\n  This legislation would not have been possible without the \ncontributions of many.\n  First, I would like to thank the Finance Committee staff for their \nexpert counsel and hard work. They spent many long hours perfecting \nthis legislation. They are role models for those in public service.\n  I appreciate the cooperation we received from the Republican staff \nmembers including Kolan Davis, Mark Prater, Dean Zerbe, Elizabeth \nParis, Christy Mistr, and Ed McClellan.\n  I want to especially thank my staff, including Jeff Forbes, John \nAngell, Russ Sullivan, Patrick Heck, and Jonathan Selib. I also want to \nmention our hardworking interns, Shawn White and Tyler Garrett.\n  The Finance Committee staff worked closely with staff members from \nother Senate offices. They also were in touch with officials from the \nAdministration, including Susan Brown and others from Treasury.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation provided technical assistance. Lindy \nPaull, Mary Schmitt, Roger Colinvaux, Ron Schultz, Sam Olchyk, Ray \nBeeman, and Brian Meighan. And many others. We owe many thanks for the \nassistance they provided.\n  Second, I want to thank Senators Lieberman and Santorum. The CARE Act \nhas been a priority for them for a long time. They have worked \ntirelessly to get this bill before the Senate. We are grateful for \ntheir diligence, cooperation and input.\n  I also want to thank our leaders Senators Frist and Daschle for their \ndecision in moving the CARE Act forward.\n  I want to thank my good friend and colleague, Chairman Grassley. As \nalways, he has been instrumental in ensuring a truly bipartisan bill. \nAnd, it continues to be a pleasure to work with him.\n  Finally, I look forward to seeing this bill passed into law--and \nsoon. It is my hope that the House will take up this legislation \nquickly.\n  The CARE Act is one of the President's top priorities. There is a lot \nin this bill that enjoys widespread, bipartisan support.\n  Together, we have been working on this bill for more than 2 years. \nThere is no need for further delay.\n  I urge the House to act quickly on this legislation so that we can \nhave the CARE Act on the President's desk by the Memorial Day recess.\n  This is a good bill. I urge my colleagues to vote for the CARE Act.\n  Madam President, the CARE Act takes bold steps to combat the \ndevastating problem of hunger--an issue that affects far too many of my \nconstituents in Montana.\n  Today, in the greatest and most prosperous nation in the world, \nhunger remains a real problem for our families.\n  According to the USDA, more than 1 in 8 households were food insecure \nin Montana between 1999 and 2001. This means that they do not \nconsistently know where their next meal will come from.\n  And 4 percent of households in Montana--that is 32,000 people, 12,000 \nof whom are children--live in conditions so severe that they are \nclassified as actually experiencing hunger.\n  These numbers are on the rise--Montana's hunger rate had the second \nhighest jump of any state from an identical USDA study done just three \nyears earlier.\n  Many of these are working poor families, making gut-wrenching \ndecisions\n\n[[Page S5017]]\n\nbetween whether to spend their hard-earned money on housing, \nhealthcare, child-care, or food.\n  So this is an issue that concerns me deeply.\n  The CARE Act will provide a valuable weapon in the war to end hunger. \nIt will do so by making it easier for farmers and small businesses to \ndonate surplus food to our struggling hunger relief charities.\n  Simply put, these difficult economic times mean that more people are \nshowing up to food pantries and soup kitchens at a time when these \norganizations are struggling the most to meet demand.\n  These community groups--usually consisting solely of volunteers--are \noften ``first-responders'' in the battle against hunger.\n  The CARE Act will help food pantries and soup kitchens to keep food \non the shelves for hungry families.\n  The CARE Act is also good for America's struggling farmers and \nbusinesses. It helps them do the right thing by donating surplus food \nthat would otherwise have been thrown away.\n  Here is what Peggy Grimes, of the Montana Food Bank Network has to \nsay about the CARE Act:\n\n       It has come to my attention that these struggling farmers \n     and small grocers do not receive any tax benefit for their \n     increasing donations. They have been donating out of concern \n     for their neighbors as they have been hearing reports of \n     increased food insecurity throughout Montana. . . . For \n     Montana, as an agricultural state, the Care Act will be of \n     significant benefit to both those donating food and those in \n     need of food.\n\n  Hunger in America is not a problem of lack of food. The USDA \nestimates that 96 billion pounds of food are thrown away each year.\n  This is simply shameful when working families are struggling to make \nends meet. There is a problem when it is more profitable to throw away \nfood than it is to donate it to those who need it.\n  The CARE Act helps solve this problem by providing incentives to \nfarmers and small businesses, whose resources are also constrained in \nthese economic times.\n  America's Second Harvest, the nation's largest anti-hunger charity, \nestimates that the CARE Act will result in enough donated food to \nprovide roughly 765 million meals over the next 10 years.\n  These results are real, and I am proud to support this provision.\n  The CARE Act is a win-win-win situation. It is a win for anti-hunger \ncharities that work hard to ensure that America's families have food on \nthe table.\n  It is a win for our farmers and businesses that want to help their \nneighbors in need. And most importantly, it is a win for America's low-\nincome families, who will see food on their tables.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the CARE Act.\n  Madam President, it is a sad fact that in a large number of homes--\nparticularly in the homes of our poorest, most at-risk children--you \ncannot find a book. Sixty percent of kindergartners--in neighborhoods \nthat performed poorly in school--did not own a single book.\n  The lack of access to books poses the greatest barrier to literacy. \nThat is why we must change the status quo.\n  Unfortunately, the tax law functions as a disincentive to the \ncharitable donation of books to schools, libraries, and literacy \nprograms. Under the tax law, it is actually more economical to truck \nbooks to a dump than it is to give them to your local school or \nlibrary.\n  Through the title I program, however, we have nearly 15 million \nyoungsters nationwide enrolled. This allows us to reach at least a \nportion of the disadvantaged children in our country.\n  In my State of Montana, there are an estimated 35,000 poor children \nwho qualify for the title I program. These children will also benefit \nfrom the provision in the CARE Act which encourages the donation of \nbooks. For a child who has never owned a book--their first book is a \nprized possession.\n  An increase in charitable book contributions would especially benefit \nthe State of Montana. According to the Montana Library Association, the \nMontana State Library has fallen victim to a 26 percent budget cut in \n2003. These reductions will mean less money for local libraries. And \nthey will mean cuts in the State subsidies that currently fund book \npurchases, interlibrary loans, and audio and other special books for \nthe elderly, disabled, and sick.\n  According to the Montana Commissioner of Higher Education, Montana \nuniversities will also receive fewer books. In the wake of the latest \nbudget cuts, the state legislature has cut university budgets 8.4 \npercent. That puts university funding below 1992 levels.\n  The University of Montana leads the list with a 10.9 percent cut in \nstate money. Followed by Montana State University at a 9.8 percent cut. \nAnd MSUY-Billings at a 8.5 percent cut. The libraries at Montana \nuniversities will experience cuts of $1.6 million for new materials.\n  These cuts will not only hurt universities--they will also hurt the \nprograms in which university students participate. For example, the \nMontana Reads literacy program--started by University of Montana \nPresident Dennison in 1997.\n  This program is critical to the 60-plus University of Montana student \nvolunteers who regularly tutor kindergarten through fifth grade \nMissoula students. I think it is simple common sense that a critical \ncomponent of any successful literacy program is for the students to \nhave books. These Montana tutors depend on book donations to help their \nstudents. The CARE Act helps them to help the elementary kids in \nMissoula.\n  Of course these donations will also greatly aid adult literacy. \nCampaigns such as the Montana Adult Basic & Literacy Education, ABLE, \nprogram serve adults who lack sufficient mastery of basic skills to \nfunction in society, a high school diploma, or basic English skills. In \nMontana, 75,000 adults aged 25 and over do not have a high school \ndiploma or a GED. Twenty-five thousand adults have less than a ninth \ngrade education.\n  Every effort we make to improve reading in Montana will suffer if we \ndo not include books in the equation. The Federal Government granted 36 \nMontana schools $11 million over 3 years to find reading coaches, \nfamily literacy programs and tutors.\n  These grants are so important to Montana. But if we fail to supply \nbooks as part of the equation, then the grants are not put to use in \nthe most efficient way. Allowing charitable donations for books ensures \nthat we use taxpayer dollars more effectively. We cannot afford not to.\n  Madam President, earlier this year, Senator Grassley and I \nreintroduced S. 701, the Rural Heritage Conservation Act. This bill \nwill help the nation's hard-working farmers and ranchers preserve their \nheritage and way-of-life. At the same time, it promotes conservation of \nvaluable open space and wildlife habitat. This legislation is included \nas a provision in the CARE Act.\n  S. 701 provides targeted income tax relief to small farmers and \nranchers who wish to make a charitable contribution of a qualified \nconservation easement.\n  The bill would allow eligible farmers and ranchers to increase the \ncurrently deductible amount for charitable contributions of qualified \nconservation easements. That means that farmers and ranchers can deduct \namounts up to 100 percent of adjusted gross income.\n  The bill also extends the carryover period from 5 years to 15 years. \nIn the case of all other landowners, the AGI limitation would be raised \nfrom 30 percent to 50 percent.\n  Senator Grassley has worked closely with me to include the provisions \nof S. 701 in the CARE Act. I believe our bipartisan cooperation is the \nreason why we have come so far in moving this very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Passing the provisions in S. 701 will mean that farmers and ranchers \nfacing the potential of having to sell their ranch will have another \nfinancially viable option. Under this proposal, they will be able to \nchoose to take advantage of the conservation easement incentives, stay \non their land, and invest in their farming or ranching business.\n  In practical terms, that means these farmers and ranchers do not have \nto sell the family farm or ranch. They can keep it in the family. This \nis so important to preserving the character and economic vitality of \nour rural communities.\n  Over the past 25 years, over 3 million acres of agricultural lands \nhave been\n\n[[Page S5018]]\n\nlost to development in Montana alone. Many of those lands were lost \nwhen family farms--hit hard by tough times--were forced to give up \ntheir generations' old farming operations and sell to developers in \norder to pay the bills.\n  We have to find additional tools to help these folks keep their land \nin agricultural production and in open space. Our legislation provides \none of those tools.\n  To illustrate why this legislation is so important, let me give you \nan example of the impact of current law on farmers and ranchers.\n  Jerry Townsend was born and raised on his family's ranch in Highwood, \nMontana. He has operated the ranch since purchasing it from his parents \nin 1974. On his ranch, called the Elk Run Ranch, he raises commercial \nbeef cattle.\n  In 1995, Mr. Townsend donated a conservation easement to the Montana \nLand Reliance. His ``donation'' was calculated at $528,000. However, \nbecause his ranch is held as a C corporation, his tax deduction was \nlimited to10 percent of the ranch's net income. His tax deduction over \nthe six years totaled a paltry $1,998--less than one percent of the \ntotal value of his donation.\n  In contrast, a landowner with more in income would have a much \ngreater incentive to enter into an easement agreement because he or she \nwould be able to deduct more of the value of the donation from their \ntaxes.\n  S. 701 would do nothing more than level the playing field for farmers \nand ranchers when it comes to the tax benefits of donating conservation \neasements. What should matter is the value of your land--not the amount \nof your income.\n  Our conservation easement bill, and as included in the CARE Act, have \nbeen endorsed by 210 land trusts representing 44 States. Other \nsupporters include the Montana Stockgrowers, the American Farmland \nTrust, and the Colorado Cattlemen.\n  This is a win-win proposition. Farmers and ranchers will be able to \npreserve their important agricultural and ranching lands for future \ngenerations. They will be able to continue to operate their businesses. \nThey will be able to stay on their land.\n  It is a purely voluntary, incentive-based way to promote \nconservation. And it will allow us to bring people together. \nLandowners. Conservationists. The Federal Government. And local \ncommunities. All working together to preserve our precious natural \nresources and agricultural heritage.\n  Madam President, I rise to talk about another important, but often \noverlooked, aspect of the CARE Act additional funding for the Social \nServices Block Grant, or SSBG.\n  SSBG funds are very flexible. States can use these funds to assist \nabused children cope with their trauma; to help seniors live at home, \ninstead of nursing homes; to provide day care for children in low-\nincome working families; so that we know those kids are in safe places \nwhile their parents work; to assist the disabled so that they can fully \nparticipate in our society; to help parents adopt children, so that \nevery child has a loving parent.\n  In my State of Montana, we use SSBG to help children with \ndevelopmental disabilities, like those with cerebral palsy.\n  SSBG is ``glue money.'' Communities use it to fill holes in the \nsafety net. It is up to States and localities to decide where it goes. \nWe give them a long menu of options, and they use it the way they see \nfit, based on local needs. This bill provides over $1 billion more in \nSSBG to fill those holes over 2 years.\n  The goal of the CARE Act is to increase compassionate activity in our \ncountry. We are a big-hearted country. We want to help each other. This \nbill will help turn more of that desire into action and will make sure \nGovernment is doing its part.\n  SSBG funds support the activities of faith-related charities. We give \nthe money to the States and they often contract with faith-related \norganizations to do the hands-on work that they do so well. If you want \nto support Catholic Charities, then you should support SSBG. If you \nwant to support Lutheran Social Services, then you should support SSBG. \nThese organizations have told me that SSBG funds are crucially \nimportant to them.\n  The CARE Act is about increased individual giving. That is absolutely \nvital. But if the Government does less, then any increase in individual \ngiving may only be filling that gap left by the withdrawal of the \nGovernment.\n  The additional SSBG funding in this bill is our way of saying that \nthe Government will keep its part of the bargain and continue to play a \nrole. It is a flexible source of funds, so it won't be bureaucrats in \nWashington dictating the money will be used. And much of the funding \nwill go to faith-related charities--the very organizations we want to \nbolster.\n  We haven't talked much about the SSBG provision. That is a good sign. \nAround here, we tend to talk about the things we disagree about. I am \nglad we could find common ground on this provision so easily. I'm sure \nthe faith-related charities will thank us for doing so.\n  I commend Senators Lieberman and Santorum for their work on the CARE \nAct.\n  Madam President, on February 5, 2003, the Finance Committee passed \ntax shelter legislation to offset the cost of the CARE Act.\n  How appropriate it is for a bill to encourage more charitable giving \nto be paid for by those shirking their responsibility to pay their fair \nshare of taxes.\n  The tax shelter legislation included in the CARE Act was developed by \nthe Finance Committee over the past 4 years.\n  The committee has taken time to develop appropriately targeted \nlegislation. Care has been taken to avoid encumbering legitimate \nbusiness transactions. Nevertheless, we will all be burdened until we \nget this problem in check.\n  Without these changes, honest businesses will continue to be burdened \nto the extent they compete against companies avoiding taxes.\n  Tax shelters are carefully engineered tax transactions. Most have \nlittle or no economic substance. That means that they are designed to \nachieve unwarranted tax benefits rather than business profit. And, they \nplace honest taxpayers at a considerable disadvantage.\n  As Michael Graetz, Professor of Law at Yale University, once said: \n``a tax shelter is a deal done by very smart people that, absent tax \nconsiderations, would be very stupid.''\n  It is time to put a stop to the unsavory practice of mining the Tax \nCode for these abusive shelters.\n  These transactions are designed to take advantage of the complexity \nof the tax law to obtain benefits that Congress never intended.\n  They pose a real threat to the integrity of our self-assessment \nsystem by eroding the public's respect of the tax law.\n  Under tax shelter legislation produced by the Finance Committee, \npromoters, advisors, and taxpayers would be subject to stiff penalties \nfor failing to acknowledge these transactions to the IRS.\n  Treasury believes that if a taxpayer feels comfortable entering into \na transaction; if a promoter feels comfortable selling a transaction; \nand, an advisor feels comfortable recommending a transaction, they \nshould all feel comfortable disclosing the transaction to the IRS.\n  We have worked closely with the Treasury Department in crafting this \nlegislation. We have given Treasury authority to fine-tune the \nprovisions so as to protect legitimate tax planning.\n  But make no mistake, I am committed to combating abusive tax \ntransactions. The tax shelter package is the first installment. It will \nnot be the last.\n  The tax shelter package reinforces steps already taken by Treasury by \nrequiring more transparency.\n  Taxpayers will now be required to disclose certain reportable \ntransactions on their tax returns or face stiff penalties. Promoters \nwill have to provide information to IRS on their tax avoidance \nstrategies or face stiff sanctions.\n  These provisions are designed to change the cost-benefit ratio of \nthose contemplating engaging in egregious tax planning strategies.\n  The bill would also eliminate abusive tax shelters by denying tax \nbenefits with little or no economic substance.\n  That means that taxpayers will have to enter into transactions for \nlegitimate economic and business reasons and not purely for tax \navoidance.\n\n[[Page S5019]]\n\n  This was the key recommendation made by the Joint Committee on \nTaxation in response to the investigation of Enron's tax transactions.\n  Presently, there is lack of uniformity regarding the proper \napplication of the economic substance doctrine. Some courts apply a \nconjunctive test that requires a taxpayer to establish the presence of \nboth economic substance and a substantial nontax business purpose. \nOther courts have found the existence of one of these as sufficient to \nrespect a transaction.\n  The provision will clarify the application of the doctrine. It does \nnot tell the court when to apply it.\n  A tax shelter disallowed in New York should not be permitted \nelsewhere. The clarification ensures uniformity across the country.\n  The tax shelter legislation included in the CARE Act is only a down \npayment. It will go a long way toward curbing abusive transactions. But \nit is not the final answer.\n  Based on the Joint Committee's investigation of Enron's tax returns, \nadditional steps are needed. The Joint Committee made several specific \nrecommendations for additional changes. We are looking closely at these \nrecommendations. Additional legislation will be forthcoming. I am \nconfident we will make any additional changes with bipartisan support.\n  Enron kept the IRS in the dark and out-maneuvered. The lack of \nadequate disclosure rules and the lack of sufficient IRS enforcement \nresources clearly helped Enron and its executives walk away with \nmillions maybe billions. Our legislation would bring more transparency \nto these Enron-type transactions. The Enron report clearly demonstrates \nthe need for meaningful shelter legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, this is an important day for Senate.\n  As American service men and women risk their lives to relieve the \nsuffering of an oppressed people in Iraq, the Senate is setting aside \nideological differences to energize American compassion to relieve \nsuffering here at home.\n  Over the past few years, the country's economic troubles have carried \na double sting for America's charities. While more Americans are in \nneed, charitable donations have dropped as families feel the pinch of \nthe economic downturn. As a result, many charities have had to cut back \non the services they provide. That means fewer meals for the hungry, \nfewer beds for the homeless, fewer safe havens for battered wives and \nchildren.\n  This legislation, the CARE Act, expands our Nation's capacity to \nrespond to the needs of its citizens who need help. With its passage, \nthe Senate adds the resources of the Federal Government to the \ncommitment of our charities and faith-based organizations.\n  This bill won't solve every problem in our cities and towns. But it \nwill get meaningful aid to organizations and institutions that are \nequipped to help those who need help the most. It also creates real \nincentives to encourage giving and makes it easier for Americans to \ncome to the aid of their fellow citizens.\n  Our country has a history of pulling together to help the less \nfortunate, and the religious community and private charities are an \nintegral part of these efforts.\n  I am pleased that the Senate is helping carry that spirit forward by \nreaffirming the relationship between the Federal Government and our \ncommunity and faith-based groups.\n  I want to commend Senator Lieberman and Senator Santorum for their \nleadership on this legislation.\n  Throughout their work, they have kept sight of two fundamental goals: \nFirst, increasing assistance to those organizations that lend a hand to \nthose in need; and second crafting a bill that reflects the Senate's \nstrong bipartisan support for America's charities.\n  Today all their hard work is being rewarded. And the result will be \ncommunity and faith-based groups that are better equipped to tackle the \nchallenges facing our families and neighborhoods today.\n  This legislation increases funding for social services block grants \nand maternity homes that help teen mothers get their lives back on the \nright track. It also creates new avenues for giving, by making it \neasier to transfer retirement savings into charitable gifts and by \nexpanding the range of deductible donations.\n  While we are forgoing a stronger relationship between the Federal \nGovernment and the faith community, we have been able to accomplish \nthis goal without undermining basic constitutional protections.\n  I was particularly pleased that Senators Santorum and Lieberman were \nable to eliminate some of the more divisive elements of the version \nthat passed the House of Representatives.\n  This compromise package will not privatize Federal social service \nprograms, or pre-empt State and local civil rights laws. These are \ndifficult and divisive issues. But American charities need help today. \nAnd by passing this legislation, the Senate sends a message that when \nour citizens are in need, we cannot hold aid hostage to endless \nideological debate. Compassion is not a partisan issue.\n  All Americans, indeed, all human being, are bound by a common \ncommandment to pursue justice, love kindness, and seek mercy for the \noppressed. It is a standard that should guide all our work.\n  Today, with the passage of this bill, we move a little closer to \nembodying the spirit of these words, and ever closer to fulfilling our \nobligation to one another.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield back all of my time except for \n30 seconds that I want to yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nbecause of his hard work on this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I ask those who are speaking to please take \ntheir conversations off the floor so we can hear the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I thank the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee for the tremendous bipartisan work it \ntook to bring this bill to the floor, where I hope we will have a very \nstrong vote on final passage. Particularly I thank the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Lieberman, for his outstanding cooperation and work to \nmake sure this was done in a very strong, bipartisan way.\n  Finally, I thank Randy Brandt, from my staff, who has put his heart \nand soul into this legislation and just did an outstanding job. I thank \nhim and yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the \nquestion is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Under the previous order, S. 476 \nwill be held at the desk.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I want to take a brief moment to thank \nthe many, many people that helped bring President Bush's words \nsupporting charities and charitable giving into reality.\n  First, I thank my colleague, Senator Baucus. I appreciate his \nbipartisanship on this matter. The people of Montana are well served by \nhis leadership on the Senate Finance Committee. In addition, I thank \nthe Democratic staff on the Finance Committee, Russ Sullivan, Pat Heck \nand Jon Selib, for their work.\n  At this time, I should also commend the work of my staff on the \nFinance Committee, Dean Zerbe for the charitable provisions and Ed \nMcClellan for the corporate shelter legislation. In addition, Mark \nPrater, Elizabeth Paris, Christy Mistr and Diann Howland were critical \nin putting this bill together.\n  It is clear that without the drive and energy of Senators Santorum \nand Lieberman we would not have had this success. I thank them for \ntheir efforts and their staff: Randy Brandt and Chuck Ludlam.\n  I also thank all those behind the scenes who have toiled on the CARE \nAct. Roger Colvineaux, Ron Schultz, Joe Naga from the Joint Committee \non Taxation, as well as Mark Mathiesen from Legislative Counsel who did \nall the drafting.\n  Finally, let me note just a few of the members of the administration \nwho ably served the President in this effort: Jim Towey, David Kuo, and \nSusan Brown at Treasury.\n  Thanks to all for their efforts.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I rise today to express my thanks for the \nSenate's passage of S. 476, the CARE Act, which included my amendment \nrequiring chief executive officers to sign their company's tax returns.\n  And I especially thank Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus and their \nstaffs for working with me on this issue.\n  I offered this amendment last summer when we were debating the \ncorporate governance bill amid the corporate scandals involving Enron, \nWorld Com, and others. In these corporate scandals, the corporate big \nshots got the gold mine while the poor employees and innocent \nstockholders got the shaft.\n  Now, I am as probusiness as anyone in this body. As Governor and \nSenator I have worked to give tax cuts and tax incentives and pay for \nthe training of their employees, all to provide a probusiness \nenvironment in which the entrepreneurial spirit can thrive and prosper \nand create jobs.\n  But folks, there comes a time when so much greed and so many lies \nbecome so bad--even if it is by only a few--that something has to be \ndone. The corporate governance bill we passed last summer will go a \nlong way to protect the investor, provide some security for the worker \nand restore confidence in the market place.\n  My amendment today will help even more. It is only two short \nparagraphs, but it goes to the very essence of fairness. It simply says \nthat when the tax man cometh, we all--workers and high-dollar bosses \nalike--must face him just alike without any go-betweens, liability \nfirewalls or corporate veils.\n\n[[Page S5044]]\n\n  The standard 1040 tax form that individuals must fill out each year \nsays:\n\n       Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined \n     this return and accompanying schedules and statements, and to \n     the best of my knowledge and belief they are true, correct \n     and complete.\n\n  If Joe Sixpack is required to sign this oath for his family, why \nshouldn't Josepheus Chardonnay be required to sign that same oath for \nhis big corporation?\n  So, my amendment simply requires that henceforth the chief executive \nofficer of all publicly owned and publicly traded corporations must \nsign the corporation's annual Federal tax return.\n  Currently, there is an IRS rule that corporations can designate any \ncorporate officer to sign their tax return. But that won't get it, Mr. \npresident. Let's be specific. The CEO is the one who must sign the tax \nreturn and must be accountable for it.\n  Where I come from it is expected that those being paid to mind the \nstore should at least know whether the store is losing or making money.\n  If any CEO is not willing to sign the company tax return if they are \nnot willing to take steps to satisfy themselves that their corporation \nis accurately reporting financial information--then those CEOs have no \nright to the prestige and respect that goes with the position they \nhold.\n  What is good for the goose is good for the gander.\n  So, I thank my colleagues for holding our CEOs to the same standard \nthat we now impose upon our average wage earners.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/09/senate-section/article/S5044-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU.

Madam President, 2 days ago, the Senate passed by unanimous \nconsent H.R. 672, a bill to rename Guam South Elementary and Middle \nSchool after CDR William McCool, the pilot of the Columbia Space \nShuttle.\n  Guam has a unique tie to LCDR William McCool. He lived on Guam and \nattended Dededo Middle School and John F. Kennedy High School in the \n1970s while his father served as a Navy and Marine pilot, a veteran of \nthe Vietnam conflict. His father, Barry, is a Las Vegas resident, as is \nhis mother, Audrey. Commander McCool's mother is dean at the University \nof Nevada, Las Vegas. His dad, Barry, after retiring from the military, \nteaches and is a graduate student at UNLV.\n  Willie was an exceptional student and a talented athlete in high \nschool. He graduated with good grades in high school, of course, and \nwent to the U.S. Naval Academy. He graduated with a 4.0 grade point \naverage at the Academy in Annapolis, but only finished second in his \nclass because one person had a better grade point average. After he \ngraduated from the Academy, he received advanced degrees in computer \nscience and engineering and became an elite pilot.\n  He had more than 400 carrier landings and almost 3,000 hours of \nflight experience in the Navy. Willie McCool was a dedicated father and \nhusband. Due to the tragedy in space, he left behind his wife Lani and \ntheir three sons, Sean, Christopher, and Cameron.\n  As I indicated, Nevada also has a tie with Willie McCool because of \nhis parents. It is traditional in Nevada that every legislative \nsession, the congressional delegation--it used to be very small, of \ncourse, with only three members in the Nevada congressional delegation, \nbut now there are five because of our Third Congressional District. We \nalways go to the legislature and speak. When I spoke this February at \nthe State legislature shortly after this tragedy in space, I had his \nparents there. They traveled from Las Vegas to Carson City for this \njoint session of the legislature. I said a few things, I am sure, that \nthe members of the legislature agreed and thought was OK when I \nmentioned and pointed out his parents. Everyone in the Chamber rose and \napplauded these two very sad but proud parents.\n\n  So I am happy that there is a school in faraway Guam named after \nWillie, who pursued his dream of space with vigor and passion. Teachers \non Guam point to his remarkable life to inspire schoolchildren to dare \nto dream big and believe in themselves and to reach for the stars.\n  While he was at Dededo Middle School in Guam, young Willie wrote a \npoem that was published on the front page of the school newspaper that \nrevealed his love of Guam and his early ambition to be an astronaut. \nThis is a poem written by a child in middle school, but I think it \nreally gives insight into this young man's dreams. This is the poem he \nwrote:\n\n     I came to an island in the middle of the sea,\n     It was so nice that I jumped for glee.\n     There are palm trees, coconuts, and bananas, too\n     Plus birds and fish so unbelievable but true.\n     It is so nice that no one can complain.\n     But he who does must be insane.\n     This is such a nice and beautiful place,\n     You'd think it was heaven--or outer space.\n\n  Even back then, Willie was thinking of going into space, and he did, \nnow leaving behind the proud family members and an entire Nation that \nis aware of the sacrifice he made along with those others on that \nspacecraft.\n  I salute Willie McCool and his family and join in applauding and \ncongratulating those school authorities in Guam who will have a school \nnamed\n\n[[Page S5045]]\n\nafter a visionary, talented American hero.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, it is my understanding that \nthe sponsors of the resolution on the POWs are on their way to the \nChamber. I just left Senator Warner in a briefing with the Secretary of \nDefense. I wish to speak before the sponsors arrive on the subject of \nthe POW resolution.\n  There are two POWs from Florida. Those whom we suspect are POWs are \nthe ones who were interviewed on Al-Jazeera television, who were \ncaptured at about the time that PFC Jessica Lynch was captured. Of \ncourse, that was such a wonderfully successful mission of finding and \nretrieving her. The entire world has rejoiced at her return. From my \nState, one of the unaccounted whom we think is a POW is Private \nWilliams from Orlando, FL.\n  Naturally, I will lend my support to this resolution which is most \nimportant not only to express our concern, but to express and demand \nthat these prisoners of war be treated according to the Geneva \nConvention, which means that under the rules of war we treat prisoners \nof war humanely.\n  The conviction that arises in my voice comes from another POW in Iraq \nof 12 years from Jacksonville, FL, CAPT Scott Speicher. Our Defense \nDepartment made a mistake and initially declared him dead. On the first \nnight of the gulf war 12 years ago, his F-18 was shot down, and we left \na downed pilot. There were a series of mistakes. He was declared dead \nwhen there was not the evidence that he was dead.\n  When we repatriated the POWs in a POW exchange with Iraq, we did not \neven ask for him because at the time, through mistakes, they did not \nthink he was a POW. They sent back surveillance assets to look at the \ncrash site. They gave them the wrong coordinates, so they did not see \nthe wreckage. It was not until some 5 years later that a Qatar hunting \nparty found the wreckage of his jet.\n\n  Once that happened, we started making more inquiries. The American \npress got into it. Lo and behold, years later, the Defense Department \nfinally admitted some of its mistakes and changed his status from \nkilled in action to missing in action. Then just last fall, thanks to \nthe Secretary of the Navy, they changed his status from missing in \naction to missing captured, which is the status for a POW.\n  The Defense Department says they do not know that he is alive. Madam \nPresident, I can tell you that Senator Roberts, who has been joined at \nthe hip with me on this matter because the Speicher family was \noriginally from Kansas and now lives in Florida, and I believe, through \nthe information we have received, that he is alive.\n  It has been published that we have a special team that is now going \ninto Iraq to look for him. What a great day it will be for America if \nwe bring home this American pilot who we walked away from and who has \nbeen gone for 12 years.\n  Of course, we can imagine what has happened to his family, his minor \nchildren first being told their father was dead, and now having hope \nthat he might be alive. It is a tragedy of gargantuan proportions. It \nis a tragedy that is borne out of the fog of war. It is a tragedy of \nbureaucratic ineptness and bureaucratic footdragging, but we can make \nthat right by finding him.\n  Of course, the possibility is that in the ensuing melee, he might be \nused. It is our hope that we will resolve the fate of CAPT Scott \nSpeicher, and it is my prayer, and the prayer of Americans all over \nthis country, that he can be brought home and that he will be alive.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of S. Con. Res. 31. The clerk will report \nthe title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 31) expressing the \n     outrage of Congress at the treatment of certain American \n     prisoners of war by the Government of Iraq.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 1 hour \nof debate evenly divided on the resolution.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this resolution reads in part in the \nwhereas clauses that Saddam Hussein has failed to comply with United \nNations Security Council resolutions, and we enumerate a series of \nresolutions that the military action now underway against Iraq is \nlawful and fully authorized by the Congress in section 38 of Public Law \n107-243, which passed the Senate on October 10, 2002, by a vote of 77 \nto 23 and which passed the House of Representatives on that same day by \na vote of 296 to 33.\n  The whereas clauses, which will be printed in the Record, are \nnumerous but very important, each and every one of them. I shall not go \nthrough them all, but they are:\n\n       Resolved by the Senate, with the House of Representatives \n     concurring, that Congress express its outrage at the flagrant \n     violations by the Government of Iraq of the customary \n     international law and the Geneva Convention relative to the \n     treatment of prisoners of war dated August 12, 1949, and \n     entered into force October 21, 1950;\n       Further resolved, with the Senate supporting, in the \n     strongest terms, the President's warning to Iraq that the \n     United States will hold the Government of Iraq, its \n     officials, and military personnel involved accountable for \n     any and all such violations;\n       Further, expects Iraq to comply with the requirements of \n     the international law of war and the explicit provisions of \n     the Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War \n     which afford prisoners of war the proper and humane treatment \n     they are entitled.\n\n  And lastly:\n\n       Expects that Iraq will afford prisoners of war access to \n     representatives of the International Committee of the Red \n     Cross, as required by the Convention Relative to the \n     Treatment of Prisoners of War.\n\n  Throughout today, the Senate has had a series of briefings from \nsenior representatives from the Departments of Defense and State and \nover 50 Senators attended a briefing given by the Secretary of Defense, \nMr. Rumsfeld, accompanied by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Richard \nMyers.\n  So far as we know, to date, none of the requirements of international \nlaw have yet been met by--I say the Government of Iraq, as the \nresolution does--Saddam Hussein's regime.\n  Prisoners of war have always been a subject that is very important to \nthe Congress of the United States. Just down this hallway in the \nhistoric Rotunda, capped by the dome which is seen throughout the \nNation's Capitol, and which is viewed throughout the world as a symbol \nof liberty--beneath the Capitol dome hangs that flag. It has been there \never since I was privileged to join this institution, and this is my \n25th year, a quarter of a century. It is there because of the constant \nfeeling of the Congress for the unaccounted-for prisoners of war and \nour compassion for the families and the loved ones they leave behind. I \njust want all America to know how important POWs are to this \ninstitution.\n  The distinguished majority leader, Mr. Frist, the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Inouye, \nMr. McCain, myself, and others working very carefully--Senator Lugar \njoined us--put together, in very simple language, the expressions of \nthis body of our concern for those unaccounted for in this war.\n  Today, I think our hearts were somewhat lifted, generally speaking, \nby the reports we received about the progress of the war to date. We \nwatched, with the embedded journalists, as they are referred to, who \nrisked their own lives and safety--a number having been lost\n\n[[Page S5046]]\n\nof recent days--to get the pictures, real time, so the world could see \nthe statue of Saddam Hussein being dragged down to Earth, an act made \npossible by brave men and women of the coalition of forces fighting at \nthis very moment in Iraq.\n  It was a historic moment today. For those of us who have had the \nopportunity to share in history, it brought back memories of the Berlin \nWall. It brought back the memories of the American School, stories of \nwhen the Bastille fell and the prisoners were released.\n  A picture is worth a thousand words. Indeed, this was worth tens upon \ntens of thousands of words as the world witnessed.\n  Our President from the very first characterized this conflict as a \nwar of liberation, a war where the coalition of the willing nations, \nprimarily the United States, Great Britain, Poland, Australia--others \nthat have contributed forces--a coalition of the willing to liberate \nthe people of Iraq. We looked into the faces of many of those people \ntoday and shared with the world their joy--today in Baghdad; a day or \ntwo ago, Basra and elsewhere.\n  We were reminded just a few minutes ago by the Secretary of Defense \nand the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs that it is not over. Much could \nremain to be done. Our forces are committed. Our forces are in place. \nThe sacrifices could once again result from the commitment of these \nbrave young men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States. We \nare witnessing true liberation of an oppressed people, as our \nPresident, George Bush, said it would be.\n  It is important to remember that this moment could not have arrived \nwithout the bravery and professionalism and sacrifices of our young men \nand women in uniform. Those of us who have had the privilege of wearing \nthat uniform in years past--and in a very modest way I have had that \nopportunity, together with many Members of this Chamber--I do not think \nwe can recall a contemporary chapter in our lifetimes where we have \nseen a greater degree of professionalism, commitment, and bravery \nthan by these troops. There were troops on the ground, troops in the \nair, sailors at sea--the precision with which the airmen have dropped \ntheir ordnance, often taking risks to protect as best we can in war the \ninnocent people of this Nation of Iraq.\n\n  From the very onset we have made it clear we are not waging this \nconflict against those people. It is for those people and for their \nliberation. We must also acknowledge the exceptional professionalism, \nmilitary professionalism of those who drew up this plan. There was none \nquite like it in the annals of military history. It had bold features, \nwhich historians will study for years to come. But Secretary Rumsfeld \nand General Tommy Franks, the CENTCOM commander, and others put it \ntogether. There were periods when some--not this Senator but some--\nquestioned whether it was properly drawn up. But now I think without a \ndoubt in the minds of any reasonable people, that plan is working well. \nIt will continue to work well. It will fulfill the goals for which this \nconflict, by necessity of the failure of diplomacy, was initiated.\n  It is also important to remain cautious and vigilant. We were \nreminded of that again in the past hour by the Secretary and the \nGeneral. Much remains to be done to stabilize a precarious security \nsituation and restore order so that humanitarian and reconstruction \nefforts, which are really now underway, can grow in intensity and \nembrace, I hope, the contributions of many nations, not just the \ncoalition of the willing but others who are willing to help these \npeople.\n  Regrettably, more lives may be lost before we can be sure that \nfreedom has been secured and the Saddam Hussein regime has no vestige \nof control for now and forevermore, so we can pursue, in relative \nsecurity, fulfilling the goals for which we set out--to free these \npeople and enable them to establish their own government, hopefully \nthrough a voting process, and elect their own representatives as \nquickly as possible.\n  As we have an uplifting of hearts and minds over the signs of what \ncould be the beginning of the end of this conflict, we mourn for those \nwe lost and renew our pledge to leave no one behind. There are still \nservice men and women missing or captive, and we are make every effort \nto recover them. I particularly note CDR Scott Speicher, U.S. Navy. The \nSecretary just reaffirmed reports that we had heard a special team has \nbeen sent in to rescue this aviator who was among the very first who \nfell in the line of duty. Hopefully, he is alive and one day he can be \nrepatriated to his family and the Navy which he loves so much.\n  The manner in which we have seen the Iraqi regime treat our people \nhas been outrageous, unacceptable by any reasonable standard, by any \ninterpretation of international law, by any understanding of common \ndecency.\n  The resolution we consider today expresses the concerns of the Senate \nabout this treatment and demands that they be treated humanely, as all \ncivilized nations have agreed to do. To those who have witnessed the \nmistreatment or participated in the mistreatment of these brave men and \nwomen, we pledge that they will be held accountable.\n  The fact that there may be no longer a Government of Iraq is of no \nconsequence. Those responsible for violating the rights of our service \nmen and women will be held accountable. No matter where they are, we \nwill eventually find them and hold them accountable.\n  It is noteworthy that we consider this resolution today not only \nbecause of the apparent increase in freedom for the people of Baghdad \nand the symbolic end of this oppressive regime but because President \nBush has declared this day ``National Former POW Recognition Day.''\n  As we recall the service of those national heroes who gave so much in \ndefense of our country, we also must think of our men and women still \nin captivity: We will not forget you. We will work for your fair \ntreatment. We will tirelessly endeavor for your safe and speedy return. \nWe will care for your families. We will leave no one behind.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that relevant material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, 2003\n\n       Americas former Prisoners of War are national heroes whose \n     service to our country will never be forgotten. These brave \n     men and women who fought for America and endured cruelties \n     and deprivation as prisoners of war helped to protect our \n     Nation, liberated millions of people from the threats of \n     tyranny and terror, and advanced the cause of freedom \n     worldwide.\n       This year, our Nation commemorates the 50th anniversary of \n     the signing of the armistice to end armed conflict in the \n     Korean War. We remember Operation Little Switch, conducted \n     April through May 1953, that freed 149 American POWs, and \n     Operation Big Switch, conducted August through September \n     1953, which returned 3,597 Americans to our country. Finally, \n     Operation Glory, conducted July through November 1954, was \n     responsible for the return of the remains of 2,944 Americans \n     from North Korea. During this observance, we also recognize \n     and honor the more than 8,100 Americans still unaccounted for \n     from the Korean War.\n       This year also marks the 30th anniversary of Operation \n     Homecoming, in which 591 American POWs from Vietnam were \n     returned. We also recognize and honor those Americans still \n     unaccounted for from the Vietnam War.\n       All of these individuals are to be honored for their \n     strength of character and for the difficulties they and their \n     families endured. From World War II, the Korean War, and \n     Vietnam, to the 1991 Gulf War, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and \n     other conflicts, our service men and women have sacrificed \n     much to secure freedom, defend the ideals of our Nation, and \n     free the oppressed. By answering the call of duty and risking \n     their lives to protect others, these proud Patriots continue \n     to inspire us today as we work with our allies to extend \n     peace, liberty, and opportunity to people around the world.\n       As we honor our former POWs, we are reminded of our current \n     POWs, captured in Operation Iraqi Freedom. We will work to \n     secure their freedom, and we pray for their speedy and safe \n     return. These brave men and women in uniform follow in the \n     footsteps of these former POWs who placed country above self \n     to advance peace in a troubled world.\n       Now therefore, I GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United \n     States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by \n     the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby \n     proclaim April 9, 2003, as National Former Prisoner of War \n     Recognition Day. I call upon all the people of the United \n     States to join me in remembering former American prisoners of \n     war by honoring the memory of\n\n[[Page S5047]]\n\n     their sacrifices and in praying for the safe return of our \n     POWs. I also call upon Federal, State, and local government \n     officials and private organizations to observe this day with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n       In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth \n     day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and \n     of the Independence of the United States of America the two \n     hundred and twenty-seventh.\n                                                   George W. Bush.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the progress in Iraq has been stunning. \nThe war is not over, but it is within sight. I think we can safely say \nthis looks like the beginning of the end. Saddam Hussein, that brutal \nand murderous dictator, is nowhere to be seen. Baghdad has been \nreclaimed, and the Iraqi people are being liberated.\n  But let us not for a moment forget the service and sacrifice of our \nbrave and brilliant men and women in uniform, which brought us to this \nday. And let us not for a moment forget that in the midst of all this, \nwhile the Iraqi people are being freed, men and women of the American \nmilitary remain prisoners--prisoners of the remnants of Saddam's brutal \nregime.\n  We all recall the heroic rescue of PFC Jessica Lynch last week. One \nsoldier rescued, and so much joy. But that joy and the rush of events \nin Iraq cannot overshadow the danger that continues to face others like \nher who were not so fortunate to be saved from captivity.\n  We cannot and we shall not forget any missing American or POW, not \nfor a moment. And, whether this regime is dying or dead, we cannot and \nwill not allow the brutal treatment of American prisoners at the hands \nof Saddam's regime to unchallenged.\n  One way to do that, is to have the American Government speak with a \nstrong and unified voice against this abhorrent behavior.\n  That is precisely what the resolution before us, S. Con. Res. 31, \ndoes. It expresses support for our troops reaffirms the international \nstandards that have bound and will continue to bind the U.S. military \nin our treatment of Iraqi prisoners, makes clear the outrage of this \nCongress at Iraq's appalling and criminal treatment of American \nprisoners of war, and commits us, as a nation, to follow through and \nhold those who commit crimes against our soldiers accountable for their \nactions.\n\n  My colleague from Virginia and I offer this resolution proudly, for \nthose Americans in captivity and those who may fall into captivity from \nthis day forward. I am sure that I speak for both of us when I say that \nwe are deeply gratified that our colleagues from Alaska and Hawaii, \nSenator Stevens and Senator Inouye--two honorable men whose \ncontributions to this Nation on the battlefield are well-known--have \njoined us in cosponsoring this resolution. I further wish to thank \nSenator Frist, our majority leader, and my good friend, Senator Tom \nDaschle, the Democratic leader, for their support.\n  This is not a partisan issue. It is not a question of politics. This \nis a matter of honor. And honor is something clearly lacking in the \nIraqi regime.\n  The insulting and humiliating manner in which American prisoners of \nwar have been publicly paraded and interrogated on state television is \nbad enough. To have members of the American Armed Forces allegedly \nexecuted in public--shot in the back of the head--is reprehensible. To \nhave their bodies publicly displayed on state television was inhumane \nsacrilege.\n  I have been appalled--and I know I am not alone--by the flagrant \nviolations of the rules of warfare and the Geneva Convention that we \nhave witnessed these past weeks.\n  It is a violation of the Geneva Convention and the customary rules of \nwar to mistreat prisoners of war. If the detailed legal terms are too \nmuch for Iraq's rulers, let me put it simply. You don't shoot \nprisoners. You don't torture them. You protect them. You treat them \nwith decency as enemies in combat but fellow human beings.\n  But I am not surprised at what Saddam's henchmen are doing. For \nanyone who has yet to be convinced of the evil and tyrannical nature of \nSaddam's regime, I cannot imagine what greater proof is needed than the \nconduct of this regime in this conflict.\n  During the course of this war, which is hopefully now drawing to a \nclose, Saddam has once again proven himself to be every bit as \nbarbarous, every bit as cruel, and--yes--every bit as evil as we knew \nhim to be.\n  Saddam and his son, Uday, have inserted members of the Fedayeen into \nthe regular army in order to force soldiers and conscripts to fight, \nunder the threat of murder or torture. They have sent those same \nFedayeen into the villages and streets of Iraq, intimidating and \nterrorizing innocent civilians. These disgraceful thugs have been \nreported to have turned their guns on innocent Iraqi civilians--their \nown people--attempting to leave Basra.\n  The list goes on and on. Last week, paramilitary troops hid in the \nAli Mosque in Kut, and opened fire on coalition forces--hoping that we \nwould respond, and fire upon one of the holiest shrines in Shi'a Islam. \nI am pleased to note, that our troops showed restraint. Respect. They \ndid not respond to the provocations.\n  That is honor. That is the understanding that even in war there are \nnorms and there are rules. There is a difference between right and \nwrong. That is why the Coalition forces are providing prisoners of war \nwith food and water. We have given the Red Cross free and open access. \nWe do not believe that the crimes and inhumanity of Saddam's regime \nnaturally extend to every member of his military.\n\n  We have especially sought to spare civilian life. It is a painful \nreality of war that civilian lives are lost in conflict. But the \nprecision with which our military operates, the care we take to avoid \ncivilian casualties, is unparalleled in the history of armed conflict. \nIt has been said that the United States is more concerned about the \nsafety and welfare of Iraqi civilians than the Iraqi Government. That \nis sadly, true.\n  Let me say again. This is--and I hope I can change the verb tense \nsoon to ``has been''--a just and necessary war against a dangerous \ndictator. Coalition forces have fought with honor, with nobility, and \nwith morality.\n  Our attempts to avoid civilian casualities, however, have been made \nmore difficult by the Iraqi regime's adoption of terrorist tactics: \nWeapons hidden in hospitals, anti-chemical warfare suits and antidotes \nsecreted in schools, troops hidden in civilian clothing who surrender, \nonly to shoot our troops in the back.\n  The Iraqi regime has officially sanctioned the use of suicide \nbombings against our soldiers--adopting a tactic they have seen used \nwith what they would call success against innocent civilians in Israel.\n  All this made clear that in Iraq we were not fighting, are not \nfighting, a separate war from the war against terrorism. Some say \nSaddam and bin Laden have different ideologies, different ambitions. \nBut they share the same inhumane tactics, the same hatred for all who \nare different, the same fear of freedom, the same brutality and \ncruelty.\n  The resolution that we offer today cannot adequately convey our shock \nand disgust at the manner in which Saddam's regime has acted because \nthere are not sufficient words to do so. But it is a clear statement of \nanger and of principle, and a clear statement of our intent to hold all \nthose who commit war crimes accountable.\n  There should be no mistake. America does not simply speak about the \nrules of war. We live by them. And we do not merely condemn atrocities. \nWe, as a Nation, will find those responsible and make them pay.\n  This is only a resolution. It cannot do what those Marines and \nSpecial Forces did in rescuing an American POW any more than a yellow \nribbon tied around a lamppost or a tree. But it is an appropriate \nexpression of our values, of our resolve, and a statement of our \nsolidarity with those who risk their lives half a world away to secure \nour freedom.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the world is now well aware of the story \nsurrounding PFC Jessica Lynch, the young soldier from Palestine, WV, \nwho was taken prisoner by the Iraqi military on March 23. She is now \nrecovering from her captivity at a military\n\n[[Page S5048]]\n\nhospital in Germany. While we regard with awe the reports of her \ncourage at the time of her capture, as well as the daring of the troops \nwho carried out her rescue from that hospital deep in Iraq, our Nation \ncannot forget that there are others who have been captured or who have \ngone missing during this war. The Pentagon reports that seven Americans \nremain in Iraqi hands, and that eight of our troops remain missing.\n  These troops deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. The \nresolution before the Senate, which will shortly be voted on, is right \nto point out that the Government of Iraq, even in the waning days of \nits authority, is obligated under the Geneva Convention and customary \ninternational law to give humane treatment for our captured troops and \nprotect them against acts of violence or intimidation and against \ninsults and public curiosity.\n  The resolution makes a clear and commendable statement about how we \nexpect our prisoners of war to be treated by Iraq. I think it is \nunfortunate that the resolution raises political issues about the \npolicies that brought us to war in the Persian Gulf. Like two previous \nresolutions passed by the Senate, the preamble to this resolution, as \nit will be amended, will contain a clause which states, in part, \n``Whereas, the military action now underway against Iraq is lawful and \nfully authorized by the Congress in Sec. 3(a) of Public Law 107-243.''\n  I do not concede that this war is lawful. I do not concede that it \nhas been fully authorized by Congress. The Constitution clearly states \nthat Congress shall have the power to declare war. That is one of the \npowers that Congress should not have the power to delegate to any \nPresident, which is exactly what Congress attempted to do in the use of \nforce resolution passed by the Senate on October 11, 2002, which I \nvoted against, and which I am proud I voted against. Allowing a \nPresident, whether Democrat or Republican, to exercise powers that are \nintended to reside only with the legislative branch is the surest way \nto upset the careful system of checks and balances that was designed by \nthe Framers of the Constitution.\n  It appears that Baghdad is now falling under the control of U.S. \nforces. It is my sincere hope that the war can soon be brought to its \nconclusion, but the cessation of hostilities may still be some time \naway. We do our captured and missing service men and women no favors by \nglossing over the realities of this war. I hope that the 15 service \nmembers who are now captured or missing will be able to return to the \nsafety of their homes and the love of their families. And it is in this \nvein that I will vote for the resolution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that immediately following the vote on adoption of S. Con. Res. \n31, the Senate proceed to executive session and an immediate vote on \nthe confirmation of Calendar No. 106, Dee Drell, to be U.S. District \nJudge for the Western District of Louisiana; provided further, that \nfollowing that vote, the Senate proceed to a vote on Calendar No. 107, \nRichard Bennett, to be U.S. District Judge for the District of \nMaryland; finally, I ask consent that following those votes, the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action.\n  Also, I ask unanimous consent that all time be yielded back on S. \nCon. Res. 31 and that the vote occur immediately.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on adoption of S. Con. Res. 31.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from Iowa \n(Mr. Harkin) would vote ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The President shall be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's actions on these nominations.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am pleased today to speak in support of \nDee Dodson Drell, who has been nominated to the United States District \nCourt for the Western District of Louisiana, Alexandria Division.\n  Mr. Drell began his legal career with the U.S. Army Judge Advocate \nGeneral's Corp upon graduation from Tulane University School of Law in \n1971. He began his tour of duty as a defense counsel for courts \nmartial, handling both misdemeanor and felony-level cases. He next \nmoved to the position of prosecutor, during which time he was named \nChief of Military Justice. He remained in that position until he \ncompleted his military service in 1975, after which he entered private \npractice.\n  Mr. Drell then joined the law firm of Gravel, Roy & Burnes. His \npractice focused primarily on personal injury, criminal defense and \ngeneral civil litigation. In 1981, Drell joined the law firm of Gold, \nWeems, Bruser, Sues & Rundell, where he is currently a member and \ndirector. His primary areas of practice are insurance defense, \ncontracts, employment law, health benefits and civil litigation.\n  Mr. Dell has a strong commitment to pro bono work that extends beyond \nhis regular law practice. It includes work with organizations that \nprovide services to people suffering from AIDS and AIDS-related \nillnesses. He provides legal services as a volunteer counselor for \nCentral Louisiana AIDS Support\n\n[[Page S5050]]\n\nServices and AIDSLaw of Louisiana, Inc. He has also served as a legal \nadvisor to the board of Shepherd Ministries, an ecumenically-based \nreligious organization that provides services to the disadvantaged.\n  Throughout his career, Mr. Drell has won many accolades, such as \nrecognition in Outstanding Young Men of America, 1976; designation as a \nLouisiana Bar Foundation Charter Fellow, 1998; and receipt of the \nProfessionalism Award from the Crossroads-American Inn of Court, 2000.\n  I am confident that Mr. Drell will serve on the bench with \ncompassion, integrity and fairness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I am also pleased today to speak in support of \nRichard D. Bennett, who has been nominated to the United States \nDistrict Court for the District of Maryland.\n  Mr. Bennett is a distinguished practitioner whose career includes two \nterms of service with the United States Attorney's Office for the \nDistrict of Maryland. His outstanding legal skills have been widely \nrecognized, including mention in the 2003-2204 edition of The Best \nLawyers in America.\n  Mr. Bennett began his legal career following his graduation from the \nUniversity of Maryland School of Law in 1973. After graduation, he \nworked for the Baltimore law firm of Smith, Somerville & Case, where he \nspecialized in insurance defense, as well as general civil and criminal \nlitigation.\n  Mr. Bennett left private practice in 1976 to serve his first term \nwith the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Maryland as \nAssistant U.S. Attorney. While there, he persecuted white collar crime, \ndrug offenses, environmental violations, and virtually every kind of \ncriminal case brought by the office. He served in that position until \nthe end of 1980.\n  Next, Mr. Bennett and another former prosecutor formed a law \npartnership, Marr & Bennett, in early 1981. The practice specialized in \nfederal and state litigation, with an emphasis on insurance and white \ncollar criminal defense.\n  Mr. Bennett then merged his practice with the firm of Weaver & Bendos \nin 1989. He continued to specialize in Federal and State litigation.\n  In 1991, Mr. Bennett left Weaver, Bendos & Bennett to serve a second \nterm with the U.S. Attorney's Office, this time as a U.S. Attorney, \nafter being nominated by President George H.W. Bush and confirmed by \nthe Senate. He served in that capacity until 1993.\n  Mr. Bennett has since returned to private practice as a partner with \nMiles & Stockbridge, one of Maryland's most prestigious law firms. His \npractice has increasingly focused on white collar criminal defense, \ngovernment investigations, internal investigations, and grand jury \npractice. He served as Special Counsel to the Government Reform and \nOversight Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives from August \n1997 until June 1998.\n  Mr. Bennett has the support of both Maryland Senators, along with a \nunanimous ``Well Qualified'' ABA rating. With his legal acumen and \nexperience as both defense counsel and federal prosecutor, I am \nconfident that Mr. Bennett will make a fine jurist on the Federal \nbench.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. With today's confirmation vote on the nominations of Dee \nDrell to the United States District Court for the Western District of \nLouisiana and Richard Bennett to the United States District Court of \nMaryland, Senate Democrats again demonstrate their bipartisanship \ntoward consensus nominees.\n  With these confirmations the Senate will have confirmed 18 judicial \nnominees of President Bush so far this year and 118 overall.\n  During the entire four years of President Clinton's second term as \nPresident, Republicans never, not once, allowed the number of vacancies \nto dip below 50. The last time vacancies hit 49 was 7 years ago.\n  So far this year we have confirmed more judicial nominees of \nPresident Bush than the Republican majority was willing to confirm in \nthe entire 1996 session when President Clinton was in the White House. \nThat entire year only 17 judges were confirmed all year and that \nincluded none to the circuit courts, not one. In contrast, already this \nsession two highly controversial circuit court nominees have already \nbeen confirmed among the 18 judges the Senate has approved to date. \nThose confirmations, including one that had more negative votes than \nthe required number of be filibustered but who was not filibustered, \nnever get acknowledged in partisan Republican talking points.\n  We are also ahead of the pace the Republican majority set in 1999 \nwhen it was considered President Clinton's judicial nominees--almost 6 \nmonths ahead. It was not until October that the Senate confirmed as \nmany as 18 judicial nominees in 1999.\n  In the prior 17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee, we were \nable to confirm 100 judges and vastly reduce the judicial vacancies \nthat Republicans had stored up by refusing to allow scores of judicial \nnominees of President Clinton to be considered. We were able to do so \ndespite the White House's refusal to consult with Democrats on circuit \ncourt vacancies and many district court vacancies.\n  There is no doubt that the judicial nominees of this President are \nconservatives, many of them quite to the right of the mainstream. Many \nof these nominees have been active in conservative political causes or \ngroups. Democrats moved fairly and expeditiously on as many as we could \nconsistent with our obligations to evaluate carefully and thoroughly \nthese nominees to lifetime seats in the Federal courts. And we continue \nto do so.\n  Unfortunately, many of this President's judicial nominees have proven \nto be quite controversial and we have had serious concerns about \nwhether they would be fair judges if confirmed to lifetime positions. \nThose controversial judges take more time and raise more concerns.\n\n  So, despite the fact that we are considering more controversial \nnominees from this President than with President Clinton, and despite \nthe progress we have made in reducing judicial vacancies to the lowest \nlevel ever attained while President Clinton was in office and despite \nthe pace of the lowest level ever attained while President Clinton was \nin office and despite the pace of confirmations, which exceeds that \nmaintained by the Republican majority in 1999, Republicans still do \nnothing but criticize and castigate Senators if every judicial nominee \nis not confirmed by the Senate after a short debate.\n  The question I have been asking and the American people should ask is \nwhy are the Senate Republicans picking fights rather than working with \nus to make additional progress. The best example of that is the \nRepublican insistence on seeking to proceed on the most controversial \namong the President's nominees instead of the circuit court nominations \nthat Democratic Senators have supported and will support to the Fifth \nCircuit, the nomination of Judge Edward Prado of Texas. Judge Prado's \nnomination was unanimously reported by the Judiciary Committee. To \ndate, there has been no effort by the Republican leadership to allow \nthe Senate to consider and vote on that nomination. I do not believe \nthe cynical comments of some that Republicans will not allows us to \nturn to the Prado nomination because he is Hispanic and when the Senate \nconfirms him it would demonstrate yet again that the outrageous charges \nof anti-Hispanic sentiment that Republicans have tried to make against \nDemocrats were and are ridiculous.\n  When Senator Hatch was chairman of the Committee and a Democratic \nPresident occupied the White House, Senator Hatch denied that even 100 \nvacancies was a vacancies crisis, according to a column he wrote for \nthe September 5, 1997 edition of USA Today. During the Clinton \nadministration, Senator Hatch repeatedly said that 67 vacancies was the \nequivalent of ``full employment'' in the Federal judiciary. As of these \nconfirmations, there are not 49 judicial vacancies.\n  By Senator Hatch's standards we have reached well beyond ``full \nemployment'' on the Federal bench.\n  Vacancies have dropped to this level in large part because during 17 \nmonths of Democratic control of the Senate, we confirmed 100 of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees, even though Republicans averaged \nonly 38 confirmations per year during their prior 6\\1/2\\ years of \ncontrol of the Senate. We inherited 110 vacancies by the time the \ncommittee\n\n[[Page S5051]]\n\nwas permitted to reorganize in the summer of 2001, and we confirmed 100 \njudicial nominees.\n  This historic number of confirmations in less than a year and a half, \ncut the number of vacancies to 60. There were 40 new retirements in \nthis period. Chairman Hatch never acted as quickly on Clinton nominees.\n  The Democratic leadership also moved to confirm 17 circuit court \nnominees, some of them quite controversial, in those 17 months, even \nthough Chairman Hatch averaged only 7 circuit court confirmations per \nyear during the Clinton administration. This year, two more circuit \nnominees of President Bush have been confirmed, although other \ncontroversial ones have not.\n\n  These 19 confirmations of Bush circuit court nominees have reduced \nthe number of circuit vacancies to 23. During the Clinton \nadministration, Chairman Hatch and Senate Republicans blocked the \nconfirmation of 22 circuit court nominees through anonymous holds, blue \nslips, and other procedures. Had those nominees been confirmed, and had \nBush won the confirmation of 19 circuit nominees to vacancies that \narose during his Presidency, the current number of circuit vacancies \nwould be 1.\n  Republicans caused what they call the circuit vacancy crisis. The \nnumber of circuit vacancies more than doubled from 16 in January 1995 \nwhen Republicans took over the Senate to 33 in the summer of 2001, when \nthe committee was permitted to reorganize under Democratic control. \nStill, the Senate has already confirmed 19 of his circuit court \nnominees in less than 2 years. By comparison, President Reagan had 19 \ncircuit nominees confirmed in his first 2 years in office as did \nPresident Clinton. The difference is that in both of those \nadministrations, the Presidents were working with Senate majorities of \nthe same political party.\n  Lately I have heard Republicans complaining that not all of this \nPresident's circuit nominees have yet been confirmed, but he has had so \nmany vacancies due to the massive obstruction of circuit seats by \nRepublicans in the Clinton administration, doubling the number of \ncircuit vacancies, as opposed to keeping the rate of vacancies steady \nor reducing them. Republicans now can be heard to complain that some \ncircuit court nominees did not get a vote in 1992, but that situation \ndoes not compare to the long stall of Clinton's circuit court nominees, \nand her is why:\n  Only 10 of the circuit nominees of President George H.W. Bush did not \nget a vote by the committee. Twenty-two of Clinton's circuit nominees \ndid not get votes by the committee during Republican control. That is \nmore than twice as many. Additionally, President George H.W. Bush won \nthe confirmation of 67 percent of his circuit nominees between 1991 and \n1992, a Presidential election year, which was consistent with prior \nPresidential election year congresses for President Reagan. In \ncontrast, President Clinton won confirmation of only 15 of 34 circuit \nnominees in 1999-2000, about 44 percent.\n  Thus, because of the Republican success in blocking appellate judges, \nPresident Clinton's circuit court nominees were actually more likely \nthan not to not be confirmed, an indignity not suffered by Bush's \nnominees. This was nothing compared to 1996, the first election year in \nmodern history and recollection in which not a single circuit nominee \nwas confirmed all year, with Republicans in charge. Plus, I would note \nthat 6 of President Clinton's circuit nominees in 1999-2000 were \nactually re-nominees, like Judge Richard Paez who even Chairman Hatch \nadmitted was ``filibustered'' in 2000 and who waited more than 1,500 \ndays to be confirmed.\n  In fact, when you look at the actual percent of confirmations by \nsession rather than the combined figure for two years, the percent of \nClinton nominees blocked by Republicans is even more shocking. During \n1999, only 7 of 25 Clinton circuit nominees were confirmed, or 28 \npercent, and 1999 was not a Presidential election year. In contrast, in \n1991, the first President Bush won the confirmation of 9 of 17 \nnominees, or 53 percent. In 2000, Clinton won confirmation of 8 out of \n25 nominees, including those not acted on in 1999, or 32 percent. In \ncontrast in 1992, Bush won the confirmation of 11 of 21 circuit \nnominees, including those not acted on in 1991, which again was more \nthan 52 percent.\n  Despite the wide-scale obstruction or filibustering of Clinton \ncircuit vacancies--filibustering after all comes from the Dutch word \nfor piracy or taking things that do not belong to you--Democrats worked \nhard to turn the other cheek and fill vacancies that were allowed to go \nunfilled due to Republican holds.\n  For example, under Democratic leadership, the Senate held the first \nhearing for a nominee to the Fourth Circuit in 3 years and confirmed \nhim and another most controversial nominee, even though seven of \nPresident Clinton's nominees to that circuit never received hearings \nfrom Republicans. We proceed with the first hearing for a nominee to \nthe Fifth Circuit in 7 years and confirmed her, even though three of \nPresident Clinton's nominees to that circuit never received hearings. \nIn fact, we held hearings for all three of President Bush's nominees to \nthat circuit even though three of President Clinton's nominees, Enrique \nMoreno, Jorge Rangel, and Alston Johnson, were never allowed hearings \nby Republicans.\n  We proceeded with the first hearing on a nominee to the Sixth Circuit \nin almost 5 years and confirmed her and another controversial nominee \nto that circuit even though three of President Clinton's nominees to \nthat circuit never received a hearing. We proceeded with the first \nhearing on a nominee to the Tenth Circuit in 6 years and confirmed \nthree, even though two of President Clinton's nominees to that circuit \nwere never allowed hearings. With the confirmation of the controversial \nTim Tymkovich to the Tenth Circuit last week we have now filled a total \nof four vacancies on that court. The seat to which he was nominated had \nbeen vacant for more than 4 years despite President Clinton having \nnominated two qualified nominees, neither of whom was ever accorded a \nhearing.\n  Had President Clinton's circuit court nominees been confirmed, the \ncircuit courts would have been evenly balanced, with six circuits with \na majority of Democratic appointees and six circuits with a majority of \nRepublican appointees and one circuit with an even number of Democratic \nand Republican appointees.\n  If President Bush succeeds in winning the confirmation of nominees to \nevery circuit vacancy he inherited plus the ones that have arisen since \nthen, only two circuits will have a majority of Democratic appointees \nand 11 will have a majority of Republican appointees. In many of those \ncircuits, the Republican appointees will have at least a 2-1 majority \non every panel on average. More than 67 percent of the appointments to \nthose courts will be by Republicans.\n  It is also important to remember when comparing what Republicans did \nto President Clinton's circuit nominees to what happened in 1992 that \nChairman Biden moved through 66 of President Bush's judicial nominees \nin 1992, President George H.W. Bush's best year for confirmations, \ndespite it being a Presidential election year. However, the Senate \ncould not get through all of the nominees following the bipartisan \njudgeship bill of 1990 which increased the size of the Federal courts \nby more than 100 seats.\n  In the 102nd Congress, Chairman Biden got through 124 of President \nGeorge H.W. Bush's nominees, including his nominee to the Supreme \nCourt, Clarence Thomas. In fact, the Republicans did not allow \nPresident Clinton to win the confirmation of a many judges in 1999 and \n2000 combined as Chairman Biden got through for President Bush in 1992 \nalone.\n  Finally, I would note that Chairman Biden moved through 20 circuit \ncourt nominees for President Bush in the 102nd Congress. As a \nconsequence, the first President Bush was able to appoint 42 circuit \njudges in his one term as a President. Because of Republicans' blockade \nof any circuit court nominee to be confirmed in 1996, President Clinton \nwas able to appoint only 30 circuit judges in his first term, more than \n25 percent fewer than his predecessor, President George H.W. Bush, who \nhad a Democratic Senate during his entire Presidency. In President \nClinton's two full terms, Republican obstruction limited him to 65 \ncircuit court appointment in those 8 years.\n  In contrast, President George W. Bush has already appointed 19 \ncircuit\n\n[[Page S5052]]\n\njudges and, as I have indicated, the 20th confirmation, that of Judge \nPrado is stalled only because Republicans have refused to proceed to \nhis consideration.\n  President Bush is poised to appoint at least one-quarter of Federal \nappellate courts in just one term, due to the large number of circuit \ncourt vacancies he inherited from President Clinton which were the \nresult of widespread Republican obstruction.\n  The solution to the current logjam over circuit court judges is not \nto move them through more quickly with less scrutiny. The solution is \nfor this President to consult with Senators from both parties in \nfinding mainstream, consensus nominees, rather than this parade of \nactivists and extremists that we have witnessed over these past few \nmonths. This President wants a clean slate on judicial nominees, but he \nrefuses to do any of the work necessary to clean that slate. Instead of \nbeing a uniter in his judicial choices, he has divided this Senate and \nthe American people by deferring to the far right wing of his party in \nthe only lifetimes appointments in our entire government.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee has been ridiculed, and I am sad to \nsay, rightly so, for becoming a rubberstamp, an assembly line for these \nimportant nominations to the second highest courts in our Federal \nGovernment. The solution is genuine consultation and accommodation \nrather than this race to pack the courts and tip the balance with \nnominees who have shown a lack of respect for individual rights.\n  I am pleased to say, however, that not all of his nominees have been \nextremists. Particularly for the district court nominees when there has \nbeen bipartisan consultation, some of the judicial nominees have been \nconservative but within the mainstream.\n  Since the Republican majority will not allow the Senate to consider \nJudge Prado, let me turn briefly to the nominees before the Senate. Mr. \nDrell has been a lawyer's lawyer, rather than a political or judicial \nactivist as so many of President Bush's circuit nominees are. Dr. Drell \nhas been a member and a leader of numerous State and Local bar \nassociations. He served on the State Committee or Post-Conviction \nRepresentation for 5 years and assisted the State bar with attorney \ndisciplinary matters. Dr. Drell has been active in the Family Mediation \nCouncil of Louisiana, where he served as a board member from 1986 to \n1992.\n  He also served as board member of the Rapides Parish Indigent \nDefender Board from 1987 to 1994. He served on the Louisiana Task Force \non Racial and Ethnic Fairness in the Courts.\n  Mr. Drell has also devoted a considerable amount of time to helping \nindividuals suffering with AIDS on a pro bono basis. He is directly \ninvolved as volunteer counsel for Central Louisiana AIDS Support \nServices and AIDSLaw of Louisiana, Inc. These two organizations provide \nservices to persons with AIDS and AIDS-related complex. He has also \ndevoted time to the Delta Region AIDS Education and Training Center. In \n1997, he received the Pro Bono Publico Award in 1997 from AIDSLaw of \nLouisiana.\n  Mr. Drell ha a record of accomplishment and compassion as a lawyer of \nwhich we can all be proud. He has the full support of both of his home-\nState Senators. His record has generated no controversy or criticism. \nIf only, our circuit court nominees had records such as his. This \nnomination is a good example of the kind of candidate who engenders \nbipartisan support.\n  I congratulate Mr. Drell, his family and the Senators from Louisiana \non his nomination and confirmation.\n  The other nominee confirmed today is Richard Bennett of Maryland. \nThere is no doubt that Mr. Bennett is a conservative and a Republican, \nyet he has the support of his home-State Senators and the support of \nSenate Democrats.\n  In 1991, Mr. Bennett was chosen by President George H.W.

Madam President, we lost a young man from Connecticut in \nthe Iraq conflict a few days ago. I want to take a few minutes to pay \ntribute to Marine SSGT Phillip Jordan of Enfield, CT, who was killed in \naction while on a combat mission in Iraq.\n  All Americans have been closely following our troops in Iraq since \nthe war began 2 weeks ago. Every day we hear lots of facts and figures \nabout the war, the number of sorties in the air, the number of tanks in \nthe field, and the locations of various divisions throughout Iraq. We \nmust never forget that behind those statistics are people. These people \nare our constituents, young men and women in uniform from all across \nthis great land of ours, some who are not even citizens of this country \nbut who have green cards and want to demonstrate their commitment to \nAmerica by serving in the Armed Forces and commit themselves to do a \njob in the Persian Gulf because they have been asked to by the \nPresident.\n  We must never forget that each and every one of the more than 225,000 \nbrave service men and women fighting in Iraq have family and friends at \nhome to fight for our country overseas. Each of these heroes is making \na tremendous contribution, a personal sacrifice, so all of us can be \nmore secure in the United States.\n  Inevitably, in a conflict such as this, there are those who will make \nthe ultimate sacrifice, some who will never return to their family and \nfriends and communities. I would like to share the story of one of \nthose fine Americans for a few moments this evening.\n\n[[Page S5053]]\n\n  The individual I want to talk about is SSGT Phillip Jordan who was 42 \nyears of age. He lived in Enfield with his wife Amanda and their 6-\nyear-old son Tyler. His devotion to his country caused him to enlist in \nthe Marines some 15 years ago as a private. Sergeant Jordan quickly \nadvanced in the ranks to become a gunnery sergeant.\n  In 1991, he served in his first combat mission as a platoon leader in \nOperation Desert Storm, the first Persian Gulf war. After that \nconflict, Sergeant Jordan was based at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina \nbefore becoming a drill sergeant at Parris Island, SC. For 3 years he \ntaught countless new recruits how to become U.S. marines. Few were \nbetter suited for the task--friends, family and his marine colleagues \nreferred to Sergeant Jordan as a ``Marine's Marine'' for his can-do \nprofessional attitude. Just before he was shipped out in January to \nserve in the second Persian Gulf war, Sergeant Jordan was asked how he \nfelt about once again being called to serve in combat. His response \nwas: ``This is what I do. That's my job.''\n  He did that job with unflinching valor. Phillip Jordan was much more \nthan just a fine marine. He was an incredibly fine, loving husband and \nremarkable father. Amanda Jordan described her husband as a caring and \nloving man who would go out of his way to do a favor for anyone at all. \nEach and every Sunday when he was home, he would make his family a \nhomemade breakfast, right down to the flowers and fresh-squeezed orange \njuice. While stationed overseas, letters home always included two \nparts, one that began ``Dear Amanda'' and the other began ``Dear \nTyler'' so that Tyler would have a letter of his own. Tyler certainly \nread those letters. He says he wants to grow up to be a marine some \nday, just like his father. There would be, perhaps, no more fitting \ntribute to a man who showed such tremendous dedication and devotion to \nhis family and his Nation.\n  Phillip Jordan's friends liked to call him ``Gump,'' after the movie \n11Forrest Gump,'' for his eternal optimism. Tragically, in times of \nwar, such optimism is not always rewarded. We, as a Nation, can be \nassured a victory in this conflict and any others which may challenge \nus down the line, because we know our fighting forces are made up of \nmen and women who share Phillip Jordan's sense of commitment and \nstrength of character. We must always be mindful of the price they and \ntheir loved ones have paid for our freedom and our security, especially \nthose like Phillip Jordan who paid the highest price of all.\n  Phillip Jordan was not the first casualty of this war and regrettably \nhe will not be the last. It is important for all of us at this moment \nin time to reach out to the many families who have an empty chair at \ntheir dinner table because a father or mother, brother, sister, son, or \ndaughter has been called to serve their Nation in a distant land. These \nfamilies need our support more now than ever.\n  Young Tyler Jordan was asked the other day about his dad. He said he \nwas confident his father was the best marine in Heaven.\n  On behalf of the Senate, I thank Phillip Jordan for his service to \nAmerica, and extend the deepest sympathies, not only of my family but \nalso of all of the Senate, to express our condolences to Amanda and \nTyler Jordan and to that family. Our thoughts and prayers are with \nthem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred September 28, \n2001 in New York, NY. A Yemeni man was badly beaten in the Bronx while \nworking at his newsstand. Three local men allegedly yelled, ``You Arabs \nget out of my neighborhood--we hate Arabs! This is war!'' before \ndragging him outside and hitting him in the head with a bottle.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/09/senate-section/article/S5053-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ARMENIAN GENOCIDE 88TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today people around the world are \npausing to remember and honor the victims of the Armenian genocide, \nwhich began 88 years ago in what is now Turkey. Between 1915 and 1923, \none-and-a-half million Armenians--roughly 60 percent of the total \nArmenian population--were systematically murdered at the hands of \nagents of the Ottoman Empire, and hundreds of thousands more were \nforced to leave their homes. At that time, the word ``genocide'' had \nnot yet entered our vocabulary. Now, 88 years later, this brutal \nepisode of violence against the Armenian people is considered to have \nbeen the first, but unfortunately not the last, genocide of the 20th \ncentury.\n  Two decades later, in 1939, as Adolph Hitler, confident that history \nwould exonerate him, prepared to send his armies into Poland with \ninstructions to slaughter people indiscriminately and without mercy, he \nrhetorically asked his advisers: ``Who, after all, speaks today of the \nannihilation of the Armenians?'' That is precisely why I speak today, \nand every year on this date, to honor the Armenian people who lost \ntheir lives nearly a century ago and to remind the American people that \nthe capacity for violence and hate is still prevalent in our world \ntoday.\n  Just in the last decade, we have seen systematic efforts to \nextinguish people because of their ethnicity in Bosnia, Rwanda, and \nKosovo. Last year the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope noted a ``sharp escalation'' of anti-Semitic violence in Europe. \nApparently, even lessons as searing and tragic as those of the \nHolocaust can be forgotten if we do not remain vigilant in our efforts \nto remember them.\n  Last year, as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa, I had the \nopportunity to visit the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, \nwhich is setting groundbreaking legal precedents with regard to the \ntreatment of genocide. Through such tribunals, the international \ncommunity should send a powerful message to would-be mass-murderers \nthat such horrific acts will not go unpunished. Since I became a member \nof the U.S. Senate, I have striven to make protection of basic human \nrights, and accountability for such atrocities, cornerstones of U.S. \nforeign policy, and I will continue to do so as long as I am here.\n  Today, we remember the men, women and children who perished in the \nArmenian genocide, because to forget them, or any of the countless \nmillions who have been murdered because of their ethnicity over the \npast century, would be to invite such tragic episodes to be repeated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/09/senate-section/article/S5053-4", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5053-S5054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PROTECTING CHILDREN AGAINST CRIME ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as you know, April is Child Abuse \nPrevention Month, and this week is National Crime Victims' Rights Week. \nFurthermore, just last week, I joined with my friends and colleagues, \nSenators Lincoln and Shelby, in announcing our creation of a new, \nbipartisan Senate\n\n[[Page S5054]]\n\nCaucus on Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children. And, just \nyesterday, I introduced the Protecting Children Against Crime Act of \n2003, S.810.\n  I thank Senators Grassley, Hutchison, and Shelby for joining me as \noriginal cosponsors of the Protecting Children Against Crime Act of \n2003. This important legislation would help protect our nation's \nchildren from the most heinous of criminals--child abductors, child \npornographers, and others who would exploit or abuse children.\n  Every day, our local police and prosecutors are on the front line in \nthe fight against the criminals who target children, and they deserve \nrecognition for their hard work. However, the data suggest that law \nenforcement is fighting an uphill battle--child victimization remains a \nlarge, pervasive, and extremely troubling problem in the United States.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, up to one in three \ngirls and one in seven boys will be sexually abused in this nation \nbefore they reach the age of 18. Many child molesters prey upon dozens \nof victims before they are reported to law enforcement. Furthermore, \nsome child molesters evade detection for long periods because many \nchildren never report the abuse. In fact, Bureau of Justice Statistics \nsuggests that between 60 percent and 80 percent of child molestations \nand 69 percent of sexual assaults are never reported to the police. Of \nthose sexual assaults that are reported, 71 percent of the victims are \nchildren.\n  We also have a long way to go on behalf of missing children. \nAccording to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, in \n2001, 840,279 persons--adults and juveniles--were reported missing and \nentered into the FBI's national crime computer. As many as 725,000 of \nthose reported missing were juveniles. On average, 2,000 children per \nday were reported missing to law enforcement in 2001, according to the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children.\n  Most missing children are eventually returned safely to their \nparents, but a small group of them are victims of more predatory \nabductors. The average victim of abduction and murder is a ``low risk'' \n11-year-old girl from a middle-class neighborhood with a stable family \nrelationship who has initial contact with an abductor within one-\nquarter mile of her home--this is according to a report by the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice and the Washington State Attorney General's \nOffice.\n  For all of these reasons, it is vitally important that Congress do \neverything in its power to support parents and law enforcement in their \nefforts to protect our nation's most vulnerable citizens. Enacting the \nProtecting Children Against Crime Act of 2003 would be a step in the \nright direction.\n  Among its major provisions, this legislation would eliminate the \nstatute of limitations, under our federal criminal code, for \nprosecuting certain sex crimes against children and child abduction \noffenses. This provision recognizes that victims of such crimes often \ndo not come forward until years after the abuse, out of shame or a fear \nof further humiliation. It is important that a sexual predator still be \nheld accountable once a sexual abuse victim courageously chooses to \ncome forward.\n  In addition, this bill would call for those who produce or distribute \nchild pornography to be included in the national sex offender registry. \nAs stated by the United States Supreme Court more than two decades ago, \nchild pornography ``is intrinsically related to the sexual abuse of \nchildren.'' Families need to know when a child pornographer moves into \nthe neighborhood.\n  To assist States in finding their missing and runaway children, our \nbill also would authorize a new, grants-to-States program that \nencourages technology enhancements in the States' Amber Alert \nCommunications Plans. Similar language, authored by Congressman Mark \nFoley, already has passed the House of Representatives as part of the \nChild Abduction Prevention Act, H.R. 1104. This language builds on the \nnational Amber Alert legislation authored by Senator Hutchison and \npassed by the Senate earlier this year. Under the bill I introduced \nyesterday, this new grant program would be authorized at $5 million per \nyear in each of fiscal years 2004 through 2007.\n  Finally, our bill would require the National Research Council of the \nNational Academy of Sciences to conduct a study for Congress on the \nfeasibility of having Internet Service Providers monitor online traffic \nto detect child pornography sites. The study also would examine both \nthe extent to which credit cards are used to facilitate the sale of \nonline child pornography and options for encouraging greater reporting \nof such illicit transactions to law enforcement officials.\n  Our bill would help ensure that our children are protected from the \nmost treacherous of criminals. This is a fight we need to win and a \nfight for which we must give our law enforcement officers every tool at \nour disposal. I urge my colleagues to support the enactment of S. 810.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/09/senate-section/article/S5054-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5054-S5055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL: UNITED AGAINST TERROR\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \ntalk to my colleagues in the Senate about the important relationship \nAmerica has with our friends in Israel, and the crucial role that this \nrelationship plays in the ongoing War on Terror.\n  As American and Coalition troops continue military operations to \nliberate the people of Iraq, it is important to recall that amidst all \nof the criticism in the world community for American actions, there has \nbeen at least one nation that has steadfastly stood by our side since \nSeptember 11 and even before.\n  That nation is the State of Israel.\n  Americans awoke fully to the realities of terrorism on that fateful \nmorning in September, 2001. But for the children of Israel, acts of \nterrorism are an all too common occurrence. Israel long ago learned all \ntoo well about the true nature of the threat we face, and their \nassistance in combating that threat has been invaluable to the American \npeople.\n  American support for Israel was strong even before September 11, but \nI believe it is even stronger now. It is strong in the Congress, in the \nWhite House, and throughout America.\n  Israel is our greatest friend in a very troubled region. This is as \nit should be; Israel has suffered greatly, in blood and treasure, and \ndeserves strong American support. Israel has been an island of \nstability in a turbulent Middle Eastern sea.\n  That is why I have strongly supported economic and military aid to \nIsrael, including the $9 billion in loan guarantees and $1 billion in \nFMF funds now pending before Congress as part of the supplemental \nspending bill to pay for the War on Terror. And that is why I have \nsigned a letter to President Bush urging him to remain true to his \nvision for peace between Israel and the Palestinians as stated in his \nhistoric June 24, 2002, Rose Garden speech.\n  Since September 2000, when Yasser Arafat rejected the Camp David \noffer put forth by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak--and the \nsubsequent, even more generous Taba offer backed by President Clinton \nthat would have granted the Palestinians a sovereign state on 97 \npercent of the West Bank and Gaza, removed the majority of Israeli \nsettlements, and allowed for Palestinian control over the Temple \nMount--Israel has faced an onslaught of organized terrorism against its \nmen, women and children.\n  The Dolphinarium disco, a Sbarro pizzeria, the Moment Cafe, a \nPassover seder--all were targets of homicide bombers sent by \nPalestinian terror groups who have been permitted to operate freely \nwithin Palestinian society by Arafat's Palestinian Authority.\n  I actually ate once at that pizzeria. In 1999, I visited Israel and \nspent a week there so I could better understand its history and events. \nOn one of our last nights, my wife, Mary and I, along with our friends \ndecided to eat out at that restaurant. To later then actually see a \nplace with which you are familiar destroyed in a senseless act of \nviolence really helps to put these chillingly serious matters in \nperspective.\n  It is a perspective that Israelis live with every day, and it is a \nperspective more and more Americans are coming to understand.\n  On the surface, these acts of terrorism are barbaric. But, on a \ndeeper level, they also represent the utter failure of Arafat to live \nup to his commitment to Israel and the United States,\n\n[[Page S5055]]\n\nmade as part of the 1993 Oslo peace accords, and for which Arafat was \nironically given the Nobel Peace Prize, to renounce violence and crack \ndown on terrorism.\n  Let me be perfectly clear: there is no moral equivalence between \nthose who send teenagers to blow themselves up in crowded Israeli cafes \nand a government that must utilize its armed forces in order to defend \nits citizens.\n  Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has no choice but to fight a war \nagainst the terrorist infrastructure in the Palestinian territories so \nlong as Arafat's police forces are doing nothing to stop terrorism, and \nworse, aiding it.\n  President Bush was exactly right when in his June 24 Rose Garden \nspeech he called on the Palestinian people to elect new leaders \nuntainted by terror, to build a democracy, and to end the scourge of \nterror, if they truly wanted the United States to recognize a \nPalestinian state. And it is vital that any ``roadmap'' toward the \nestablishment of a Palestinian state be based on Palestinian \nperformance, not timetables. Further, this performance should be judged \nby the party most trusted by Israelis--the United States--and not the \nUnited Nations, France, Russia or others.\n  On September 11, 2001, Israelis spontaneously gathered on the streets \nto mourn for the victims of that day's brutal attacks. Israel \nimmediately offered the United States whatever assistance it might \nneed. Israelis know terrorism, but they will never become inured to it.\n  At a time when Israel is treated as a pariah by the U.N. and much of \nEurope, when American academics seek to have universities divest from \nIsrael, when anti-Semitic language reminiscent of the worst days of \nNazism are considered fair game, it is imperative that the United \nStates stand in solidarity with its true friend and ally, the State of \nIsrael.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/09/senate-section/article/S5055-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       U.S. RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as U.S.-led coalition forces act to \nremove Saddam Hussein from power, I would like to speak about another \nconflict in the Middle East that is, unfortunately, all too often in \nthe news for the wrong reasons.\n  During the opening days of Operation Iraqi Freedom, U.S. forces \nseized two key airfields, known as H2 and H3, in Western Iraq. It was \nfrom these airfields that 39 Scud missiles were launched against Israel \nduring the first Gulf War in 1991, prompting chaos and panic. While \nIsrael was fortunate that the Scud strikes were ineffective, many more \npeople died from heart failure blamed on war-related stress--68--than \nfrom the missile strikes themselves--2.\n  It was the intent of Saddam Hussein to prompt backlash by Arab \nnations against the U.S.-led coalition should Israel respond with \nmilitary force to the Scud attacks. That concern remains valid today.\n  Much of the current opposition in the Muslim community to military \naction against Saddam Hussein stems from their desire to see an end to \nthe ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n  The United States policy toward Israel has been roundly criticized by \nsome as lopsided in its support. There is no question that the United \nStates provides Israel with more foreign assistance than any other \nnation--and deservedly so.\n  The United States played a critical role in the establishment of \nIsrael in 1948. Our two nations are bound closely by historic and \ncultural ties as well as by mutual interests. As a key ally, and the \nonly democracy in the Middle East, she deserves our support.\n  This does not mean, however, that the United States and Palestinians \ncannot build a similarly positive relationship.\n  On March 14, President Bush reiterated his support for the creation \nof a peaceful Palestinian State. I agree, and share the President's \nvision of two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in \npeace and security.\n  I welcome the appointment of Mahmoud Abbas as Prime Minister and \napplaud the Palestinian Authority's decision to rebuff Yasir Arafat's \nattempts to retain power over the Cabinet.\n  I am not convinced, however, that these actions alone are enough to \nwarrant the United States' full endorsement. The Palestinian Authority \nmust crack down on those terrorist organizations that seek to derail \nany prospects for peace in the Middle East. Groups like Hamas, Islamic \nJihad and the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade.\n  I pose this simple test. If the Israeli military were to withdraw its \nforces to pre-1967 boundaries, what is the likelihood that Palestinian \nterrorist organizations would end their suicide attacks against \ninnocent Israelis?\n  Likewise, if attacks by Palestinian terrorists were to end, what is \nthe likelihood that Israeli troops would end their excursions into \nPalestinian held land?\n  At present, I would suggest the latter is a much more likely \nscenario.\n  Israel has every right to defend herself against these terrorist \nattacks--and the United States should not endorse efforts that would \nundermine Israel's national security.\n  There are those who suggest that U.N. peacekeepers should be sent in, \nor that the Middle East ``quartet''--the United States, Russia, the \nEuropean Union and the United Nations--should present a roadmap for \npeace.\n  The United States should not--must not--be drawn into endorsing any \n``roadmap'' that does not require the dismantling of the operational \ncapabilities and financial support of terrorist groups within a \nPalestinian state. When Palestinian leaders refuse to crack down on \nterrorist organizations, Israel has every right to take the necessary \nmeasures to protect its national security.\n  Certainly, there is a role for the international community to play in \nthe process. To provide assurances to both sides that their interests \nwill not be steamrolled.\n  But, for true peace to be achieved, it is inherent that Israel and \nthe Palestinian people reach a peace accord between themselves, without \noutside influence. An agreement dictated and enforced by a third party \nwill not result in long lasting peace.\n  History has shown that peace cannot be achieved with Yasir Arafat in \ncharge of the Palestinian Authority. At the Camp David summit in July \n2000, then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak offered Chairman Arafat a \nremarkable array of concessions. Unfortunately, Arafat was unable to \nmuster the political courage to accept these concessions--because to \naccept would mean the end of his reign; the end of his power over the \nPalestinian people. Yasir Arafat was not willing to make that sacrifice \nfor peace in the Middle East.\n  We have seen this type of behavior from Arafat in the past. There is \nno indication that it will change in the future.\n  But now, the Palestinian Authority has moved past Yasir Arafat. The \nposition of Prime Minister has been created. A Prime Minister has been \nappointed. The power to appoint a cabinet is his alone. The potential \nis there for truly significant reform.\n  This is encouraging. But it is only a beginning. Now, they must \nrecognize that terror and violence do not work. That arrested \nextremists must remain in jail. That denouncing suicide attacks entails \nmore that just words.\n  Certainly, Israel must do its part. The establishment of settlements \nin the territories seized in the 1967 war must be stopped. Retaliatory \nviolence against innocent Palestinians must be curtailed. I was pleased \nto read that on March 24, Israeli troops dismantled an illegal Jewish \nsettlement near Hebron. This crackdown on settlements must continue.\n  There is a dual responsibility here. Israeli and Palestinian \nauthorities must prevent extremists on both sides from setting and \ndriving the agenda. The continued acts of violence and aggression only \ndemonstrate that some groups in the region will always oppose a peace \nagreement. These groups must be placed on the sidelines. They must be \ndelegitimized.\n  Peace is possible. But it takes real effort by both sides to make it \nhappen. We have seen significant concessions from Israel in the past. \nYasir Arafat was unwilling to reciprocate. I am hopeful that Prime \nMinister Abbas proves more amenable.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/09/senate-section/article/S5056-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5056]]\n  THE MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM FINAL FOUR APPEARANCE\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, it is with great admiration that \nI congratulate the Marquette University Men's Basketball Team on their \naccomplishment in making it to the Final Four of this year's NCAA \nBasketball Tournament. Their season was extremely impressive and made \nfolks proud to be from Wisconsin.\n  This was Marquette's third trip to the Final Four. Their first trip \nwas in 1974, and they won the NCAA Championship in 1977. Their hard \nwork and perseverance carried them into this prestigious position, \nwhich undoubtedly honored the instillings of Al McGuire, who was the \ncoach from 1964 to 1977 and represents the spirit of this basketball \nprogram. With this great accomplishment, Marquette's coach Tom Crean \ngraduates to the honors bestowed on this program in years past and has \nignited the strong traditions of success that have long been a part of \nMarquette.\n  I take great pride in recognizing the Marquette University Men's \nBasketball Team in their attainment of a spot in the Final Four of the \nNCAA Tournament. I wish Coach Crean and the Marquette University \nbasketball team all the best. Wisconsin is very proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/09/senate-section/article/S5056-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   HONORING DONNELL D. ETZWILER, M.D.\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great \nAmerican and a most distinguished Minnesotan, Donnell D. Etzwiler, \nM.D., as he receives the National Institute of Health Policy's Health \nCare Leadership Award.\n  Donnell D. Etzwiler, M.D., earned a Doctor of Medicine from Yale \nUniversity School of Medicine in 1953. He practiced as a pediatrician \nspecializing in diabetes care at the Park Nicollet Clinic in \nMinneapolis, Minnesota from 1957 to 1996.\n  In 1967, Dr. Etzwiler founded the International Diabetes Center, IDC, \nin Minnesota where he served as its President and Chief Medical Officer \nuntil 1996. The IDC's mission is to ensure that every individual with \ndiabetes or at risk for diabetes receives the best possible care. Under \nDr. Etzwiler's three decades of leadership, the IDC trained over 12,000 \nhealth professionals, including hundreds from other countries, \nincluding Japan, Poland, Russia, Mexico, and Brazil. Dr. Etzwiler's \ndedication to his pediatric patients resulted in the IDC organizing and \nhosting the First International Symposium on Diabetes Camps in 1974. \nThis important group significantly contributed to the establishment of \nstandards and accreditation for diabetes camp programs.\n  Donnell D. Etzwiler, M.D. served as President of the American \nDiabetes Association from 1976 to 1977. From 1982 to 1994, Dr. Etzwiler \nserved as a Principal Investigator for the National Institutes of \nHealth Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, a landmark study that \nshowed that keeping blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible \nslows the onset and progression of eye, kidney, and nerve diseases \ncaused by diabetes.\n  Dr. Etzwiler's commitment to improving diabetes care was \ninternational in scope. From 1986 to 1994 he served as the Chairman of \nthe Diabetes Collaborating Centers for the World Health Organization in \nGeneva, Switzerland. In 1994, the Russian Government, awarded Dr. \nEtzwiler a Peace Award for co-founding and co-directing the \nInternational Diabetes Programme in Russia from 1989 to 1997.\n  Dr. Etzwiler was extensively involved in professional medical \nassociations, where he served in numerous leadership positions. He was \na member of the Institute of Medicine. He has received over 30 hours \nand awards from professional and civic organizations, including the \nCharles H. Best Medal for Distinguished Service in 1994 from the \nAmerican Diabetes Association. A Professor of Medicine for over 40 \nyears, Dr. Etzwiler has published over 180 articles and abstracts about \ndiabetes care.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring this great man. \nThrough his commitment and compassion, Dr. Donnell D. Etzwiler has \nimproved health care both nationally and internationally for people \nwith diabetes. Thanks to Don, people--especially children--with \ndiabetes live happier and healthier lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/09/senate-section/article/S5056-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TOWNS COUNTY MIDDLE SCHOOL TRIP TO WASHINGTON, DC\n\n  Mr. MILLER.

Mr. President, on April 26, 2003, more than \n1,200 students from across the United States will visit Washington, DC \nto compete in the national finals of the We the People: The Citizen and \nthe Constitution program, the most extensive educational program in the \ncountry developed specifically to educate young people about the \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights. Administered by the Center for \nCivic Education, the We the People program is funded by the U.S. \nDepartment of Education by act of Congress.\n  I am proud to announce that the class from Grace King High School \nfrom Metairie will represent the State of Louisiana in this national \nevent. These young scholars, led by their teacher Jamie Staub, have \nworked conscientiously to reach the national finals by participating at \nlocal and statewide competitions. As a result of their experience they \nhave gained a deep knowledge and understanding of the fundamental \nprinciples and values of our constitutional democracy.\n  The 3-day We the People national competition is modeled after \nhearings in the United States Congress. The hearings consist of oral \npresentations by high school students before a panel of adult judges on \nconstitutional topics. The students are given an opportunity to \ndemonstrate their knowledge while they evaluate, take, and defend \npositions on relevant historical and contemporary issues. Their \ntestimony is followed by a period of questioning by the judges who \nprobe the students' depth of understanding and ability to apply their \nconstitutional knowledge.\n  The class from Grace King High School is currently preparing for \ntheir participation in the national competition in Washington, DC. It \nis inspiring to see these young people advocate the fundamental ideals \nand principles of our Government, ideas that identify us as a people \nand bind us together as a nation. It is important for future \ngenerations to understand these values and principles, which we hold as \nstandards in our endeavor to preserve and realize the promise of our \nconstitutional democracy. I wish these young ``constitutional experts'' \nthe best of luck at the We the People national finals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/09/senate-section/article/S5056-5", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/09/senate-section/article/S5056-6", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/09/senate-section/article/S5056-7", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5056-S5057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:45 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby\n\n[[Page S5057]]\n\nMr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 108.

A bill to amend the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 to \nprovide for transitional housing assistance grants for child victims of \ndomestic violence; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill provide much-needed grants for transitional housing services to \nvictims of domestic violence who are brave enough to leave an abusive \nsituation and seek a new life of safety and freedom. I am pleased that \nSenators Kennedy and Biden join me as original cosponsors of this \nimportant legislation.\n  I witnessed the devastating effects of domestic violence early in my \ncareer as the Vermont State's Attorney for Chittenden County. Today, \nmore than 50 percent of homeless individuals are women and children \nfleeing domestic violence. More than half the cities surveyed by the \nU.S. Conference of Mayors in 2000 cited domestic violence as a primary \ncause of homelessness. The women and children who leave their abusers \ntend to have few, if any, funds with which they can support themselves. \nShelters offer short-term assistance, but are overcrowded and unable to \nprovide the support needed. Transitional housing allows women to bridge \nthe gap between leaving a domestic violence situation and becoming \nfully self-sufficient, but such assistance is limited because there is \ncurrently no Federal funding for transitional housing specifically for \nthose victims.\n  If we truly seek an end to domestic violence, then transitional \nhousing must be available to all those fleeing domestic abuse. The \nstable, sustainable home base for women and their children found in \ntransitional housing allows women the opportunities to learn new job \nskills, participate in educational programs, work full-time jobs, and \nsearch for adequate child care in order to gain self-sufficiency. \nWithout such resources, many women eventually return to situations \nwhere they are abused and even killed. This cycle of domestic abuse \nmust end, and transitional housing assistance is one of the tools we \ncan use to end it.\n  A transitional housing grant program was last authorized for only one \nyear as part of the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act \nin 2000. This program would have been administered through the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services and provided $25 million in \nfiscal year 2001. Unfortunately, funds were never appropriated for the \nprogram, and the authorization has now expired.\n  The grant program established in the bill I introduce today with \nSenators Kennedy and Biden would establish a new Department of Justice \ngrant program that authorizes the Attorney General, acting in \nconsultation with the Director of the Violence Against Women Office of \nthe Department of Justice, in consultation with the Secretary of \nHousing and Urban Development and the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. This program would have the benefit of a wide range of \nexpertise in the three departments, and has enormous potential to \nimprove people's lives. It would authorize $30 million in DOJ \ntransitional housing grants for each of the fiscal years 2004 through \n2008.\n  This new grant program administered through DOJ will make a big \nimpact in many areas of the country where availability of affordable \nhousing is at an all-time low. There are many dedicated people working \nto provide victims of domestic violence with resources, such as Rose \nPulliam of the Vermont Network Against Domestic Violence and Sexual \nAssault, but they can not work alone. We should all be concerned with \nproviding victims of domestic violence a safe place to gain the skills \nand stability needed to make the transition to independence. This is an \nimportant component of reducing and preventing crimes that take place \nin domestic situations, ranging from assault and child abuse to \nhomicide, and helping the victims of these crimes.\n  I am please that our bill will be included in the conference report \non the PROTECT Act, S. 151. I thank the conferees for including in the \nconference agreement this language for a grant program that will supply \nto victims fleeing domestic violence situations tangible means by which \nthey may move on with their lives.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section by section analysis of this \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional materials were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n A Bill To Amend the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 To Provide for \n Transitional Housing Assistance Grants for Child Victims of Domestic \n                 Violence--Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\nsection 1. transitional housing assistance grants for child victims of \n            domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault.\n\n       This section amends Subtitle B of the Violence Against \n     Women Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 13701 note; 108 Stat. 1925) to \n     include a new Chapter 11--Transitional Housing Assistance \n     Grants for Child Victims of Domestic Violence, Stalking, or \n     Sexual Assault.\n       Subsection (a) of this section authorizes the Attorney \n     General, acting in consultation with the Director of Violence \n     Against Women Office of the Department of Justice, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Development and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \n     to award grants to organizations, States, units of local \n     government, and Indian tribes to carry out programs to \n     provide assistance to minors, adults, and their dependents \n     who are homeless or in need of transitional housing or \n     related assistance as a result of fleeing a situation of \n     domestic violence, and for whom emergency shelter services or \n     other crisis intervention services are unavailable or \n     insufficient.\n       Subsection (b) provides that the grants awarded may be used \n     for programs that provide short-term housing assistance, \n     which includes rental or utilities payments assistance and \n     assistance with related expenses such as payment of security \n     deposits and other costs incidental to relocation to \n     transitional housing for minors, adults and their dependents. \n     Grants will also be available for support services designed \n     to help those fleeing a situation of domestic violence to \n     locate and secure permanent housing, as well as integrate \n     into a community by providing with services, such as \n     transportation, counseling, child care services, case \n     management, employment counseling, and other assistance.\n       Subsection (c) states that a minor, an adult, or a \n     dependent who receives assistance under this section may \n     receive that assistance for not more than 18 months. The \n     recipient of a grant under this section may waive the time \n     restriction for not more than an additional 6 month period \n     with respect to any minor, adult, or dependent, so long as he \n     or she has made a good-faith effort to acquire permanent \n     housing; and has been unable to acquire permanent housing.\n       Subsection (d) specifies the application process for \n     transitional housing grants. Each\n\n[[Page S5062]]\n\n     eligible entity desiring such grants shall submit an \n     application to the Attorney General at such time, in such \n     manner, and accompanied by such information as the Attorney \n     General may reasonably require. Each application shall \n     describe the activities for which assistance under this \n     section is sought; and provide such additional assurances as \n     the Attorney General determines to be essential to ensure \n     compliance with the requirements of the grant program.\n       Subsection (e) states that a recipient of a Justice \n     Department transitional housing grant must annually prepare \n     and submit to the Attorney General a report describing the \n     number of minors, adults, and dependents assisted, and the \n     types of housing assistance and support services provided.\n       Subsection (f) provides that the Attorney General, with the \n     Director of the Violence Against Women Office, must also \n     annually prepare and submit to the Committee on the Judiciary \n     of the House of Representatives and the Committee on the \n     Judiciary of the Senate a report that contains a compilation \n     of the information contained in the report submitted by grant \n     recipients. Copies of this report will also be transmitted to \n     the Office of Community Planning and Development at the \n     United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and \n     the Office of Women's Health at the United States Department \n     of Health and Human Services.\n       Subsection (g) authorizes that there be appropriated to \n     carry out the Department of Justice transitional housing \n     grant program $30,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2004 \n     through 2008. Of the amount made available to carry out this \n     section in any fiscal year, not more than 3 percent may be \n     used by the Attorney General for salaries and administrative \n     expenses. States, together with the grantees within the State \n     (other than Indian tribes), shall be allocated in each fiscal \n     year, not less than 0.75 percent of the total amount \n     appropriated in the fiscal year for grants for transitional \n     housing. The United States Virgin Islands, American Samoa, \n     Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands shall each be \n     allocated not less than 0.25 percent of the total amount \n     appropriated in the fiscal year for grants pursuant to this \n     section.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Warner, Mr. \n        Allen, and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 827.

A bill to establish programs to enhance protection of the \nChesapeake Bay, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing a package of five \nmeasures to sustain and, indeed, renew the Federal commitment to \nrestoring the water quality and living resources of the Chesapeake Bay \nwatershed. Joining me in sponsoring one or more of these measures are \nmy colleagues from Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Maryland, Senators \nWarner, Allen, Mikulski and Specter.\n  This year marks the 20th anniversary of the Chesapeake Bay Agreement, \nthe historic Federal-State compact that launched the Chesapeake Bay \nrestoration effort. Over the past two decades, we have made important \nprogress both in putting in place the comprehensive, coordinated \nFederal-State-local and private sector management structure to guide \nthe program and in specific initiatives to address key problems in the \nwatershed. Three subsequent agreements were signed in 1987, in 1992 and \nin 2000, respectively, setting specific goals and action plans to \nrestore the Chesapeake watershed. There are today over 700 groups and \nsome 40 committees involved in the Bay Program. More than twenty-five \nFederal agencies are partnering with EPA and the Bay area States and \nthere are numerous State agencies, local governmental organizations and \ncitizen groups actively engaged in the restoration efforts. The level \nof public support and the degree of cooperation and coordination among \nall parties is unparalleled.\n  Despite these efforts, the job of restoring the Chesapeake to levels \nof quality and productivity that existed earlier in this century is far \nfrom complete. In its latest report card issued in November, 2002, the \nChesapeake Bay Foundation gave the Chesapeake Bay a score of 27 out of \n100--far short of the ``70'' level believed necessary for the Bay to be \ndeclared ``saved.'' The index underscores the continuing serious \nchallenges facing the Bay. Nitrogen pollution from farms and city \nstreets, sewage treatment plants, and air deposition, among other so-\ncalled non-point sources, continue to overload the Bay. Many of the \nliving resources--oysters, shad, white perch, crabs--which are \nindicators of the Bay's health, are still in decline. Toxic chemicals \nare still present in the Bay's surface and bottom waters, having untold \nimpacts on water quality and wildlife. A recent analysis undertaken by \nthe Chesapeake Bay Commission estimates that the costs to clean the Bay \nand achieve the goals of the Chesapeake 2000 agreement over the course \nof the next seven years will exceed projected income by nearly $13 \nbillion. Pollution from all sources will have to be further reduced, \nthousands of acres of watershed property must be preserved, significant \nefforts must be made to restore living resources, buffer zones to \nprotect rivers and streams need to be created, education and \nstewardship efforts must be dramatically expanded.\n  While $13 billion seems like an enormous sum, we should remember that \nthe health of the Chesapeake Bay is vital not only to the more than 15 \nmillion people who live in the watershed, but to the Nation. It is one \nof our Nation's and the world's greatest natural resources covering \n64,000 square miles within six States. It is a world-class fishery that \nstill produces a significant portion of the finfish and shellfish catch \nin the United States. It provides vital habitat for living resources, \nincluding more than 3600 species of plants, fish and animals. It is a \nmajor resting area for migratory waterfowls and birds along the \nAtlantic including many endangered and threatened species. It is also a \none-of-a-kind recreational asset enjoyed by millions of people, a major \ncommercial waterway and shipping center for much of the eastern United \nStates, and provides jobs for thousands of people. In short, the \nChesapeake Bay is a magnificent, multifaceted resource worthy of the \nhighest levels of protection and restoration.\n  The five measures that we are introducing today are intended to help \naddress some of the highest priority needs in the watershed and provide \na Federal blueprint for restoring the Bay in the years ahead. I want to \naddress each of these measures briefly.\n  The first measure, the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Nutrient Removal \nAssistance Act, would establish a grants program in the Environmental \nProtection Agency to support the installation of nutrient reduction \ntechnologies at major wastewater treatment facilities in the Chesapeake \nBay watershed. I first introduced this measure during the 107th \nCongress and provisions of the legislation were included as part of S. \n1961, the Water Investment Act of 2002, reported favorably by the \nSenate Environment and Public Works Committee. Unfortunately, no \nfurther action was taken on that legislation. Despite important water \nquality improvements over the past decade, nutrient\n\n[[Page S5063]]\n\nover-enrichment remains the most serious pollution problem facing the \nBay. The overabundance of the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorous \ncontinues to rob the Bay of life sustaining oxygen. Recent modeling of \nEPA's Bay Program has found that total nutrient discharges must be \nreduced by more than 35 percent from current levels to restore the \nChesapeake Bay and its major tributaries to health. To do so, nitrogen \ndischarges from all sources must be reduced drastically below current \nlevels. Annual nitrogen discharges into the Bay will need to be cut by \nat least 110 million pounds from the current 300 million pounds to less \nthan 190 million pounds. Municipal wastewater treatment plants, in \nparticular, will have to reduce nitrogen discharges by nearly 75 \npercent.\n  There are 304 major wastewater treatment plants in the Chesapeake Bay \nwatershed: Pennsylvania, 123, Maryland, 65, Virginia, 86, New York, 18, \nDelaware, 3, Washington, D.C., 1, and West Virginia, 8. These plants \ncontribute about 60 million pounds of nitrogen per year--one-fifth--of \nthe total load of nitrogen to the Bay. Upgrading these plants with \nnutrient removal technologies to achieve nitrogen reductions of 3 mg/\nliter would remove 46 million pounds of nitrogen in the Bay each year \nor 40 percent of the total nitrogen reductions needed. Nutrient removal \ntechnologies have other benefits, as well. They provide significant \nsayings in energy usage, 20 to 30 percent, in chemical usage, more than \n50 percent, and in the amount of sludge produced, five to 15 percent. \nThey are one of the most cost-effective methods of reducing nutrients \ndischarged to the Bay.\n  My legislation would provide grants for 55 percent of the capital \ncost of upgrading the plants with nutrient removal technologies capable \nof achieving nitrogen reductions of 3 mg/liter. Any publicly owned \nwastewater treatment plant which has a permitted design capacity to \ntreat an annual average of 0.5 million gallons per day within the \nChesapeake Bay watershed portion of New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, \nWest Virginia, Delaware, Virginia and the District of Columbia would be \neligible to receive these grants. As a signatory to the Chesapeake Bay \nAgreement, the EPA has an important responsibility to assist the states \nwith financing these water infrastructure needs.\n  The second measure, the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Education Pilot \nProgram Act, would establish a new environmental education program in \nthe U.S. Department of Education for elementary and secondary school \nstudents and teachers within the Chesapeake Bay watershed. There is a \ngrowing consensus that a major commitment to education--to promoting an \nethic of responsible stewardship and citizenship among the nearly 16 \nmillion people who live in the watershed--is necessary if all of the \nother efforts to ``Save the Bay'' are to succeed. Expanding \nenvironmental education and training opportunities will lead not only \nto a healthier Chesapeake Bay ecosystem, but a more educated and \ninformed citizenry, with a deeper understanding and appreciation for \nthe environment, their community and their role in society as \nresponsible citizens.\n  One of the principal commitments of the Chesapeake 2000 Agreement, is \nto ``provide a meaningful Bay or stream outdoor experience for every \nschool student in the watershed before graduation from high school'' \nbeginning with the class of 2005. Despite important efforts by Bay area \nstates and not-for-profit organizations, only a very small percentage \nof the more than 3.3 million K-12 students in the watershed have had \nthe opportunity to engage in meaningful outdoor experiences or receive \nclassroom environmental instruction. Many of the school systems in the \nBay watershed are only at the beginning stages in developing and \nimplementing environmental education into their curriculum, let alone \nexposing students to outdoor watershed experiences. What's lacking is \nnot the desire or will, but the resources and training to undertake \nmore comprehensive environmental education programs.\n  This legislation would authorize $6 million a year over the next \nthree years in Federal grant assistance to help close the resource and \ntraining gap for students in the elementary and secondary levels in the \nChesapeake Bay watershed. It would require a 50 percent non-Federal \nmatch, thus leveraging $12 million in assistance. The funding could be \nused to help design, demonstrate or disseminate environmental curricula \nand field practices, train teachers or other educational personnel, and \nsupport on-the-ground activities or Chesapeake Bay or stream outdoor \neducational experiences involving students and teachers, among other \nthings. The program would complement the NOAA Bay Watershed Education \nand Training Program that we established last year.\n  The third measure would reauthorize and enhance the Chesapeake Bay \nEnvironmental Protection and Restoration Program. This program, which \nwas first established in Section 510 of the Water Resources Development \nAct of 1996, Public Law 104-303, authorizes the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers to provide design and construction assistance to State and \nlocal authorities in the environmental restoration of the Chesapeake \nBay. To date, the Corps of Engineers has constructed or approved $9.3 \nmillion in projects under the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Restoration \nand Protection Program including oyster restoration projects in \nVirginia, shoreline protection and wetland/sewage treatment projects at \nSmith Island in Maryland and the upgrade of the Scranton Wastewater \nTreatment Plant in Pennsylvania to reduce the amount of nutrients \ndelivered to the Chesapeake Bay. These projects have nearly exhausted \nthe current $10 million authorization.\n  This legislation increases the authorization for this program from \n$10 million to $30 million. Consistent with all other environmental \nrestoration authorities of the Corps of Engineers, it enables States \nand local governments to provide all or any portion of the 25 percent \nnon-Federal share required in the form of in-kind services. It also \nestablishes a new small-grants program for local governments and \nnonprofit organizations to carry out small-scale restoration and \nprotection projects in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The program would \nbe administered by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation which has \nextensive experience and expertise in managing these kinds of grants \nfor other Federal agencies. Ten percent of the funds appropriated each \nyear under this program would be set-aside for these grants. In view of \nthe great need and the many requests for assistance from the Bay area \nstates, this legislation is clearly unwarranted.\n  The forth measure, the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Forestry Act, would \ncontinue and enhance the USDA Forest Service's role in the restoration \nof the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Forest loss and fragmentation are \noccurring rapidly in the Chesapeake Bay region and are among the most \nimportant issues facing the Bay and forest management today. According \nto the National Resources Inventory, the States closest to the Bay lost \n350,000 acres of forest between 1987-1997 or almost 100 acres per day. \nMore and more rural areas are being converted to suburban developments \nresulting in smaller contiguous forest tracts. These trends are leading \nto a regional forest land base that is more vulnerable to conversion, \nless likely to be economically viable in the future, and is losing its \ncapacity to protect watershed health and other ecological benefits, \nsuch as controlling storm water runoff, erosion and air pollution, all \ncritical to the Bay clean-up effort.\n  Since 1990, the USDA Forest Service has been an important part of the \nChesapeake Bay Program. Administered through the Northeastern Area, \nState and Private Forestry, this program has worked closely with \nFederal, State and local partners in the six-state Chesapeake Bay \nregion to demonstrate how forest protection, restoration and \nstewardship activities, can contribute to achieving the Bay restoration \ngoals. Over the past 12 years, it has provided modest levels of \ntechnical and financial assistance, averaging approximately $300,000 a \nyear, to develop collaborative watershed projects that address \nwatershed forest conservation, restoration and stewardship.\n  With the signing of the Chesapeake 2000 Agreement, the role of the \nUSDA Forest Service has become more important than ever. Among other \nprovisions, this Agreement requires the signatories to conserve \nexisting forests along all streams and shoreline; promote the expansion \nand connection of\n\n[[Page S5064]]\n\ncontiguous forests; assess the Bay's forest lands; and provide \ntechnical and financial assistance to local governments to plan for or \nrevise plans, ordinances and subdivision regulations to provide for the \nconservation and sustainable use of the forest and agricultural lands. \nTo address these goals, the USDA Forest Service must have additional \nresources and authority, and that is what this measure seeks to \nprovide.\n  This legislation codifies the role and responsibilities of the USDA \nForest Service to the Bay restoration effort. It strengthens existing \ncoordination, technical assistance, forest resource assessment and \nplanning efforts. It authorizes a small grants program to support local \nagencies, watershed associations and citizen groups in conducting on-\nthe-ground conservation projects. It also establishes a regional \napplied forestry research and training program to enhance urban, \nsuburban and rural forests in the watershed. Finally it authorizes $3.5 \nmillion for each of fiscal years 2004 through 2010, a modest increase \nin view of the six-State, 64,000 square mile watershed.\n  The fifth measure, the NOAA Chesapeake Bay Watershed Education, \nTraining, and Restoration Act, would enhance the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric, NOAA, Chesapeake Bay Office's authorities to address the \nliving resource restoration and education and training goals and \ncommitments of the Chesapeake 2000 agreement. It builds upon provisions \ncontained in the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act Amendments of \n2003, and addresses several urgent and unmet needs in the watershed. To \nhelp meet Bay-wide living resource education and training goals, it \ncodifies the Bay Watershed Education and Training or, B-WET, Program--\nthe first federally funded environmental education program focused \nsolely on the Chesapeake Bay watershed--that we initiated in the Fiscal \n2002 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill and establishes an \naquaculture education program to assist with oyster and blue crab \nhatchery production.\n  To better coordinate and organize the substantial amounts of data \ncollected and complied by Federal, State and local government agencies \nand academic institutions--data such as information on weather, tides, \ncurrents circulation, climate, land use, coastal environmental quality, \naquatic living resources and habitat conditions--and make this \ninformation more useful to resource managers, scientists and the \npublic, it establishes an internet-based Coastal Predictions Center for \nthe Chesapeake Bay. It also authorizes a shallow water monitoring \nprogram to address critical gaps in information on near shore and river \narea water quality conditions needed for restoration of living \nresources. And to help meet Chesapeake 2000 living resource restoration \ngoals, it codifies the ongoing oyster restoration program an authorizes \na new submerged aquatic vegetation restoration program.\n  Mr. President, these measures would provide an important boost to our \nefforts to save the Chesapeake Bay and a blueprint for the course \nahead. They are strongly supported by the Chesapeake Bay Commission, \nthe Chesapeake Bay Foundation, and other organizations in the \nwatershed. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills and \nsupporting letters to printed in the Record. I urge my colleagues to \njoin with us in supporting the measures and continue the momentum \ncontributing to the improvement and enhancement of our Nation's most \nvaluable and treasured natural resource.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 827\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: We would like to express our deepest \n     appreciation for your continued leadership on behalf of the \n     Chesapeake Bay. Your proposed legislation for the 108th \n     Congress will provide essential new resources and policy \n     direction for top Chesapeake priorities, consistent with the \n     ambitious goals of the 2000 Chesapeake Bay Agreement. We \n     pledge our support for the legislation, and we stand ready to \n     help you in any way possible to secure enactment.\n       We are particularly pleased with your proposed Chesapeake \n     Bay Watershed Nutrient Removal Assistance Act, which will \n     significantly help reduce nitrogen pollution by providing \n     first-time federal assistance to local communities for \n     improving sewage treatment throughout the watershed. The bill \n     will provide $660 million over five years, and more than 300 \n     major sewage treatment plants will be eligible to participate \n     in the new federal program. Importantly, the legislation will \n     limit assistance to only those treatment plants willing to \n     install state-of-the-art pollution controls, which is \n     precisely consistent with the scientific conclusions of the \n     Chesapeake Bay Program.\n       Your other Chesapeake initiatives will strengthen \n     environmental education, improve forestry management, and \n     enhance the work of the Army Corps of Engineers. Together, \n     these bills will authorize significant new federal financial \n     support for the Chesapeake Bay Program.\n       This year marks the 20th anniversary of the modern \n     Chesapeake Bay Program. While we have made significant \n     progress in the past two decades, Chesapeake scientists now \n     believe we must redouble our efforts if we are to succeed in \n     the goals that we all share. Your legislation will provide \n     new direction and federal resources to the Chesapeake at a \n     key time.\n       We thank you for your continued leadership on behalf of the \n     Chesapeake Bay.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Robert M. Ferris,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Environmental Protection and Restoration.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Chesapeake Bay Commission,\n\n                                     Annapolis, MD, April 9, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: Federal funding has played a crucial \n     role in supporting the Chesapeake Bay restoration. Thanks in \n     large part to your efforts, federal funds have supported \n     nearly one-fifth of the projects currently underway.\n       However, in signing Chesapeake 2000, the signatories (both \n     state and federal) vowed to substantially enhance their \n     efforts to reduce nutrient pollution and restore the Bay's \n     fisheries. With science driving these decisions, the \n     expenditure of some $18.7 billion dollars will be required to \n     restore the Bay to its former health and abundance. A \n     commitment of this size will require the substantial \n     involvement of all partners, including the federal, state, \n     and local governments and the private sector.\n       With this financial need solidly in focus, we are writing \n     to convey our unanimous, tri-state support for your \n     Chesapeake Bay legislative package. Together, these five \n     bills promote the kinds of enhanced funding and technical \n     assistance called for in Cheasapeake 2000 (C2K). We hope that \n     the 108th Congress will join us in our support of:\n       1. The Chesapeake Bay Watershed Nutrient Removal Act;\n       2. The reauthorization and improvement of The Chesapeake \n     Bay Environmental Restoration and Protection Program of WRDA.\n       3. The Chesapeake Bay Environmental Education Pilot Program \n     Act;\n       4. The Chesapeake Bay Watershed Forestry Act; and\n       5. NOAA Chesapeake Bay Watershed Education, Training and \n     Restoration Act.\n       The Chesapeake Bay Watershed Nutrient Removal Assistance \n     Act is of keen interest to this Commission. As a signatory to \n     C2K, we have committed to reducing the Bay's nitrogen loads \n     by 110 million pounds. Translated, this goal represents a \n     doubling of the load reductions achieved since 1983. If \n     accomplished, it will restore the Bay waters to conditions \n     that are clean, clear and productive.\n       The Act provides grants to upgrade the major wasterwater \n     treatment plants (WWTP) in our six-state watershed with \n     nutrient removal technologies. It will allow the region to \n     demonstrate that state-of-the-art nutrient removal is \n     possible on a large scale. It will single-handedly result in \n     the removal of 41 million pounds of nitrogen, or 40 percent \n     of the total nitrogen reduction needed. Only the federal \n     government is in the position to trigger such remarkable \n     reductions. It is an opportunity that should not and \n     cannot be ignored.\n       In addition to the removal of nitrogen loads from our \n     WWIPs, The Chesapeake Bay Watershed Forestry Act will help to \n     control pollution running off the land. Forests and riparian \n     buffers play a critical role in filtering and absorbing \n     sediment and nutrient runoff, while providing valuable \n     habitat for animals and birds and food and shelter for fish. \n     Enhanced support for the Bay Program Forest Service will ramp \n     up its provision of interstate coordination, technical \n     assistance, and forest assessment and planning services that \n     are otherwise limited or unavailable in our region.\n       Finally, let us emphasize the important support for \n     education that this package provides. Sustaining hard won \n     progress in the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay will \n     ultimately rest in the hands of citizens and their \n     communities. Sustainability, then, rests in our ability to \n     provide ample education and opportunity for community \n     involvement. This effort to supply financial and technical \n     support is provided by the The Chesapeake Bay Environmental \n     Education Pilot Program Act and the NOAA Chesapeake Bay \n     Watershed Education, Training and Restoration Act. Education \n     and community engagement are two activities of C2K that are \n     woefully underfunded. The monies provided by these two acts \n     will substantially improve our ability to keep our \n     commitments on track and reach our stated goals.\n       Since the Bay Program's inception the federal government \n     has been a strong partner, providing approximately 18 percent \n     of the funds needed. For the federal government to maintain \n     its level of support in the face of rising costs to attain \n     our C2K objectives, it will need to triple its investment. \n     Your five-bill package puts the federal government soundly on \n     this track. As a Bay-region leader, you are to be commended. \n     Please instruct us as to how we can further support these \n     measures.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Delegate Robert S. Bloxom,\n                                                         Chairman.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 832. A bill to provide that bonuses and other extraordinary or \nexcessive compensation of corporate insiders and wrongdoers may be \nincluded in the bankruptcy estate; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \n``Corporate Accountability in Bankruptcy Act.'' This bill would clarify \nthat the bonuses and other excessive compensation of corporate \ndirectors and wrongdoers can be brought back into a bankruptcy estate \nwhen a company goes bankrupt. It is only fair that corporate officers \nand employees who have engaged in wrongdoing and violated the \nsecurities and accounting laws should not be able to make money off of \na company which has gone bankrupt, while company employees, \nshareholders and creditors are left carrying the burden of the \nbankruptcy. Moreover, corporate officers and insiders should not be \nallowed to keep their bonuses and loans when a company has done so \npoorly to go bankrupt.\n  Currently, the Bankruptcy Code permits a trustee to recover assets \nwhich a debtor has previously distributed to\n\n[[Page S5069]]\n\ncreditors within a certain time period prior to the filing of a \nbankruptcy petition. This allows a trustee to increase a debtor's \nassets for the fair treatment and equitable distribution of assets \namong all creditors, as well as to help shore up a debtor's assets \nduring a reorganization.\n  Section 547 of the Bankruptcy Code currently allows a trustee to \nrecover assets from an insider made within a year of the filing of a \nbankruptcy petition. Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code allows a \ntrustee to recover transfers of assets, made within one year, where \nthere has been a fraudulent transaction or where a debtor has received \nless than what is reasonably equivalent in value. However, the \nBankruptcy Code is not clear as to whether these sections would include \nthe bonuses and other extraordinary or excessive compensation of \nofficers, directors or other company employees. That needs to change.\n  The Corporate Accountability in Bankruptcy Act clarifies section 547 \nof the Bankruptcy Code to provide that a trustee may recover bonuses, \nloans, nonqualified deferred compensation, and any other extraordinary \nor excessive compensation as determined by the court, made to an \ninsider, officer or director and made within one year before the date \nof the filing of the bankruptcy petition.\n  In addition, the bill amends section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code to \nprovide that a trustee may recover bonuses, loans, nonqualified \ndeferred compensation, and any other extraordinary or excessive \ncompensation, as determined by the court, paid to an officer, director \nor employee who has committed securities or accounting violations, \nwithin 4 years of the filing of the bankruptcy petition. The reason \nthat the bill extends the present one year reach-back period for \nfraudulent transfers to four years is because a majority of States have \nadopted a four year time period or the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, \n(which allows for 4 years).\n  The plain fact is that corporate officers and employees who have \nviolated the law, as well as corporate officials who have not done a \ngood job in managing a company, should not be allowed to benefit where \ntheir actions have contributed to the downfall of the company. \nCorporate mismanagement and irresponsibility should not be rewarded, \nand the bad guys need to be held accountable. The changes to the \nBankruptcy Code contained in this bill are tied to excessiveness and \nwrongdoing and are fair. We need to do something about bringing more \naccountability and fairness to the system, and the Corporate \nAccountability in Bankruptcy Act does that.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 833. A bill to increase the penalties to be imposed for a \nviolation of fire regulations applicable to the public lands, National \nParks System lands, or National Forest System lands when the violation \nresults in damage to public or private property, to specify the purpose \nfor which collected fines may be used, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Public \nLands Fire Regulations Enforcement Act of 2003, a bill that I am \nintroducing, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 833\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION OF PUBLIC LAND FIRE \n                   REGULATIONS RESULTING IN PROPERTY DAMAGE.\n\n       (a) Increased Penalties on Interior Lands.--Notwithstanding \n     section 303(a) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act \n     of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1733(a)) or section 3 of the Act of August \n     25, 1916 (16 U.S.C. 3), a violation of the rules regulating \n     the use of fire by visitors and other users of lands \n     administered by the Bureau of Land Management or National \n     Park System lands shall be punished by a fine of not less \n     than $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than one year, or \n     both, if the violation results in damage to public or private \n     property.\n       (b) Increased Penalties on National Forest System Lands.--\n     Notwithstanding the eleventh undesignated paragraph under the \n     heading ``SURVEYING THE PUBLIC LANDS'' of the Act of June 4, \n     1897 (16 U.S.C. 551), a violation of the rules regulating the \n     use of fire by visitors and other users of National Forest \n     System lands shall be punished by a fine of not less than \n     $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both, \n     if the violation results in damage to public or private \n     property.\n       (c) Relation to Other Sentence of Fine Authority.--The \n     maximum fine amount specified in subsections (a) and (b) \n     applies in lieu of the fine otherwise applicable under \n     section 3571 of title 18, United States Code.\n       (d) Use of Collected Fines.--Any moneys received by the \n     United States as a result of a fine imposed for a violation \n     of fire rules applicable to lands administered by the Bureau \n     of Land Management, National Park System lands, or National \n     Forest System lands shall be available to the Secretary of \n     the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture, as the case may \n     be, without further appropriation and until expended, for the \n     following purposes:\n       (1) To cover the cost to the United States of any \n     improvement, protection, or rehabilitation work rendered \n     necessary by the action that resulted in the fine.\n       (2) To reimburse the affected agency for the cost of the \n     response to the action that resulted in the fine, including \n     investigations, damage assessments, and legal actions.\n       (3) To increase public awareness of rules, regulations, and \n     other requirements regarding the use of fire on public lands.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 834. A bill for the relief of Tanya Andrea Goudeau; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a private bill on \nbehalf of Tanya Andrea Goudeau and her family to grant Tanya immediate \nrelative status. The Goudeaus adopted Tanya in 2001, but due to \nmisinformation and an undue delay in the adoption process, the adoption \nwas not completed until a week after Tanya's 16th birthday. As a \nresult, Tanya was no longer considered a child under the law and \ntherefore was not eligible to receive permanent resident status. \nCurrently, Tanya faces deportation to Sri Lanka where she no longer has \na family to care for her. What is more, she is now legally a part of \nthe Goudeau family. Tanya is the Goudeau's daughter and they are her \nparents.\n  Tanya Goudeau was born to Mrs. Goudeau's sister in 1984 in Sri Lanka. \nDuring a visit with the Goudeaus in 1999 at their home in Baker, LA, \nTanya's mother announced that she was moving and that she did not want \nany further contact with her daughter. Tanya's father had walked out on \nthe family 11 years earlier and could not be located. The Goudeaus \nrealized that Tanya had no family to return to and they decided to \nadopt her. They could not bear to send their niece back to her native \nhome where she would be on her own at age 14. Without any children of \ntheir own, they lovingly took Tanya into their family and have lovingly \ncared for her for the past 4 years.\n  Tanya has overcome her mother's and father's abandonment and after a \nperiod of adjustment, she has grown to love her new home. She is \ncurrently a senior in high school with aspirations to earn an advanced \nmedical degree. Without the passage of this private bill, Tanya could \nface deportation to Sir Lanka at a time when she should be focused on \nher college degree with the support of her parents. The Goudeaus' \nsituation is an unintended consequence of the requirement to complete \nthe adoption process before a child's sixteenth birthday. We need to \ngrant Tanya immediate relative status to allow the Goudeaus to remain a \nfamily.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 835. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide \nstudent loan borrowers with a choice of lender for loan consolidation, \nto provide notice regarding loan consolidation, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, throughout the next month, hundreds of \nthousands of high school seniors across this Nation will open up their \nmailboxes and receive acceptance letters for college. They will begin \nplanning where they will live and what they will study for the next 2 \nor 4 years. These students will dream big and have grand ideas about \nwhat college will mean for them, but before they can officially enroll, \nthey will be slapped in the face with a very real question: how are \nthey going to pay for it?\n\n[[Page S5070]]\n\n  Attending an institution of higher education can be expensive. \nAccording to the National Center for Higher Education, the cost of \nattending two or four year, public and private colleges has increased \nfaster than both inflation and family income. In 2000, families in the \nlowest quartile of the income bracket spent as much as 25 percent of \ntheir annual income to send their children to a public, four year \ncollege, compared with only 13 percent in 1980. At the same time, \nthough, sources of federal assistance are diminishing. The Federal Pell \nGrant program, which was designed to help alleviate the financial \nburden on low income families, covered only 57 percent of the cost of \ntuition at public, four year colleges in 1999, whereas Pell Grants \ncovered 98 percent of the costs in 1986.\n  As the cost of college increases and the impact of Federal grants \ndecreases, school loans have become a gateway to attending college for \nthe majority of students. However, because of a provision in the 1998 \nre-authorization of the Higher Education Act, entitled the ``Single \nLender Rule,'' students who have all of their student loans from a \nsingle lender are barred from getting a lower rate by consolidating \ntheir loans with a different lender. The financial benefits for the \nconsumer by using a different lender for loan consolidation are easily \nseen in other areas of finance, such as homeowners refinancing their \nmortgage. What appears to me to be an arbitrarily contrived limitation \nthat protects lenders more than students has prevented college \ngraduates from consolidating their multiple student loans into a \nsingle, new loan, thus driving up the cost of attending college.\n  Having a college degree is fast becoming a necessary pre-requisite to \nlong-term success. That is why I rise today to introduce to my \ncolleagues the ``Consolidation Student Loan Flexibility Act of 2003.'' \nThis bill would repeal the Single Lender rule, and knock down this \narbitrarily contrived barrier that hinders students from gaining access \nto higher education.\n  Some of my colleagues may be asking, why now? Why not wait to repeal \nthe Single Lender rule when we readdress the Higher Education Act? As \nthe close of this school year fast approaches, and high school \ngraduates begin making important decisions about their educational \nfuture, we cannot put off the repeal of the Single Lender rule. The \neffects of maintaining the Single Lender rule are devastating. In 2001, \n143,504 students were forced to pay higher rates on their student loans \nbecause the Single Lender rule denied them benefits of loan \nconsolidation. Over 3,300 of these students were from my home State of \nLouisiana. We cannot force another class of college students to pay \nmore for college than necessary. Studies have shown that a major factor \ninfluencing a student's choice of college and degree program is the \namount of debt connected with the type of institution of profession. \nThese choices greatly impact not only the lives of the students \nthemselves, but also society as a whole. At a time when our society is \nin dire need of nurses, teachers, and many other professions, we must \nnot frighten students away from college for fear of substantial debt \nburdens after their graduation.\n\n  The greatest investment we can make in our future is in the education \nof our children. Today, with the changing world, educating our children \nincludes assisting those who desire to obtain a college degree. By not \nrepealing the Single Lender rule, we will be continuing to drive up the \ncost of college, thus impeding access, especially for lower-income \nstudents. According to the Census Bureau, the income gap between people \nreceiving a bachelor's degree and people receiving only a high school \ndiploma has increased from 57 percent in 1975, to 76 percent in 2002. \nBy financially hindering the entrance into college, we will be adding \nto this income gap, which only further hurts our already recessed \neconomy.\n  The Consolidation Student Loan Flexibility Act is an important first \nstep to making college more affordable for all American families. I \nhope and urge my colleagues to join me in making the dream of a college \neducation a reality for all.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 836. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to extend by \nfive years the period for the provision by the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs of noninstitutional extended care services and required nursing \nhome care; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I rise to reintroduce a bill \nthat is enormously important to veterans in my State of West Virginia \nand to all veterans across this great Nation. The bill I am \nreintroducing will extend VA's ability to provide long-term care under \ntwo specific authorities of the Veterans Millennium Health Care and \nBenefits Act of 1999.\n  In November of 1999, Congress passed comprehensive long-term care \nlegislation that required VA for the first time to provide extended \ncare services to enrolled veterans. Section 101 of Public Law 106-117 \ndirected VA to provide nursing home care to any veteran who is in need \nof such care for a service-connected condition, or who is 70 percent or \nmore service-connected disabled. In addition, VA was to have provided \nnon-institutional care, such as respite care, adult day care, home-\nbased primary care, homemaker/home health aide and skilled home health \ncare to all enrolled veterans. Without extension, both authorities will \nexpire in December, 2003.\n  Long-term care for veterans has been, and remains, a priority for me. \nAnd the extension of these services is critically important to veterans \nand their families in every State across this country.\n  Prior to the passage of the Millennium Health Care Bill, when \nfamilies in West Virginia were told by VA that the long-term care \nservices they needed were not available to them, they would turn to me \nin despair. I still frequently hear from families of aging, sick \nveterans who want desperately to keep their husbands, fathers or \nbrothers at home, but in order to do that they need help.\n  Many of our aging veterans are suffering from debilitating diseases, \nsuch as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, or a stroke. A large number of \nthese veterans are WW II combat veterans, whose wives are lovingly \ncaring for them at home with very limited resources. The \nnoninstitutional long-term care services currently available within VA \nprovide an array of care that can be a lifesaver for the dedicated care \ngivers of critically ill veterans, and allow these veterans to remain \nat home.\n  While the purpose of this bill is clear, let me explain the reason it \nis so necessary. Within three years of the enactment of Public Law 106-\n117, VA was to evaluate and report to the House and Senate Committees \non Veterans' Affairs on its experience in providing services under both \nthe nursing home care and non-institutional care provisions, and to \nmake recommendations on extending or making permanent these provisions. \nThese programs were given an expiration date of four years.\n  But unfortunately, very little has happened with these long-term care \nprograms. It was not until October, 2001, that VA addressed the \nrequirements of the law by issuing a directive on such noninstitutional \nlong-term care services as respite and adult day care. And even now, we \nfind that how these services are being provided, if at all, varies \nwidely throughout the VA health care system. The delay in implementing \nthese programs will greatly impede our ability to adequately study \ntheir effects.\n  Additionally, in September, 2001, two years after Congress passed the \nMillennium Health Care and Benefits Act of 1999, I asked the General \nAccounting Office to identify the long-term care services that are \navailable at each of VA's medical centers, and the standards and \ncriteria used by VA to determine which veterans may receive these \nservices.\n  GAO is expected to release their final report on VA long-term care by \nMay 1, but their preliminary report confirms that VA has not made much \nprogress in implementing noninstitutional long-term care services for \nveterans.\n  Therefore, I believe it is critical that both long-term care \nauthorities, due to expire in December of this year, be extended for an \nadditional five years, until December 31, 2008, so that we can be \nproperly evaluate the services and, if need be, make appropriate \nadjustments.\n\n[[Page S5071]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Miller, Mr. Alexander, Mr. \n        Allard, Mr. Allen, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \n        Fitzgerald, Mr. Graham of South Carolina, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \n        Santorum, Mr. Thomas, and Mr. Bunning):\n  S. 837. A bill to establish a commission to conduct a comprehensive \nreview of Federal agencies and programs and to recommend the \nelimination or realignment of duplicative, wasteful, or outdated \nfunctions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nbipartisan Commission on the Accountability and Review of Federal \nAgencies, CARFA, Act.\n  We need accountability in Federal spending. With our Nation at war \nand with a recovering economy, the Congress needs to take concrete \nsteps to ensure that hard-earned taxpayer dollars are being efficiently \nused by the Federal Government.\n  Indeed, few things are more upsetting to my Kansas constituents than \nto see wasteful Federal spending. Kansans often say to me: ``I do not \nmind paying my taxes, but it is infuriating to see my hard-earned money \nbeing poorly spent by the Federal Government. If I am going to work \nhard to earn this money, I want it spent wisely.'' These are real \nconcerns that need to be addressed.\n  The bipartisan legislation that I introduce today with 13 original \ncosponsors would help to provide accountability to Federal spending by \nestablishing a commission to review Federal domestic agencies and \nprograms within agencies.\n  The Senate is already on record strongly supporting this concept \nthrough an amendment that I offered to the Senate Budget Resolution. On \nMarch 21, the Senate passed S.A. 282 to the budget resolution by a \nvoice vote. S.A. 282 briefly describes the CARFA Act, expressing the \nsense of the Senate that a commission should be established to review \nFederal domestic agencies and programs within agencies, and that the \ncommission should submit to Congress: (1) recommendations to realign or \neliminate wasteful agencies and programs within agencies; and (2) \nlegislation to implement its recommendations.\n  The CARFA Act is modeled on successful commissions of the past. If \nenacted, the 12-member presidentially appointed commission would \nconduct a 2-year review of Federal domestic agencies and programs \nwithin agencies, using a narrow set of criteria in its review.\n  Upon completion of its evaluation, the commission would submit to \nCongress both its recommendations of agencies and programs that should \nbe realigned or eliminated, and proposed legislation to implement its \nrecommendations. As with successful commissions of the past, the \nCongress would consider this legislation on an expedited basis with a \ncomment period from the committees of jurisdiction. Within the \nexpedited timeframe, the Congress would take an up-or-down vote on the \nlegislation as a whole without amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support and pass this important piece of \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Ensign, and Mr. \n        Hatch):\n  S. 840. A bill to establish the Great Basin National Heritage Route \nin the States of Nevada and Utah; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today for myself, Senator Ensign, \nSenator Hatch, and Senator Bennett to introduce this bill, which will \nestablish a National Heritage Route in eastern Nevada and western Utah.\n  National Heritage areas, corridors, and routes are regions in which \nresidents and businesses, as well as local and tribal governments join \ntogether in partnership to conserve and celebrate cultural heritage and \nspecial landscapes. The Great Basin National Heritage Route includes \nhistoric mining camps and ghost towns, Mormon and other pioneer \nsettlements, as well as Native American communities. The Route passes \nthrough classic Great Basin country along the trails of the Pony \nExpress and the Overland Stage. Cultural resources within the route \ninclude Native American archaeological sites dating back to the Fremont \nCulture.\n  Our bill will also help highlight some of the Great Basin's natural \nwonders. Passing through Millard County, Utah, and parts of the \nDuckwater Reservation and White Pine County in Nevada, the Route \ncontains items of great biological and geological interest. In Nevada, \nit encompasses forests of bristlecone pine, the oldest living things on \nthe earth. In Utah, the Route includes native Bonneville cutthroat \ntrout as well as other distinctive species and ecological communities.\n\n  Designation of the corridor as a Heritage Route will ensure the \nprotection of key educational and recreational opportunities in \nperpetuity without compromising traditional local use of the land. The \nGreat Basin National Heritage Route will provide a framework for \ncelebrating Nevada's and Utah's rich historic, archeological, cultural, \nand natural resources for both visitors and residents.\n  The bill will establish a board of directors consisting of local \nofficials from both counties and tribes to manage the area designated \nby the route. The board will develop a management plan within 3 years \nof the bill's passage, and the Secretary of the Interior will enter \ninto a memorandum of understanding with the Board of Directors for the \nmanagement of the resources of the heritage route. Our legislation also \nauthorizes up to $10 million to carry out the Act but limits Federal \nfunding to no more then 50 percent of the project's cost. The bill \nallows the Secretary to provide assistance for 15 years after the bill \nis enacted.\n  Our bill benefits not just the people of Nevada and Utah, but \ncitizens of all States. It highlights an area of outstanding cultural \nand natural value and brings people together to celebrate values that \nthey can be proud of. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 840\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Great Basin National \n     Heritage Route Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprohibit discrimination in the payment of wages on account of sex, \nrace, or national origin, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senators Murray, \nKennedy, Mikulski, Durbin, Leahy, Akaka, Feingold and Boxer, I am \nintroducing the Fair Pay Act.\n  April 15, tax day, is also Equal Pay Day. If you add what women made \nlast year and so far this year, that would be the same amount men made \nin all of last year. In other words, it takes women 16 months to make \nwhat men make in 12.\n  There's been a lot of tax talk from Congress and the White House \nlately. We've got more than 1 million people out of work. And we've got \nmillions of families struggling to make ends meet. The White House \nbelieves a new $750 billion tax cut for the rich is the solution.\n  I disagree. One way we can put more money in the pockets of working \nfamilies--pay women what they're worth. Nearly 40 years after the Equal \nPay Act became law, women are still paid only 76 cents for every dollar \na man earns.\n  Working women at all income and education levels are affected by the \nwage gap. Last year, the GAO found that the pay gap continues to effect \nwomen in management and that, for these women, the pay gap has actually \nwidened since 1995.\n  Regardless of education, the impact is the same. These women work as \nhard as men, but have less money to pay the bills, to put food on the \ntable, or to save for their retirement or their child's education. That \nis simply wrong and it must end. We must close the wage gap once and \nfor all.\n  First, we need to do a better job by enforcing and strengthening the \npenalties for the law that demands equal pay for equal work. That's why \nI support the Paycheck Fairness Act, sponsored by Senator Daschle and \nCongresswoman DeLauro.\n  Another part of discrimination against women in the work place is the \nhistoric pattern of undervaluing and underpaying so-called ``women's \njobs.''\n  Millions of women today working in female-dominated jobs--as social \nworkers, teachers, child care workers and nurses--are ``equivalent'' in \nskills, effort, responsibility and working conditions to similar jobs \ndominated by men. But these women aren't paid the same as men.\n  That's what the Fair Pay Act--that Congresswoman Norton and I are \nreintroducing today--would address. Unfairly low pay in jobs dominated \nby women is un-American, it is discriminatory and our bill would make \nit illegal.\n  20 States have ``fair pay'' laws and policies in place for their \nemployees, including my State of Iowa. And Iowa had a Republican \nlegislature and Governor when this bill passed into law. So, ending \nwage discrimination against women in a nonpartisan issue.\n  Some say we don't need any more laws; market forces will take care of \nthe wage gap. If we had relied on market forces we would have never \npassed the Equal Pay Act, the Civil Rights Act, the Family Medical \nLeave Act or the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  I first introduced the Fair Pay Act in 1996 after the Iowa Business \nand Professional Women alerted me to this problem. And as long as I'm \nin the U.S. Senate I will continue to fight to pass this important \nlegislation so we can end wage discrimination against women once and \nfor all.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5074]]\n\n                                 S. 841\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE AND REFERENCE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Pay \n     Act of 2003''.\n       (b) Reference.--Except as provided in section 8, whenever \n     in this Act an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of \n     an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other provision, \n     the reference shall be considered to be made to a section or \n     other provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 \n     U.S.C. 201 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Wage rate differentials exist between equivalent jobs \n     segregated by sex, race, and national origin in Government \n     employment and in industries engaged in commerce or in the \n     production of goods for commerce.\n       (2) The existence of such wage rate differentials--\n       (A) depresses wages and living standards for employees \n     necessary for their health and efficiency;\n       (B) prevents the maximum utilization of the available labor \n     resources;\n       (C) tends to cause labor disputes, thereby burdening, \n     affecting, and obstructing commerce;\n       (D) burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in \n     commerce; and\n       (E) constitutes an unfair method of competition.\n       (3) Discrimination in hiring and promotion has played a \n     role in maintaining a segregated work force.\n       (4) Many women and people of color work in occupations \n     dominated by individuals of their same sex, race, and \n     national origin.\n       (5)(A) A General Accounting Office analysis of wage rates \n     in the civil service of the State of Washington found that in \n     1985 of the 44 jobs studied that paid less than the average \n     of all equivalent jobs, approximately 39 percent were female-\n     dominated and approximately 16 percent were male dominated.\n       (B) A study of wage rates in Minnesota using 1990 Decennial \n     Census data found that 75 percent of the wage rate \n     differential between white and non-white workers was \n     unexplained and may be a result of discrimination.\n       (6) Section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 \n     prohibits discrimination in compensation for ``equal work'' \n     on the basis of sex.\n       (7) Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits \n     discrimination in compensation because of race, color, \n     religion, national origin, and sex. The Supreme Court, in its \n     decision in County of Washington v. Gunther, 452 U.S. 161 \n     (1981), held that title VII's prohibition against \n     discrimination in compensation also applies to jobs that do \n     not constitute ``equal work'' as defined in section 6(d) of \n     the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Decisions of lower \n     courts, however, have demonstrated that further clarification \n     of existing legislation is necessary in order effectively to \n     carry out the intent of Congress to implement the Supreme \n     Court's holding in its Gunther decision.\n       (8) Artificial barriers to the elimination of \n     discrimination in compensation based upon sex, race, and \n     national origin continue to exist more than 3 decades after \n     the passage of section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act \n     of 1938 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Elimination of such \n     barriers would have positive effects, including--\n       (A) providing a solution to problems in the economy created \n     by discrimination through wage rate differentials;\n       (B) substantially reducing the number of working women and \n     people of color earning low wages, thereby reducing the \n     dependence on public assistance; and\n       (C) promoting stable families by enabling working family \n     members to earn a fair rate of pay.\n\n     SEC. 3. EQUAL PAY FOR EQUIVALENT JOBS.\n\n       (a) Amendment.--Section 6 (29 U.S.C. 206) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(h)(1)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no \n     employer having employees subject to any provision of this \n     section shall discriminate, within any establishment in which \n     such employees are employed, between employees on the basis \n     of sex, race, or national origin by paying wages to employees \n     in such establishment in a job that is dominated by employees \n     of a particular sex, race, or national origin at a rate less \n     than the rate at which the employer pays wages to employees \n     in such establishment in another job that is dominated by \n     employees of the opposite sex or of a different race or \n     national origin, respectively, for work on equivalent jobs.\n       ``(B) Nothing in subparagraph (A) shall prohibit the \n     payment of different wage rates to employees where such \n     payment is made pursuant to--\n       ``(i) a seniority system;\n       ``(ii) a merit system;\n       ``(iii) a system that measures earnings by quantity or \n     quality of production; or\n       ``(iv) a differential based on a bona fide factor other \n     than sex, race, or national origin, such as education, \n     training, or experience, except that this clause shall apply \n     only if--\n       ``(I) the employer demonstrates that--\n       ``(aa) such factor--\n\n       ``(AA) is job-related with respect to the position in \n     question; or\n       ``(BB) furthers a legitimate business purpose, except that \n     this item shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that \n     an alternative employment practice exists that would serve \n     the same business purpose without producing such differential \n     and that the employer has refused to adopt such alternative \n     practice; and\n\n       ``(bb) such factor was actually applied and used reasonably \n     in light of the asserted justification; and\n       ``(II) upon the employer succeeding under subclause (I), \n     the employee fails to demonstrate that the differential \n     produced by the reliance of the employer on such factor is \n     itself the result of discrimination on the basis of sex, \n     race, or national origin by the employer.\n       ``(C) The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shall \n     issue guidelines specifying criteria for determining whether \n     a job is dominated by employees of a particular sex, race, or \n     national origin.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax relief for small businesses, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a package of \ntargeted, affordable tax relief provisions designed to help the \nNation's small businesses during this time of economic stagnation. \nAfter the Easter recess, I know that the Finance Committee will be \nmarking up a wide-ranging tax bill whose ultimate size is yet to be \ndetermined. I also know, however, that few of the proposals offered by \nthe President will truly stimulate the economy or help the millions of \nstruggling small businesses. Instead, the Bush tax proposal will reward \nthe richest among us and pass the bill to our children. We can and must \ndo better.\n  As the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I have drafted legislation that will truly help small \nbusinesses and the Nation. It is a tax proposal with meaningful, \naffordable reforms that will make a difference without sticking our \nkids with a huge bill. I hope that all of part of this legislation can \nbe incorporated into a Senate economic stimulus package. I have titled \nthe bill that I am introducing today ``The Affordable Small Business \nStimulus and Simplification Act of 2003,'' and it builds upon a bill \nthat I introduced in the 107th Congress.\n  I call my bill an ``affordable'' stimulus package for small business \nbecause it targets the policies that can make the biggest difference \nand uses our limited resources as wisely and efficiently as possible. \nIt does not include everything that I would like to do for small \nbusiness, but it includes enough to help stimulate this essential \ncomponent of our economy. Moreover, the bill will help address the tax \ncomplexity concerns of small businesses because it includes the Single \nPoint Tax Filing Act that has passed the Senate on two previous \noccasions and a new standard deduction that will benefit millions of \nsmall businesses.\n\n[[Page S5076]]\n\n  Let me briefly explain the contents of my bill.\n  First, my bill increases the expensing limitation for small \nbusinesses. It raises it to $35,000, rising to $40,000 in 2008, and it \nincreases the phase-out level, above which expensing is not allowed, to \n$350,000, rising to $400,000 in 2008. I know that others have proposed \nraising this limit as high as $75,000, but such an increase is simply \nunaffordable while we face huge budget deficits. Raising it to $35,000 \nnow, rising to $40,000 in 2008, is a more responsible approach and will \nprovide an immediate investment incentive to many small businesses.\n  Second, my bill creates a new standard deduction of $500 for sole \nproprietorships. This provision provides tax relief and real tax \nsimplification to the smallest of small businesses because it would \nrelieve these businesses of the paperwork burden of having to itemize \nthe myriad of small expenses on IRS forms. Of course, businesses with \nexpenses greater than $500 would retain the option of full itemization. \nBut for the very smallest businesses, many of them home-based or part-\ntime, this new provision will be a significant step towards tax \nsimplification.\n  Third, the bill modifies and expands a provision that was signed into \nlaw in 1993 regarding new equity investments in small businesses' \nstock. Under my bill, new investments in companies with capitalization \nof up to $100 million at the time of investment will have a 75 percent \ncapital gains exclusion if the investments are held at least four \nyears. The exclusion for such investments will be 100 percent if they \nare made in a business involved in such critical technologies as \ntransportation or homeland security, defense-related technologies, \nanti-terrorism, pollution control, energy efficiency, or waste \nmanagement. The 100-percent exclusion would also be allowed for \ninvestments in specialized small business investment companies, or \nSSBICs, whose investments are made solely in disadvantaged small \nbusinesses. Both the 75 and 100 percent exclusion levels would be \navailable for investments made by both individuals and corporations. In \naddition, the rollover period for such investments would be increased \nfrom 60 days to 180 days. The provision passed in 1993 was crafted too \nnarrowly to stimulate substantial new investment. I hope that this new, \nexpanded capital gains treatment will prompt new investments in small \nand entrepreneurial businesses.\n  Fourth, my bill recognizes that the current depreciation schedules \nfor high-tech equipment and software are out of date, given how quickly \nsuch items become obsolete in our fast-changing economy. My bill would \nreduce the recovery period for computers or peripheral equipment from \nfive years to three, and for software from three years to two. This \nchange would be permanent.\n  Fifth, my bill would fix a problem with the tax deductibility of \nhealth insurance expenses for the self-employed. Under current law, \nthese expenses are fully deductible in 2003 for the first time--but the \nInternal Revenue Code denies the deduction to taxpayers who are \neligible to participate in another plan, such as their spouse's \nemployer's plan. My bill would clarify that the deduction is denied \nonly if the taxpayer actually participates in the other plan.\n  Sixth, to simplify tax filing, my bill would include the Single Point \nTax Filing Act. This section would simplify the tax filing process for \nemployers that choose to participate by allowing the Internal Revenue \nService and State agencies to combine, on one form, both State and \nFederal employment tax returns. This provision has been passed by the \nSenate twice before, but has not yet become law. There is currently a \ndemonstration project along these lines in Montana, which is working \nvery well. I believe such authority should extend to all States.\n  Seventh, my bill clarifies that married couples who co-own a business \ncan elect to be sole proprietors for purposes of filing their Federal \nincome taxes. This provision aligns the law with the way many married \ncouples actually do business. Under present law, married couples who \nco-own a business technically own that business as a partnership for \nFederal income tax purposes. This treatment carries with it all the \ncomplications of the partnership provisions of the Internal Revenue \nCode, including having to file partnership returns. But in reality, \nmany married couples in this situation consider themselves sole \nproprietors and are incorrectly filing tax returns as such. While the \nIRS may not be strictly enforcing the law against these taxpayers, this \ntechnical non-compliance can cause trouble down the road. Upon divorce, \nfor example, it may not be clear that the business had been jointly \nowned. This same ambiguity might complicate a spouse's ability to get \nthe full Social Security and Medicare benefits to which they are \nentitled. My bill makes clear that for Federal income tax purposes, \nmarried couples who co-own a business can be treated as sole \nproprietors.\n  Eighth, my bill would extend the existing income averaging provisions \nto cover fishing as well as farming. In other words, the choice to \naverage income from a farming trade or business under present law would \nbe extended to cover income from the trade or business of fishing as \nwell. Under my bill, a farmer or fisherman electing to average his or \nher income would owe the alternative minimum tax, AMT, only to the \nextent he or she would have owed AMT had averaging not been elected. \nThis is an important change that will benefit not only people in my \nstate, but also throughout New England, the Pacific Northwest, the Gulf \nof Mexico region, Alaska, and in other areas of the country where \nfishing is an important industry.\n  Finally, my bill would modify the tax treatment of investments in \ndebenture small business investment companies, or SBICs, so they are \nless likely to create unrelated business taxable income, UBTI, \nliability. The current tax treatment of money borrowed from the \ngovernment by a debenture SBIC creates taxable income for an otherwise \ntax-exempt investor, which makes it almost impossible to raise capital \nfrom these investors. Free to choose, tax-exempt investors opt to \ninvest in venture capital funds that do not create any UBTI liability. \nTherefore, my bill would assure that money borrowed from the government \nby an SBIC does not subject tax-exempt investors to UBTI. In so doing, \nthe bill would encourage greater investment in SBICs, which provide \ncritically needed venture capital to emerging small businesses. These \nventure capital funds are sorely needed in today's stalled economy.\n  I believe that ``The Affordable Small Business Stimulus and Stimulus \nAct of 2003'' will provide a much-needed stimulus to small business in \na way that we can afford, particularly if we can find offsets to pay \nfor the bill. I look forward to working with the Chairman and Ranking \nMember of the Finance Committee to have some or all of its provisions \nenacted into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARPER (for himself, Mr. Chafee, and Mr. Gregg):\n  S. 843. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to establish a national \nuniform multiple air pollutant regulatory program for the electric \ngenerating sector; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today along with Senators Lincoln Chafee \nand Judd Gregg, I am introducing comprehensive legislation to reduce \nharmful emissions from our Nation's power plants. Developed after \nextensive input from electric generators who would be affected by such \nlegislation, leaders in the environmental community, and State and \nlocal regulators who will enforce any new requirements, the Clean Air \nPlanning Act is a balanced approach to a difficult challenge.\n  The Clean Air Planning Act takes a market-based approach that would \naggressively reduce electric power generators' emissions of sulfur \ndioxide, SO2, by 80 percent, nitrogen oxides, \nNOX, by 69 percent, mercury by 80 percent, and return carbon \ndioxide, CO2, emissions to 2001 levels within a decade. It \nprovides planning and regulatory certainty to electric generators who \nwould be required to achieve these regulations.\n  The negative public health and environmental impacts of \nSO2, NOX and mercury emissions have been well \ndocumented. While there is bipartisan agreement that emissions of these \nthree pollutants from power plants need further control, there is \ndisagreement over how much and how fast. The bill includes a flexible \ntrading system that allows for attainment of the caps\n\n[[Page S5077]]\n\nin the most efficient manner and updates the new source review program \nto help encourage emission reductions to occur.\n  There is also a growing consensus that greenhouse gases such as \nCO2 emissions from power plants are contributing to climate \nchange. The time has come to set up mechanisms that will address these \nemissions without impeding economic growth. The Clean Air Planning Act \nestablishes modest goal of capping CO2 emissions from \nelectrical generators at 2001 levels by 2013. Generators could meet \nthat goal with a flexible system that allows both trading between \ngenerators and earning credits through off-system reductions of \ngreenhouse gases.\n  Today, America's power plants will emit over 6 million tons of \nharmful emissions. They will also power the world's most productive \neconomy. Reducing emissions while retaining affordable electricity is \nthe goal of the Clean Air Planning Act, and I urge others to join in \nthis effort.\n  In the months ahead, this clean air bill and others will be compared \nand debated. Opponents and supporters will be heard, but at the outset \nI believe we should agree on a set of guiding principles.\n  Four is better than three: A comprehensive four-emission strategy \nthat includes carbon reductions provides regulatory certainty and \noffers the greatest environmental and economic benefits.\n  Markets work: Cape and trade based emission standards provide the \nmaximum incentive to achieve cleaner power.\n  Stairs are better than cliffs: Prompt but gradual reductions through \nmulti-phase or declining caps are more desirable than single phased \ncuts.\n  Eliminate redundancy: Existing regulatory programs will need some \nmodernization in light of tight emission caps.\n  Clean air is a basic right all Americans deserve. The responsibility \nto ensure that right falls to Congress and the President. By putting \nour differences aside and focusing on the challenge at hand the result \nwill be healthy citizens breathing clean air, a vibrant economy with \nabundant affordable electricity, and a model for the rest of the world \nto follow.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 843\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Carper \ntoday to introduce the Clean Air Planning Act of 2003. Congress needs \nto advance four-pollutant legislation that offers the best chance for \nbroad bipartisan support, and I believe this bill meets that test. The \ntestimony received through hearings in the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee over the past several years has clearly outlined the need for \ncontrolling the major emissions from power plants--sulfur dioxide, \nnitrogen oxide, mercury and carbon dioxide--while at the same time \nrecognizing the added costs of these new controls. We know through \nexperience that we will only be successful at passing legislation if we \nfind middle ground.\n  The parameters of this debate have been established. Some will say \nthis bill doesn't go far enough in some respects. Others will say the \nlegislation goes too far, especially as it pertains to the mandatory \ncontrol of carbon dioxide emissions. However, the relationship of \nfossil fuels to global warming is clear and scientifically validated. \nThe ``U.S. Climate Action Report 2002'' released by the administration \nlast May tells us we need to take real actions to address the problem. \nThe longer we wait, the harder this problem will be to solve. The Rio \nConvention is a perfect example of why waiting is not reasonable. In \n1992, we agreed to voluntarily reduce harmful emissions to 1990 levels. \nIt didn't happen. Now, in 2003 we are told that reductions to 1990 \nlevels will stall the economy. If we wait much longer before taking any \naction, imagine how much harder it will be to achieve real reductions \nwithout harming the economy.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would achieve significant \nreductions in a more cost effective way than other proposals. For \nsulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury, we will establish \nemissions caps that are superior to reductions that will be achieved \nunder the existing Clean Air Act. In addition, for the first time, we \nwill ensure real reductions of carbon dioxide emissions are achieved. \nBy 2013, the utility sector will be required to reduce carbon dioxide \nemissions to 2001 levels. This proposal will allow the United States to \naddress carbon pollution for the first time and, when compared to a \nthree-pollutant bill, at very small incremental costs.\n  I believe that the Carper-Chafee bill offers a real opportunity to \nbreak the stalemate that exists today and begin an honest debate that \nwill eventually lead to enactment of strong legislation. I look forward \nto working with all of my colleagues as we move forward to pass a bill \nthat enjoys the broadest support and adequately addresses the serious \nhealth, environmental, and economic issues facing the Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO (for himself, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Allard, \n        Mr. Kyl, and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 844. A bill to subject the United States to imposition of fees and \ncosts in proceedings relating to State water rights adjudications; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Water Adjudication \nFee Fairness Act. This bill would require the Federal Government to pay \nthe same filing fees and costs associated with state water rights \nadjudications as is currently required of States and private parties.\n  To establish relative rights to water--water that is the lifeblood of \nmany States, particularly in the West--States must conduct lengthy, \ncomplicated, and expensive proceedings in water rights' adjudications. \nIn 1952, Congress recognized the necessity and benefit of requiring \nFederal claims to be adjudicated in these State proceedings by adopting \nthe McCarran Amendment. The McCarran Amendment waives the sovereign \nimmunity of the United States and requires the Federal Government to \nsubmit to State court jurisdiction and to file water rights' claims in \nState general adjudication proceedings.\n  These Federal claims are typically among the most complicated and \nlargest of claims in State adjudications, and Federal agencies are \noften the primary beneficiary of adjudication proceedings where states \nofficially quantify and record their water rights. However, in 1992, \nthe United States Supreme Court held that, under existing law, the U.S. \nneed not pay fees for processing Federal claims.\n  When the United States does not pay a proportionate share of the \ncosts associated with adjudications, the burden of funding the \nproceedings unfairly shifts to other water users and often delays \ncompletion of the adjudications by diminishing the resources necessary \nto complete them. Delays in completing adjudications result in the \ninability to protect private and public property interests or determine \nhow much unappropriated water may remain to satisfy important \nenvironmental and economic development priorities.\n  Additionally, because they are not subject to fees and costs like \nother water users in the adjudication, Federal agencies can file \nquestionable claims without facing court costs, inflating the number of \ntheir claims for future negotiation purposes. This creates an unlevel \nplaying field favoring the Federal agencies and places a further \nfinancial and resources burden on the system.\n  I recognize the Federal Government has a legitimate right to some \nwater rights; however, the Federal Government should play by the same \nrules as the States and other private users. The Water Adjudication Fee \nFairness Act is legislation that remedies this situation by subjecting \nthe United States, when party to a general adjudication, to the same \nfees and costs as State and private users in water rights \nadjudications.\n  This measure has the full support of the Western States Water Council \nand the Western Governor's Association. I ask my colleagues to join me \nin supporting water users, taxpayers, the States, and welcome their co-\nsponsorship.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM of Florida (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. McCain, \n        Mr. Daschle, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Landrieu, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Kerry, and \n        Mr. Nelson of Florida):\n  S. 845. A bill to amend title XIX and XXI of the Social Security Act \nto provide States with the option to cover certain legal immigrants \nunder the medicaid and State children's health insurance programs; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and \ncolleague from Rhode Island, Mr. Chafee, and a bipartisan group of co-\nsponsors to introduce the Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act \nof 2003.\n  This legislation will give states the option to provide Medicaid and \nState Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, coverage to legal \nimmigrant children and pregnant women during their first five years in \nthis country.\n  Medicaid and CHIP are vital components of our nation's health care \nsafety net. They provide coverage to over 40 million non-elderly, low-\nincome Americans, most of them children. These programs have helped \ndramatically reduce infant mortality, and they have provided health \ncare financing for millions of poor children whose families cannot \nafford the high cost of private health insurance.\n  However, for many low-income families that are eligible for Medicaid \nand CHIP, these safety net programs are little more than a mirage in a \ndesert--an illusion to those who need them most. The Personal \nResponsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, \ncommonly known as the welfare reform law, arbitrarily barred states \nfrom using federal funds to provide health coverage to low-income legal \nimmigrants during their first five years in the United States. While \nthe goal of welfare reform was to encourage self-sufficiency in adults, \nthe legislation unintentionally punished children.\n  Prior to 1996, Medicaid coverage was available to qualified children, \nparents,\n\n[[Page S5084]]\n\nseniors, and people with disabilities in both citizen and legal \nimmigrant families alike. After passage of the 1996 welfare reform law, \nmany low-income and working legal immigrant families were left without \na viable option for health insurance coverage.\n  In fact, while the percentage of our nation's children with health \ninsurance has risen in recent years, the percentage of children in \nimmigrant families with health insurance has fallen. According to the \nKaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, in 2000, half of low-\nincome children in such families were uninsured.\n  Florida is home to over half a million uninsured children, many of \nwhom are legal immigrants. Take the Sardinas family of Miami.\n  The Sardinas family immigrated to the United States from Cuba in \n2001. Mr. Sardinas works in a factory assembling airplanes while Mrs. \nSardinas maintains a low-wage job. The family's four children--Swani, \n17; Sinai, 13; Samuel, 8; and Sentia, 5--have been on a State waiting \nlist for health insurance for almost two years. Sentia has allergies \nand Swani suffers from asthma. Mrs. Sardinas worries about not having \naccess to regular check-ups for her children, but she has no choice. \nShe does not know what the family will do if Sentia has a severe \nallergic reaction or Swani is hospitalized after an asthma attack.\n  The Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act eliminates the \narbitrary designation of August 22, 1996, as a cutoff date for allowing \nchildren to get health care. More than 155,000 children like Swani, \nSinai, Samuel, and Sentia will have access to health coverage each \nyear, allowing them to receive preventive services, have their chronic \nconditions properly diagnosed and treated, and receive timely care for \nacute conditions.\n  States have asked for this option. In its 2003 Winter Policy Report, \nthe National Governors Association endorsed this common-sense policy \nproposal. The National Council of State Legislators has also endorsed \nthis bill.\n  Twenty-two States are already providing health coverage for legal \nimmigrants through State-funded replacement programs. However, severe \nbudget shortfalls may prevent such states from being able to continue \nthese important programs in the future. Our bill provides immediate \nfiscal relief for these States by allowing them to draw down federal \nmatching funds. It also gives states that are not currently providing \nhealth coverage to legal immigrant children and pregnant women the \nflexibility to do so.\n  Legal immigrants pay taxes, serve in the military, and have the same \nsocial obligations as United States citizens. Legal immigrant children \nare, as much as citizen children, the next generation of Americans. It \nis important that all children, both citizen children and legal \nimmigrant children alike, start off on the right foot towards full \ncivil participation.\n  Our bill is supported by Senators McCain, Daschle, Jeffords, \nBingaman, Lincoln, Collins, Kennedy, Feinstein, Corzine, Levin, \nSarbanes, Dodd, Landrieu, Boxer, Kerry, and Bill Nelson.\n  Representatives Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Florida and Henry Waxman of \nCalifornia have also introduced bipartisan companion legislation in the \nHouse.\n  We call upon Congress and the President to act this year and pass \nthis important bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Graham \nand Senator Chafee in introducing the Immigrant Children's Health \nInsurance Act, which will benefit tens of thousands of immigrant \nchildren and families across the Nation.\n  The 1996 welfare reform legislation disqualified legal, taxpaying \nimmigrants from major Federal assistance programs, including health \ncoverage through Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. As a result, many of these individuals and families go without \nneeded care or rely on hospital emergency rooms for their care.\n  This bill will enable States to provide health insurance coverage for \nlegal immigrant children and pregnant women under Medicaid and SCHIP. \nThis is an important step in alleviating the health disparities that \nexist for immigrant children. Research shows that children of immigrant \nare twice as likely to be uninsured as children of U.S. citizens. They \nare more than three times as likely not to have regular care, and more \nthan twice as likely to be in fair or poor health. Enacting this \nlegislation will help to eliminate these inequalities.\n  This bill will also help to reduce the number of uninsured in our \ncountry. Today, there are 42 million uninsured, and 10 million are \nchildren. Most of the uninsured are earning incomes below or near the \npoverty line, and can't afford the high cost of private insurance. The \n1996 legislation barring legal immigrants from federally funded health \ncare has contributed to the increase in the number of uninsured. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that this bill will cover an \nadditional 155,000 children and 06,000 pregnant women this year alone.\n  Throughout our history, immigrants have made important contributions \nto our country. They work hard, pay taxes, and play by the rules. In \nfact, immigrants and their children make significant contributions to \nour long-term economic well-being by adding an estimated $10 billion \nannually to our economy. However, they are disproportionately employed \nin low-wage, low-benefit jobs, and are more likely to be uninsured. \nThis bill will enable legal immigrant families to receive the services \nthey are paying for as taxpayers. It is a matter of basic fairness.\n  The bill makes good economic sense, as well. Twenty-six states and \nthe District of Columbia already use their own State funds to provide \nmedical coverage for legal immigrants, but continuing these programs is \nbecoming increasingly difficult as state budget constraints worsen. In \nfact, Massachusetts, which currently provides health coverage at State \nexpense, is proposing to eliminate Medicaid for adult immigrants. \nAllowing States to use Federal funds to support their health care \ninitiatives will provide needed fiscal relief, and ensure that these \nchildren receive a health start.\n  Both good nutrition and adequate health care are fundamental for \nhealth child development. Last year, with President Bush's support, \nCongress restored food stamp benefits to legal immigrants in the farm \nbill. It is long past time for Congress to guarantee that legal \nimmigrants also have access to health care.\n  America has a proud tradition of welcoming immigrants, and we must \nlive up to our history and heritage as a nation of immigrants. \nRestoring these health benefits will ensure that children in immigrant \nfamilies have the same opportunities for good health as every other \nchild in the Nation. The Immigrant Children's Health Insurance Act is a \nneeded step to achieve this goal, and I urge my colleagues to support \nthis important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 846. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ndeduction for premiums on mortgage insurance, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today with my Finance Committee \ncolleague, Senator Lincoln, to introduce the The Mortgage Insurance \nFairness Act. This legislation will extend the mortgage interest tax \ndeduction to mortgage insurance payment premiums, both government and \nprivate. It will make mortgage insurance payments tax-deductible and \nwill boost homeownership in Oregon and across the Nation, for those \nlower-income, minority and veteran borrowers that typically need \nmortgage insurance to purchase a home.\n  It is widely recognized that homeownership helps create stable and \nsafe communities. Thus, the Federal Government has long sought to \nincrease homeownership. The Bush Administration has announced a target \nof 5.5 million new homeowners by the year 2010. To achieve that goal, \ngroups that have typically had difficulty purchasing homes--young \npeople, low-income families, members of minority groups--must be able \nto participate in the housing market.\n  Government and private mortgage insurance programs help first-time, \nlow-income and veteran borrowers afford to purchase a home. The \nVeterans Affairs, VA, Federal Housing Authority, FHA, Regional Housing \nAuthority, RHA, and Private Mortgage Insurance,\n\n[[Page S5085]]\n\nPMI, programs allow buyers to make a down payment of 3 percent or less \nof the appraised value. Mortgage insurance is a critical factor in \nallowing middle-income families and minorities to become homeowners. In \nOregon, more than 137,000 families held mortgages with either FHA or \nprivate mortgage insurance at the end of 2002 and insured mortgages \ncovered 25 percent of home purchase loans originating in 2001. Sixty-\ntwo percent of the insured home purchases in Oregon in 2001 were low-\nincome borrowers. The Mortgage Insurance Fairness Act will bring tax \nrelief to those who need it the most.\n  In 2001, nationwide, mortgage insurance covered 57 percent percent of \nmortgage purchase loans made to African American and Hispanic borrowers \nand 54 percent percent of the loans to borrowers with incomes below the \nmedian income. The people who use mortgage insurance are regular \nworking families who live in every community throughout the country. \nCurrently, twelve million American families use mortgage insurance.\n  Presidently, these borrowers cannot deduct the cost of their mortgage \ninsurance payments for Federal tax purposes. If mortgage insurance \npayments were made deductible, the cost of homeownership would be \nfurther reduced for these borrowers, enabling new buyers to get into a \nhome that they might not have been able to afford. It is estimated that \nthe Mortgage Insurance Fairness Act would increase the number of \nhomeowners by 300,000 per year.\n  Extending the tax deduction for home mortgage interest payments to \nmortgage insurance payments will significantly contribute to making the \nAmerican dream of owning a home come true for many more of our \ncitizens. I urge my colleagues to support this important bi-partisan \nlegislation and join us in working towards its enactment at the \nearliest opportunity this year. I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof this legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 846\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \npermit States the option to provide Medicaid coverage for low income \nindividuals infected with HIV; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Early \nTreatment for HIV Act, ETHA, of 2003. Senator Clinton joins me in \nintroducing this bill, and I want to thank her for her steadfast \nsupport for people living with HIV. HIV knows no party affiliation, and \nI am pleased to say that ETHA cosponsors sit on both sides of the \naisle.\n  Simply stated, ETHA gives States the opportunity to extend Medicaid \ncoverage to low-income, HIV-positive individuals before they develop \nfull-blown AIDS. Today, the unfortunate reality is that AIDS must \ndisable most patients before they can qualify for Medicaid coverage. We \ncan do better, and we should do everything possible to ensure that all \npeople living with HIV can get early, effective medical care.\n  Current HIV treatments are very successful in delaying the \nprogression from HIV infection to AIDS, and help improve the health and \nquality of life for millions of people living with the disease. That is \nwhy it was so devastating for people in Oregon when, just a few weeks \nago, the state announced that its Medically Needy program ran out of \nmoney, and that many patients, including those living with HIV, would \nhave to go elsewhere for their treatments. The fact of the matter is \nthat safety net programs all over the country are running out of money, \nand are generally unable to cover all of the people who need paying for \ntheir medical care. As other programs are failing, ETHA gives States \nanother way to reach out to low-income, HIV-positive individuals.\n  Importantly, ETHA also offers states an enhanced Federal Medicaid \nmatch, which means more money for States that invest in treatments for \nHIV. This provision models the successful Breast and Cervical Cancer \nTreatment and Prevention Act of 2000, which allows states to provide \nearly Medicaid intervention to women with breast and cervical cancer. \nEven in these difficult times, forty-five states are now offering early \nMedicaid coverage to women with breast and cervical cancer. We can \nbuild upon this success by passing ETHA and extending similar early \nintervention treatments to people with HIV.\n  HIV/AIDS touches the lives of millions of people living in every \nState in\n\n[[Page S5086]]\n\nthe Union. Some get the proper medications, and too many do not. This \nis literally a life and death issue, and ETHA can help many more \nAmericans enjoy long, healthy lives.\n  I want to thank Senators Collins, Bingaman, Cantwell, Corzine, \nFeinstein, Landrieu, Murray, and Wyden for joining us as cosponsors of \nETHA. I also wish to thank all of the organizations around the country \nthat have expressed support for this bill. I have received a stack of \nsupport letters from those organizations, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat those letters be printed in the Congressional Record. In \nparticular, I want to thank the ADAP Working Group and the Treatment \nAccess Expansion Project, led by Robert Greenwald, for helping bring so \nmuch attention to ETHA. I hope all of my colleagues will join us in \nsupporting this critical, life-saving legislation.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               American Foundation\n\n\n                                            for Aids Research,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 9, 2003.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith and Clinton: Thank you for your \n     sponsorship of the Early Treatment for HIV Act of 2003 \n     (ETHA), which would allow states to extend Medicaid coverage \n     to low-income people living with HIV.\n       Currently, Medicaid coverage is limited to people who meet \n     very strict income requirements and meet other \n     qualifications, such as being disabled. The disability \n     requirements for Medicaid are such that many low-income \n     uninsured people living with HIV are unable to qualify for \n     Medicaid until their disease has progressed to the point \n     where they are fully disabled by AIDS. Since individuals who \n     are HIV-positive generally do not qualify for Medicaid, many \n     do not have access to the early intervention and treatment \n     that can help slow the progression of HIV and prevent the \n     onset of opportunistic infections.\n       There are many benefits to providing access to early \n     intervention and treatment to low-income HIV-positive people. \n     By delaying the progression from HIV to AIDS, savings in \n     treatment costs are realized. Most important, however, the \n     health and quality of life of individuals living with HIV is \n     greatly improved.\n       The Early Treatment for HIV Act would provide states with \n     the option of extending Medicaid coverage to low-income, non-\n     disabled people living with HIV. As a result, ETHA could help \n     provide early access to care for thousands of individuals \n     around the country.\n       We thank you for your leadership and sponsorship of this \n     very important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Jerome J. Radwin,\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Human Rights Campaign,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 7, 2003.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith and Clinton: Thank you, on behalf of \n     the more than 500,000 members of the Human Rights Campaign, \n     for your sponsorship of the Early Treatment for HIV Act of \n     2003.\n       Currently, childless adults living with HIV generally only \n     qualify for Medicaid coverage once they become eligible for \n     Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Because an individual is \n     not eligible for SSI until they become disabled, a person \n     with asymptomatic HIV infection is not eligible for Medicaid \n     until he or she has progressed to full-blown AIDS. Since HIV-\n     positive individuals do not qualify for Medicaid, many lack \n     the ability to receive medical care and medicine to help slow \n     the progression of the HIV and to prevent the onset of \n     opportunistic infections.\n       Treating those who are HIV-positive early in the \n     progression of the disease provides numerous benefits. By \n     making therapeutics available earlier, treatment costs will \n     diminish, new HIV infections will decrease because of the \n     lower viral loads, the AIDS Drug Assistance Program will be \n     able to provide care to more individuals with HIV because of \n     savings, and most importantly, the quality of life for \n     countless HIV-positive individuals will be improved. Simply \n     put, providing coverage earlier rather than later is the \n     right thing to do.\n       The Early Treatment for HIV Act would provide states with \n     the option of covering low-income HIV-infected individuals as \n     `categorically needy'. In this way, this legislation is very \n     similar to the successful effort in 2000 to provide states \n     with the option of providing Medicaid coverage to women \n     diagnosed, through a federally funded program, with breast or \n     cervical cancer.\n       On behalf of the countless people whose lives will be \n     improved by enactment of this legislation, we thank you for \n     your leadership and your sponsoring this important \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Winnie Stachelberg,\n     Political Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    L.A.

Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: On behalf of the L.A. Gay & Lesbian \n     Center, I am writing to thank you for agreeing to be the lead \n     sponsors of the Early Treatment For HIV Act (ETHA). We \n     wholeheartedly support your efforts to ensure that low-income \n     people with HIV have access to health care by allowing States \n     the option to expand Medicaid programs to cover non-disabling \n     HIV disease.\n       ETHA represents a breakthrough in assuring early access to \n     care for thousands of low-income people living with HIV. \n     Current HIV treatments are successfully delaying the \n     progression from HIV infection to AIDS, improving the health \n     and quality of life for many people living with the disease. \n     However, without access to early intervention health care and \n     treatment, these advances remain out of reach for many non-\n     disabled, low-income people with HIV.\n       Research has shown that providing highly active \n     antiretroviral therapy produces significant cost-savings in \n     reduced hospital costs. By preserving the health of people \n     living with HIV, preventing opportunistic infections \n     associated with the disease, and slowing the progression to \n     AIDS, the Early Treatment for HIV Act could ultimately save \n     taxpayer dollars. Most importantly, should ETHA become law, \n     the United States will take an important step towards \n     ensuring that all people living with HIV can get the medical \n     care they need to stay healthy for as long as possible, \n     enabling individuals to lead productive lives.\n       Increasing need as people with HIV live longer and the rise \n     in new infections demand additional resources to provide care \n     and treatment. It is unconscionable that low-income people \n     with HIV should not have access to care and treatment. The \n     demographics of the HIV epidemic have shifted into more \n     impoverished and marginalized communities. Rates of HIV \n     infection are staggeringly high in some communities, with one \n     in ten gay men infected and one in three African American gay \n     men living with HIV.\n       In an era of constrained federal resources for health care \n     spending, we must aggressively fight for effective means to \n     finance care for people with HIV. This bill will begin to \n     address these challenges through a permanent funding \n     solution, allowing states to expand the safety net to cover \n     eligible persons with early-stage HIV disease.\n       Thank you again for your leadership on behalf of people \n     living with HIV. Please let me know if there is anything I \n     can do to help secure passage of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Rebecca Isaacs,\n     Interim Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                San Francisco AIDS Foundation,\n\n                                 San Francisco, CA, April 8, 2003.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith and Clinton: The San Francisco AIDS \n     Foundation would like to thank you for your sponsorship of \n     the Early Treatment for HIV Act 2003.\n       The Act would provide states with the option of covering \n     low-income people living with HIV as `categorically needy' \n     provide them with medical care and treatment, reduce long \n     term health care costs to states, and address a serious gap \n     in public health care access. Recent breakthroughs in medical \n     science and clinical practice have transformed the \n     possibilities in HIV/AIDS care in the United States. Today, \n     we know that early intervention with medical care and \n     treatment for HIV disease slows the progression of HIV and \n     prevents the onset of opportunistic infections. Application \n     of this knowledge lengthens the life expectancy and \n     dramatically improves the quality of life for many. These \n     changes in science and medical practice demand revisions in \n     the treatment of HIV disease under Medicaid.\n       Currently Medicaid eligibility for childless adults is tied \n     to the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) eligibility. The \n     result of this determination is that people living with HIV \n     must wait for Medicaid access until their disease has \n     progressed to a disabling AIDS diagnosis. The cruel irony of \n     this practice is that individuals are forced to incur often-\n     irreparable damage to their immune systems before receiving \n     treatments that could have delayed or avoided the damage. \n     This is counter to sound public health practices and all but \n     guarantees higher cost of care for thousands of affected \n     individuals. This serious anomaly in public health care \n     coverage must be rectified by the enactment of this \n     legislation.\n\n[[Page S5087]]\n\n       The AIDS Foundation thanks you both for your leadership and \n     sponsorship of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Ernest Hopkins,\n     Director of Federal Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Treatment Access\n\n\n                                            Expansion Project,\n\n                                        Boston, MA, April 7, 2003.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The Treatment Access Expansion Project (TAEP) \n     would like to thank you on behalf of our broad-based \n     coalition of members. Your leadership and support of the \n     Early Treatment For HIV Act (ETHA) and your commitment to \n     AIDS and to the HIV community are greatly appreciated.\n       As you are well aware, ETHA would allow states to extend \n     Medicaid coverage to pre-disabled people living with HIV. \n     This breakthrough in assuring early access to care for \n     thousands of low-income people living with HIV is imperative. \n     Under current law, AIDS must disable most patients before \n     they can qualify for Medicaid coverage. Enacting ETHA into \n     law would represent an important step toward ensuring that \n     all people living with HIV could get the medical care \n     necessary to remain healthy for as long as possible.\n       Current HIV treatments are successful in delaying the \n     progression from HIV infection to AIDS, and thus help improve \n     the health and quality of life for many people living with \n     the disease.

ETHA would allow states to extend Medicaid \n     coverage to pre-disabled people living with HIV. It \n     represents a breakthrough in assuring early access to care \n     for thousands of low-income people living with HIV. \n     Currently, most individuals with HIV must become disabled by \n     AIDS in orders to receive Medicaid coverage.\n       HIV/AIDS treatments are successfully delaying the \n     progression from HIV infection to full-blown AIDS. These \n     advancements have improved both the health and quality of \n     life for many people living with this disease. However, \n     without access to early intervention health care and \n     treatment, these advances remain out of reach for thousands \n     of non-disabled, low-income people living with HIV.\n       By preserving the health of people living with HIV, \n     preventing opportunistic infections, and slowing the \n     progression to AIDS, ETHA could ultimately save taxpayer \n     dollars.

We \n     strongly support the goals of this legislation and are \n     grateful for your leadership.\n       As you know, ETHA would allow states to extend Medicaid \n     coverage to pre-disabled people living with HIV. It \n     represents a breakthrough in assuring early access to care \n     for thousands of low-income people living with HIV. Current \n     HIV treatments are successfully delaying the progression from \n     HIV infection to AIDS, as well as improving the health and \n     quality of life for many people living with the disease. \n     However, without access to early intervention, health care \n     and treatment, these advances remain out of reach for many \n     non-disabled, low-income people with HIV.\n       By preserving the health of people living with HIV, \n     preventing opportunistic infections associated with the \n     disease, and slowing the progression to AIDS, the Early \n     Treatment for HIV Act could ultimately save taxpayer dollars. \n     Most importantly, should ETHA become law, the United States \n     will take an important step towards ensuring that all people \n     living with HIV can get the medical care they need to stay \n     healthy for as long as possible.\n       Whitman-Walker Clinic provides a broad range of services \n     including HIV testing and counseling, medical and dental \n     care, substance abuse and mental health services and housing. \n     Yet maintaining access to these services for those in need is \n     increasingly difficult.\n       Despite nearly two decades of success in HIV prevention and \n     care which has kept tens of thousands alive and healthy in \n     our community, Washington, DC has a rate of AIDS ten times \n     the national average.

Because an individual is \n     not eligible for SSI until they become disabled, a person \n     with a symptomatic HIV infection is not eligible for Medicaid \n     until he or she has progressed to AIDS. Since HIV-positive \n     individuals do not qualify for Medicaid, many lack the \n     ability to receive medical care and medicine to help slow the \n     progression of the HIV and to prevent the onset of \n     opportunistic infections.\n       Treating those who are HIV-positive early in the \n     progression of the disease provides numerous benefits. By \n     making therapeutics available earlier, treatment costs will \n     diminish, due to cost savings the AIDS Drug Assistance \n     Program will be able to provide care to more individuals with \n     HIV, and most importantly, the quality of life for countless \n     HIV-positive individuals will be improved. Simply put, \n     providing coverage earlier rather than later improved lives \n     and reduces cost for all.\n       The Early Treatment for HIV Act would provide states with \n     the option of covering low-income HIV-infected individuals as \n     ``categorically needy.'' In this way, this legislation is \n     very similar to the successful effort in 2000 to provide \n     states with the option of providing Medicaid coverage to \n     women diagnosed, through a federally funded program, with \n     breast or cervical cancer.\n       On behalf of the countless people whose lives will be \n     improved by enactment of this legislation, we thank you for \n     your leadership and your sponsoring this important \n     legislation.\n           Very truly yours,\n     A.

Because an individual is \n     not eligible for SSI until they become disabled, a person \n     with asymptomatic HIV infection is not eligible for Medicaid \n     until he or she has progressed to full-blown AIDS. Since HIV-\n     positive individuals do not quality for Medicaid, many lack \n     the ability to receive medical care and medicine to help slow \n     the progression of the HIV and to prevent the onset of \n     opportunistic infections.\n       Treating those who are HIV-positive early in the \n     progression of the disease provides numerous benefits. By \n     making therapeutics available earlier, treatment costs will \n     diminish, new HIV infections will decrease because of the \n     lower viral loads, the AIDS Drug Assistance Program will be \n     able to provide care to more individuals with HIV because of \n     savings, and most importantly, the quality of life for \n     countless HIV-positive individuals will be improved.

Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: On behalf of the thousands of parents \n     and children served by Parents Anonymous' of \n     Oregon, I wish to thank you for the support you have provided \n     to the Parents Anonymous' Programs in your State. \n     These vital federal funds and support from Parents \n     Anonymous' Inc. allow us to meet the ever \n     increasing demand and ensure that the proven effective, child \n     abuse prevention programs of Parents Anonymous' \n     are available to strengthen families here at home.\n       For over twenty-five years, Parents Anonymous' \n     of Oregon (PAO) has been dedicated to the prevention of child \n     abuse and neglect by strengthening families in our community. \n     Currently we provide 14 free weekly Parent Support Groups and \n     Children's Programs to parents experiencing challenges and \n     stress in their family and who have the courage to seek help. \n     PAO is committed to providing services to anyone in parenting \n     role, but particularly to at risk populations, including low \n     income Latino families, women transitioning from federal \n     prison and women in residential treatment for substance \n     abuse.\n       I respectfully request your support and advocacy for two \n     funding initiatives for Parents Anonymous' Inc. \n     for fiscal year 2004.\n       $4 million in the current level of appropriations under the \n     Commerce-Justice-State (``CJS'') appropriations bill, for \n     strengthening and expanding nationwide services to families \n     in local communities to prevent child abuse, neglect, and \n     juvenile delinquency.\n       $3 million under the Labor-Health and Human Services \n     (``LHHS'') appropriations bill for establishing, operating, \n     and maintaining a national parent helpline.\n       Research demonstrates that child abuse and neglect is often \n     a precursor to delinquent and adult criminal behavior and \n     that children who are abused or neglected are 40% more likely \n     to engage in delinquency or adult criminal behavior. In fact, \n     being abused or neglected as a child increases the likelihood \n     of an arrest as a juvenile by 59%, as an adult by 28%, and \n     for a violent crime by 30%. The requested CJS funding will \n     enable us to continue Parents Anonymous' Programs \n     and address the needs of at-risk populations. In addition, \n     this funding will help, in the long run, to reduce \n     expenditures in other Department of Justice programs.\n       The requested LHHS funding for a national parent helpline \n     run by Parents Anonymous' Inc. will enable parents \n     throughout the country, in all states, on reservations, in \n     urban and rural areas, to obtain immediate support and help, \n     24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Currently, thee is no national \n     toll-free telephone system aimed at providing immediate \n     support to parents seeking help with their child-raising \n     crises and connecting them with effective community-based \n     programs for assistance--the first cry for help needs to be \n     answered in order to prevent child abuse and neglect.\n       Given your strong commitment and leadership to addressing \n     the needs of families in your State, we wish to thank you in \n     advance for championing these two FY 04 funding initiatives.\n           Very truly yours,\n\n                                                  Ruth Taylor,\n\n                                                 Program Director,\n     Parents Anonymous' of Oregon.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     Metropolitan Community Church\n\n\n                                                   of Portland\n\n                                     Portlands, OR, April 9, 2003.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington DC.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith and Clinton, I want to take this \n     opportunity to thank you for your sponsorship of the Early \n     Treatment for HIV Act of 2003. Esther's Pantry has been a \n     food bank for individuals living with AIDS since 1985. As \n     funding for AIDS programs such as ours continue to decline \n     and disappear, it very important that individuals diagnosed \n     with HIV receive medical benefits as soon as possible so they \n     may maintain some level of health and be able to provide for \n     themselves long term. We have learned so much about HIV/AIDS \n     over the past several years and the most important lesson has \n     been early detection and treatment. Your bill will address \n     that further piece of the solution by providing some \n     resources to enable those infected to follow through.\n       At Esther's Pantry, we regularly provide individually \n     shopped food boxes to approximately 150 clients every month \n     for a total annual population of clients numbering 250. We \n     recently lost Ryan White Title 1 funding and now provide our \n     service through local donation and grant funding from a \n     variety of sources. All clients must have AIDS and be at less \n     than twice the federal poverty level. We are a provider for \n     these clients who are struggling to cope with increased \n     medical costs. Earlier treatment of all these clients would \n     have helped to maintain their health, and enable them to \n     expend their resources for other life necessities. Failure to \n     do this has only created a dire situation.\n       This is certainly a bill that takes the necessary steps to \n     improve the situation for so many men, women and children \n     suffering from this disease. Thank you for your continuing \n     efforts.\n           In Gratitude,\n                                                 David R.

Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Re: Early Treatment for HIV Act of 2003\n       Dear Senators Smith and Clinton: I am the executive \n     director of Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and \n     Gays (PFLAG), the nation's foremost family organization \n     dedicated to fair treatment for gay, lesbian, bisexual and \n     transgender (GLBT) persons. Founded in 1973 by heterosexual \n     parents who were brought together by their deep desire to \n     understand and accept their GLBT loved ones, PFLAG consists \n     of almost 500 chapters and represents over 250,000 members \n     and supporters--Republicans and Democrats--throughout the \n     country. On behalf of our national membership, I write to \n     thank you for your sponsorship of the Early Treatment for HIV \n     Act of 2003.\n       As a national organization whose mission focuses on the \n     health and well-being of GLBT persons, PFLAG strongly \n     believes that treating those who are HIV-positive early in \n     the progression of the disease provides numerous benefits. By \n     making therapeutics available earlier, treatment costs will \n     diminish, new HIV infections will decrease because of the \n     lower viral loads, the AIDS Drug Assistance Program will be \n     able to provide care to more individuals with HIV because of \n     savings, and most importantly,\n\n[[Page S5090]]\n\n     the quality of life for countless HIV-positive individuals \n     will be improved. Simply put, providing coverage earlier \n     rather than later is the right thing to do.\n       The Early Treatment for HIV Act would provide states with \n     the option of covering low-income HIV-infected individuals as \n     ``categorically needy''. In this way, this legislation is \n     very similar to the successful effort in 2000 to provide \n     states with the option of providing Medicaid coverage to \n     women diagnosed, through a federally funded program, with \n     breast or cervical cancer.\n       PFLAG is proud to support you in calling for these critical \n     steps to be taken in our national fight against AIDS/HIV, and \n     we applaud you for your leadership in this important battle \n     we must all win.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      David Tseng,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric\n\n\n                                              Aids Foundation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 8, 2003.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith and Clinton: On behalf of the Elizabeth \n     Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, I would like to express my \n     strong support for the Early Treatment for HIV Act of 2003. \n     We applaud your efforts to give states the option to extend \n     critical Medicaid benefits to low-income HIV-infested \n     individuals.\n       For children and adults infected with HIV the recent \n     dramatic advances in treatment offer great hope for living \n     long and healthy lives. Unfortunately, for too many low-\n     income and uninsured individuals the cost of these live-\n     saving medications is out of reach. A ``catch-22'' in the \n     current Medicaid rules requires that they must be disabled by \n     AIDS before Medicaid will begin to cover the drugs that would \n     have prevented or delayed their becoming disabled in the \n     first place.\n       Improving the access of HIV-positive individuals to \n     treatment early in the progression of the disease is not only \n     humane, but also cost-effective. Early treatment lowers the \n     need for expensive medical interventions and, by decreasing \n     viral loads, reduces the likelihood of new infections. Just \n     as importantly, by preserving the ability of HIV-infected \n     individuals to be productive and healthy workers, parents and \n     citizens, early treatment also reduces the attendant social \n     costs of AIDS.\n       Thank you for your leadership and commitment to this issue. \n     We look forward to working with you toward passage of the \n     Early Treatment for HIV Act.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Mark Isaac,\n\n                                   Vice President for Governmental\n     and Public Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS \n           Directors,\n                                    Washington, DC, April 8, 2003.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: On behalf of the National Alliance of \n     State and Territorial AIDS Directors (NASTAD), I am writing \n     to offer our support for the ``Early Treatment for HIV Act.'' \n     NASTAD represents the nation's chief state and territorial \n     health agency staff who are responsible for HIV/AIDS \n     prevention, care and treatment programs funded by state and \n     federal governments. This legislation would give states an \n     important option in providing care and treatment services to \n     low-income Americans living with HIV.\n       The Early Treatment for HIV Act (ETHA) would allow states \n     to expand their Medicaid programs to cover HIV positive \n     individuals, before they become disabled, without having to \n     receive a waiver. NASTAD believes this legislation would \n     allow HIV positive individuals to access the medical care \n     that is widely recommended, can postpone or avoid the onset \n     of AIDS, and can enormously increase the quality of life for \n     people living with HIV.\n       State AIDS directors continue to develop innovative and \n     cost-effective HIV/AIDS programs in the face of devastating \n     state budget cuts and federal contributions that fail to keep \n     up with need. ETHA provides a solution to states by \n     increasing health care access for those living with HIV/AIDS. \n     ETHA will also save states money in the long-run by treating \n     HIV positive individuals earlier in the disease's progression \n     and providing states with a federal match for the millions of \n     dollars they are presently spending on HIV/AIDS care.\n       Thank you very much for your continued commitment to \n     persons living with HIV/AIDS. I look forward to working with \n     you to gain support for this important piece of legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Julie M.

Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: on behalf of the Southern California \n     HIV Advocacy Coalition, I am writing to thank you for \n     agreeing to be the lead sponsors of the Early Treatment For \n     HIV Act (ETHA). We strongly support this legislation and are \n     grateful for your leadership.\n       As you know, ETHA would allow states to extend Medicaid \n     coverage to pre-disabled people living with HIV. It \n     represents a breakthrough in assuring early access to care \n     for thousands of low-income people living with HIV. Current \n     HIV treatments are successfully delaying the progression from \n     HIV infection to AIDS, improving the health and quality of \n     life for many people living with the disease. However, \n     without access to early intervention health care and \n     treatment, these advances remain out of reach for many non-\n     disabled, low-income people with HIV. The delay in getting \n     individuals into a system of care is having a huge \n     detrimental impact on the HIV delivery system and the entire \n     health safety net in the Southern California area.\n       By preserving the health of people living with HIV, \n     preventing opportunistic infections associated with the \n     disease, and slowing the progression to AIDS, the Early \n     Treatment for HIV Act could ultimately save taxpayer dollars. \n     Most importantly, should ETHA become law, the United States \n     will take an important step towards ensuring that all people \n     living with HIV can get the medical care they need to stay \n     healthy for as long as possible.\n       In an era of constrained federal resources for health care \n     spending, we must aggressively fight for effective means to \n     finance care for people with HIV. This bill will begin to \n     address these challenges through a permanent funding \n     solution, allowing states to expand the safety net to cover \n     eligible persons with early-stage HIV disease.\n       Thank you again for your leadership on behalf of people \n     living with HIV.

Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: on behalf of The Center for AIDS: Hope \n     & Remembrance Project (CFA), I am writing to thank you for \n     agreeing to be the lead sponsors of the Early Treatment For \n     HIV Act (ETHA). We strongly support this legislation and are \n     grateful for your leadership.\n       As you know, ETHA would allow states to extend Medicaid \n     coverage to pre-disabled people living with HIV. It \n     represents a breakthrough in assuring early access to care \n     for thousands of low-income people living with HIV. Current \n     HIV treatments are successfully delaying the progression from \n     HIV infection to AIDS, improving the health and quality of \n     life for many people living with the disease. However, \n     without access to early intervention health care and \n     treatment, these advances remain out of reach for many non-\n     disabled, low-income people with HIV. Moreover, without these \n     treatments to stave off disease progression, hospitalizations \n     and associated costs would unnecessarily add millions of \n     dollars in burdens to the U.S. health care system.\n       The CFA has the largest collection HIV/AIDS-specific \n     treatment information in the southwestern U.S. The CFA \n     specializes in research/treatment information and advocacy. \n     The proposed ETHA legislation will help The CFA's clients--\n     those affected by HIV/AIDS both locally in Houston and \n     nationally--stay healthier and lead productive lives in \n     society.\n       By preserving the health of people living with HIV, \n     preventing opportunistic infections associated with the \n     disease, and slowing the progression to AIDS, ETHA could \n     ultimately save taxpayer dollars. Most importantly, should \n     ETHA become law, the United States will take an important \n     step towards ensuring that all people living with HIV can get \n     the medical care they need to stay healthy for as long as \n     possible.\n       Thank you again for your leadership on behalf of people \n     living with HIV.

Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith and Clinton: the San Francisco AIDS \n     Foundation would like to thank you for your sponsorship of \n     the Early Treatment for HIV Act 2003.\n       The Act would provide states with the option of covering \n     low-income people living with HIV as `categorically needy' \n     provide them with medical care and treatment, reduce long \n     term health care costs to states, and address a serious gap \n     in public health care access. Recent breakthroughs in medical \n     science and clinical practice have transformed the \n     possibilities in HIV/AIDS care in the United States. Today, \n     we know that early intervention with medical care and \n     treatment for HIV disease slows the progression of HIV and \n     prevents the onset of opportunistic infections. Application \n     of this knowledge lengthens the life expectancy and \n     dramatically improves the quality of life for many. These \n     changes in science and medical practice demand revisions in \n     the treatment of HIV disease under Medicaid.\n       Currently Medicaid eligibility for childless adults is tied \n     to Supplemental Security Income (SSI) eligibility. The result \n     of this determination is that people living with HIV must \n     wait for Medicaid access until their disease has progressed \n     to a disabling AIDS diagnosis. The cruel irony of this \n     practice is that individuals are forced to incur often-\n     irreparable damage to their immune systems before receiving \n     treatments that could have delayed or avoided the damage. \n     This is counter to sound public health practices and all but \n     guarantees higher cost of care for thousands of affected \n     individuals. This serious anomaly in public health care \n     coverage must be rectified by the enactment of this \n     legislation.\n       The AIDS Foundation thanks you both for your leadership and \n     sponsorship of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Ernest Hopkins,\n                                      Director of Federal Affairs.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Early \nTreatment for HIV Act of 2003 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 847\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for a land exchange in the State of Arizona \nbetween the Secretary of Agriculture and Yavapai Ranch Limited \nPartnership; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Kyl \ntoday to introduce the Northern Arizona National Forest Land Exchange \nAct of 2003. This bill facilitates an exchange of over 50,000 acres of \nFederal and private land in Arizona for the primary purpose of \nconsolidating National Forest lands currently in checkerboard ownership \nin the northwestern portion of the State. Included in the exchange are \na number of other Federal land parcels located in the communities of \nFlagstaff, Williams, Clarkdale, Cottonwood, and Camp Verde and other \nlands currently leased by six different camps.\n  This is a complex land exchange because of its size, the diverse \nnature of the lands involved, and the range of potential benefits and \nimpacts that would result. The Forest Service has stated that the \nconsolidation of the checkerboard in the Prescott National Forest will \nyield significant benefits and cost-savings to the public. In putting \nforth this exchange with the Yavapai Ranch Limited Partnership, the \nForest Service has identified opportunities to achieve better and more \ncost-effective management of Federal lands and resources, to acquire \nlands that will meet the important public objectives of protection of \nwildlife habitat, cultural resources, watershed, wilderness and \naesthetic values, and also meet the needs of State and local residents \nand their economies.\n  The communities of Flagstaff and Williams and the camps are strongly \nin favor of this bill as it will allow them to acquire federal lands \nthat will be exchanged to Yavapai Ranch, providing them beneficial \neconomic and land use management opportunities. The communities of \nClarkdale, Cottonwood, and Camp Verde are also an important part of \nthis exchange. Inclusion of these parcels, totaling more than 300 \nacres, has focused discussion on essential issues of available water \nsupply, the limits of sustainable growth, and quality of life concerns.\n  The issue of potential adverse impacts of new development on limited \nwater resources has been addressed in this bill through the \nestablishment of conservation easements which limit water use on the \nVerde Valley parcels after private acquisition. This foresighted \nprovision is intended to conserve precious surface and ground water \nresources and protect the water users and State water right holders \ndependent upon them. Given the uncertainty about available water \nsupplies and future uses, I believe this is a responsible measure which \nis in the interest of both Arizona citizens and the American public.\n  Of primary importance to me are the procedural terms and conditions \nby which the land exchange will be conducted. The Forest Service has \nstated that the procedures set forth in this bill represent standard \npractice and will allow for the desired outcome of a fair and equal \nvalue exchange of public property. I have also made an effort to\n\n[[Page S5092]]\n\nsolicit public input on the exchange in order to appreciate the \npotential benefits and costs involved. I held several public meetings \nin Arizona on the exchange and have heard and read the differing views \nof hundreds of interested Arizonans.\n  After careful consideration, I believe it is appropriate that the \nbill be introduced at this time. While the proposed exchange has the \nsupport of the Forest Service, the elected representatives of the \naffected communities, and the camps, introduction of this bill advances \nus to the next phase of public consideration of key aspects and \nprocedural issues associated with the legislation.\n  I expect that public hearings will be held here and in Arizona on the \nbill in the near future. The Forest Service will have an opportunity to \nprovide public statements concerning the specific provisions of the \nbill, as will other parties affected by the exchange. I anticipate that \nin the next phase of the legislative process, our state delegation will \nreceive the information needed to address any remaining issues and \nensure that this exchange will be conducted in a manner that benefits \nthe citizens of Arizona and Federal taxpayers alike.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join with Senator \nMcCain to introduce the Northern Arizona National Forest Land Exchange \nAct of 2003. This bill, which facilitates a large and very complex land \nexchange in Arizona, is the product of months of discussions between \nthe Forest Service, community groups, local officials, and other \nstakeholders. It will allow communities to accommodate growth and \nimprove the management of our forests; it will also yield many \nenvironmental benefits to the public.\n  This bill will protect some of Arizona's most beautiful ponderosa \npine forests from future development by placing approximately 35,000 \nacres of private land into public use. It consolidates a 110-square \nmile area in the Prescott National Forest near the existing Juniper \nMesa Wilderness under Forest Service ownership, to preserve the area in \nits natural state and prevent its subdivision. This land has old growth \nponderosa pine that is at least 250 years old and juniper that is 500 \nyears old or older. Consolidation will preserve the area for watershed \nmanagement, wildlife habitat, and outdoor recreation. Without \nconsolidation, these tracts would be open to future development. I am \npleased that this bill will preserve them for future generations.\n  This bill significantly improves management of the Prescott National \nForest. The existing checkerboard ownership pattern in the Prescott \nmakes management and access difficult. The exchange improves management \nof the forest by consolidating this land, and allowing the Forest \nService to effectively apply forest-restoration treatments designed to \nimprove forest health and reduce hazardous fuels. In turn, better \nmanagement will help decrease the fire risk in Arizona's forests. The \nimportance of improved management and efficient restoration treatments \ncannot be overstated given last year's devastating Rodeo-Chediski fire.\n  In addition to protecting Arizona's natural resources, this bill \nallows several Northern Arizona communities to accommodate future \ngrowth and economic development, and to meet other municipal needs. The \nexchange will allow the Cities of Williams and Flagstaff to expand \ntheir airports and water-treatment facilities, and develop town parks \nand recreation areas. The town of Camp Verde will have the opportunity \nto acquire lands for view shed protection. Several youth organizations \nthroughout northern Arizona will be able to acquire land for their \ncamps.\n  Even as it addresses environmental and community needs, this bill \nsaves significant taxpayer dollars. It obviates the administrative \nroute for land exchange--doing an exchange of this size \nadministratively would require considerable financial and personnel \nresources within the Forest Service. The agency estimates that the \nlegislative approach will cost half as much as the administrative \nalternative--resulting in potential savings to the taxpayers in excess \nof $500,000.\n  This land exchange is supported and endorsed by many municipalities, \nreligious institutions, environmental groups, and other nongovernmental \norganizations in Arizona. Experts from the Arizona Game and Fish \nDepartment have reviewed the lands to be exchanged and strongly support \nthe proposal. I have received hundreds of letters and petitions from \nresidents expressing support for it. This exchange is extremely \nimportant to the residents of Arizona.\n  This land exchange is a unique opportunity to protect Arizona's \nnatural resources while accommodating the tremendous growth that my \nState is experiencing. This bill is good for the state of Arizona and I \nplan to work with my colleagues to ensure that we pass this important \nlegislation this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/09/senate-section/article/S5092-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5092-S5093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 112--DESIGNATING APRIL 11TH, 2003, AS ``NATIONAL \n              YOUTH SERVICE DAY'', AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Biden, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \nJohnson, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bunning, Mr. \nCampbell, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \nDurbin, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lugar, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. \nMurray, and Mr. Stevens) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

The nutria eradication bill.\n  Mr. REID. Is that the rat eradication?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It certainly is.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I think so.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this legislation would reauthorize and \nexpand the Nutria Control Project established under Public Law 105-322 \nto help address the non-native rodent nutria which is destroying \nwetlands and valuable habitat at and around Blackwater National \nWildlife Refuge on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and in Louisiana. \nSponsored by my colleague, Representative Wayne Gilchrest, the \nlegislation authorizes $4 million in grant assistance to the State of \nMaryland and $2 million to the State of Louisiana for each of the next \n5 fiscal\n\n[[Page S5097]]\n\nyears to help alleviate this invasive problem.\n  Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge and its surrounding wetlands are \nbeing threatened by the prolific and highly invasive non-indigenous \nspecies nutria which is destroying the tidal marshes and even \ndisplacing other native species. Over the past three decades, the \npopulation of nutria in Maryland has grown exponentially from about 150 \nto as many as 150,000--a thousand fold increase. During that same \nperiod, Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge has lost more than 40 \npercent of its marshes--approximately 7000 of 17,000 acres--due, in \nlarge part, to nutria. As nutria population densities continue to \nincrease, so does the range of the creature and its associated \necological damage. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, \nevery Maryland county south of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge on both the \neastern and western shores has reported nutria. Without action, \nresource managers believe that valuable habitat will continue to be \nlost at an accelerated rate, numerous fish and wildlife resources will \nbe impacted, and the range and distribution of this invasive species \nwill continue to expand.\n  In 1998, the Congress enacted legislation Public Law 105-322--\nauthorizing $2.9 million for a 3-year pilot project designed to develop \ntechniques to control nutria populations and to restore degraded marsh \nhabitat. Over the past 3 years, approximately $2 million has been \nappropriated for studies of the reproductive capacity of the species, \nmethods to eradicate nutria populations, and prospects for restoring \nwetlands destroyed by the critter along Maryland's Eastern Shore. The \nauthorization expired in September 2002, and new legislation is needed \nto move to the next phase of a control and ultimately an eradication \nprogram. Results of the project in phase II are expected to be \napplicable throughout the range of nutria in North America, which \nincludes 15 States and potentially over 1 million acres of marsh \nhabitat on national wildlife refuges.\n  This legislation authorizes the Federal funds necessary to carry out \nthe program. I urge adoption of the legislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read three \ntimes, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nthat any statements relating thereto be printed in the Record, with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 273) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/09/senate-section/article/S5097-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL YOUTH SERVICE DAY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise in support of S. Res. 112, a \nresolution that requests the President of the United States to \ndesignate April 11, 2003 as ``National Youth Service Day,'' \nacknowledges the remarkable community service efforts of youth today, \nand encourages all people to recognize and support the significance of \nthese contributions.\n  NYSD is a public awareness and education campaign that highlights the \nextraordinary contributions that young people make to their communities \nthroughout the year. On this day, youth from across the United States \nand the world will carry out community service projects in areas \nranging from hunger to literacy to the environment. NYSD is the largest \nservice event in the world with over three million participants. NYSD \nbrings a diverse group of local, regional, and national partners \ntogether to support and promote youth service.\n  As a mother of two young sons, I understand the importance of \nrecognizing and supporting the positive contributions that youth make \nto our country and the world each and every day. It is imperative to \nkeep young people active and motivated, and instilled with a sense of \ncommunity responsibility. Volunteer work gives youth an outlet to gain \nthis responsibility, and to learn valuable skills that are essential to \npersonal and academic achievement.\n  I thank my colleagues--Senators Akaka, Baucus, Biden, Brownback, \nBunning, Campbell, Clinton, Cochran, Collins, DeWine, Domenici, Durbin, \nJohnson, Kennedy, Landrieu, Lugar, Mikulski, Murray, and Stevens--for \nco-sponsoring this worthwhile legislation, which will ensure that youth \nacross the country and the world know that all of their hard work is \ngreatly appreciated.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 113 submitted earlier \nby Senators Dodd and Lieberman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 113) commending the Huskies of the \n     University of Connecticut for winning the 2003 NCAA Division \n     I Women's Basketball Championship.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the outstanding \naccomplishments of this year's NCAA women's basketball champions--the \nUniversity of Connecticut Huskies--and offer, along with my colleague \nSenator Lieberman, a Senate resolution commending the Huskies for \nanother phenomenal season.\n  Sports and other forms of entertainment have taken a backseat over \nthe past few weeks, and rightfully so, as our full national attention \nhas been focused on our brave service men and women risking--and some \nlosing--their lives in our war with Iraq.\n  The beginning of this year's NCAA tournament coincided almost to the \nhour with the beginning of America's war with Iraq. For millions of \nAmericans who eyes were glued to the television watching live coverage \nof our swift invasion, and whose hearts and prayers remain with our \ntroops overseas, the NCAA tournament offered us all a much needed \ndiversion.\n  Compared to the stakes in the real battles being fought by our young \nmen and women in cities and towns across Iraq, the stakes in this \nyear's tournament seem very insignificant.\n  But watching the NCAA tournament reminded us of the simple joy we \nfeel from witnessing America's finest young athletes engage in the \nheights of competition.\n  And for thousands of soldiers who watched the games live by satellite \nin the Persian Gulf, it gave them a little taste of home, where, it is \nmy hope, they will be returning very, very soon.\n  I would like to take a few moments to commend all the participants in \nthe men's and women's basketball tournament this year. I want to \nespecially congratulate the Syracuse Orangemen for their victory over \nKansas on Monday night in the men's championship game.\n  It was truly a spectacular year for the Big East, which also included \nSt. John's winning the NIT championship.\n  But most of all, I would like to specifically recognize the UConn \nLady Huskies for their tremendous accomplishments this season, \nculminating with winning the national championship over their arch-\nrival Tennessee last night, by a score of 73-68.\n  A casual observer picking up a newspaper today might remark, ``UConn \nwins. Just like every year.'' And indeed, this marks the second \nstraight year, and the third time in the last four years, that the Lady \nHuskies have ended the season as champions.\n  But anyone who has followed UConn knows that this year was not just \nlike any other year--and it certainly wasn't like last year. Last \nseason, an undefeated UConn team, led by four outstanding All-American \nseniors--Sue Bird, Swin Cash, Tamika Williams, and Asjha Jones--won its \ngames by an average of 35 points.\n  After these four women graduated--each one moving on to play \nprofessionally in the WNBA--many pundits believed that a younger, less \nexperienced UConn team filled with underclassmen, and not a single \nsenior, had little chance to win much of anything this season. To many, \nthis was considered a rebuilding year. Preseason polls had the Huskies \nranked as low as 12th in the Nation.\n  Yet through grit, determination, talent, teamwork--and an exceptional \ncoaching staff led by Geno Auriemma--the Huskies exceeded all \nexpectations. They opened the season with 31 straight wins, extending \ntheir record winning streak to 70 games--one of the greatest streaks in \nthe history of team sports.\n  After moving with relative ease through the first few rounds of the \nNCAA tournament, they survived a grueling test against Texas in the \nsemifinal game last Sunday night, when they rallied from a 9-point \ndeficit with 12 minutes remaining to win by only two points. And last \nnight, they held off a furious late rally by Tennessee.\n  As usual, the tremendous play of two-time All-American junior Diana \nTaurasi sparked the Huskies to victory. This year, Ms. Taurasi sparked \nthe Huskies to victory. This year, Ms. Taurasi rewrote the record \nbooks, as she put together one of the most outstanding seasons in the \nhistory of women's college basketball. She was recognized as the player \nof the year by every organization that gives out that honor, and was \nalso named the Most Outstanding Player of the NCAA East Regional and \nthe Final Four.\n  Her 157 points in the NCAA tournament represented the third highest \ntotal in history. And her on and off court leadership was a steadying \nforce for such a young team, prompting one of her teammates to describe \nher as ``the most amazing leader you could ask for.''\n  But it was not only Diana Taurasi who won the championship for UConn. \nIn fact, in the final game, despite scoring 28 points, she did not \nscore a single point in the last 6 minutes. Instead, she relied upon \nher teammates to take center stage. The final free throws that inched \nthe team closer to victory were made by a freshman, Ann Strother, who \nplayed one of the best games of her young career. And the steal that \nclinched the game was made by a sophomore reserve, Defensive Player of \nthe Year, Ashley Battle.\n  Last night's game showed all of America what we in Connecticut have \nknown for years: that the Lady Huskies are not a collection of \nindividual players, but a team in every sense of the word.\n  Though the players all played their hearts out this year, UConn's \nsuccess is also a testimony to their outstanding coach, Geno Auriemma. \nThis year, Coach Auriemma was recognized for the fourth time as the \nCoach of the Year by the Associated Press and by the United States \nBasketball Writers Association. In his amazing 18 years as head coach \nof the Huskies, he has won 501 games and lost only 99.\n  His success has made him one of the most recognizable figures in the \nNutmeg State. Coach Auriemma has taught his players not only how to \nwin, but how to do so with grace.\n  In an age when sportsmanship has become almost a forgotten word, \nUConn women stand as a model which all young children can emulate, \nextending helping hands to fallen opponents and congratulating them \nafter a game's conclusion.\n  And every single student-athlete brought to UConn by Coach Auriemma \nhas received her undergraduate degree.\n  The success of the Lady Huskies has extended far beyond their own \nteam. During their recent dynasty, women's basketball, and women's \nathletics in general, have risen to new prominence. This year, for the \nfirst time ever, all 63 games in the women's NCAA tournament were \ntelevised nationally. Over 28,000 fans attended last night's title game \nat the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, and millions more watched on \ntelevision.\n  I am proud that the UConn Huskies have contributed to the flourishing \nof women's sports in America. Anyone who watched last night's game \nknows why this is so: the athletic ability of these women is truly \namazing, matched only by their intensity and enthusiasm. And the \ncaliber of women's basketball will only continue to get better and \nbetter as more and more young girls are inspired by these athletes to \nplay sports in elementary and high school.\n  I would like to recognize every member of the Huskies: players Ashley \nValley, Diana Taurasi, Maria Conlon, Stacey Marron, Morgan Valley, \nNicole Wolff, Ashley Battle, Willnett Crockett, Jessica Moore, Barbara \nTurner, Ann Strother, Head Coach Geno Auriemma, Associate Head Coach \nChris Dailey, and Assistant Coaches Tonya Cardoza and Jamelle Elliott.\n  I would also like to congratulate the runners-up, the University of \nTennessee Volunteers, and their Head Coach Pat Summitt, for an \noutstanding season as well. For years, Tennessee has been synonymous \nwith success in women's basketball, and there is no doubt that when the \nHuskies won last night, they beat the best.\n\n[[Page S5099]]\n\n  With the great joy and pride that I and all Connecticut residents \nfeel right now, I am almost sorry to see the season end. But with every \nsingle member of the team set to return next year. I am already looking \nforward to another great season. If anyone can top this year's \naccomplishments, I know the Huskies can.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nUniversity of Connecticut Huskies on their national championship, the \nfourth in the school's history. With their impressive 73-68 victory \nover the Tennessee Lady Vols, another powerhouse program, the Huskies \nproved that they could do much more than rebuild their team after last \nyear's undefeated season. The Huskies showed that they could repeat as \nthe best team in the land. That makes them just the third repeat \nchampion in women's college basketball history.\n  With this victory, the great Geno Auriemma--national coach of the \nyear--has earned a place, alongside Jim Calhoun of course, as one of \nthe best basketball coaches in America. Diana Taurasi, the Naismith \nPlayer of the Year and the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player, has \nbecome a full-fledged superstar. And the rest of this young team has \ndemonstrated a harmony and chemistry that are almost impossible to \nmatch, especially for such a young group. Do you realize this is the \nfirst team ever to win the championship without a senior on the roster? \nThat says a lot about the coaching prowess of Geno, the leadership of \nDiana, and the spirit of the UConn program.\n  This season, things did not come quite as easy as they did in the \nlast one. Last year, the program dominated with its four superstar \nseniors and its then-sophomore phenom. This time, many, many games were \nclose. Sometimes they came close to blowing big leads. They even lost . \n. . once. Honestly, after their record-breaking 70-game winning streak, \nthat single loss in an otherwise perfect season was big, big news in my \nState of Connecticut.\n  But this team did not flinch. They did not waver. They kept their \neyes on the prize and reached down into their gut, game after game.\n  The championship game itself was no different. It was intense, hard \nfought. Everybody found a way to contribute. Tough play in the paint, \ngraceful outside shooting. Strong defense. And ``D''--that's Diana--\nscored 28 in a passionate and poised performance. After the game, she \nwas humble about it. ``No superstars, just blue collar,'' she said.\n  In the process, Connecticut-Tennessee has become, hands down, the \nbest rivalry in women's college basketball. The Huskies against the \nVols. Geno Auriemma against Pat Summit, both basketball legends. And, \nwith my condolences to the Tennessee delegation, I must say proudly \nthat Connecticut has the upper hand, with four straight victories over \nthe Lady Vols, including in the 1995, 2000, and 2003 title games.\n  I do not want to get mushy here, but when speaking of the Huskies, it \nis hard to stop myself from wagging my tail with joy. All of \nConnecticut, and especially girls who love basketball like my daughter, \nare cheering today, and eager to welcome the Huskies home for a victory \ncelebration.\n  With so much success already under the belt of this great program, it \nis hard to say that we are surprised by what they have accomplished yet \nagain. But with such a remarkable road to their second straight title, \nit is easy to say we are proud.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution and \npreamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in the \nRecord, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 113) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, as all of America now knows, Syracuse \ndefeated Kansas in the national championship Monday night 81 to 78. \nThis is the Syracuse Orangemen's first national championship. My, how \nlong we have waited. But my, how sweet and deserved victory is.\n  As you remember, in 1987, in New Orleans, the same building, the same \nsite as this year's championship, Syracuse lost to Indiana by 1 point \non an acrobatic shot by Keith Smart. Coach Jim Boeheim said: ``I think \nthat building owed us.'' Well, the building did, and Syracuse is now \nthe national champion.\n  In a time of war, when so much sorrow is among us, it is a time for a \nlittle happiness, the happiness that the Orangemen brought New Yorkers, \nsoldiers overseas who follow the game, and the tens and tens and tens \nof thousands of Syracuse fans across New York State and across the \ncountry.\n  This is Jim Boeheim's first national championship. He has been coach \nfor 27 years. His loyalty to his alma mater, Syracuse, is unparalleled. \nNow, Boeheim has been criticized for not being able to win the big \ngame, but he has quieted his critics and has established himself as a \nlegitimate candidate for the Hall of Fame. He called the win not a \nvalidation of his coaching skills but a testament to the talent of his \nplayers--typical of Jim Boeheim's modesty. This Syracuse team is a \nmodel for all of America. They have persisted and persisted and \npersisted. Coach Boeheim persisted and persisted and persisted, and we \nso admire him. His heart belonged to Syracuse.\n\n  Jim Boeheim is Mr. Syracuse. As the old story goes, Boeheim was \nsitting on the beach in Hawaii with his former assistant, Rick Pitino, \nand Pitino's wife, Joanne. Someone posed a question: If you could live \nanywhere, where would it be?\n  Rick picked San Francisco, and his wife Joanne picked New York City. \n``Syracuse,'' Boeheim said. ``Hawaii was just Syracuse in July,'' \nBoeheim sniffed. ``For 8 months a year, it's the best weather in the \ncountry, and the other 4 months we are playing basketball.''\n  Well, the Orangemen had an amazing story this year. They came in to \nthe season as underdogs, not even earning a ranking in the ESPN/USA \nToday coaches poll until February. They stormed through the regular \nseason, finishing tied for first in the Big East, with a 13-3 record. \nThey finished the regular season 24-5 overall.\n  Of course, one of the biggest stories is the youth of this team. \nWhere have we ever seen--ever--two freshmen guards lead as well as they \nhave?\n  Carmelo Anthony, a freshman and leader of the team, had 20 points \nMonday night, with 10 rebounds and seven assists in the final game \nagainst Kansas. You could see the pain on his face. He was playing with \nan injured back, but he kept going and going, as he has done all \nseason. He scored a career high 33 points and had 14 rebounds against \nTexas in the semifinal. Many scouts believe he could be the No. 1 or \nNo. 2 draft pick this year in the NBA lottery.\n  How about Gerry McNamara, that feisty Irishman, a freshman point \nguard. He was huge in the championship game. In the first half, he hit \nsix 3-pointers and scored 18 points.\n  Hakim Warrick, only a sophomore, made the biggest play of the game. \nAs all of us were sitting around holding our breath as Kansas came \nwithin three points, with 1.5 seconds left, Warrick made an amazing \nblock of Michael Lee's 3-point attempt that would have tied the game.\n  What a game it was, Mr. President. What a victory for Syracuse. All \nof central New York is cheering. It is 80 degrees and that orange sun \nis shining brightly over Syracuse in central New York this afternoon, \nand it will continue to do so for a long time. Because Syracuse has so \nmany proud alumni and fans from one end of New York State to the other, \nthere is a smile across our State this afternoon spreading from Buffalo \nto New York City.\n  Mr. President, we are proud of the coach, Jim Boeheim; we are proud \nof the team, the great Orangemen; we are proud of the university, \nSyracuse University.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent the resolution and preamble be \nagreed to en bloc and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table \nwithout intervening objection or debate, and any statements be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
