Today's prayer will be offered by our guest \nChaplain, Rev. Glen Warner, Second Congregational United Church of \nChrist in Ashtabula, OH.\n  The guest Chaplain, Rev. Glen Warner, offered the following prayer:\n  Let us pray.\n  Sovereign Lord, Author of liberty, as we gather in this house of \nstrong resolve and mighty decisions, we believe that it must also be a \nhouse of prayer for all nations. We pray that You will be with each of \nus in these difficult and challenging times.\n  We stand in Your Presence, in awe of the connection of events that \nhas brought us to this moment in history. Our deepest desire is to ``be \nstill and know that You are God,'' we remember with reverence that Your \nwork is only accomplished by vision and courage. In this moment we know \nthat we belong to You whose glory stretches from age to age. May Your \n``right hand become glorious in power, justice, and righteousness in \nall the earth!''\n  We know that everything here, every light switch, every doorknob, \nevery computer chip, every heart, and every brain cell exists only by \nYour grace. In gratitude for these good gifts, we reverence the work \nYou have entrusted to us. We seek the priceless treasure of Your Divine \nguidance to do it well.\n  Living God! Your eternal word tells us ``The Lord is the one who goes \nbefore you. He will be with you. He will not leave you . . . do not \nfear nor be dismayed.'' (Deuteronomy 31:8) In trust, we wait, yielded \nand still, as Your Spirit brushes the souls of our Armed Forces, the \ninnocent people of Iraq, and the women and men we have chosen to serve \nAmerica as our Senators. May they know and accept Your comforting \nwisdom as they fulfill their ordained purposes for this day.

Madam President, for the information of all Senators, this \nmorning there will be a period for morning business until 11 a.m. \nAgain, this will allow time for Members to make remarks regarding the \nmen and women of our Armed Forces. At 11 a.m. today, we will consider \nthe military tax fairness bill under a 3-hour time limitation. Chairman \nGrassley and Senator Baucus will be here to manage time on that \nlegislation over the course of 3 hours. I thank them for their hard \nwork in getting that bill ready for floor consideration today.\n  In addition, we are attempting to reach an agreement for the \nconsideration of S. Con. Res. 30 which would express our gratitude to \nthe nations participating with the United States in the coalition to \ndisarm Iraq. Also, as I mentioned last night, we may also vote on any \njudicial nominations that may be ready for the Executive Calendar \ntoday. Therefore, there will be votes throughout the day. If we are \nable to finish the work I just mentioned, it would likely be that there \nwould be no rollcall votes on Friday. We would return for business on \nMonday with a rollcall vote likely to occur at around 5:30 Monday \nafternoon. I will have more to say about Monday's schedule later today.\n  In addition, over the course of today, I am sure people will want to \ncome to the floor to make tributes to Senator Moynihan. A number of \npeople took advantage of being able to do that last night. But over the \ncourse of today, people are welcome to come down to make those \ntributes. I do remind my colleagues, we will later, in a week, 2 weeks \nfrom now, bind all those tributes together in an appropriate volume for \nthe family.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if I can get the attention of the majority \nleader while he is on the floor, we have a number of people on the \nfloor today, and I would like to speak a few minutes about Senator \nMoynihan. Senator Hutchison is here. How long does she wish to speak?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, we were hoping certainly after \nSenator Reid's tribute to Senator Moynihan that we could have the hour \nevenly divided to talk about our troops in the field, which we are \nhoping will be the case every morning while our troops\n\n[[Page S4460]]\n\nare in the field, so that we can honor them in this way.\n  Mr. REID. It would be more appropriate then that we leave that full \ntime. I will find some time later in the day to speak. We should give \nthe full time for people to speak. Senator Nelson is here early, \nSenator Lincoln, and Senator Crapo. We have a lot of people here to \nspeak. I will give my speech at a later time. I am sure he might \napprove of that.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I am grateful to Senator Reid for \nmaking that concession. Senator Moynihan had the greatest respect of \nall of us. I hope we will all honor him, and the Senator allowing us to \ngo forward with this hour that we intend to set aside every day we are \nin battle in Iraq is very helpful. I appreciate it very much.\n  Madam President, I know Senator Voinovich has a special message about \nthe invocation this morning, and then we would like to proceed. Senator \nLincoln will be managing the floor for the Democrats. I and Senator \nCrapo will be managing the floor for the Republicans.\n  Madam President, the majority leader, Senator Frist, and the minority \nleader, Senator Daschle, have agreed that the Senate will open every \nday now with this hour of tribute to our troops. It will be set aside \nfor that purpose only as our way of letting them know that we will \nremember everything they are doing, we think of them every day, and we \nappreciate their service to our country. This is our way to emphasize \nthat this is first and foremost on our minds, and everything we do will \nbe with them in mind.\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/27/senate-section/article/S4460-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I thank the majority leader for the \nhospitality he extended to Rev. Glen W. Warner. I have had the pleasure \nof knowing Reverend Warner for many years. He is a remarkable person \nwho has a distinguished record of service to his community in northeast \nOhio in two vocations--as a spiritual leader of the Second \nCongregational Church and a leader in his family's business, the Molded \nFiber Glass Companies, which is one of the area's leading employers.\n  I have been very impressed over the years that he has been so \nsuccessful in both of these very different careers. He has ministered \nto people's spiritual and temporal needs and he has made a real \ndifference in the community.\n  Reverend Warner has volunteered for several community organizations \nincluding serving on the board of the Ashtabula Foundation.\n  His church is the one in which Reverend Warner and his wife, Nancy, \nwho joins him today were married. In his business career, Reverend \nWarner travels throughout North America and Europe to develop new \nmarkets and new products for the company which was founded by his \nfather-in-law, Robert S. Morrison.\n  Reverend Glen Warner is a wonderful role model for anyone, and his \nunique, dual-career underscores the fact that one can be successful in \nbusiness and in serving the Lord. That one can exercise his spiritual \npurpose in the realm of his secular responsibility in the great \ntradition of the English parliamentarian and leader, William \nWilburforce.\n  I am so happy that his wife, Nancy, and his granddaughter Tyra Miller \nand her friend Keisha Gilbert joined Reverend Warner in the Chamber \ntoday as he led the opening prayer at today's session of the United \nStates Senate.\n  Reverend Glen Warner is a good friend and I am proud to have him here \nas the guest Chaplain. I encourage Members of the Senate, as they come \nto the Chamber, if they get a chance, to meet Reverend Warner. He is \ntruly an inspiration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/27/senate-section/article/S4460-4", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4460-S4463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I will take some time this morning \nto show some pictures that speak more than 1,000 words. They are \npictures from the field. They show how the mightiest force in the world \nis connecting with people on an individual basis.\n  I start with a picture showing PFC Joseph DeWitt, age 26, of the 7th \nCalvary Regiment carrying an Iraqi boy who was injured Tuesday, March \n26, in the fight at Al Faysaliyah. The picture speaks for what America \nis. Here is this private, 26 years old, carrying this little boy to \nsafety. You can see the terror on his face, of the little boy who is \nsaved today because Private DeWitt cared.\n  An unidentified U.S. soldier gives candy to Iraqi boys as he patrols \nin the southern border city of Safwan, Friday, March 21. Waving Iraqi \ncivilians greeted members of the 1st Marine Division as they entered \nthe town of Safwan.\n  An Iraqi child waves as a convoy of 3rd Brigade, 101st Airborne \nDivision drives through a southern Iraqi town Sunday, March 23, 2003.\n  Children wave at members of the British 2nd Royal Tank Regiment as \nthey arrive in Basra, southern Iraq, Saturday, March 22.\n  All of the missing in action and POWs in this conflict are from Texas \nbases. They are either from Fort Hood or Fort Bliss.\n  In addition to the great mission, I feel a personal connection in \nthis conflict because I know the pain and agony the loved ones are \ngoing through at this time and, of course, I think every day, every \nhour, every minute about those who are actually in captivity or about \nwhom we do not know. I have tried to make contact with as many as I \ncould. It has been difficult because many of them are in such stress \nthey probably do not want to talk to people they do not know or members \nof the press who might be calling them.\n  I have not connected with all of them. However, every conversation I \nhave had has been uplifting. I have gotten more out of these \nconversations than I could ever give back. I have talked this morning \nto Michelle Williams, the wife of CWO David Williams, from Fort Hood, \none of those captured by the Iraqis when the Apache helicopter he was \nin crashed. Michelle is also in the service. She is at Fort Hood. I \ntalked to her this morning. She has not been talking to the press but \none of her major concerns is that somehow she could get a message to \nher husband: That she is thinking of him, that she loves him very much, \nthat their children are fine, but she just wants some way to make sure \nthat message gets to him--if it is the Red Cross that could take a \nletter; we will certainly try to be helpful, as the Army will try to be \nhelpful--if it is a message he might hear, that she has given, we want \nto do everything possible to try to get that message to him. She is \nstrong and brave and waiting for a happy reunion with her husband when \nhe is able to come home.\n  I talked to Mark Kennedy and his wife, Mrs. Kennedy, this morning. \nThey are the parents of Brian Kennedy who was killed in action when his \nhelicopter crashed in Kuwait. Brian was their only son. Again, they \nsaid to me the personal outpouring of support and love and attention \nthey have received because of the loss of their son has made their \nordeal better. They feel the Army has done everything it can to make \nthis terrible situation as positive as possible. They asked me to take \na message to the President, which I will certainly do. They said, \nplease tell the President that they support him, that their son had \ncalled in just 2 days before he was lost. He said: Don't worry about \nme. We are good to go. We have been trained. We believe in this \nmission.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy want us to know that they supported Brian \nKennedy and what he was doing. They know the importance of this action \nto freedom for everyone in America.\n  I will take that message to the President because these are people \nwho have\n\n[[Page S4461]]\n\ntaken the greatest loss imaginable. They understand their son will be \nforever respected and revered by Americans in perpetuity, for the loss \nthat they have and the giving of his life to make sure that our way of \nlife is enduring in perpetuity, that freedom and America as the beacon \nof freedom to the world will prevail because of people such as Brian \nKennedy and CWO David Williams.\n  Those are just two families with whom I have had contact. They are \nvery special people. Their families are very special people. We owe \nthem a great debt of gratitude. I know all Americans feel that as well.\n  I am pleased to be able to start this tribute to our troops as we \nwill do every day our troops are in the field protecting us, to let \nthem know how much we care and how brave we know they are as we watch \non television the kinds of weather they are enduring, in addition to \nall of the normal horrors of war, sandstorms that are so thick it looks \nas if it is night when it is day. They are enduring a lot for us, and \nwe want them to know we appreciate it.\n\n  My last word is that I hope anyone who hears our message will not \nforget the Geneva Convention; that the treatment of our prisoners of \nwar--and any we do not know who are prisoners--will be humane and in \nline with the Geneva Convention because I know for sure America is \ngiving medical treatment, food, water, and care to those Iraqi \nprisoners. We would always comply with the norms of war, including \nhumane treatment of prisoners. I hope if there is any modicum of \nhonesty and integrity in the Iraqi military, they will be treating our \nprisoners in like manner to the way their prisoners are being treated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I am pleased to be here for the second \ncontinuing day of the Senate's tribute to the troops. I compliment my \ncolleague from Texas. I thank her for being here this morning. We \ntalked about how important it is for the entire Senate to come and talk \nfrequently about our troops so they do know we are solidly behind them \nand making sure they know our thoughts and prayers are with them.\n  I yield time now to the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Nelson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I thank my colleague from \nArkansas for yielding time to speak this morning and compliment the \nSenator from Texas for a very graphic expression of the treatment of \nthe Iraqi people by our military.\n  I rise today to show my support for our troops, both those serving \nabroad and those providing vital support here at home and their \nfamilies.\n  Our men and women in uniform have proven over and over that they are \nthe best military force in the history of the world. Today I would like \nto pay tribute to their bravery and their continued commitment to \nAmerica and to freedom. Americans show their gratitude through words \nand through deeds. But often it seems like that is not quite enough. \nOur soldiers on the frontlines are putting their own lives at risk in \ndefense of this Nation and the freedoms we unfortunately sometimes take \nfor granted. We cannot match that sacrifice, but we can do our utmost \nto let them know that the entire Nation is united behind them.\n  As we fight battles in Iraq and continue our military presence in \nAfghanistan, Bosnia, South Korea, and other nations around the world, \nit is more important now than ever that we pledge ourselves to honoring \nthe commitments we make to our troops, just as they honor our country \nthrough their service.\n  And we must pledge that we will all support and comfort their \nfamilies while they are deployed. It is very difficult to be separated \nfrom loved ones in the best of circumstances--I hope that all our \nmilitary men and women know that we will help their families through \nthis difficult period until they are able to come back home and rejoin \ntheir families.\n  I would also like to express my gratitude to the service personnel \ndeployed stateside, at bases like Offutt Air Force Base in Bellevue, NE \nand the National Guard headquarters in Lincoln and all those who serve \nall over the country serving in similar capacities. Through their work \nmaintaining equipment, keeping our intelligence channels open, and \nkeeping our homeland safe, they continue to ensure that our nation has \nthe best run, best trained, and best staffed military in the history of \nthe world.\n  We must also recognize the changing face of our military. No longer \nare our Nation's armed forces primarily composed of full-time troops. \nNow, a sizable number of our service members are reservists and \nguardsmen. We do not make the distinction of the troops in the field \nwho are active duty, ready Reserves or Guard members. We should not \nmake a distinction in our policies that affect them. This week, this \nChamber spoke with one voice in resolving to make sure our Reserve and \nGuard members have the equipment and support they need. We will now see \nthat vote through.\n  I also note that reservists are particularly likely to come from the \nranks of the Nation's first responders. For those police officers, \nfirefighters, and EMTs who serve in the Reserves, they honor our Nation \ntwice--providing hometown security and then putting on another uniform \nto provide national security. We need to make sure that the burdens \nplaced on them and their families do not make it more difficult for \nthem to serve.\n\n  It is my pleasure to be here today to address these issues and to \nmake sure that we join together in support of our troops and we do so \nrecognizing not only their sacrifice but also the sacrifice their \nfamilies make.\n  I would particularly like to recognize those Nebraskans serving in \nuniform. Right now, we have approximately 400 Nebraska Army National \nGuardsmen participating in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and 675 \nGuardsmen serving in Afghanistan as part of Operations Enduring Freedom \nand Noble Eagle.\n  These men and women hail from Chadron, Gering, Scottsbluff, North \nPlatte, Lincoln, Kearney, Falls City, Wahoo, Fremont and a number of \nother cities across our State. There is no part of Nebraska that is not \nrepresented overseas in our military.\n  Nebraskans are also represented by 25 members of the 24th Medical \nCompany training for deployment to Kosovo as well as 125 Nebraska Air \nNational Guardsmen deployed in regions around the world. I am very \nproud of the service of my fellow cornhuskers.\n  I had the opportunity this past fall to visit with a few of these \ntroops serving at Aviano Air Force Base in Italy. It was a real \npleasure to sit down with SSgt Michale Varney of Murray, SrA Aaron \nMueller of Weeping Water, MSgt Edward Coufal of Plattsmouth, and Airman \nElizabeth Ahrens of my hometown of McCook. I can honestly say that they \nare truly among the best Nebraskans that our State has ever produced.\n  Thank you for this opportunity to show my support for our troops.\n  The ACTING PRESIDING pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I also stand with the Senator from Texas, \nthe Senator from Arkansas, the Senator from Nebraska--really, all the \nSenators--to take this opportunity to share our feelings about the \nsupport we have for our troops while they are engaged in this difficult \nbattle in Iraq.\n  While our Nation fights the war on terrorism, taking on even more \ndemanding and dangerous tasks, and is now actually headed into heated \nbattle in the Arabian Peninsula, it is important that we remember just \nhow important the United States military is to preserving and \nprotecting our national security.\n  Each of us in the Senate and those we represent throughout the \ncountry owe a sincere debt of gratitude to the brave men and women in \nuniform. Our soldiers, sailors, and marines serve us with unselfish \ncourage and epitomize the term ``hero.''\n  I will point out another brave group of men and women serving in \nharm's way. These are the thousands of our guardsmen and reservists who \nhave been called to duty here in America and abroad.\n  On a sad note, I would like to share with my colleagues my heartfelt \nsadness over the death of Air National Guardsman Major Gregory Stone, \nfrom Idaho, who was killed on March 23.\n  Major Stone, serving as liaison with the Army's 101st Airborne \nDivision in\n\n[[Page S4462]]\n\nKuwait, was one of the victims of the grenade attack on the officers' \ntents at Camp Pennsylvania. Major Stone leaves behind two sons, Evan, \nage 11, and Joshua, age 7, and an entire community, State, and Nation \nin grief.\n  Major Stone's father said:\n\n       My son died to allow the guy who killed him to believe in \n     what he believed.\n\n  As we know right now, it appears it is very possible that the \ncowardly attack that killed Major Stone may have been perpetrated by \nanother fellow soldier. That is being investigated at the moment.\n  Major Stone, an Oregon native, was one of six Idaho Air National \nGuard members working as liaisons with the Army's 101st Airborne \nDivision in Kuwait. He worked for 2 years at the Air Expeditionary \nForce Battlelab in Mountain Home, ID, as the lab's B-1 bomber expert. \nSince September, he was an independent assessor with the company that \ndoes contract work for the lab.\n  One of his colleagues, MAJ Thomas G. Westall, U.S. Air Force, \nRetired, said:\n\n       He paid the highest sacrifice for being a good soldier.\n\n  Major Stone is just one of those brave Americans who will be called \nupon to pay the highest sacrifice for our freedom. I commend him and \nall of those in our military who are putting their lives on the line to \nprotect our freedom, and I express the gratitude of a grateful country \nfor their service.\n  Idahoans, as all Americans have a long-standing tradition of service \nin our Nation's Armed Forces. As each of my colleagues here can attest, \nour States have called forward their best and bravest to protect our \nsecurity and preserve our liberties. Idaho has a contingent of \nguardsmen, reservists, and mainline forces in the Persian Gulf and \nengaged in the war on terrorism.\n  The Gunfighters of Mountain Home Air Force Base are among the best \ntrained forces in our military because they train at the world-class \nordnance training facility in Southwest Idaho. Mountain Home offers the \nAir Force one of the best training bases in the world. With its good \nweather and unobstructed air space, our pilots can train almost year-\nround. As Air Force pilots from around the country can attest, the \ntraining range in Idaho keeps them on the cutting edge of combat \neffectiveness.\n  The Idaho Reserve and National Guard provide another vital military \npresence in our State. These citizen soldiers provide a critical \nservice to our State and to our Nation. The Idaho Army National Guard, \nwith 28 units throughout the State, has 3,500 members and, during the \npast year, has provided personnel for active duty service throughout \nthe world. Very recently, elements of the Idaho Army National Guard \ncompleted an extended rotation in the Balkans.\n  The Air Guard, which has its headquarters at Gowen Field, has seen \nits share of active duty as well, most recently being called to service \nfollowing the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The \nAir Guard's equipment includes C-130 transports, as well as the very \ncapable close in support fighter, the A-10.\n  Units of the Army and Navy Reserve are also very active in Idaho. The \nArmy Reserve has 11 units in the State with 750 personnel assigned \nwhile the Navy Reserve has approximately 250 members. Many reservists, \nfrom a host of specialities and backgrounds, ranging from civil affairs \nto logistics, have been called to active duty during the past year.\n  Each Idahoan in uniform has a demanding responsibility, and I am \ngrateful for all they do. And right now, over 100,000 reservists \nnationwide have been placed on active service.\n  For the foreseeable future, our Armed Forces will be dealing with \nmore and more demands. We are facing uncertainly in the Persian Gulf, \nand threats worldwide continue to loom. It will be difficult and tough \nduty for these brave people, but I have complete confidence in their \nability to meet the tasks ahead. And I also know, that Idaho, with its \nlong tradition of military service, will continue to play an important \nrole in the defense of our Nation.\n  Many Americans have expressed their heartfelt appreciation of our \ntroops. It is indeed tragic that the lives of many men and women are \nnow being put in harm's way because Iraqi leaders would not to conform \nto international resolution that would have brought a peaceful end to \nthis conflict. Sadly, we are seeing Iraq refuse to voluntarily end its \nsupport of terrorism and stop the threat from the weapons of mass \ndestruction Iraq possesses.\n  My heart and my prayers are with our troops and their families. This \nis a time for support of all of those brave Americans being put at risk \nto defend our national security. We will win this conflict and end the \nmultiple threats of weapons, terrorism, and continued instability in \nthe Middle East the Iraqi dictator represents.\n  Every generation of Americans has faced the need to protect our \nfreedoms, and we live in a new age where innocent Americans have died \nat the hands of terrorists. Our President has made the difficult \ndecision that our national security is on the line and I fully support \nhis decision.\n  Our President and the men and women in our Armed Forces will protect \nour freedom and continue to make out nation secure. We owe them our \nsupport, our prayers, and our hopes that this conflict is over as soon \nas possible.\n  There is much more I could say, but I conclude my remarks by, once \nagain, coming back to the importance that I place on this Senate giving \ntime each day, as we are now doing, to commend the men and women in \nuniform, whether they be our active military, or our guardsmen or \nreservists, for putting their lives on the line for our freedom.\n  Every generation in America has had the opportunity, in some context \nor another, to defend our freedom. And these brave men and women are \nbeing called upon to risk the greatest sacrifice so we in America and \npeople throughout the globe can continue to have the freedoms which we \ncherish so greatly.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I now yield a portion of our time to \nthe Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I thank our good friend from \nArkansas.\n  Madam President, the floor is open principally to pay our respects to \nour citizens, our friends, and our neighbors who are serving now in the \nIraqi theater to try to right a terrible wrong that has been \nperpetrated on the world; and that is, to make sure we get rid of the \nsavage regime of Saddam Hussein and the threat he brings not only to \nthe people in that region but to people across the world.\n  People recognize that were he to continue unfettered in his capacity \nto develop his military might, it would be quite incredible to witness. \nThe fact is, we are there with so much force and so much skill and so \nmuch technology, and still we are facing constant obstacles to our \nmission of getting rid of the regime and reducing the threat or \neliminating the threat that these weapons might bring to that area and \nto the world at large.\n  New Jersey is the home of McGuire Air Force Base. That is a base that \nhas had members leaving for conflicts over the years, and particularly \nwith the first gulf war in 1990 and presently, and other conflicts that \nwe have seen, because of the mobility of an air wing that we have there \nto refuel aircraft in the air, both cargo and fighter craft, as well as \ncarrying cargo of substantial proportion and need to the theater so our \ntroops have facilities with which to take care of their needs \npersonally as well as, unfortunately, those facilities that might be \ncalled upon if they are wounded or injured in any way.\n  At this moment, New Jersey has about 5,000 people deployed from \nvarious Reserve and regular Army and Marine units, as well as other \nbranches of the military.\n  One person, SGT James Riley, was someone we saw on television not \nvery long ago being questioned by his captors, the Iraqis. We have been \ntrying to contact his family to offer our services in whatever way we \ncan, and to see if we can find out something about how he is being \ntreated, to make sure the rules of the Geneva Convention are observed \nto the letter in the treatment of prisoners. They cannot, under any \nkind of a rule of civilization or treaties,\n\n[[Page S4463]]\n\nmanhandle prisoners. It is not permitted. You are not permitted to \ninterview on public media. And you are not permitted to interrogate in \npublic. We want the Iraqis to know there is a price to pay for that \nkind of action. We demand they observe all the conventions that relate \nto prisoners and their treatment.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with great sadness and \ntremendous gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from \nAtwood, IN. Lcpl David Fribley was 26 years old. He died Sunday in \nNasiriyah, Iraq as he and his fellow Marines encountered Iraqi soldiers \nbelieved to be surrendering. Instead, the Iraqis opened fire, killing \nDavid Fribley and eight other Americans, David was there, in a far away \nland, to fight for the values we all hold close to our hearts.\n  David Fribley was the second Hoosier killed while dutifully serving \nhis country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Today, I mourn David's death \nwith his family, friends and the Atwood community. While our pride in \nDavid shall certainly live on, so too will our sorrow. Even though \nDavid's life on Earth has been cut short, his bravery, and his strength \nof character shall live on as a powerful and consoling force during \nthese difficult days of conflict.\n  David Fribley was a quiet and caring man who led by example, not mere \nwords. He was adored by all who knew him for his soft-spoken manner and \ngreat sense of humor. He was compelled to leave his job working with \nthe elderly and join the Marine Corps after witnessing the terrorist \nattacks of September 11. Upon his resignation David stated: ``The \ngreatest gift is the gift of service.'' This kind of selflessness is an \ninspiration to us all.\n  David leaves behind father Garry and mother Linda, brother Steven, \nwho serves in the Air Force, and a fiancee. He attended Warsaw \nCommunity High School where he was a star athlete in both track and \nfootball. After high school he attended Indiana State University and \ngraduated in 2001.\n  President Abraham Lincoln wrote in a letter to the mother of a fallen \nUnion soldier: ``I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the \nanguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of \nthe loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have \nlaid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.'' These words \nring as true today as they did 140 ago. As we mourn the loss of David \nFribley and honor the sacrifice he made for America and for all of \nhumanity.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of David Fribley in the official \nrecord of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think \nabout this just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain \nthat comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like \nDavid's can find comfort in the word of the prophet Isaiah who said, \n``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away \ntears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God \nbless the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I also rise today with great sadness and tremendous \ngratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Hobart, IN. Greg \nSanders was just 19 year old. On Monday, March 24, 2003, he was with \nhis Army unit, the 3rd Infantry, 3rd Battalion, 69th Armor Division, \n1st Brigade, Company B, when he was mortally wounded by an Iraqi sniper \nbullet. Greg was in Iraq, far away from loved ones and fellow \ncountrymen, to fight for the values of democracy we all hold close to \nour hearts.\n  Greg Sanders is the third Hoosier to be killed while dutifully \nserving our Nation in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Today, I mourn along \nwith Greg's family, friends, and community. While our pride in him \nshall certainly live on, so too will our sorrow. Although Greg's life \nwas cut short, his courage, and his dedication to the preservation of \ndemocracy will live on to serve as a guiding light in these dark days \nof war.\n  Greg Sanders was a natural born leader who always loved challenging \nhimself in everything he did, whether it was on the bowling lane or the \nbattlefield. From the time Greg was small, it was his dream to be a \nsoldier. It was with great pride that he left for Iraq, prepared to do \nhis duty and willing to make the ultimate sacrifice, if fate dictated, \nfor a country he loved dearly.\n  Greg attended Hobart High School where he ran cross-country and began \nhis training to become a soldier before his graduation in 2001. He \nleaves behind his mother Leslie Sanders, a brother, two sisters, his \nwife Ruthann, and their 1-year-old daughter, Gwendolyn. He will be \ngreatly missed by his family, fellow soldiers, and the Hobart community \nas a whole.\n  President Abraham Lincoln wrote in a letter to the mother of a fallen \nUnion soldier: ``I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the \nanguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of \nthe loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have \nlaid so costly a sacrifice upon the alter of freedom.'' These words \nring as true today as they did 140 years ago, as we mourn the loss of \nGreg Sanders and honor the sacrifice he made for America and for all of \nhumanity.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Greg Sanders in the official \nrecord of the Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think \nabout this just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain \nthat comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like \nGreg's can find comfort in the word of the prophet Isaiah, who said: \n``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away \ntears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God \nbless the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/27/senate-section/article/S4463-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO MAJOR ANTHONY D. ``TONY'' SINNOTT\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to \nU.S. Marine Corps Reserve Major Anthony D. ``Tony'' Sinnott. A former \nFlatwoods, KY native, Major Sinnott was recently awarded the Joint \nService Commendation Medal for being chosen as the Reserve Officer of \nthe Year for 2002.\n  Major Sinnott was chosen from 560 reserve officers from all the armed \nservices serving the U.S. Central Command in support of Operation \nEnduring Freedom. Sinnott received the award from General Tommy Franks, \nCombatant Commander of U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Florida.\n  The citizens of Flatwoods, KY, and the Commonwealth are proud of \nMajor Sinnott's accomplishments. His example of hard work, \ndetermination, and patriotism are appreciated by all across the United \nStates. As we continue to keep our soldiers deployed all around the \nworld in our thoughts and prayers, I rise to also thank the thousands \nof men and women who wear our uniform and serve our Nation so \ncourageously.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senate in joining me to congratulate Major \nSinnott on his service to the U.S. Marine Corps and our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/27/senate-section/article/S4463-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4463-S4465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SGT. BRADLEY KORTHAUS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today for the very sad purpose of \nhonoring a fallen American.\n  I learned this morning that Sgt Bradley Korthaus of Davenport, Iowa, \nhas died while in service to his country as part of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. I would like to take this opportunity to salute his patriotism \nand his sacrifice.\n  Sgt Korthaus disappeared Monday during an operation in which he and \nthree other Marines were swimming across a canal in southeastern Iraq, \nand his body has now been recovered.\n  This is the first Iowan who has died in the current conflict in Iraq \nand the news has hit home with me and my staff.\n  We all know that sacrifice is part of war, and the President has \ntried to prepare us for the inevitable losses; but it is impossible to \nfully prepare for the loss of a young life.\n  My prayers go out to Steve and Marilyn Korthaus who grieve for their \nson and to all of the family, friends, and neighbors who are touched by \nhis passing.\n  There is nothing I can say that can take away the pain they must \nfeel, but they should know that they are not alone in their grief.\n\n[[Page S4464]]\n\n  Iowans have a strong sense of community and I know that Bradley's \nloss will be felt deeply by many who never even knew him.\n  Bradley Korthaus deserves the highest gratitude of this body and the \nentire Nation. His sacrifice reminds us that freedom is so precious \nbecause of its incredibly high cost.\n  Bradley's father served in Vietnam and Bradley followed that \ntradition of service to his country.\n  This is an example of the patriotic contribution made by thousands of \nAmerican service members and their families.\n  The love of country and dedication to service shared by so many of \nits citizens is the great strength of our Nation and we can all be very \nproud of patriots like Bradley Korthaus.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the 24 young \nAmerican men who have died in the conflict in Iraq.\n  I would like to pay particular tribute, however, to the six men from \nmy home State of California, and to talk briefly about each of them.\n  To date, the young men of California account for one-fourth of all \nthe Americans that have made the ultimate sacrifice. To date, nearly \n120,000 men and women now stationed in the Middle East, many of them in \nharm's way, are either from California or were stationed there before \nbeing deployed.\n  It is often said that California receives too much from the Federal \nGovernment--too much of the appropriations pie. But when you consider \nour population is 35 million and you remember that, on average, \nCalifornians pay more in federal taxes than they receive in Federal \nprograms, this is simply not the case. And Californians are playing a \nvery prominent role in liberating the Iraqi people from the tyranny of \nSaddam Hussein.\n  Of the six Californians that have died so far, two were not yet \ncitizens, while one was a direct descendant of the second and sixth \nPresidents of the United States.\n  Together, they embody the depth and breadth of America's armed forces \nmen and women from all walks of life, willing to give their lives to \ndefend our freedoms.\n  The first four I would like to honor--Corporals Jorge Gonzalez, \nRandal Kent Rosaker, and Jorge Garibay, and SGT Michael Bitz--were \nkilled on March 23, in heavy fighting outside the town of An Nasiriya.\n  Two were fathers with infant children that they never met, a third a \nson who followed his father into the military.\n  Twenty year-old Cpl Jorge Gonzalez was part of the 1st Battalion of \nthe 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade. He grew up in Rialto, with his \nparents, Rosa and Mario, and five siblings. He was an avid soccer \nplayer, and a graduate of El Monte High School.\n  His last visit home was at Christmas. There, his younger sister \nNancy, who was never affectionate with her brother, hugged and kissed \nhim before he left. ``I knew I had to do that,'' she said.\n  He also left behind his wife Jazty and their 3-week-old baby boy, \nAlonso, who he never knew. He had hoped to retire from the Marines in a \nyear and become a policeman.\n  Before leaving he told his anxious mother,: ``Don't worry, mom. If I \ndie a Marine, I'll die honored.''\n  Marine Sgt Michael Bitz, a part of the 2nd Assault Amphibious \nBattalion, 2nd Marine Division, was just 31 years old. He grew up in \nPort Hueneme.\n  He loved being a Marine so much, he reenlisted last fall. He loved \nhis wife Janina so much that they had just renewed their vows. When he \nleft for the gulf, they were expecting twins, Caleb and Taylor, who are \nnow a month old. They also have a 2-year-old son, Joshua, and a 7 year-\nold son, Christian, from an earlier marriage.\n  In his last phone call to his mother, Donna, Sargeant Bitz was able \nto tell her that he loved her--and in his last letter he said that he \nwas her warrior. In classic Marine-style, she always called her \n``ma'am.''\n  Cpl Randal Kent Rosacker was also a member of the 2nd Marine \nExpeditionary Brigade. He was a rough-and-tumble athlete who loved the \noutdoors and ever since he was a boy he knew he wanted to follow his \nfather, Rod, into the military.\n  Cpl Rosacker grew up in San Diego, the son of a Navy man. He played \nfootball, baseball and wrestled for the Serra High School \nConquistadors. His wrestling coach, Steve Stone, recalled when Randal \nbroke his hand senior year, just before an important game.\n  ``Well, we heard some thudding on the wall in the lockeroom,'' he \nsaid. ``We walk in, and Randy had broken off his cast. He said: 'Coach, \ntape it up. I'm ready to go.'''\n  His former baseball coach, Chris Herrin, said that Rosacker's \nteammates could always count on him. ``He was the kind of guy who you \nwould want fighting for your country,'' Herrin said.\n  His grandmother, Patricia, said her grandson died doing something he \nloved--serving America. ``He believed in what he was doing,'' she said. \nHe was just 21 years old.\n  Born in Jalisco, Mexico, Cpl Jorge Garibay played football at Newport \nHarbor High School, in Costa Mesa. He, too, was just 21 years old.\n  One of his teachers, Janis Toman, described him as a hard worker who \nfrequently returned to the high school campus in full uniform, to \nencourage students to do their best.\n  Ms. Toman received a letter from Cpl Garibay just a few hours before \nlearning of his death, as she packed him a care package. ``He wrote of \nsimple things that we take for granted but make soldiers happy,'' she \nsaid. ``Things like moving from a small tent to a bigger one.''\n  ``I want to defend the country I plan to become a citizen of,'' he \nwrote to her. He also left a tape recording before his deployment for \nhis beloved Uncle Urbano, whom he regarded as a surrogate father.\n  In the tape he said: ``I'm being called to represent and serve my \ncountry. I don't know if I'll return, and I want you to know that I \nlove you and how much I appreciate the support and love you have given \nme over the years.''\n  LCpl Jose Gutierrez was the first American killed in combat. He was \nstruck by enemy fire while fighting alongside fellow Marines near the \nsouthern Iraqi port city of Umm al Qasr. He was 22 years old.\n  LCpl Gutierrez arrived in the United States when he was a 16 year old \norphan, having left poverty-stricken circumstances in Guatemala City \nand a country racked by a brutal civil war.\n  He traveled over 2,000 miles by foot, north through Mexico, in search \nof a better life here in the United States.\n  Like so many immigrants, his past was soon eclipsed by his new life \nas an American. He was taken in by the Mosquera family, of Lomita, CA. \nNora and Max Mosquera had begun helping immigrant foster children when \ntheir own children had grown.\n  ``He joined the Marines to pay back a little of what he'd gotten from \nthe U.S.,'' Max Mosquera said. ``For him it was a question of honor.''\n  A tall and quiet young man who enjoyed soccer and chess, Jose learned \nEnglish quickly and had plans to study architecture.\n  ``He was such a good kid,'' remembered Robert Nobles, a physical \neducation teacher at North High in Torrance, where Corporal Gutierrez \ngraduated in 2000.\n  I have been told that news of his death has resonated throughout \nGuatemala. Every major newspaper, radio and TV station carried his \nstory. He has been portrayed as a brave and selfless young man--which \nhe most certainly was.\n  Navy LT Thomas Mullen Adams grew up in comfort, in the suburb of La \nMesa, as a member of a family that traces its roots directly to John \nAdams, one of America's most important Founding Fathers.\n  He graduated from Grossmont High School in 1993 and the United States \nNaval Academy in 1997.\n  He received flight training in Pensacola, FL, and inherited his love \nof flying from his father, John, an architect who helped design the \naerospace museum in San Diego.\n  Promoted to lieutenant in the year 2000, Adams won two National \nDefense Service Medals, three sea service deployment ribbons, and other \nawards.\n  ``He's one of these amazingly clean-cut, all-American kids,'' his \naunt, Elizabeth Hansen, told the San Diego Union Tribune Newspaper. \n``He's the kind of kid that if you had a very special daughter, you \nwould hope that she would snag him. He was just amazingly bright, \nfunny, and kind.''\n\n[[Page S4465]]\n\n  In October 2002, Lieutenant Adams was assigned as an exchange officer \nwith the British Royal Navy's 849th Squadron, now on the aircraft \ncarrier Ark Royal.\n  An avid soccer fan who had volunteered to go to Japan with the \ncarrier Kitty Hawk in time for the World Cup finals last summer, he \njoined a local team near his base in Helston, England.\n  Lieutenant Adams's family said he particularly enjoyed his time with \nthe Royal Navy for two reasons: Every ship had a pub onboard, and he \nwas allowed a weekly 20-minute phone call home. He died with the Royal \nNavy when the helicopter he was flying collided with another helicopter \nover the Persian Gulf. He was just 27 years old.\n  Mr. President, we all wish for a quick resolution of this war to \nlimit casualties, military and civilian, American, allied, and Iraqi. \nWe wish that American and coalition forces will be able to liberate the \npeople of Iraq soon, and that our men and women will be able to return \nhome to their families. Until then, however, they remain in our \nthoughts and our prayers, along with those who have already fallen.\n  All Americans owe an enormous, an almost incalculable debt to these \nyoung men who were willing to sacrifice their own futures for the \nfuture of this country they so dearly loved so that we, as a people, \nmight be safe and free. Their sacrifices must never be forgotten.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/27/senate-section/article/S4465-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4465-S4470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. At the same time, I wish to pay tribute to a dear \nfriend who passed away yesterday, Senator forever, Pat Moynihan.\n  I came to the Senate 6 years after he arrived here, and we served \ntogether for 18 years. We left together at the same time in 2001.\n  I personally will miss him and think fondly of the moments we shared \ntogether, but, at the same time, say thank goodness--thank goodness--\nthat this place and this country had Senator Pat Moynihan.\n  He was a great man, with a brilliant mind, an incredible wealth of \nknowledge. He will have left a mark forever on our Government and on \nour society, even at a time when our culture has exhibited an ephemeral \nquality.\n  We can think of the moments we shared with him, all of us who had the \ngood fortune to serve with him. Because New York and New Jersey are \nneighboring States and have many similar concerns, he and I worked \nclosely on many issues. We served together on the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee.\n  He will be rightfully remembered as one of the giants who have served \nin this Senate. He will be able to be compared to the greats at the \nfounding of this country because his half century of contributions to \nthis body and to New York and to the region and to the Nation and to \nthe world are immeasurable.\n  He, like many who are serving now and have served, was born in modest \ncircumstances and was raised in an area on the west side of New York \ncalled Hell's Kitchen, a rough and tumble area. He joined the Navy. He \nserved in World War II. And then he went on to earn degrees at the \nFletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.\n  In the early 1950s, Pat Moynihan worked for the International Rescue \nCommittee, one of the earliest and most effective human rights \norganizations. Then he joined the administration of New York Governor \nAverill Harriman, where he met his beloved wife and someone we all \nlove, Liz.\n  Pat and Liz came to Washington with the Kennedy administration, and \nPat went on to serve in the cabinet or subcabinet of the next three \nPresidents, two of whom were Republicans. He served as U.S. Ambassador \nto India and as U.S. Representative to the United Nations.\n  All the while, he had a busy and prolific career in academia, with \nteaching positions at Syracuse and Harvard and other universities. It \nis often said that Pat Moynihan has written more books than most people \nhave read. And those books were on subjects as diverse as ethnicity, \nwelfare policy, secrecy as form of regulation, and international law. \nHis books and essays and op-eds were always erudite and displayed a wit \nand wisdom and grace few people have. His books were so well received, \nwhenever they were produced.\n  I doubt anyone else ever entered the United States Senate with a \ngreater breadth of experience or knowledge. Pat Moynihan was made for \nthe Senate, and the Senate was made for men like Pat Moynihan.\n  Pat was not only a great intellectual; he was a man of principles, \ndeeply held and eloquently expressed. And yet he had that remarkable \nability of being able to disagree without being disagreeable. There \nisn't a single Member of the Senate who served with him who didn't also \nlove and revere him.\n  We are poorer for Pat's passing, but rather than dwell on that, I \nwould like to express my gratitude that someone with such inestimable \ntalents and energies devoted them to public service. We are definitely \nricher for that.\n  We send our sympathy to Liz Moynihan, and to the children, Timothy \nand Maura and John, and to the grandchildren, Michael Patrick and Zora.\n  We live in tumultuous and dangerous times. No one understood that \nbetter than Pat Moynihan, and we would benefit from his counsel. I will \ninclude for the Record a commencement address that Pat delivered at \nHarvard University about world events and foreign policy, and I commend \nit to my colleagues.\n  On a more personal note, my legislative director, Gray Maxwell, was \nPat's legislative director from 1995 to 2000. When Pat retired, Gray \nwrote a tribute that was printed in Long Island Newsday. I will also \nask that the tribute be printed in the Record.\n  In closing, I note that one of Pat's great abiding passions was \npublic works--not just in New York but here in Washington. He authored \nmuch of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, ISTEA, he \nfought for Amtrak and mass transit, he wrote the guiding principles for \nfederal architecture, he shepherded the Union Station redevelopment and \nthe Thurgood Marshall and Ronald Reagan buildings to completion, and he \nalmost single-handedly transformed Pennsylvania Avenue. I think what \nwas written in St. Paul's Cathedral in London for Sir Christopher Wren \nwould serve as an equally fitting tribute to Pat Moynihan: Si \nmonumentum requiris circumspice [If you would see the man's monument, \nlook about you.].\n  I ask unanimous consent that his commencement address delivered at \nHarvard University on June 6, 2002, to which I referred, and an article \nwritten by a person on my staff, Gray Maxwell, who was on the Moynihan \nstaff before that, that demonstrates beautifully the character and \ncapability Pat Moynihan brought to his job and to all of us, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Commencement Address, June 6th, 2002, by Daniel Patrick Moynihan\n\n       A while back it came as something of a start to find in The \n     New Yorker a reference to an article I had written, and I \n     quote, ``In the middle of the last century.'' Yet persons my \n     age have been thinking back to those times and how, in the \n     and, things turned out so well and so badly. Millions of us \n     returned from the assorted services to find the economic \n     growth that had come with the Second World War had not ended \n     with the peace. The Depression had not resumed. It is not \n     perhaps remembered, but it was widely thought it would.\n       It would be difficult indeed to summon up the optimism that \n     came with this great surprise. My beloved colleague Nathan \n     Glazer and the revered David Riesman wrote that America was \n     ``the land of the second chance'' and so indeed it seemed. We \n     had surmounted the depression; the war. We could \n     realistically think of a world of stability, peace--above \n     all, a world of law.\n       Looking back, it is clear we were not nearly so fortunate. \n     Great leaders preserved--and in measure extended--democracy. \n     But totalitarianism had not been defeated. To the contrary, \n     by 1948 totalitarians controlled most of Eurasia. As we now \n     learn, 11 days after Nagasaki the Soviets established a \n     special committee to create an equivalent weapon. The first \n     atomic bomb was acquired through espionage, but their \n     hydrogen bomb was their own doing. Now the Cold War was on. \n     From the summer of 1914, the world had been at war, with \n     interludes no more. It finally seemed to end with the \n     collapse of the Soviet Union and the changes in China. But \n     now . . .\n       But now we have to ask if it is once again the summer of \n     1914.\n       Small acts of terror in the Middle East, in South Asia, \n     could lead to cataclysm, as they\n\n[[Page S4466]]\n\n     did in Sarajevo. And for which great powers, mindful or not, \n     have been preparing.\n       The eras are overlapping.\n       As the United States reacts to the mass murder of 9/11 and \n     prepares for more, it would do well to consider how much \n     terror India endured in the second half of the last century. \n     And its response. It happens I was our man in New Delhi in \n     1974 when India detonated its first nuclear device. I was \n     sent in to see Prime Minister Indira Gandhi with a statement \n     as much as anything of regret. For there was nothing to be \n     done; it was going to happen. The second most populous nation \n     on earth was not going to leave itself disarmed and \n     disregarded, as non-nuclear powers appeared to be. But \n     leaving, I asked to speak as a friend of India and not as an \n     official. In twenty years time, I opined, there would be a \n     Moghul general in command in Islamabad, and he would have \n     nuclear weapons and would demand Kashmir back, perhaps the \n     Punjab.\n       The Prime Minister said nothing, I dare to think she half \n     agreed. In time, she would be murdered in her own garden; \n     next, her son and successor was murdered by a suicide bomber. \n     This, while nuclear weapons accumulated which are now poised.\n       Standing at Trinity Site at Los Alamos, J. Robert \n     Oppenheimer pondered an ancient Sanskrit text in which Lord \n     Shiva declares, ``I am become Death, the shatterer of \n     worlds.'' Was he right?\n       At the very least we can come to terms with the limits or \n     our capacity to foresee events.\n       It happens I had been a Senate observer to the START \n     negotiations in Geneva, and was on the Foreign Relations \n     Committee when the treaty, having been signed, was sent to us \n     for ratification. In a moment of mischief I remarked to our \n     superb negotiators that we had sent them to Geneva to \n     negotiate a treaty with the Soviet Union, but the document \n     before us was a treaty with four countries, only two of which \n     I could confidently locate on a map. I was told they had \n     exchanged letters in Lisbon [the Lisbon Protocol, May 23, \n     1992]. I said that sounded like a Humphrey Bogart movie.\n       The hard fact is that American intelligence had not the \n     least anticipated the implosion of the Soviet Union. I cite \n     Stansfield Turner, former director of the CIA in Foreign \n     Affairs, 1991. ``We should not gloss over the enormity of \n     this failure to forecast the magnitude of the Soviet crisis. \n     . . . The corporate view missed by a mile.''\n       Russia now faces a near-permanent crisis. By mid-century \n     its population could well decline to as few as 80 million \n     persons. Immigrants will press in; one dares not think what \n     will have happened to the nuclear materials scattered across \n     11 time zones.\n       Admiral Turner's 1991 article was entitled ``Intelligence \n     for a New World Order.'' Two years later Samuel Huntington \n     outlined what that new world order--or disorder--would be in \n     an article in the same journal entitled ``The Clash of \n     Civilizations.'' His subsequent book of that title is a \n     defining text of our time.\n       Huntington perceives a world of seven or eight major \n     conflicting cultures, the West, Russia, China, India, and \n     Islam. Add Japan, South America, Africa. Most incorporate a \n     major nation-state which typically leads its fellows.\n       The Cold War on balance suppressed conflict. But the end of \n     the Cold War has brought not universal peace but widespread \n     violence. Some of this has been merely residual proxy \n     conflicts dating back to the earlier era. Some plain ethnic \n     conflict. But the new horrors occur on the fault lines, as \n     Huntington has it, between the different cultures.\n       For argument's sake one could propose that Marxism was the \n     last nearly successful effort to Westernize the rest of the \n     world. In 1975, I stood in Tiananmen Square, the center of \n     the Middle Kingdom. In an otherwise empty space, there were \n     two towering masts. At the top of one were giant portraits of \n     two hirsute 19th century German gentlemen, Messrs. Marx and \n     Engels. The other displayed a somewhat Mongol-looking Stalin \n     and Mao. That wasn't going to last, and of course, it didn't.\n       Hence Huntington: ``The central problem in the relations \n     between the West and the rest is . . . the discordance \n     between the West's--particularly America's--efforts to \n     promote universal Western culture and its declining ability \n     to do so.''\n       Again there seems to be no end of ethnic conflict within \n     civilizations. But it is to the clash of civilizations we \n     must look with a measure of dread. The Bulletin of the Atomic \n     Scientists recently noted that ``The crisis between India and \n     Pakistan, touched off by a December 13th terrorist attack on \n     the Indian Parliament marks the closest two states have come \n     to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis.'' By 1991, the \n     minute-hand on their doomsday clock had dropped back to 17 \n     minutes to midnight. It has since been moved forward three \n     times and is again seven minutes to midnight, just where it \n     started in 1947.\n       The terrorist attacks on the United States of last \n     September 11 were not nuclear, but they will be. Again to \n     cite Huntington, ``At some point . . . a few terrorists will \n     be able to produce massive violence and massive destruction. \n     Separately, terrorism and nuclear weapons are the weapons of \n     the non-Western weak. If and when they are combined, the non-\n     Western weak will be strong.''\n       This was written in 1996. The first mass murder by \n     terrorists came last September. Just last month the vice \n     president informed Tim Russert that ``the prospects of a \n     future attack . . . are almost certain. Not a matter of if, \n     but when.'' Secretary Rumsfeld has added that the attack will \n     be nuclear.\n       We are indeed at war and we must act accordingly, with \n     equal measures of audacity and precaution.\n       As regards precaution, note how readily the clash of \n     civilizations could spread to our own homeland. The Bureau of \n     the Census lists some 68 separate ancestries in the American \n     population. (Military gravestones provide for emblems of 36 \n     religions.) All the major civilizations. Not since 1910 have \n     we had so high a proportion of immigrants. As of 2000, one in \n     five school-age children have at least one foreign-born \n     parent.\n       This, as ever, has had bounteous rewards. The problem comes \n     when immigrants and their descendants bring with them--and \n     even intensify--the clashes they left behind. Nothing new, \n     but newly ominous. Last month in Washington an enormous march \n     filled Pennsylvania Avenue on the way to the Capitol grounds. \n     The marchers, in the main, were there to support the \n     Palestinian cause. Fair enough. But every five feet or so \n     there would be a sign proclaiming ``Zionism equals Racism'' \n     or a placard with a swastika alongside a Star of David. Which \n     is anything but fair, which is poisonous and has no place in \n     our discourse.\n       This hateful equation first appeared in a two-part series \n     in Pravda in Moscow in 1971. Part of Cold War ``agit prop.'' \n     It has since spread into a murderous attack on the right of \n     the State of Israel to exist--the right of Jews to exist!--a \n     world in which a hateful Soviet lie has mutated into a new \n     and vicious anti-Semitism. Again, that is the world we live \n     in, but it is all the more chilling when it fills \n     Pennsylvania Avenue.\n       It is a testament to our First Amendment freedoms that we \n     permit such displays, however obnoxious to our fundamental \n     ideals. But in the wake of 9/11, we confront the fear that \n     such heinous speech can be a precursor to violence, not least \n     here at home, that threatens our existence.\n       To be sure, we must do what is necessary to meet the \n     threat. We need to better understand what the dangers are. We \n     need to explore how better to organize the agencies of \n     government to detect and prevent calamitous action.\n       But at the same time, we need take care that whatever we do \n     is consistent with our basic constitutional design. What we \n     do must be commensurate with the threat in ways that do not \n     needlessly undermine the very liberties we seek to protect.\n       The concern is suspicion and fear within. Does the Park \n     Service really need to photograph every visitor to the \n     Lincoln Memorial?\n       They don't, but they will. It is already done at the Statue \n     of Liberty. In Washington, agencies compete in techniques of \n     intrusion and exclusion. Identity cards and X-ray machines \n     and all the clutter, plus a new life for secrecy. Some \n     necessary; some discouraging. Mary Graham warns of the \n     stultifying effects of secrecy on inquiry. Secrecy, as George \n     Will writes, ``renders societies susceptible to epidemics of \n     suspicion.''\n       We are witnessing such an outbreak in Washington just now. \n     Great clamor as to what the different agencies knew in \n     advance of the 9/11 attack; when the President was briefed; \n     what was he told. These are legitimate questions, but there \n     is a prior issue, which is the disposition of closed systems \n     not to share information. By the late 1940s the Army Signal \n     Corps had decoded enough KGB traffic to have a firm grip on \n     the Soviet espionage in the United States and their American \n     agents. No one needed to know about this more than the \n     President of the United States. But Truman was not told. By \n     order, mind, of Omar Bradley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff. Now as then there is police work to be done. But so \n     many forms of secrecy are self-defeating. In 1988, the CIA \n     formally estimated the Gross Domestic Product of East Germany \n     to be higher than West Germany. We should calculate such \n     risks.\n       The ``what-ifs'' are intriguing. What if the United States \n     had recognized Soviet weakness earlier and, accordingly, kept \n     its own budget in order, so that upon the breakup of the \n     Soviet Union a momentous economic aid program could have been \n     commenced? What if we had better calculated the forces of the \n     future so that we could have avoided going directly from the \n     ``end'' of the cold War to a new Balkan war--a classic clash \n     of civilizations--leaving little attention and far fewer \n     resources for the shattered Soviet empire?\n       Because we have that second chance Riesman and Glazer wrote \n     about. A chance to define our principles and stay true to \n     them. The more then, to keep our system open as much as \n     possible, with our purposes plain and accessible, so long as \n     we continue to understand what the 20th century has surely \n     taught, which is that open societies have enemies, too. \n     Indeed, they are the greatest threat to closed societies, \n     and, accordingly, the first object of their enmity.\n       We are committed, as the Constitution states, to ``the Law \n     of Nations,'' but that law as properly understood. Many have \n     come to think that international law prohibits the use of \n     force. To the contrary, like domestic law, it legitimates the \n     use of force to uphold law in a manner that is itself \n     proportional and lawful.\n       Democracy may not prove to be a universal norm. But decency \n     would do. Our present conflict, as the President says over \n     and again, is not with Islam, but with a malignant growth \n     within Islam defying the\n\n[[Page S4467]]\n\n     teaching of the Q'uran that the struggle to the path of God \n     forbids the deliberate killing of noncombatants. Just how and \n     when Islam will rid itself of current heresies is something \n     no one can say. But not soon. Christianity has been \n     through such heresy--and more than once. Other clashes \n     will follow.\n       Certainly we must not let ourselves be seen as rushing \n     about the world looking for arguments. There are now American \n     armed forces in some 40 countries overseas. Some would say \n     too many. Nor should we let ourselves be seen as ignoring \n     allies disillusioning friends, thinking only of ourselves \n     inthe most narrow terms. That is not how we survived the 20th \n     century.\n       Nor will it serve in the 21st.\n       Last February, some 60 academics of the widest range of \n     political persuasion and religious belief, a number from here \n     at Harvard, including Huntington, published a manifesto: \n     ``What We're Fighting For: A Letter from America.''\n       It has attracted some attention here; perhaps more abroad, \n     which was our purpose. Our references are wide, Socrates, St. \n     Augustine, Franciscus de Victoria, John Paul II, Martin \n     Luther King, Jr., Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the Universal \n     Declaration of Human Rights.\n       We affirmed ``five fundamental truths that pertain to all \n     people without distinction,'' beginning ``all human beings \n     are born free and equal in dignity and rights.''\n       We allow for our own shortcomings as a nation, sins, \n     arrogance, failings. But we assert we are no less bound by \n     moral obligation. And, finally, reason and careful moral \n     reflection teach us that there are times when the first and \n     most important reply to evil is to stop it.\n       But there is more. Forty-seven years ago, on this occasion, \n     General George C. Marshall summoned our nation to restore the \n     countries whose mad regimes had brought the world such \n     horror. It was an act of statesmanship and vision without \n     equal in history. History summons us once more in different \n     ways, but with even greater urgency. Civilization need not \n     die. At this moment, only the United States can save it. As \n     we fight the war against evil, we must also wage peace, \n     guided by the lesson of the Marshall Plan--vision and \n     generosity can help make the world a safer place.\n       Thank you.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                              Sui Generis\n\n       As the final summer of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's \n     public career comes to an end, I think back to one languid \n     Friday afternoon three summers ago. Not much was happening; \n     the Senate was in recess. So Senator Moynihan--my boss at the \n     time--and I went to see an exhibit of Tyndale Bibles at the \n     Library of Congress. Tyndale wrote the first English Bible \n     from extant Greek and Hebrew manuscripts. Senator Moynihan \n     was eager to learn more about a man whose impact on the \n     English language, largely unacknowledged, is probably equal \n     to Shakespeare's.\n       One might wonder what Tyndale has to do with the United \n     States Senate. Not much, I suppose. But like Tennyson's \n     Ulysses, Senator Moynihan is a ``gray spirit yearning in \n     desire to follow knowledge like a sinking star.'' He has \n     unbounded curiosity. I'm not one who thinks his \n     intellectualism is some sort of an indictment. Those who do \n     are jealous of his capabilities, or just vapid. In a \n     diminished era when far too many Senators know far too \n     little, I have been fortunate to work for one who knows so \n     much and yet strives to learn so much more.\n       There is little I can add to what others have written or \n     will write about his career in these waning moments. But I \n     would make a few observations. On a parochial note, I know of \n     no other Senator who shares his remarkable facility for \n     understanding and manipulating formulas--that arcane bit of \n     legislating that drives the allocation of billions of \n     dollars. He has ``delivered'' for New York but it's not \n     frequently noted because so few understand it.\n       More important, every time he speaks or writes, it's worth \n     paying attention. I think back to the summer of 1990, when \n     Senator Phil Gramm offered an amendment to a housing bill. \n     Gramm wanted to rob Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) \n     funds from a few ``rustbelt'' States and sprinkle them across \n     the rest of the country. The amendment looked like a sure \n     winner: more than 30 States stood to benefit. Senator \n     Moynihan went to the floor in opposition. He delivered an \n     extemporaneous speech on the nature of our Federal system \n     worthy of inclusion in the seminal work of Hamilton, Madison, \n     and Jay as The Federalist No. 86. (The amendment was \n     defeated: New York's share of CDBG funding was preserved.)\n       While Senator Moynihan has been enormously successful as a \n     legislator, I think of him as the patron Senator of lost \n     causes. By ``lost'' I mean right but unpopular. Every Senator \n     is an advocate of the middle class; that's where the votes \n     are. What I most admire and cherish about Senator Moynihan is \n     his long, hard, and eloquent fight on behalf of the \n     underclass--the disenfranchised, the demoralized, the \n     destitute, the despised.\n       T.S. Eliot wrote to a friend, ``We fight for lost causes \n     because we know that our defeat and dismay may be the preface \n     to our successors' victory, though that victory itself will \n     be temporary; we fight rather to keep something alive than in \n     the expectation that anything will triumph.'' this wistful \n     statement, to me, captures the essence of Senator Moynihan \n     and his career. Too many of today's tepid, timid legislators \n     are afraid to offer amendments they think will fail. They \n     have no heart, no courage. Senator Moynihan always stands on \n     principle, never on expediency. He's not afraid to be in the \n     minority, even a minority of one.\n       His statements over the years on a variety of topics \n     constitute a veritable treasury of ``unpopular essays.'' He \n     characterizes the current bankruptcy ``reform'' bill as a \n     ``boot across the throat'' of the poor. A few years ago, he \n     fought against a habeas corpus provision in the \n     ``Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty act'' (a truly \n     Orwellian name for that bill). He argued, in vain, that \n     Congress was enacting a statute ``which holds that \n     constitutional protections do not exist unless they have been \n     unreasonably violated, an idea that would have confounded the \n     framers . . . thus introducing a virus that will surely \n     spread throughout our system of laws.'' These are just a few \n     examples. Others include his passionate opposition to welfare \n     repeal, the balanced budget act, the ``line-item'' veto, the \n     Constitutional amendment to ban flag desecration. The list \n     goes on.\n       For the past quarter-century, Senator Moynihan has been the \n     Senate's reigning intellectual. But he has also been its--and \n     the nation's--conscience. His fealty as a public servant, \n     ultimately, has been to the truth. He seeks it out, and he \n     speaks it, regardless of who will be discomfitted. He has \n     done so with rigor, and wit, a little bit of mischief now and \n     then, and uncommon decency.\n       When Thomas Jefferson followed Benjamin Franklin as envoy \n     to France, he told the Comte de Vergennes, ``I succeed him; \n     no one could replace him.'' Others will succeed Senator \n     Moynihan; no one will replace him. We are fortunate indeed \n     that he has devoted his life to public service.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when I first came to the Senate, I had the \ngood fortune, as my friend the distinguished Senator from Montana did, \nto serve on a committee with Pat Moynihan. My friend had it double; he \nnot only got to serve with him on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee but also the Finance Committee.\n  Even though this is a time of sadness because we have lost a giant in \nthe history of America, for those of us who spent time with Pat \nMoynihan, just mentioning his name brings a smile to our faces. There \nis no one I have ever served with in government or known in government \nwho is anything like Pat Moynihan. He was a unique individual.\n  I was over in the House gym this morning, meeting with someone I came \nto the House of Representatives with, Ed Towns, from New York. We were \ntalking about Pat Moynihan. Congressman Towns said the last \nconversation he had with Pat Moynihan was a very pleasant conversation. \nPat Moynihan called him--very typical of Pat Moynihan.\n  I wish I could mimic his voice. People who worked for Pat Moynihan \ncan talk just like him. I can't. But he said--with his distinctive \nstaccato delivery--he wanted to name this big building in Brooklyn for \nGovernor Carey.\n  Congressman Towns said: No, I have someone else. I don't need to \nembarrass that person by mentioning that name. He said: I have someone \nelse and I can't agree with you, Senator. I know Governor Carey was a \ngood person, but I think we should name it after someone else.\n  Senator Moynihan, the gentleman that he was, simply said: Thank you \nvery much.\n  Five or six weeks later he called back and said: You know, \nCongressman Towns, I am getting old. He said: This means a lot to me to \nhave this building named after one of my close personal friends. I hope \nyou will reconsider.\n  Ed Towns said: I have reconsidered. You can do it.\n  Senator Moynihan said: Did I hear you just say I could name this \nbuilding after Governor Carey?\n  And Congressman Towns said: Yes.\n  Pat Moynihan said: I am so happy.\n  Senator Baucus and I can imagine that conversation because he was \ntruly a gentleman.\n  I had the privilege, as I indicated, of serving with him. I had the \ngood fortune over many years to serve with many outstanding people in \nthe Senate, men and women with extraordinary talent and achievements, \npeople who have accomplished so much in their personal and professional \nlives, people highly educated, people who have great records of \nmilitary service, and people who are just good public servants.\n\n  Certainly there have been many skilled orators in the Senate--today \nand in the past--and many other highly intelligent Senators, but I have \nto\n\n[[Page S4468]]\n\nsay, I trust nobody will disagree or be offended if I point out that \nPat Moynihan stood out as an intellectual giant in the Senate, not only \nfor the time he served here but in the history of our country.\n  Pat Moynihan spoke in a unique style, with a delivery that would not \nbe taught in an oratory class.\n  He was a professor. He was a college professor, and he never lost \nthat ability to teach.\n  I always felt, when I was in the presence of Pat Moynihan, that I had \nthe opportunity to learn from him, whether we were on the Senate floor, \nor in a committee hearing, or in an informal conversation. I hope no \none is going to be upset with me, but when I ran the Democratic Policy \nCommittee for a number of years, we would take down names of speakers. \nI cheated a little bit and always moved Pat high up on the list because \nI loved to hear him talk, and he did not have a lot of patience and \nwould leave if you did not recognize him pretty quickly.\n  He would come to our luncheons, and I remember he usually ordered egg \nsalad sandwiches. He would eat, listen for a while, and if it were not \nsomething he was really interested in, he would go back to his hideaway \nand start writing. That is what he did most of the time.\n  Pat was unlike most of us. We devote a lot of our time to constituent \nservices. Pat Moynihan did not do that. He was an intellectual giant, \nand he spent his time in the Senate reading and writing. He was a great \nthinker. Although he certainly did a good job of representing the State \nof New York, and served the interests of his constituents as his \npopularity makes clear, he often focused on the bigger picture and \ncontemplated big ideas.\n  We identify Pat Moynihan with New York. He was actually a native of \nthe American West. He was born in Tulsa, OK. His family moved to New \nYork when he was a child. His father abandoned them, and his mother, \nthereafter, struggled to provide for Pat and his siblings.\n  Pat always worked hard. He worked as a shoeshine boy, later as a \nlongshoreman. He did not come from a privileged background, but he had \na privileged education because of his great intellect. He was able to \nachieve much because he was a hard worker and extremely smart.\n  He graduated first in his class from high school in Harlem, and by \nserving in the Navy, he was able to attend college. He graduated from \nTufts University and remained there to earn his Ph.D. from the Fletcher \nSchool of Law and Diplomacy. He also studied at the London School of \nEconomics as a Fulbright Scholar.\n  Pat had enlisted in the Navy during World War II. Just a short time \nago, when he was still serving in the Senate, he had back surgery for \nan injury sustained years ago while he was in the U.S. Navy. He was \nproud of his military service and grateful that he was sent to college \nfor training as an officer. But he was, indeed, a scholar. He was a \nprofessor at Syracuse University early in his career and then later at \nHarvard. He published numerous articles and studies covering a wide \narray of topics that reflected the tremendous breadth of his interests \nand depth of his knowledge.\n  I am not sure which Senator said this, although I think it was Dale \nBumpers, who also recently has published a book--but if it was not Dale \nBumpers, I apologize for not giving credit to the right Senator--who \nsaid he had not read as many books as Pat Moynihan had written. That is \nhow he looked at Pat Moynihan. He was a voracious writer. He wrote 18 \nbooks, including 9 while he was a Senator. In addition, he wrote parts \nof many other books and articles too numerous to mention.\n\n  After one of his books was published, while we here in the Senate, he \nasked me if I had read it. I said: Pat, I didn't receive the book. He \nsaid: Well, maybe somebody on your staff borrowed it. So he gave me \nanother copy, and I read it.\n  Much of his writing is famous. For me personally the most far-\nreaching, the most visionary article he wrote was called ``Defining \nDeviancy Down.'' In this brief article--probably no more than 30 \npages--he discussed how our societal values have changed over the \nyears, how one thing we would not accept 20 years ago, now we accept. \nIt is a wonderful article that reveals his perspective and insights and \ncalls on us to recognize we have to change what is going on in our \nsociety.\n  Senator Moynihan had great compassion for America's poor, especially \nfor children growing up in poverty. He sought to develop public policy \nthat took into account social scientific methods and analysis. He \napplied academic research to benefit people living in the real world.\n  Pat was also interested in architecture and historic preservation. He \nworked to improve the appearance of Washington, D.C. to reflect its \nstatus as our Nation's Capital, and of federal buildings across the \ncountry. Those of us who leave the Capitol and travel along \nPennsylvania Avenue, and see the beautiful buildings will remember his \nrole in improving this area. When I was back here going to law school, \nthat area of the city was a slum. It was a slum. Right off Capitol \nHill, it was a slum. And Pat Moynihan recognized, when President \nKennedy was inaugurated, that should change. And he changed it. He \npersonally changed it.\n  Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation was something that Pat \nMoynihan thought up. When you drive down that street today, you see the \nbeautiful building that we are proud of, that is part of the U.S. \nCapitol. That was the work of Pat Moynihan.\n  I can remember, there was one Senator who thought it was really bad \nthat the courthouses we were building around the country were basically \ntoo nice. Pat Moynihan proceeded to indicate to all of us that is what \nwe should do, that we should construct buildings for the future that \npeople would like to look at that are nice inside. And Pat Moynihan won \nthat battle.\n  To serve on the Public Works Committee with Pat Moynihan was like \ngoing to school and not having to take the tests because there was not \na subject that came up that he did not lecture us on--the great \narchitect Moses, not out of the Bible but of New York City. In \neverything we did Pat Moynihan taught us to be a little better than \nourselves.\n  My thoughts and sympathies are with Senator Moynihan's wife Liz, his \ndaughter Maura, his sons Timothy and John, and his grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, I wish words could convey to everyone within the sound \nof my voice what a great man Pat Moynihan was, how much he did to \nbenefit the State of New York and our country. Because of my contact \nwith Pat Moynihan, I honestly believe I am a better person. I better \nunderstand government. I do not have his intellect, his ability to \nwrite, but I think I understand a little bit about his enthusiasm for \ngovernment and how important it is to people.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been listening to the tributes to a \ngreat man. I probably have a different feeling about Patrick Moynihan \nthan most people do. Many people are not aware Patrick Moynihan came \nfrom Tulsa, OK, my hometown. Most people think of him as being a New \nYorker, but really he is not. We hit it off many years ago before he \nwas even in the Senate. I considered him one of the really sincere and \nlovable liberals of our time.\n  People would ask, why are the two of you such close friends? I would \nexplain to them that we have many things in common, even though \nideologically we have nothing in common. In fact, during the years we \nserved together in the Senate, his office was next to mine. When the \nbell would ring to come over and vote, I would walk to the door and \nwait for him so I could have those moments with him.\n  I don't think there is anyone who has had a more colorful career than \nPatrick Moynihan. It is one we will remember for a long time. But he \nhad courage also. I used to say this about Paul Wellstone. There are \nfew people who are really sincere in their philosophy, and yet they \nwant to do the right thing. I remember standing right here when Patrick \nMoynihan, just a few seats over, stood up during one of our debates on \npartial-birth abortion, and he made this statement in a long and \npassionate speech, going into all kinds of detail as to what this \nbarbaric procedure is. This is a quote. He said:\n\n       I am pro-choice, but partial-birth abortion is not \n     abortion. It is infanticide.\n\n  It took an awful lot of courage for him to say that.\n\n[[Page S4469]]\n\n  I can tell you from when we knew each other back before our Senate \ndays, following his colorful career has been a wonderful experience. I \nam hoping we will have others like him. We will be truly blessed if \nthat is the case.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in paying tribute to \nSenator Moynihan. He was one of the most special, most erudite, \nforward-thinking persons I have had the privilege to meet. He was an \namazing man.\n  Senator Moynihan died yesterday at the age of 76. With a little bit \nof history--and then I will give a few personal anecdotes--he was \nelected to the Senate in 1976. I was elected in 1978, 2 years later. I \nhad the privilege and honor to join both the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee and the Finance Committee at the same time as Senator \nMoynihan. Senator Moynihan served as both chairman and ranking member \nof both committees. I had huge shoes to fill, as I immediately followed \nhim as chairman and ranking member of each committee. I sat next to him \nmany days and many hours. He was a wonderful man.\n  We all know about Senator Moynihan's great contributions in such \nimportant areas as foreign policy, trade policy, welfare, \ntransportation, and environmental policy. They are enormous.\n  On the foreign side, Senator Moynihan was a visionary. In 1979, while \nthe CIA and others were talking about how strong the Soviet Union was, \nSenator Moynihan predicted its downfall. I heard him say that many \ntimes. With keen understanding of history and the laws of economics, \nSenator Moynihan understood the inherent weakness of the Soviet \nstructure.\n\n  Senator Moynihan's foreign policy experience led him to his \ngroundbreaking work on Government secrecy, advocating greater openness \nas a core strength for any democracy.\n  On trade policy, Senator Moynihan had a vast depth of experience from \nbeing a trade negotiator to being a legislator. As a legislator, he was \nquick to educate his colleagues on the importance of pursuing a strong, \nbipartisan, open trade policy. With an unfailing independent voice, he \nwas a firm believer in the principle that partisanship should not \nextend beyond our borders.\n  On welfare policy, Senator Moynihan was the center of debate for more \nthan three decades. From his groundbreaking report on family policy for \nPresident Johnson, to his work for President Nixon on his welfare \nproposal, to his own Family Support Act of 1988, the first welfare \nreform legislation passed in decades, to his passionate dissent to the \n1996 welfare legislation, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan never forgot \nwhat it was like to grow up in a poor family. For him it was clearly \nalways about helping the children.\n  On transportation policy, Senator Moynihan was the author of the \ngroundbreaking highway bill known as ISTEA. That legislation led to the \ndramatic improvement in transportation policy by focusing on surface \ntransportation more broadly.\n  On environmental policy, Senator Moynihan was one of the first to \nstress that good environmental policy should be based on sound science. \nI heard that many times--sound science. He was right. He absolutely \ninsisted that we obtain a careful understanding of the scientific \nproblems and understanding of them on a scientific basis before we \nproceeded with environmental policy.\n  But his incredible contributions to our Nation did not stop there. \nOne of his most enduring, but least known, contributions was his \ncontribution to public architecture, particularly on the Environment \nand Public Works Committee.\n  Thomas Jefferson said:\n\n       Design activity and political thought are indivisible.\n\n  In keeping with this, Senator Moynihan sought to improve our public \nplaces so they could reflect and uplift our civic culture. He himself \nsaid it well in 1961. We all know he held many important positions in \nGovernment, but it is not known so well that early in his career, in \n1961, he was the staff director of something called the Ad Hoc \nCommittee on Federal Office Space. That is right, in addition to all of \nhis books, he once wrote a document called ``The Guiding Principles for \nFederal Architecture.'' He wrote it in 1961, and it remains in effect \ntoday. It is one page long. It says that public buildings should not \nonly be efficient and economical, but also should ``provide visual \ntestimony to the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of the \nAmerican Government.''\n  For many years, Pat Moynihan worked with energy and vision to put the \ngoals expressed in the guidelines into practice. As an assistant to \nPresident Kennedy, he was one of the driving forces behind the effort \nto renovate Pennsylvania Avenue and finally achieve Pierre L'Enfant's \nvision.\n  He followed through. There is the Navy memorial, Pershing Park, the \nRonald Reagan Building, and Ariel Rios, and there are other projects. \nAlong with Senator John Chafee, he had the vision to restore Union \nStation--now a magnificent building--and then to complement it with the \nbeautiful Thurgood Marshall Judiciary Building not far away.\n\n  It is a remarkable legacy leaving a lasting mark on our public places \nthat brings us together as American citizens. In fact, it is no \nexaggeration to say that Daniel Patrick Moynihan has had a greater \npositive impact on American public architecture than any statesman \nsince Thomas Jefferson.\n  In St. Paul's Cathedral in London, there is a description \nmemorializing the architect of that cathedral, Sir Christopher Wren, \nand it reads: If you would see his memorial, look about you.\n  If years from now you stand outside the Capitol and look west down \nPennsylvania Avenue, north at Union Station, and the Marshall Building, \nyou can say the same about Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan; that is, if \nyou would see his memorial, look about you.\n  A few years ago when we were naming the Foley Square Courthouse in \nhis honor, I used the same quote. I must confess, I was very pleased to \nhave found this quote in English history and hoped to impress my very \nlearned colleague. However, as is often the case, I fell a little \nshort. No one, it turns out, can match his learning.\n  After my remarks, Senator Moynihan gave me a big hug. He was so \nhappy. But he also corrected me quietly and politely. I had, he said, \ngiven the correct translation. I had said it was in Italian. He said: \nMax, I think it's in Latin. Sure enough, it is in Latin.\n  In his honor, I stand corrected. The inscription memorializing the \narchitect of St. Paul's Cathedral, Sir Christopher Wren, reads: Si \nmonumentum requiris, circumspice; Latin for: If you want to see the \nmemorial, look about you.\n  As we consider ways of memorializing Senator Moynihan, I have a \nsuggestion. He loved Pennsylvania Avenue. He inspired its renovation. \nHe helped design it. He helped build it. He lived there when he \nretired. It is his home. Therefore, I suggest that at an appropriate \npoint on the avenue, we add his inscription: Daniel Patrick Moynihan, \nSi monumentum requiris, circumspice.\n  I might also add, Senator Moynihan gave the commencement address this \nlast June at Harvard University. I have read it. I was very impressed \nwith it. I said to him: Patrick, that was a great speech. Do you mind \nif I put that in the Congressional Record? He said: I would love it.\n  About 2 months later, I received a letter from Senator Moynihan, and \nit said: Dear Max, you once offered, perhaps irrationally, to include \nmy commencement address in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I think it is appropriate that Senator Lautenberg \nasked that Senator Moynihan's speech be printed in the Record. It is \nthe commencement address he gave last June 6 at Harvard University. I \ncommend it to my colleagues.\n  Senator Moynihan's speech includes many wise words about the future \nof our country, about terrorism, how to handle the world, which leads \nme to another memory of him. It was at the end of a session, and we \nwere about to go on a 2-week recess. Senator Moynihan's chair is behind \nme at the end of the aisle by the door. I said: Patrick, what are you \ngoing to do this recess?\n  He said: I am going to give the Oxford lecture.\n  I said: What is that? He explained it.\n\n[[Page S4470]]\n\n  He said: I am going to give the Oxford lecture. I am going over to \nEngland.\n  What are you going to talk about? What are you going to say?\n  I am going to talk about the rise of ethnicity.\n  What do you mean?\n  At the end of the cold war, he talked about the urdu, an Israeli \nsect, which was very strong, which epitomizes the rise of ethnicity in \nthe world at the conclusion of the cold war. It is so true, if one \nstops and thinks about it. The world order has collapsed, and we are \nnow almost in a free-for-all when different ethnicities, different \ncountries, different people are pursuing their own dreams, and it is \nvery difficult to find some managed order in this chaotic world today.\n  That was Senator Moynihan: The rise of ethnicity. It is very true.\n  Another time, I had a wonderful encounter with him, a wonderful \nexchange. People often ask us: What is going to happen, Senator? Who is \ngoing to win this election? What is going to happen?\n  I always answered: Well, as Prime Minister Disraeli would always say, \nin politics a week is a long time. That was before television. That was \nbefore radio. Today, it is even a shorter period of time to try to \npredict what is going to happen in political matters. Sometimes it is \njust a minute.\n  I was standing in the well of the Senate and somebody asked me: What \nis going to happen? And I said: Well, Disraeli said, in politics a week \nis a long time.\n  Senator Moynihan happened to overhear me, and very graciously and \npolitely he walked up to me when the other Senators had left. He kind \nof leaned over to me and he said: Max, now I think that was Baldwin.\n  I looked it up. Sure enough, it was Lord Baldwin--it was not \nDisraeli--who said, in politics a week is a long time.\n  He was an absolutely amazing man, the Senator's Senator, a professor. \nI have never known a Senator so gifted as Senator Moynihan. We are all \ngoing to certainly mourn his passing, but even more important than \nthat, we are going to have very fond memories of him and I think be \nguided and inspired by him in so many different ways. We are very \nthankful he chose to serve our country as his calling.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am going to make a longer speech about \nPat Moynihan, who was a close personal friend. That sounds almost \npresumptuous to say. He was such a towering intellect and profound \npolitical figure, to claim a personal friendship with him seems to be \nsomewhat presumptuous. But he was.\n  Of all that I recall Pat Moynihan said and did, there is one thing \nthat sticks in my mind that seems particularly appropriate on the day \nafter his passing.\n  He once said, and I am paraphrasing but it is close to a quote, about \nJohn Kennedy's death:\n\n       There is no sense in being Irish unless you understand the \n     world is eventually going to break your heart.\n\n  I want Mrs. Moynihan to understand that there are a lot of us--Irish \nand non-Irish--who have a broken heart today because of the passing of \na man who was truly, truly a giant in 20th-century American politics.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/27/senate-section/article/S4470-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4470-S4472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nbrave service men and women from Georgia who are serving in Operation \nIraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. Several weeks ago I had the \nprivilege of being in Fort Stewart, GA, which is located in Hinesville, \nto visit with several hundred of our men and women preparing to leave \nas soon as we finished our visit to board an airplane headed for \nKuwait. They are members of the 3rd Infantry Division, one of the more \nnotable infantry divisions in the history of our great country. I \nswelled with pride as I had the opportunity to visit with those men and \nwomen who were so prepared, so well trained, and so well equipped to \nensure that democracy and freedom continue to ring and to do what is \nnecessary on their part to free the people of Iraq from the dreaded \nrule of Saddam Hussein.\n  The 3rd Infantry Division is known as the ``Rock of the Marne.'' They \nfought bravely in World War I and they held their ground during the \nBattle of Marne when surrounding units retreated. Since then they have \nbeen operating under the motto ``we'll stay there.'' Their most famous \nsoldier was one of the most decorated soldiers in the history of the \nUnited States, Audie Murphy. They have a proud history of serving in \nWorld War II, the Korean war, and Operation Desert Storm.\n  Georgia and America can be proud of the history that the 3rd is \nmaking today in Iraq. Currently, there are over 7,000 tanks, humvees, \nBradley armored vehicles, and trucks in theater. This is undoubtedly \none of the largest convoys ever in the history of the United States \nMilitary. They are facing heavy resistance and fierce sandstorms, but \nbecause of their training and their preparation, thankfully they have \nsuffered only light casualties.\n  This morning, as we speak, the 3rd Infantry Division is less than 50 \nmiles from Baghdad, preparing to encounter the elite Iraqi Republican \nGuard. Over the last 3 days, soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Division \nhave surrounded the city of Najaf and taken captive over 500 Iraqi \nsoldiers in their effort to liberate the Iraqi people and overthrow the \noppressive Iraqi regime.\n  In addition to the 3rd Infantry Division, there are many other brave \nmen and women deployed from Georgia to the Middle East and Afghanistan, \nincluding the 94th Airlift Wing from Dobbins Air Reserve Base in \nAtlanta; the 165th Airlift Wing from Savannah; the 4th Supply Battalion \nfrom the Marine Corps Logistics Base in Albany, GA, which is near my \nhome; the Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron from the Naval Air Station \nin Atlanta; the 221st Military Intelligence Battalion in Atlanta, from \nthe Army Reserve, and the 116th Air Control Wing from Robins Air Force \nBase, who are very proud of flying the Joint Stars weapon system.\n  I have had the privilege of representing Robins Air Force Base for \nthe last 8 years as a Member of the House. I have flown with the Joint \nStars about four times. They are so proud of the work they do, and \njustly so. They are the eyes of the Army when it comes to gathering \nintelligence on the enemy and its movement.\n  Sadly, they are also prisoners of war and brave soldiers that have \nbeen killed and wounded in the line of duty from Georgia. Just this \nweek, there was an Apache helicopter shot down. On that helicopter were \ntwo chief warrant officers, Rob Young from Lithia Springs, GA, and \nDavid Williams. Both of these men now are prisoners of war of the Iraqi \nArmy.\n  I had the opportunity to visit with Officer Young's father on Tuesday \nthis week. He was obviously, like all of his family and all Americans, \nvery concerned about the health and safety of his son. But he was so \nproud of the work that his son was doing and so proud that his son was \ndoing exactly what he wanted to do. I share in that pride with his \nfamily.\n\n  Killed in action in Iraq over the last couple of days have been \nSpecialist Jamall R. Addison of the 507th Maintenance Company from Fort \nBliss, TX, who is a resident of Roswell, GA; Specialist Gregory P. \nSanders from Company B, 3rd Battalion of 69th Armor, stationed at Fort \nStewart, GA.\n  Unfortunately, also killed in the helicopter crash in Afghanistan \nover the last few days, they were flying a Pave Hawk search and rescue \nhelicopter, 1LT Tamara Archuleta, SSgt Jason Hicks, MSgt Michael Maltz, \nSrA Jason Plite, LTC John Stein, and SSgt John Teal, all from Moody Air \nForce Base in Valdosta, GA. We will be praying for them and their \nfamilies in this time of hardship and sorrow.\n  The men and women I have described are all part of the All-Volunteer \nForce that make up the best and brightest our country has to offer. \nThey have chosen to put their lives on the line for the freedom of \ntheir families and their country, and we could never adequately express \nour gratitude for the sacrifice they and their families have made and \nwill continue to make for the United States.\n  I am proud of all of these young men and women. I salute them. We \nwant to make sure they and their families know they continue to be in \nour prayers. We wish for immediate success and a safe return of all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, in the early stages of the conflict with\n\n[[Page S4471]]\n\nIraq, my State of Oregon is already mourning, already forced to count \nthe cost of this war in real and human terms.\n  This morning I expressed my condolences to the families and friends \nof all of those who have given their lives in this war, but I \nparticularly recognize the brave soldiers being mourned today by the \npeople of Oregon. Army Reserve Specialist Brandon Tobler, who was only \n19, lost his life in a humvee accident during a sandstorm. Brandon was \nthe only son of Leo and Gail Tobler of Portland. He grew up there and \njoined the military to help pay for college. He was in a convoy headed \nto Baghdad providing engineering support to the combat troops. Private \nTobler's death reminds us that a soldier doesn't have to be on the \ncombat line to face tremendous danger and possible death.\n  It reminds us how brave each and every person who puts on a uniform \nfor the United States must be regardless of their particular \nassignment.\n  Air National Guard MAJ Gregory Stone was a 20-year veteran of \nmilitary service. He was killed in the grenade attack at the base of \nthe 101st Airborne in Kuwait. He leaves behind two young sons today, \nEvan and Joshua, as well as his mother in Ontario--who I just spoke \nwith--and others across our State who loved him dearly. Major Stone \ngraduated from Oregon State University, and from Benson High School in \nmy hometown of Portland. He died far from the front lines but, again, \ncalled to sacrifice in war.\n  Army SGT Donald Walters is now missing in action after his convoy was \nambushed in Southern Iraq. His wife and kids are in Missouri. His \nparents, Norman and Arlene, are in Salem, OR, awaiting word on his \nsafety. Sergeant Walters comes from a family with a rich tradition of \nservice across the military, including the Army, Navy, and the Air \nForce. He is a specialist in decontamination. His convoy was moving to \nsupport troops in battle when they took a wrong turn into terrible \ncircumstances. The people of Oregon now are praying for his family and \nhis friends. I join with all of them in hoping for his safe return.\n  Each of these very brave Oregonians, in my view, is an example of the \nbest of the American spirit. We mourn the deaths of those killed. We \npray for the safe return of Sergeant Walters and, above all, we give \nthanks for all of those living as well, who still serve so bravely in \nthis time of war.\n  Madam President, the special people who are serving our country cross \ngenerations, and they represent every ethnic group. They serve in a \nwide variety of capacities. Some come from Reserve units or the \nNational Guard. Others are in the permanent services. They are members \nof very different fighting forces--Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Marines, \nand Air Force. Amidst all of this diversity, there is so much that they \nshare--especially a deep love for our country, and a common willingness \nto risk their lives for the lives of others.\n  Together, they stand between the citizens of our Nation and those who \nwould do America harm. They all know that at any time they could be \ncalled upon to make the ultimate sacrifice. Yet, each day, they go in \nand put their uniform on and charge into harm's way for all of our \nsakes.\n  Throughout American history, members of our military have made the \nsacrifices that allow our great Republic to survive. Today, as the \npictures of this war play out on television screens across the Nation, \npeople in this country can see as never before just what a war requires \nof men and women who fight on behalf of all of us. As we watch, it is \nimportant to remember these images are not created in Hollywood. They \nare the actions of real human beings. The soldiers are real people, \nloved by countless Americans here at home who worry every single hour \nfor their safety, and mourn them when they are lost.\n  I will close today by expressing my gratitude to all of the Americans \nwho serve our great Nation, and take special time today to reflect on \nthe contributions of the Oregonians we have lost. Our concern for the \nmissing people of this country today is great. The people I represent \nat home in Oregon offer their prayers every day for the success of the \nmission of those who serve and for their safe and speedy return.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I am truly pleased and honored to be \nhere today for the second continuing day of the Senate's tribute to the \ntroops. I want to say to my good colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, \nthat the purpose really of us being here today and the time we are \ntrying as a body to take is to recognize and to speak out to his \nconstituents in Oregon; and it is not just his thoughts and prayers \nthat go out to those families but all of our prayers.\n  When it comes to our troops and the tribute we pay to these men and \nwomen who serve us, serve this great Nation, we act as one body. We \ncome together with collective thoughts and prayers for each and every \none of these service men and women.\n  Regarding the two Oregonians whose lives were lost and the two who \nare missing, each of us feels what Senator Wyden does. We want to \nexpress that as a body. I think it is so important at this time in our \ncountry's history that we as a body are not divided, that we are here \nas individuals to say our thoughts and prayers are collective for the \nmen and women who have put their lives on hold here, left their \nfamilies, and gone to a foreign land to defend our freedom and our \nsecurity against the tyranny of this individual who has the \nunbelievable capabilities of weapons of mass destruction.\n  So I am pleased the Senator from Oregon was able to join us, and I \nhope his constituents understand they have the entire body's thoughts \nand prayers with them. I want to expand on that a little bit.\n  I come to this body a little bit differently than many of the other \nSenators. I don't have a long list of elected positions that I have \nheld, and in terms of the time I have been here, it is probably shorter \nthan a good many. I really come as a farmer's daughter and, I guess \nmore recently, as a mother. I thought this morning, as I put my twin \nboys who are in the first grade on the school bus, sending them off to \nschool, having sat at the breakfast table and made sure they had a good \nbreakfast--one of my boys is in a school play and we were practicing \nhis lines--when I put them on that bus this morning, I thought about \nthe other mothers in the country whose sons and daughters are in a \nfaraway land, who they cannot communicate with; all they can do is look \nup in the sky and realize that the same moon, and the same sun, and the \nsame stars are shining above their precious children today in a foreign \nland where their lives are in danger. I just lifted up my own prayer of \nthankfulness that I live in this great country, where people want to be \na part of other people's lives, where men and women are willing to give \nof themselves to defend the things we believe in: freedom, fairness, \nhard work, community, and helping each other.\n  Yesterday, I paid tribute to the troops from Arkansas, from all \nacross our great State--so many of whom were from small communities, \nalmost every community in our State represented. Those proud men and \nwomen, measuring well over 2,000, are now over there in that conflict.\n  Today, I want to talk about how each of us can honor all of the \nindividuals who are there serving us right now. As I said earlier, not \nhaving served in the military myself, and not having a longstanding \nhistory of elected positions, I look back to my own background, and I \nremember the stories my mother told me. She remembered every detail. \nShe had gone to the movies, and when her mother picked her up from the \nmovies, she told her that World War II had begun and that her big \nbrother would be shipping out in the next couple of days. She \nremembered everything: She remembered the movie, she remembered the \nclothes she was wearing, she remembered the thoughts in her mind. She \nthought, what is it that I can do to make a contribution and honor \nthese individuals who are going overseas to defend me, and who I am in \nthis great country that I belong to? She thought about that. She was \nimmediately introduced to rations and victory gardens and making sure \nthat there were plenty of bandages for the Red Cross.\n  We must all look at and never underestimate the ways we can honor \nthose individuals.\n  I think one of the most important ways we can honor these men and \nwomen who have sacrificed and are giving so much on our behalf is to \nlook at\n\n[[Page S4472]]\n\nourselves as a body. As we stood here this morning and said the Pledge \nof Allegiance to the Flag, which always makes me proud, to be \nindivisible, to come together as one body when it comes to our troops--\nwe are going to have our differences. We always have and we always \nwill. But I think it is so important in this time of paying tribute to \nour armed services, the forces that are out there to defend our \nfreedoms, that we act in a nonpartisan and indivisible way.\n  I was really saddened today when I picked up the paper and, in what \nhas become a very common manner, there was a sense of making fun about \nsome of the priorities that many of us Democrats had in this recent \nbudget debate. Budgets are all about priorities, and in our household, \nI run our budget. We sometimes have to cut our spending to make sure we \nhave enough money for college education and other priorities in our \nhousehold budget.\n  I had an amendment on the budget which I thought was very important. \nWhen the men and women who serve in our Reserves and National Guard are \nactivated, they have health care at that point, but prior to that \npoint, they do not have health care. I think it is equally as important \nto honor them not just when they are serving but when they are at home \npreparing and willing to serve.\n  I do not think it is comical in terms of a Democratic ``spend-o-\nmeter.'' It is my priority that these men and women are important \nenough to me that I am willing to ask some to delay a tax cut so we can \nprovide that kind of health care to their families and to our men and \nwomen serving when they are willing and preparing to serve us in the \narmed services.\n  In these continuing debates--we certainly come to the floor to talk \nabout the men and women from our States who serve us in the armed \nservices, who have put their lives in harm's way, to talk about their \nfamilies at home who are heartbroken, who are anxious, who are in \nthoughtful prayer--I hope we will also remember in this body as we \ndebate these priorities--whether it is a budget, tax cuts, or any other \nissue--that we also remember what they fight for: Our ability in this \ncountry to have the freedom to disagree but to disagree with respect.\n  My priorities in that budget were for the service men and women who \nserve, and I will continue to put them as a priority because when I put \nmy son on that bus this morning, I thought about the rest of those \nmothers across this country. I thought about those men and women \nserving us who left family members behind who maybe did not have health \ncare, and I think it is critical. Whether or not we disagree, we \ncertainly respect the differences of opinions that we may have in this \nbody and, for the sake of those men and women who have put their lives \nin harm's way, that we will not be frivolous with our comments or \ncomical in the priorities each of us may have, even though there is a \ndifference.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Arkansas be allowed to speak for as long as she would like. She is \nmaking a good statement, and there is no other Member on the floor. I \nmake that request.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the Senator from Montana. I thank him very much \nfor what he is going to begin, a tax package that really does serve the \nmen and women in uniform. I appreciate his hard work and leadership on \nthat issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/27/senate-section/article/S4472-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 1307, which the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H. R. 1307) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to provide a special rule for members of the uniformed \n     services in determining the exclusion of gain from the sale \n     of a principal residence and to restore the tax exempt status \n     of death gratuity payments to members of the uniformed \n     services, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 3 \nhours of debate on the bill.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we are now awaiting the arrival of the \nchairman of the committee. Pending his arrival, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is a privilege for me to be before \nthe Senate again in a working relationship with Senator Baucus, the \nranking Democrat of the Senate Finance Committee. It is another example \nof legislation that comes out of our committee in the bipartisan \ntradition of our committee, and this one came out, I believe, with \nunanimous support.\n  I very much appreciate not only the cooperation of Senator Baucus, \nbut other members on the Democratic side of the committee, for helping \nus move along a very important piece of legislation, one that was very \nimportant last fall when we did not get it passed but more important \nnow because it deals with our people in the military and because of \nwhat is going on in Iraq at this moment.\n  We are here today to consider the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act which \nthe Finance Committee developed during this and the last Congress. This \nis a particularly somber time in our country as we continue our \ndangerous operations in the country of Iraq.\n  The contributions of the men and women of our uniformed services, our \nreservists and our National Guard, are foremost in our minds, and our \nthoughts and prayers remain with their loved ones and with families. I \nparticularly wish to extend my condolences to the family of SGT Bradley \nKorthaus of Davenport, IA, whose death was reported yesterday. SGT \nKorthaus died while serving his Marine Corps engineering unit in \nsoutheast Iraq. So we have before us legislation affecting all of these \nmen and women, legislation to ensure that our service men and women and \ntheir families are treated fairly under tax law. It seems to me this \nlegislation is particularly timely.\n  The military bill we consider today rectifies a number of inequities \nfaced by the uniformed services, our National Guard, and even Foreign \nService personnel. For example, this legislation before the Senate now \nensures that the families of military personnel called into active duty \nare not disadvantaged under the home sale exclusion provisions that \naffect many homeowners in the United States because most Americans are \npermitted to exclude built-in gain on the sale of their personal \nresidence if they meet certain residency requirements.\n  The situation for military personnel owning a home is entirely \ndifferent because we know that military personnel, called to active \nduty or asked to relocate, do not have the flexibility to meet these \nresidency requirements and are consequently then adversely impacted by \nthese rules. The Tax Code is unfair to them because they have no \ncontrol over where they are going to live because they are called to \nmeet the command of a military commanding officer to move out to \nsomeplace else.\n  The legislation, then, would suspend the residency test for periods \nof active duty aggregating no more than 10 years. We should obviously \nnot punish members of our military and their families who are asked to \nrelocate in the name of serving their country and protecting our \nnational security, protecting our freedoms. To that extent, the Tax \nCode is unfair so that they get punished in ways that people who are \nnonmilitary and can control more of their lives would not be punished.\n  Another important issue weighing on the minds of many military \npersonnel called into active duty is the well-being and the care of \ntheir children. The Federal Government works to ensure that military \nfamilies have adequate and affordable access to child\n\n[[Page S4473]]\n\ncare, as we should. This is an important function of the military \nduring peacetime, but it is essential, even more so, during periods of \nconflict such as the one we are experiencing in Iraq.\n  The need is that much more pressing obviously for single parents and \ndual military career families. This legislation clarifies that \ndependent care benefits provided to families of the uniformed services \nwill not be treated as taxable compensation.\n  In recent days, the press has focused significantly on the impending \nservice contributions of our Reserve, military people, and National \nGuard members. To date, we have more than 200,000 reservists and \nNational Guard being called to active duty, most of them called for the \nsole purpose of assisting Operation Iraqi Freedom. This includes, in my \nown State of Iowa, 3,500 men and women who have been called to active \nduty. We have begun to rely increasingly on these service personnel to \ndefend our borders and serve and protect in other areas of the world, \nmeeting their commitment to our total force concept of the military.\n  Many of Iowa's reservists have contacted me to emphasize that \nreservists who travel for training exercises that they do on weekends, \nor any other time, are required to spend their own money for these \ntravel expenses. If our military is not able to reimburse reservists \nfor travel expenses related to training assignments, we should, at a \nvery minimum, allow these men and women to fully deduct those expenses \non their Federal tax returns and not be hit by some threshold that \nprecludes most of these deductions from being taken. Reservists should \nnot be in a position of subsidizing their own military training.\n  Among other things, this legislation also ensures that military \npersonnel serving in Secretary of Defense-designated contingency \noperations--and this would include Operation Desert Storm and \npresumably now Operation Iraqi Freedom--receive appropriate relief from \nthe administrative burdens that our tax laws foist upon them during \nparticipation in those operations.\n  In closing, we all thank the men and women of the U.S. military and \nReserve components. The onset of the conflict in Iraq, no doubt, renews \nour deep appreciation for the tremendous sacrifices and risks that they \nundertake to protect the freedom of American people and others around \nthe world. It is a perfect time then to ensure that our military is \nmore fairly treated under our country's tax laws. That is what this \nlegislation is all about.\n  So I thank my colleagues for their consideration of this legislation. \nI urge each of my colleagues to vote for this very important tax \nfairness measure, particularly considering the importance of it at this \ntime of sacrifice on the battlefield of Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Armed \nForces Tax Fairness Act of 2003. On February 5, 2003, the Finance \nCommittee favorably reported the bill by unanimous voice vote.\n  As the conflict in Iraq continues, our thoughts are with the men and \nwomen who are leading America's response and serving our country. \nWhether it be the Marines deployed in Iraq, the National Guard \nsupporting our troops, or the Foreign Service Officers serving in \ndangerous diplomatic posts.\n  I think in particular of the many men and women in Montana. These men \nand women have been called to service to defend our Nation. In fact, on \nSeptember 11 of 2002, the members of the 120th Fighter Wing of the \nMontana Air National Guard were called on to secure the skies of the \nno-fly zone over Iraq.\n  For these dedicated public servants, we are considering the Armed \nForces Tax Fairness Act. This bill will not only correct inequities in \nthe current Tax Code that our military men and women are subject to but \nit will also provide incentives for our dedicated forces to continue \ntheir service to America.\n  These are the men and women who put their lives on the line for our \nfreedom on a daily basis. We need to ensure that the tax laws we pass \ndo not negatively impact them.\n  It is with these principles in mind that I have moved forward with \nthe introduction of this military tax package and that the Finance \nCommittee favorably reported the bill.\n  I would now like to describe the provisions included in this critical \npiece of legislation:\n\n  Why is the death gratuity payments provision so important? Under \ncurrent law, death gratuity benefits are excludable from income only to \nthe extent that they were as of September 9, 1986. In 1986, the death \ngratuity benefit was $3,000.\n  In 1991, the benefit was increased to $6,000 but the Tax Code was \nnever adjusted to exclude the additional $3,000 from income. Because of \nthis oversight, the U.S. government has been taxing families for the \ndeath of a family member who died in combat.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, one of our soldiers from Montana, PFC Stryder \nStoutenburg, was killed during a Blackhawk helicopter crash. A native \nof Missoula, Private First Class Stoutenburg was only 18.\n  His mother will receive the death benefit payment, but will be taxed \non half of it. She has already lost so much. It is unfair to also take \naway part of the small compensation she is receiving.\n  In 1997, Congress passed legislation revising the taxation of capital \ngains on the sale of a person's principal residence.\n  The new law provides that up to $250,000 or $500,000 for a married \ncouple is excluded on the sale of a principal residence if the \nindividual has lived in the house for at least two of the previous five \nyears.\n  However, when enacted, Congress failed to provide a special rule for \nmilitary and foreign service personnel who are required to move either \nwithin the U.S. or abroad.\n  Our proposal would permit service personnel and members of the \nforeign service to suspend the 5-year period while away on assignment. \nThat means that those years would not count toward either the two years \nor the five year periods.\n  Senators McCain, Graham, and Lincoln proposed a bill in the last \nsession to correct this.\n  The Department of Defense provides payments to members of the Armed \nServices to offset diminution in housing values due to military base \nrealignment or closure.\n  For example, if a house near a base was worth $140,000 prior to the \nbase closure and $100,000 after the base closure, DoD may provide the \nowner with a payment to offset some, but not all, of the $40,000 \ndiminution in value. Under current law, those amounts are taxable as \ncompensation.\n  We should ensure that those men and women losing value in their homes \ndue to a federal government decision are not adversely affected \nfinancially.\n  The proposal would provide that payments for lost value are not \nincludible into income.\n  Under current law, military personnel in a combat zone are afforded \nan extended period for filing tax returns.\n  However, this does not apply to contingency operations. This proposal \nwould extend the same benefits to military personnel assigned to \ncontingency operations.\n  It cannot be easy trying to figure out our complicated tax system \nwhile you are overseas and protecting our nation's freedom. Those men \nand women who are sent to uphold democracy and freedom in other \ncountries are confronted with the same filing complications as combat \nzone personnel.\n  Contingency operations are just as demanding as combat zone \ndeployment, although not always in the same manner. For example, in our \ncurrent war on terrorism, this proposal would help members of our \nSpecial Forces in the Philippines supporting Operation Enduring Freedom \nwho are just as focused on accomplishing their critical mission as our \ntroops in the Iraqi combat zone.\n  Some reservists who travel one weekend per month and two weeks in the \nsummer for reserve duty incur significant travel and lodging expenses.\n  For the most part, these expenses are not reimbursed. Under current \nlaw, these are deductible as itemized deductions but must exceed 2 \npercent of adjusted gross income.\n  For lower income reservists, this deduction does not provide a \nbenefit, because they do not itemize. For higher income reservists, the \n2 percent floor\n\n[[Page S4474]]\n\nlimits the amount of the benefit of the deductions.\n  In my home state of Montana, we have approximately 3,500 reservists, \n800 of whom travel each month across the state for their training. \nThese 800 reservists pay travel and lodging expenses out of their own \npocket.\n  Montana ranks 48th in the nation for per capita personal income. So, \nthat $200 expense for reserve duty every month means a lot to the \nMontana reservist. Yet, they continue selflessly to provide their \nservices to our country at their own expense. For those reservists who \ntravel out of state for their training, this expense is even higher.\n  This proposal would provide an above the line deduction for overnight \ntravel costs and would be available for all reservists and members of \nthe National Guard.\n  Currently, qualified veterans' organizations under section 501(c)(19) \nof the tax code are tax-exempt. In addition contributions to the \norganization are tax-deductible.\n  In order to qualify under 501(c)(19), the organization must meet \nseveral tests, including 75 percent of the members must be current or \nformer military, and substantially all of the other members must be \neither spouses, widows, or widowers of current or former military.\n  The proposal would permit lineal descendants and ancestors to qualify \nfor the ``substantially all'' test.\n  It is important that our veterans' organizations continue the good \nwork that they do. But, as the organizations age, they are in danger of \nlosing their tax-exempt status. This bill helps ensure the vitality of \nthese organizations.\n  I want to ensure that parents in the military can continue their \ndedicated service once they enter parenthood, with the knowledge that \ntheir children are being well taken care of.\n  The military provides extensive childcare benefits to its employees. \nEmployees at DoD-owned facilities provide childcare services while \nother areas with non-DoD owned facilities contract out their childcare.\n  When Congress passed the Tax Reform Act of 1986, we included a \nprovision stating that qualified military benefits are excluded from \nincome. It is not absolutely clear whether childcare provisions are \ncovered under this provision.\n  The proposal would clarify that any childcare benefit provided to \nmilitary personnel would be excludible from income.\n  This bill permits penalty-free withdrawals from Coverdell education \nsavings accounts and qualified tuition programs made on account of the \nattendance of the account holder or beneficiary at any of the service \nacademies. The amount of the funds that can be withdrawn penalty-free \nis limited to the costs of advanced education in that calendar year.\n  Under current law there is no procedure for the IRS to suspend the \ntax-exempt status of an organization.\n  This proposal would suspend the tax-exempt status of an organization \nfor any period during which the organization is designated or \nidentified by Executive Order as a terrorist organization.\n  Current law provides for income tax, estate tax and death benefit \nrelief to soldiers who are killed in a combat zone, victims of the \nSeptember 11th attacks, the Oklahoma City bombing victims, and the \nvictims of the anthrax attacks.\n  The crew of the Space Shuttle Columbia was heroic in every sense of \nthe word. We have a duty to those who lost their lives for the \nadvancement of science and increasing our knowledge of the world we \nlive in. This legislation makes all of the above benefits available to \nthe families of the Columbia crew.\n  In addition, this bill includes three revenue offsets. First, we \nimprove the collection of unpaid taxes from people who have renounced \ntheir American citizenship in order to avoid U.S. taxes.\n  Second, we extend certain IRS user fees.\n  Third, we restore the ability of the IRS to permit partial-pay \ninstallment agreements with taxpayers.\n  The Military bill passed by the Senate Finance Committee fixes some \nof the inequities in our tax code and, more importantly, acknowledges \nthe men and women who are making sacrifices and risking their lives to \ndefend us all.\n  I thank all of the Members who have contributed to the development of \nthe bill: Senators Levin and Warner of the Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Landrieu for the childcare provision, Senator Johnson for the \ncontingency operation provision, Senator DeWine for the above-the-line \ndeduction, and Senator Harkin for the Veterans and Expatriation \nprovisions.\n  I especially thank the Chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator \nGrassley, who has once again been a partner in the development of \nimportant bipartisan tax legislation.\n  Mr. President, it is important that we continue to show members of \nthe armed forces our support and solidarity during this time of \nconflict. The War on Terrorism and the conflict with Iraq have brought \nto light the essential role the armed services play in upholding \nfreedom throughout the world.\n  I hope to see this military tax equity bill passed by the Senate \ntoday, and signed into law by the President swiftly.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to share my strong support \nfor this much needed and much deserved military tax package. I commend \nChairman Grassley and my many colleagues who have worked so hard on \nthis bill for such a long time. As we all know, this tax package is \nlong overdue.\n  As my colleagues know, the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act of 2003 \nwould provide critical tax relief to our service men and women. \nSpecifically, this bill would remedy several tax problems that unfairly \npenalize the men and women serving in our military and Foreign Service. \nCertainly now, more than ever, we must correct these inequities. It is \nthe right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, there are many service men and women from my home \nstate of Ohio serving in our military today. My wife, Fran, and I pray \nfor all of them and their families--we pray that they will be safe, \nwherever they are and in whatever capacity they are working. Many of \nthese courageous men and women are in Iraq right now. Four of them from \nOhio have been injured or are listed as missing. Both Army CPT Gregory \nHolden from Huron, OH, and Marine Corps Sgt. Jose Torres from Lorain, \nOH, have been injured in the war. And Army PVT Brandon Sloan from \nBedford Heights, OH, and Marine Corps MSgt Robert Dowdy from Cleveland \nare listed as missing. I would like their families to know that we are \npraying for them. We pray for their recovery and their safe return \nhome.\n  Mr. President, as we debate the merits of this bill, I would like to \ntake a moment to discuss a specific provision that I have worked on for \nmore than two years--and that is a provision that would allow our \nNational Guard and Reserve members to take deductions for travel \nexpenses incurred getting to and from duty assignments. This initiative \nstems from legislation I first introduced two years ago, and then again \nthis past January.\n  Specifically, the provision would provide a tax deduction for \novernight travel costs incurred more than 100 miles from the taxpayer's \nhome. These expenses include meals, transportation, and lodging up to \nthe amount allowable under Department of Defense per diem allowances.\n  Mr. President, this provision is a positive step in the right \ndirection, as approximately 225,000 Reservists and Guardsmen incur \nsignificant out-of-pocket expense--expenses that often match or even \nexceed their military take-home pay.\n  The restoration of the tax deductibility of these expenses would help \nalleviate the personal and financial costs of these individuals' \npatriotic efforts. And, quite frankly, our servicemen and women should \nnot be put in the position of subsidizing their own training.\n  I thank Chairman Grassley, Senator Baucus, and the Finance Committee \nfor working with my office to include my provision. I also would like \nto thank Senator McCAIN and my 61 colleagues who co-sponsored this \nlegislation with me last year. The incredible number of bipartisan co-\nsponsors demonstrates the widespread support our legislation carries, \nas well as the tremendous support we all share for our troops.\n  Mr. President, we owe these brave Americans our thanks and our deep \nand abiding gratitude for their service and dedication to our country \nand all that it represents. Whether in the streets of Baghdad, the \ndeserts of Kuwait, or the caves of Afghanistan, we must never forget \nthose men and women, who serve to uphold the ideals of our great \nNation.\n  They have sacrificed so much not only to protect our freedom, \nliberty, and way of life here at home, but also to promote those ideals \nabroad.\n  Mr. President, this entire military tax package is an important sign \nof support for those called to serve, as well as their families. I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the Floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, thousands of men and women from Montana \nare currently stationed overseas, be it in Iraq, Afghanistan, South \nKorea, Southeast Asia or in other supporting missions throughout the \nUnited States and the rest of the world.\n  These brave and dedicated soldiers have chosen to join the Armed \nForces and protect our country, which is one of the highest forms of \nservice there is. They are putting their lives on the line to protect \nthe freedom and security of the United States. I take my hat off to \nthem.\n  To date, Montana has sent almost 700 Reserve forces into Active Duty. \nMalmstrom Air Force Base has 105 airmen deployed overseas, including 50 \nmembers of the 819th Red Horse Squadron. Earlier this month 114 members \nof the Red Horse Squadron came home after being deployed in southwest \nAsia for five and a half months. The airmen are supporting six \ndifferent operations around the world in southwest Asia, supporting no-\nfly zones in Iraq or in Afghanistan.\n  About 390 Army Reservists from Montana have been deployed. From Great \nFalls, the 889th Quartermaster Company unit--with 119 members--recently \nreceived mobilization orders along with 100 members of the 4225th U.S. \nArmy Hospital.\n  From Missoula, 58 soldiers from the 279th Engineer Battalion and 16 \nsoldiers from the 823rd Transportation Detachment have been activated. \nAnd out of Billings, 161 members of the 592nd Ordnance Company recently \nreceived their orders. Most of these army Reservists will take part in \nOperation Enduring Freedom.\n  Montana's Air National Guard has also contributed significant human \nresources. 210 members of the 120th Fighter Wind have been activated \nflying in the no-fly zone over Iraq.\n  Montana's Army National Guard has contributed about 125 Army Guard \nmembers, many of which are at other bases throughout the United States \ntaking part in Homeland Security measures.\n  Thirty-five members of the 443rd Petroleum, Oil and Lubricants Supply \nCompany have been mobilized to assist\n\n[[Page S4476]]\n\nwith base security at the 120th Fighter Wing unit on Gore Hill outside \nof Great Falls, MT. Forty-five soldiers from the 495th Transportation \nBattalion are taking part in Operation Enduring Freedom. Eight ground-\nair liaison teams are in Fort Sill, OK, and 2 UH60 Helicopter pilots \nare in Fort Benning, GA.\n  Most certainly, I do not want to forget the thousands of Active Duty \nArmy, Navy, Air Force and Marines from Montana stationed elsewhere \nthroughout the Nation and overseas.\n  These soldiers are sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, fathers \nand mothers. And like you and I, they have families to take care of and \nworry about. They have personal lives to attend to, bills to pay and \ntax forms to fill out. As they are stationed far away, they are worried \nabout how their children are doing in school and how their husbands or \nwives are coping with the distance. It is not easy.\n  Every day they are putting their lives back here on hold and instead \nputting their lives on the line to protect the rights we hold so dear.\n  With all of the worries they are facing, I am urging for passage of \nthe military tax bill so we can take one, or two, burden off of their \nminds.\n  These men and women should not have to worry about whether or not \ntheir deployment changes their residency for tax purposes. They should \nnot have to worry about whether or not they can afford their weekend \ntraining, nor should they ever have to worry about whether their death \ncould result in an undue tax burden to their family.\n  One of the best ways we can support our troops is by doing everything \nwe can to ensure that they and their families are taken care of. As a \ntribute to our Armed Forces, I cannot think of a better way to support \nthem than by passing the military tax bill and allowing them to focus \non their mission rather than their finances.\n  I encourage my colleagues to show their support for our troops today \nby voting in favor of the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know that my friends and colleagues, \nSenator Grassley from Iowa and Senator Baucus from Montana, share my \nconcerns about the safety and welfare of our troops in the field and \ntheir families at home. With the deployment of the 389th Engineer \nBattalion and the 106th Aviation Unit from the Iowa Guard and 495th \nTransportation Company and 411th Support Detachment from the Montana \nGuard, no one can doubt that the people of the Hawkeye and Big Sky \nStates are making very important contributions to our national defense.\n  However, I wonder if my friends saw the article in the Washington \nPost on March 4, entitled ``Called-Up Reservists Take Big Hit in \nWallet; Families Struggle on Military Salary.'' I ask unanimous consent \nthat this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 4, 2003]\n\n   Called-Up Reservist Take Big Hit in Wallet; Families Struggle on \n                            Military Salary\n\n       Spring should be the busy season for the Brinkers' Columbia \n     home improvement business. But instead of cashing in on the \n     jobs that will come up as the weather improves, Lynn Brinker \n     is calling customers to cancel thousands of dollars' worth of \n     work.\n       It was less than five months ago that her husband, Sgt. \n     Mark Brinker, an Army reservist with the 400th Military \n     Police Battalion, returned from a year-long, post-Sept. 11 \n     deployment to Fort Sam Houston in Texas. To get through that \n     tour, Lynn Brinker cashed in savings bonds meant for the \n     education of their three children, took out a bank loan and \n     borrowed $15,000 from a relative.\n       Now, mark has been called up again, this time for the \n     impending war in Iraq, and she doesn't know what they're \n     going to do.\n       ``There is just no way we can make ends meet with him gone \n     again,'' she said, ``It's just ridiculous. We're in our \n     forties, we've worked hard, and we didn't expect to have to \n     be starting all over again like this.''\n       As the Pentagon continues to activate reserve and national \n     Guard troops, some of the biggest sacrifices are being made \n     on the home front. In addition to risking their lives, many \n     soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines are risking their \n     livelihoods, leaving civilian jobs that pay much better than \n     the military. Families are selling second cars, canceling \n     vacations and postponing paying bills as they steel \n     themselves for drastic reductions in income.\n       For the reservist on inactive status, the duty can be a \n     welcome source of extra cash. A private with less than two \n     years' experience can pick up $2,849 a year for one weekend a \n     month of drilling and an annual two-week training exercise. A \n     staff sergeant with six years can get $4,628. With a call to \n     active duty, the pay bumps up--$16,282 for a private first \n     class and $26,448 for the staff sergeant, which is tax-free \n     while the military member is in a combat zone.\n       There are other benefits. Mortgage and credit card rates \n     are reduced. In some cases, the law prohibits landlords from \n     evicting military families even if they haven't paid rent. \n     And employers are required to take reservists back once they \n     return from duty, with no loss in pension benefits or \n     seniority.\n       But the package comes nowhere near making up for many \n     civilian salaries.\n       The reservists are volunteers, of course. They have been \n     reminded repeatedly that active duty could come at any time. \n     But many say they signed up for the several thousand a \n     year in extra pay and other perks, not for war.\n       ``I thought I could get some money for school,'' said Spec. \n     Robert Moore of Pasadena, who spent a year on active duty \n     with the Army's 443rd Military Police Company after the Sept. \n     11, 2001, terrorist attacks and was shipped off again last \n     week for training at Fort Lee, Va.--most likely a prelude to \n     deployment overseas. ``I think most people just thought: \n     `We're just the reserves. We're not going anywhere.' ''\n       Sgt. Kevin Green hears similar comments from his Army \n     National Guard troops in the 1229th Transportation Company.\n       ``They don't want a weapon in their hands, riding around in \n     another country, worried that they won't come back,'' he \n     said.\n       As of last week, 168,083 reserve and National Guard troops \n     were on active duty, including thousands from Washington, \n     Maryland and Virginia. They have guarded al Qaeda and Taliban \n     detainees from Afghanistan at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and \n     patrolled Iraq's no-fly zone. Now, area troops are getting \n     ready to set up refugee camps in northern Iraq and to \n     transport equipment to the front lines. In the Maryland \n     National Guard, 3,000 of 8,000 members have been called up \n     since Sept. 11, 2001.\n       ``The military can't conduct a war without the National \n     Guard and reserve components,'' said Maj. Charles Kohler, a \n     spokesman from the Maryland National Guard.\n       Green's unit probably will be placed somewhere in the \n     Middle East, he said. He doesn't yet know where, but it will \n     be a world away from his civilian life, where he has two \n     children and is in charge of Sears deliveries in Maryland. \n     While on active duty, he expects to lost about $1,000 a \n     month, the equivalent of his monthly mortgage payment.\n       Green was called up during the Persian Gulf War, and this \n     time around, he thought he knew how to prepare. But still he \n     was caught somewhat off guard.\n       ``You try to put a few dollars away in case of an \n     emergency,'' he said. ``But this isn't an emergency; this is \n     a crisis.''\n       Now, he's praying for two things: ``I hope we win the \n     lottery, or at least that our car doesn't break down.''\n       His fiancee, Wanda Jones, will have to work overtime at her \n     pharmaceutical company job to help make up the difference. \n     And they've already had a conversation about finances when \n     he's gone.\n       ``I'm going to cut out shopping at the mall,'' she said.\n       Some firms continue to pay troops on active duty, or at \n     least to make up the difference between military and civilian \n     pay. A survey by the Reserve Officers Association of the \n     United States found that of the 154 Fortune 500 corporations \n     that responded to a query, 105 make up the differences in \n     pay. Last year, just 75 of 132 responding companies did so, \n     and in 2001, the number was 53 of 119.\n       Army Reserve Sgt. Jeffery Brooks, a fraud detection manager \n     from Woodbridge, said his company, Capital One, has agreed to \n     pay him the difference. Otherwise, he would be losing 42,200 \n     a month. ``I'd be in real trouble,'' he said.\n       Daniel Ray, editor in chief of bankrate.com, an online \n     financial information service that helps reservists, said \n     many people are not so lucky. ``Those are generous bosses to \n     have,'' Ray said. ``But if you're self-employed, or you've \n     built up your practice over the years, it can be very hard. \n     When you go away, your practice dries up. Then it doesn't \n     just affect you but your secretary and the people who rely on \n     you.''\n       Not everyone takes a financial hit. Army Reserve Lt. \n     Orlando Amaro would make the same amount guarding a POW camp \n     in Iraq as he does as a D.C. police officer patrolling the \n     streets of Columbia Heights. If he is shipped overseas, where \n     his income wouldn't be taxes, he may come out ahead.\n       ``It won't affect me at all,'' he said.\n       Lynn Brinker isn't thinking about coming out ahead. She may \n     sell the Chrysler she and her husband recently bought. She \n     wants desperately to let her 12-year-old son, Chris, continue \n     private viola lessons, and for Kevin, 10, to keep up with the \n     trumpet. She wonders whether she'll be able to afford the \n     registration fees and equipment for youth hockey in the fall.\n       ``My thinking is we'll tap this line of credit and try to \n     keep my kids' lives as normal as possible while their father \n     is away. It's very traumatic for them,'' she said.\n       ``People may say, `Well, he signed up for this. You knew \n     this could happen.' But he was away for an entire year, and \n     then leaves\n\n[[Page S4477]]\n\n     four months later. And now we don't know how long he'll be \n     gone. I don't think he signed up for that.''\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. This Post story captures the reality of reservists who \nare called to war and are asked to make the double sacrifice of \nenormous pay cuts to serve their country.\n  Because of stories like these in my home State, and across the \ncountry, I introduced S. 442, the Reservists and Guardsmen Pay \nProtection Act. This bill would provide a tax credit to employers who \ntake the patriotic step of covering the difference between their \nemployee's pay and as a civilian, and their pay as a soldier. The tax \ncut would cover 50 percent of the amount, and last for 1 year. \nAdditionally, the Senate just passed a budget resolution that calls for \n$350 billion in tax cuts over 10 years. Certainly, we should ensure \nthat there is room in this tax cut to both promote economic growth and \nbenefit the men and women in uniform willing to risk their lives in \ndefense of this great Nation.\n  As the chairman and ranking member know, I have been a strong \nsupporter of Senate Bill 351, the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act. It \ncontains a provision that I introduced as separate legislation relating \nto dependent care benefits for military personnel, and I very much \nappreciate Senator Grassley's and Senator Baucus' effort to include \nthese provisions in the bill.\n  However, I think it would be a terrible mistake to ignore this \nlooming question that affects so many Reservists and Guardsmen, \nespecially after agreeing to $350 billion in tax cuts. S. 442 is both \nstimulative and necessary for the men and women on the front lines, as \nwell as their families back at home. So, I ask my friends, the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, can anything be done to address this problem?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the junior Senator from Louisiana for her \nbringing this important issue to the committee's attention. The \nCongress has an obligation to see to the well being of the men and \nwomen who are defending this Nation even now. For these reasons, the \ncommittee has adopted S. 351, and we would like to pass that \nlegislation immediately. I know it contains provisions of deep interest \nto the Senator from Louisiana, and she would agree that the sooner they \nare enacted the better. However, I share her concern about the need to \ntake whatever steps we can to support our troops and their families. \nFor a variety of reasons, I do not believe that the S. 351 is the \ncorrect vehicle to address this problem. I do recognize that the issue \nappears to have drawn broad support as similar proposals have been \nintroduced by Senators DeWine and Allen. I say to my friend from \nLouisiana, I will work with her and Senators DeWine and Allen on \nincluding the Reservists and Guardsmen Pay Protection Act in the \nreconciliation package that we will bring to the floor soon.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I share the sentiments of Chairman Grassley. I would \nsupport tax treatment for our Guardsmen and Reservists like that \nproposed by Senators Landrieu, DeWine, and Allen. S. 351 is not the \nappropriate venue, but the reconciliation package should achieve the \ngoals of S. 442. The junior Senator from Louisiana is correct that the \n$350 billion tax package should contain both tax cuts to promote growth \nand benefit the quality of life for the men and women in the United \nStates Armed Forces.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I appreciate the chairman's offer and \nthe ranking member's offer, and look forward to working with them to \ninclude this important legislation in the reconciliation bill this \nyear.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, earlier I paid tribute to Senator Daniel \nPatrick Moynihan. There is a provision in the legislation we are \nconsidering which was very near and dear to the heart of Senator \nMoynihan, and that is the expatriation provision contained in this \nbill. It was actually developed by Senator Moynihan and Senator Roth \nseveral years ago. That is the genesis of this provision.\n  As we know, there are many men and women overseas fighting for our \ncountry. For example, there are currently about 300,000 in Iraq. At the \nsame time, there are individuals who attempt to escape their patriotic \nduty. While we have 300,000 men and women over in Iraq, other \nindividuals are attempting to escape their patriotic duty. They \nrelinquish their U.S. citizenship. Why? One basic reason: In order to \navoid supporting the United States through taxes.\n  Between 1991 and 2002, approximately 6,500 U.S. citizens have \nexpatriated; that is, they gave up their U.S. citizenship. In 1966, as \npart of the Foreign Investors Tax Act, Congress created an alternative \ntax regime for U.S. citizens who expatriated in order to avoid paying \ntaxes. The alternative tax regime taxes a former citizen on U.S. \nproperty for 10 years after expatriation.\n  These tax rules were strengthened in 1996 following press reports and \ncongressional hearings indicating that very wealthy individuals \nexpatriated while maintaining significant contacts with the United \nStates.\n  Unfortunately, these changes to the law have not deterred citizens \nfrom expatriating to avoid paying U.S. taxes. The changes simply never \nworked as Congress intended.\n  This year, the Joint Committee on Taxation published a study on \nindividual expatriation. According to the Joint Committee, there is \nvirtually no enforcement of the special tax and immigration rules \napplicable to tax-motivated citizenship relinquishment and residency \ntermination.\n  The Joint Committee also said that present law has been highly \nineffective. Present law continues to provide tax incentives for \nindividuals to expatriate. It also is difficult to collect U.S. taxes \non former citizens who are no longer physically present in the United \nStates.\n  Additionally, a study conducted by the General Accounting Office \nconcluded that the IRS did not have a systematic compliance effort. \nThat means that we are not even enforcing the alternative tax regime \nthat is on the books.\n  That means a former citizen could avoid the alternative tax regime by \nholding foreign assets--which are not taxed. Or by waiting until the \n10-year period expires before disposing of U.S. property.\n  The Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act includes a new system to address \ntax-motivated expatriation. Under this legislation, any U.S. citizen or \nlong-term resident who relinquishes their U.S. citizenship or residency \nwill be subject to an exit tax on the gains attributable to property \nowned during their U.S. citizenship.\n  Under this proposal, if the gain exceeds $600,000, then a former \ncitizen will be taxed on the net unrealized gain on property--as if it \nwere sold at fair market value 1 day prior to expatriation. The \nTreasury Department believes that this new system will greatly improve \nthe administrability of the tax on expatriates. The new system imposes \nthe tax at the time the individual leaves the U.S. jurisdiction.\n  Additionally, by including foreign assets within the regime, this \neliminates a significant incentive for tax-motivated expatriation.\n  This expatriation provision will raise $700 million. The military \nbill uses that $700 million to provide tax benefits to military \npersonnel.\n  In contrast, the House version of the military bill is simply a \nmodification of the current alternative tax regime. It raises $328 \nmillion. The House version will not go far enough. It simply adds more \nprovisions for the IRS to enforce. This strikes me as odd considering \nnone of the current provisions is being enforced.\n  Sometimes the laws just do not work the way Congress intended. So, we \nmust change the laws to ensure they are effective and administered as \nCongress intended.\n  The current system to tax expatriates does not work. We have had \nnearly 40 years to make the system work. We should not wait any longer \nto collect taxes on those who do not value the freedoms our nation \nprovides.\n  The new proposal does not seek to tax expatriates on income earned \nafter expatriation. It just says they have to\n\n[[Page S4478]]\n\npay tax on the income earned while they were a U.S. citizen. While our \nmilitary protected them.\n  I thank former Senator Bill Roth and the late Senator Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan, who developed this proposal several years ago. And I thank \nSenator Harkin and others who have continued to work on this in the \n107th Congress and this year.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 433\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n  On behalf of Senator Grassley and myself, I call up amendment \nnumbered 433.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], for Mr. Grassley, \n     and Mr. Baucus, proposes an amendment numbered 433.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is in today's Record under ``Text of the Amendment.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support for this piece of \nlegislation. I compliment my long-time friend, the Senator from \nMontana, for his work. We have enjoyed many projects together over the \nquarter of a century, and our distinguished Senator Grassley has taken \na strong hand, as always, on matters regarding revenue and also the \nArmed Forces of the United States.\n  If I had named this bill, I would have called it the Armed Forces \nFamily Tax Fairness Act of 2003 because as I have studied this \nlegislation and made some contribution to the text of it, I have always \nhad in mind the families of the men and women of the Armed Forces and \nothers who serve in the cause of freedom for our citizenry the world \nover, who take enormous risks and, frankly, accept the hardships which \nfor those who would lead sort of a normal life are hard to understand.\n  Traveling about the world, most recently with Senators Levin and \nRockefeller and my colleague from Kansas, covering that area in \nPakistan and Qatar, Kuwait, we saw firsthand the brave men and women \nnot only in uniform but the agency staff and others who hopefully will \nbenefit from this legislation.\n  I compliment my two colleagues on their timely action in extending \nthese tax benefits to military and Foreign Service personnel and to the \nfamilies of the Space Shuttle Columbia astronauts.\n  At this historic moment in history, with Operation Iraqi Freedom in \nprogress, it is fitting we take every opportunity to express \nappreciation we have for our men and women in uniform. Certainly one \nway to do that is to place a priority on legislation enhancing the \ncompensation of Active-Duty, Reserve, and National Guard personnel, and \ntheir families.\n\n  In the Armed Services Committee, we also are engaged in such an \neffort and we do it annually. I assure my colleagues that in connection \nwith the fiscal year 2004 Defense Authorization Act, we do our utmost \nto make sure every aspect of pay and benefits is closely examined.\n  With respect to the legislation before the Senate, I am particularly \npleased to support the provision of capital gains relief to military \nhomeowners in connection with the sale of their residence. This relief, \nwhich recognizes realities of military service, is long overdue.\n  Senator McCain introduced legislation last year, S. 1678, and I was \nhappy to be a cosponsor and sought to achieve this purpose with him and \nothers. I also view as particularly timely and well justified the \nprovisions that are above-the-line tax deductions to Reserve and \nNational Guard personnel who incur out-of-pocket expenses as a result \nof training operations and those benefiting the families of the Space \nShuttle Columbia heroes.\n  It is fitting as hundreds of thousands of our military personnel--and \nmany are engaged not only in the battle in Iraq but Afghanistan, which \nour group recently visited, and other trouble spots of the world--that \nthe Senate recognize their contributions to freedom and the sacrifices \nthey and their families make.\n  There are roughly 290 million citizens in this country. There are on \nactive duty today about 1.5 to 1.6 million individuals. The normal \nstanding force of the active forces of the United States runs about 1.2 \nto 1.3 million. Now with the augmentation of so many being called in \nthe Reserve and the Guard to active duty, that is somewhat larger. \nHowever, that group represents only one half of 1 percent, roughly, of \nthe population of 290 million citizens in this country.\n  We should always be mindful that so many are on active duty, \nparticularly those engaged in armed combat, those who are on the \ntelevision screens 24 hours a day now, assuming these courageous roles \nthey are taking in combined forces, trying to free the Iraqi people of \nthe bondage of these many years and to remove the weapons of mass \ndestruction which threaten the very Members who occupy this Chamber \nfrom time to time. If those mass weapons spread throughout the world \nthrough the net of terrorism, small quantities of biological and other \ntypes of weapons of mass destruction could reach our shores and, \nindeed, inflict enormous harm against our people.\n\n  This is a very small group, less than \\1/2\\ percent, who take these \nrisks to preserve the freedoms and give us a greater sense of security \nhere at home.\n  I hope this bill receives 100 votes. I thank those who made it \npossible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield whatever time the Senator from \nArkansas desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nfor up to 5 minutes on the pending bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, in these halls we often talk about the need \nto provide our military personnel with the resources they need to \ncomplete their missions. We all acknowledge how unique and important \nour military personnel and their needs are to us.\n  It is our responsibility to have a comprehensive picture to know what \nwe need to do to make life better for our men and women in uniform. By \nthat I mean not only salary but that we need to understand their health \ncare needs, their housing needs, pension needs, education needs, \ndisability and employment benefits. It is very important, as we work in \nIraq and around the world and as we keep America safe, that we, as \nCongress, have this important information.\n  Not long ago, I was in a hearing of the Armed Services Committee, of \nwhich I am a member, and we began discussing the home mortgage \ndeduction. One thing I realized was the home mortgage deduction is a \nvery important part of America's financial picture, but also it is an \nimportant cornerstone to the American way of life.\n  As I thought about the home mortgage deduction for military \npersonnel, I realized that the Tax Code is cumbersome and complicated. \nI could not find one place, one document, that laid out all the \nprovisions in the Tax Code designed to benefit our military personnel.\n  And on comes the military tax bill, this very important piece of \nlegislation. I commend Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus for all \ntheir hard work on this bill. But I looked, and I saw a maze of Tax \nCode provisions, mainly for short-term solutions. Those are important, \nthere is no question about it. But still, I could not find a \ncomprehensive view of tax treatment for our Armed Forces.\n  So what I am proposing is very simple and very clear; that is, I \nwould like to ask the GAO and the Departments of Defense and Treasury \nto provide us with a comprehensive study of the tax treatment of U.S. \nmilitary personnel, along with a complete study of the financial \nconditions of our troops. And I would request they make recommendations \non whether the Tax Code could be used to improve the unique financial \nconditions of our troops.\n  This powerful information will help this Congress, help this \nadministration, and also help our men and women in uniform. This one \ndocument could be a very powerful tool for us to help our men and women \nin uniform.\n  However, at this juncture, I do not want to slow down, in any way, \nthis\n\n[[Page S4479]]\n\nvery important bill on which Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus have \nspent so much time. I support their efforts to move this bill through \nquickly. We all understand how important that is.\n  Therefore, I am not asking that my amendment be adopted. But what I \nam asking, very respectfully, is that Senators Grassley and Baucus join \nme in a letter asking the GAO to do what our amendment otherwise would \naccomplish. I thank them for their hard work, and I thank them for \ntheir leadership on these very important issues, issues the American \npeople are very concerned with, and issues on which they have shown \ngreat leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, that is a very important statement and \nrequest that the Senator from Arkansas has made. I can speak on behalf \nof myself, and I am sure Senator Grassley, that we would be more than \nhonored to join with the Senator from Arkansas in making that request. \nIt is a very timely request. It is one that is very important. Frankly, \nI am a little bit surprised none of us made that same request that he \nhas made because it is so important, and it is going to give us a lot \nbetter idea of the financial condition of our armed services. It is a \ngood idea.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  I associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from Montana. I \nshare Senator Pryor's interest in a GAO study and will be glad to work \nwith him on a letter. And, obviously, a person such as I, who relies \nupon the GAO for so much study on matters in which I am involved, would \nnot discourage my colleague from likewise seeking the General \nAccounting Office's expertise and look forward to what such a study \nwould show in regard to the treatment of our military personnel.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, when the space program began in 1959 there \nwere only seven astronauts in the entire country. They all were or had \nbeen in the Armed Forces.\n  That was only 44 years ago and since then, much has changed. Today, \nastronauts are comprised of Americans from every race, creed, color and \ngender.\n  While many still come from the military, the astronaut corps now \nincludes civilian doctors, scientists, and engineers. They are our best \nand our brightest. They risk their lives to advance our knowledge and \nunderstanding of the world.\n  On February 1, 2003, seven men and women aboard the space shuttle \nColumbia lost their lives. LTC Michael P. Anderson, U.S. Navy CAPT \nDavid Brown, U.S. Navy CDR Laurel Clark, Dr. Kalpana Chawla, U.S. Air \nForce COL Rick Husband, Naval CDR William McCool, and Israeli Air Force \nCOL Ilan Ramon will be remembered forever.\n  Five of the six Columbia crew members, from the United States, had \nmilitary backgrounds. They were national heroes who are deeply missed \nby their family and friends. Through their dedication to space \nexploration, they lived their lives to the fullest and made long \nlasting contributions.\n  In honor of their sacrifice, I along with 13 of my Senate colleagues, \nintroduced S. 298, the Assistance for Families of Space Shuttle \nColumbia Heroes Act.\n  I am pleased that the legislation was included by the Senate Finance \nCommittee as part of the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act of 2003.\n  Under the legislation, the families of the Columbia heroes would \nreceive the same benefits as families of military personnel who die in \nthe line of duty.\n  The provisions are similar to legislation passed in 2001 that \nprovided relief to victims of the September 11, anthrax and the \nOklahoma City attacks.\n  Specifically, the bill expands the class of those eligible for these \nbenefits to include astronauts killed in the line of duty.\n  The legislation provides income tax relief. Current law generally \nexcludes from tax income received in the year of death or in a previous \nyear for soldiers killed in combat zones, and victims of September 11, \nanthrax and Oklahoma City.\n  The legislation expands this benefit to apply to astronauts who die \nin the line of duty.\n  The legislation provides death benefit relief. Current law excludes \nfrom income any death benefit paid by the U.S. Government to a soldier \nkilled in a combat zone or paid by an employer to the families of the \nvictims of September 11, the anthrax attacks, or the Oklahoma City \nbombing.\n  The legislation expands this benefit to apply to death benefits paid \nto the families of astronauts killed in the line of duty.\n  The legislation provides for estate tax relief. Current law provides \nestate tax relief that effectively lowers the estate tax rate to 20 \npercent for the estates of soldiers killed in combat zones, the victims \nof September 11, the anthrax attacks or the Oklahoma City bombing.\n  The legislation expands this benefit to apply to the estates of any \nastronaut killed in the line of duty.\n  The best way to honor Columbia's fallen heroes is to promptly pass \nthis legislation and pledge that the goals and missions of NASA will \nlive on in the years to come.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act of \n2003 which includes tax relief for the families of the Space Shuttle \nColumbia heroes.\n  Mr. President, since September 11, significant progress has been made \nto disrupt and dismantle the financial components of terrorist \norganizations.\n  Special agents from the IRS and other law enforcement agencies have \nsuccessfully investigated numerous terrorist related entities--\nincluding tax exempt organizations that have engaged in terrorist \nfundraising.\n  The Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act of 2003 contains a provision that \nwould suspend the tax-exempt status of any organization designated by \nU.S. authorities as a terrorist organization or supporter of terrorism.\n  There is no procedure under present law for the IRS to suspend the \ntax-exempt status of an organization.\n  The IRS can revoke an organization's tax-exempt status only after \nconducting an examination of the organization.\n  Even then, the IRS must issue a letter proposing revocation and allow \nthe organization to exhaust its administrative appeals rights.\n  The provision in this legislation is simply common sense. It is an \nimportant weapon in our war on terrorist financing.\n  An organization that has been designated by the Federal Government as \na terrorist organization should not be exempt from Federal income tax. \nMoreover, contributions to such organizations should not be tax \ndeductible.\n  Once the Federal Government determines that an entity is a terrorist \norganization pursuant to certain authority--for example, the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act--a separate investigation \nby the IRS is not necessary.\n  Further, because a terrorist organization may challenge the Federal \ngovernment's designation under the law authorizing the designation, \nrecourse to the declaratory judgment procedures of the Tax Code is not \nappropriate.\n  If a tax-exempt organization's suspension is determined to be \nerroneous, the provision would allow tax refunds for any overpayments.\n  Lastly, the IRS will be required to update its listings of tax-exempt \norganizations to take into account organizations that have had their \nexemption suspended. This will give notice to taxpayers that \ncontributions to these organizations are no longer deductible.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act of \n2003.\n  Mr. President, this bill includes many important changes in the tax \ntreatment of income and benefits received by members of our armed \nforces. One provision is particularly important for members that face \nthe dual challenge of serving their nation while raising a family. The \nbill explicitly states that child care subsidies that members of the \nmilitary receive shall not be subject to income tax.\n  In 1986, we passed a law which stated that military benefits should \nnot be included in income for tax purposes. The statute lists a number \nof benefits received by members of the military--\n\n[[Page S4480]]\n\nhousing allowances, medical benefits, education assistance, and many \nothers. But child care subsidies do not appear on the list.\n  When we passed this law, the Department of Defense did have a program \nto assist members of the military in caring for their children. But the \nimportance of this program has increased as the demographics of the \nmembers of the military have changed.\n  There was a time when our forces were primarily young single men. \nHowever, times have changed. Twelve percent of the forces are women. \nOver half of the active duty members are married. Two-thirds of \nmilitary spouses work outside the home. Six percent of members are \nmarried to another member of the military. And 6 percent are single \nparents.\n  Young single soldiers are no longer the norm. Recognizing these \nchanges, the Department of Defense has placed a reinforced importance \non assisting military families.\n  The Department of Defense recognizes the additional challenges faced \nby military families as they raise children. The average military \nfamily moves every two and a half years, making it difficult for them \nto find quality child care, or friends and neighbors to look to for \nhelp with child care responsibilities. And with work schedules that are \noften long and unpredictable, help is often necessary. In addition, \nmembers of the military face the possibility of deployment anywhere in \nthe world at any time.\n  They now operate over 800 child care centers in the U.S. and abroad. \nThese include child development centers for young children, after-\nschool centers for older children, and other family care programs. They \nprovide night and weekend services as well, to accommodate the often \nhectic schedules that military families face. All in all, these \nprograms provide care for over 200,000 children every day.\n  The cost of these programs varies depending on the income of the \nparents--on average, it is about $7,700 per child. This cost is shared \nby the military parents and the government, with each paying about half \nthe cost.\n  The law is unclear about whether these benefits are subject to income \ntax. A provision in this bill ends that confusion. It states that these \nchild care subsidies, shall not be included in income, for tax \npurposes.\n  As the demographics of the members of the military have changed, so \nhas the policy of the Department of Defense. Now it is time that we \nfollow with these changes to the tax code.\n  I compliment Senator Landrieu of Louisiana, who developed this \nproposal, and insisted on its inclusion in this military tax bill.\n  It is one more reason the Senate should pass this legislation today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all time is yielded \nback, amendment No. 433 is agreed to, and the clerk will read the bill, \nas amended, for the third time.\n  The amendment (No. 433) was agreed to.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read the \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Finance \nCommittee has moved the important provisions of this bill to the Senate \nfloor and I urge that the bill be passed.\n  The current Tax Code does not adequately deal with the special \ncircumstances that some in our military face. One of the most important \nprovisions, in my view, is providing for an above-the-line deduction \nfor overnight travel expenses of National Guard and Reserve members.\n  I have taken a personal interest in a provision included in this \nmeasure that provides that descendants of current or former active \nmilitary personnel may be members of veterans organizations. Without \nthis provision, many local veteran posts which operate food operations \nwill find themselves having to pay unrelated business income taxes as \nthe portion of service to members falls. A large share of the local \nposts in Iowa are very small operations and this would be a real \nburden. I introduced legislation in the last Congress and this one \nwhich has been included in the bill and I appreciate the inclusion of \nthis provision.\n  Lastly, I want to discuss the inclusion of a provision that will \neffectively prevent very rich individuals from reducing their taxes by \nrenouncing their U.S. citizenship. I cannot stress too strongly how \ndisgusting I find this group's behavior. Their number is small, but \ntheir cost to the Treasury is significant. The Joint Tax Committee has \nestimated the savings of this provision at $700 million over 10 years.\n  Back in 1996, I became very interested in this issue and introduced \nlegislation on the subject. Senator Monynihan took the lead in the \nSenate and we passed solid legislation at that time. Unfortunately, the \nHouse resisted the provision and successfully proposed a mechanism \nwhich has proven to be grossly inadequate.\n  The Joint Tax Committee staff issued an extensive report on this \nissue earlier this year with considerable cooperation from the GAO and \nthe Treasury. The report found that ``there is little or no enforcement \nof the special tax and immigration rules applicable to tax-motivated \ncitizenship relinquishment and residency termination.'' It went to say, \n``The Joint Committee staff believes that a key reason for inadequate \nenforcement of the alternative tax regime is the inability to obtain \nnecessary information from individuals.'' With appendices, the report \nis over 500 pages in length. But it comes down to a simple point: A \nsmall number of people continue to evade U.S. income taxes by turning \ntheir back on our country because of the weakness of the 1996 \nprovisions. That should stop today.\n  In both this Congress and the last, I introduced legislation with \nSenator Stabenow to effectively prevent very rich individuals from \nreducing their taxes by renouncing their U.S. citizenship. It is a \ncompanion to a measure introduced by Congressman Charles Rangel in \n2002. The Joint Tax Committee now estimates that it saves $700 million. \nThe savings to the Treasury are important and the reality that people \nare able to save on their fair share of taxes by turning their back on \nour country is in some ways even more important. I call them Benedict \nArnold.\n  Under current law, for 10 years after a U.S. citizen renounces his or \nher citizenship with a principal purpose of avoiding U.S. taxes, the \nperson is taxed at the rates that would have applied had he or she \nremained a citizen. In reality, the tax is nominally on a broader based \nof income and on more types of transactions. In addition, if the \nexpatriate dies within 10 years of the expatriation, more types of \nassets are included in his or her estate. Unfortunately, the reality is \nthat taxes are very often not paid.\n  Once a person has expatriated and removed U.S. assets from U.S. \njurisdictions, as the Joint Tax Committee report notes, it is extremely \ndifficult to enforce the current rules, particularly for an entire \ndecade after the citizenship is renounced. The measure I introduced \nsimply provides that the very act of renouncing one's citizenship \ntriggers the recognition of tax. So, rather than collecting tax every \ntime an asset is sold over the next decade, my bill treats all of the \nassets of an expatriate as having been sold the day prior to when the \nperson renounces their citizenship. The taxes are due up front rather \nthan over time. In regard to estate taxes, rather than attempting to \ncollect the tax from the estate of an expatriate not in U.S. \njurisdiction, my measure taxes the inheritance of an heir who remain in \nthe U.S. in such a way as to remove any tax benefit from the \nrenouncement of citizenship.\n  Revenue of $700 million from these very few former citizens is a \nsignificant amount of money that must be made up by loyal Americans in \nthe form of higher debt or taxes that Americans will face. Last year, \nthe Senate passed this measure as a part of the Armed Forces Tax \nFairness Act but, unfortunately, the House opposed this provision.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate will strongly resist any effort to \nweaken these provisions in any way. This is a matter where the Senate \nshould insist that the loopholes be completely closed. It is an area \nwhere lobbyists for the Benedict Arnolds should have no success in \ntheir efforts to escape their tax obligations.\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I offer my strong support for the \nArmed Forces Tax Fairness Act and am proud to be a cosponsor of the \noriginal bill.\n\n[[Page S4481]]\n\nThis legislation, among other measures, will remedy several provisions \nin the Tax Code that needlessly penalize the members of our Armed \nForces.\n  The act eliminates taxes on military death gratuities. It allows \nservice members to benefit from the sale of a home as civilian \ntaxpayers now do by exempting up to $250,000 of the revenue from the \nsale of a principal residence even if the owner is away on active duty. \nIt excludes amounts received under the military housing assistance \nprogram. It expands combat zone filing rules to include contingency \noperations. And it takes other sound steps that will benefit Americans \nwho have chosen to serve their country so admirably in our armed \nservices. There is also a provision to assist the families of \nastronauts lost in the tragic crash of the Space Shuttle Columbia.\n  As a veteran, I hold the dedication and commitment of our military \npersonnel in especially high regard. They are putting their time, \ntalent, energy and, often, their very lives on the line for our Nation. \nFor that, I thank them and am proud to support this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nmilitary tax bill that is currently pending before the Senate.\n  First, I would like to commend Senator Grassley, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, and Senator Baucus, the committee's ranking \nDemocrat, for their leadership in bringing this legislation to this \npoint. Although this bill has a great deal of support in the Senate and \nin the House, it has not been an easy process to get it enacted, as the \nSenate and House each have different versions of the bill. In fact, \nthis legislation was passed in the Senate and in the House last fall in \nthe final days of the 107th Congress. Unfortunately, Congress adjourned \nbefore the differences in the bills could be worked out.\n  As we debate this bill today, hundreds of thousands of our military \nmen and women are in harm's way in Iraq, including 3,000 National \nGuardsmen and reservists from Utah who have been called into active \nservice. These brave individuals are selflessly risking their lives for \ntheir country. Most, if not all, of these people are also making big \nfinancial sacrifices to serve in the military. While this bill will not \ncome close to compensating our service people for these financial \nsacrifices, it will bring some basic fairness to their tax lives.\n  The tax provisions in this bill are targeted and modest. They are \nalso very much needed. I urge my colleagues to quickly join me in \nsupporting this bill, and I hope the House will join with us in working \nout the differences in the two versions of this legislation so that \nthese modest relief measures can be quickly sent to the President and \nsigned into law.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, our Nation has always risen to the \nchallenges of war. During such times, Congress has spared no expense to \nmake sure that our dedicated armed services personnel have everything \nthey need to fight and win. We will always meet this obligation.\n  But the men and women on the battlefield have families back home and \nthere is more that we can do for them. I am talking about the families \nof the troops from Barksdale, Belle Chasse, and Fort Polk in Louisiana, \nas well as our guardsmen from all across the State. Every one of my \ncolleagues represents military families. We need to make sure that we \nsupport them as well.\n  That is why today I would like to add my voice of strong support for \nthe Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act of 2003. I congratulate Senator \nGrassley, the Finance Committee chairman, and Senator Baucus, the \nranking member, for bringing this bill to the floor today. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.\n  This bill contains several provisions that would reduce taxes for \nmembers of our armed services. The bill would clarify that childcare \nbenefits provided to military personnel are to be excluded from income, \na provision based on legislation that I introduced earlier in this \nCongress, S. 235. In addition, the bill excludes all death gratuity \npayments from the income of surviving family members. Military and \nForeign Service personnel would receive capital gains tax relief when \nthey have to sell a home and move because of reassignment or deployment \norders. National Guard and Reserve members would receive an above-the-\nline deduction for overnight expenses when they travel more than 100 \nmiles from home to attend National Guard and Reserve meetings. There \nare other important provisions in this bill that give needed tax relief \nto our families.\n  I had hoped to include language in this bill to give a much-needed \ntax break to the employers for Reserve personnel. When a reservist gets \ncalled up, as many have, to go fight in Iraq, employers have to keep \nhis or her job open, but do not have to pay a salary to the reservist \nwhile they are gone. This can cause an extreme hardship on a \nreservist's family. While the reservist receives military pay, in many \ncases this is much less than their civilian pay. Some employers, but \nnot all, will pay the difference between the civilian and military pay, \nbut they do not receive any benefit for this act of patriotism. I \nintroduced S. 442, the Reservist and Guardsmen Pay Protection Act, to \ngive a 50 percent tax credit to these patriotic employers.\n  I regret that we were not able to include my bill in the Armed Forces \nTax Fairness Act. But I deeply appreciate the chairman and ranking \nmember for their commitment to address my tax credit proposal in the \nfuture reconciliation package. I look forward to working with them.\n  Again our men and women in the Armed Forces and their families \ndeserve our support. For all these reasons and more, this legislation \ndeserves to pass. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nbill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nthe Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act of 2003, H.R. 1307. This important \nlegislation provides Congress with the opportunity to demonstrate our \nfirm resolve to support the men and women who sacrifice so much in the \nservice of our country. I applaud Chairman Grassley's and ranking \nmember Baucus' efforts, and those of my colleagues who have worked so \nhard on these initiatives, in some cases, for many years. I want to \nparticularly thank Senator DeWine for his stalwart leadership on the \nabove-the-line deduction for expenses incurred by our National Guard \nand Reserve service members who have to travel great distances for \ntheir duty and training.\n  This long overdue tax benefit for our true citizen-soldiers is even \nmore important today considering these facts: During each of the past 5 \nyears, Reserve and National Guard service members have performed \nbetween 12 and 13.5 million duty days in support of the Active Force. \nThese numbers are in a direct contrast to 1990, when 1 million duty \ndays were performed at a time when there were 25 percent more \nreservists.\n  Reservists and National Guardsmen currently comprise more than half \nof the airlift crews and 85 percent of the sealift personnel that are \nneeded to move troops and equipment in either wartime or peacetime \noperations. In addition, Reserve medical and construction battalions \nand other specialists are critical to a wide range of operations. \nEfforts by the Reserve components to move beyond a traditional wartime \nbackup role and to provide peacetime support to active units are thus \ndesirable. The Naval Reserve and Air Force Reserve components have made \nparticularly impressive progress in this area.\n  The Reserve components are performing many vital tasks: From direct \ninvolvement in military operations to liberate Iraq in the air, on the \nground, and on the sea; to guarding nuclear power plants in the United \nStates; to providing support to the war on terrorism through guarding, \ninterrogating, and providing medical service to detainees in Guantanamo \nBay Cuba; to rebuilding schools in hurricane-stricken Honduras and \nfighting fires in our Western States; to overseeing civil affairs in \nBosnia; to augmenting aircraft carriers short on Active-Duty sailors \nwith critical skilled enlisted ratings during at-sea exercises as well \nas periods of deployment.\n  I believe that the civilian and uniformed leadership of our Armed \nForces and the Congress must recognize this involvement. At a minimum, \nCongress must provide equality in benefits for Reserve component \nservice members\n\n[[Page S4482]]\n\nwhen they put on the uniform and perform their weekend drills or other \ncritical training evolutions. Quality of life is not just an Active-\nDuty obligation that Congress must provide. Reservists, on duty, who \nresemble their Active-Duty counterparts during training evolutions and \nare deployed at times around the world, should be treated equally when \nthe administration and Congress provide for quality of life benefits.\n  I would like to take a moment to discuss a provision in the bill that \nI have personally worked on for some time. Section 101 would allow \nmembers of the uniformed services, as well as State Department \npersonnel who are away on extended duty overseas, to qualify for the \nsame tax relief on the profit generated when they sell their main \nresidence as other Americans. I am pleased to announce that Secretary \nof State Colin Powell fully supports this legislation, and this \nlegislation enjoys overwhelming support by the senior uniformed \nleadership, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as the Office of \nManagement and Budget Director Mitch Daniels, the 31-member \nassociations of the Military Coalition representing 5.5 million \nveterans, the American Foreign Service Association, and the American \nBar Association.\n  The average American participates in our country's growth through \nhome ownership. Appreciation in the value of a home allows everyday \nAmericans to participate in our country's prosperity. Fortunately, the \nTaxpayer Relief Act of 1997 recognized this and provided this break to \nlessen the amount of tax most Americans will pay on the profit they \nmake when they sell their homes. Unfortunately, the 1997 home sale \nprovision unintentionally discourages home ownership among members of \nthe Uniformed and Foreign Services.\n  Under the 1997 Act the taxpayer must meet two requirements to qualify \nfor this tax relief. The taxpayer must: (1) own the home for at least 2 \nof the 5 years preceding the sale, and (2) live in the home as their \nmain home for at least 2 years of the last 5 years. The second part of \nthis eligibility test unintentionally and unfairly prohibits many of \nthe women and men who serve this country overseas from qualifying for \nthis beneficial tax relief.\n  Constant travel across the United States and abroad is inherent in \nthe uniformed and foreign services. Nonetheless, some members of these \nservices choose to purchase a home in our communities, even though they \nwill not live there much of the time. Under current law, if they do not \nhave a spouse who resides in the house during their absence, they will \nnot qualify for the full benefit of the home sales provision, because \nno one ``lives'' in the home for the required period of time. The law \nis prejudiced against families that serve our Nation abroad. They would \nnot qualify for the home sales exclusion because neither spouse \n``lives'' in the house for enough time to qualify for the exclusion.\n  Section 101 simply remedies this inequality in there 1997 law. It \namends the Internal Revenue Code so that members of the uniformed and \nforeign services will be considered to be using their house as their \nmain residence for any period that they are assigned overseas in the \nexecution of their duties. In short, they will be deemed to be using \ntheir house as their main home, even if they are stationed in Bosnia, \nthe Persian Gulf, in the ``no man's land,'' commonly called the DMZ \nbetween North and South Korea, or anywhere else they are assigned.\n  With Operation Iraqi Freedom, the global war on terrorism, and \ncontinuing operations in Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Kosovo, our Armed \nForces are deployed to an unprecedented number of locations. They are \naway from their primary homes, protecting and furthering the freedoms \nwe Americans hold so dear. It is wrong to penalize them for doing their \nduty. Military service entails sacrifice. We must do all that we can to \nensure that Congress is not adding to the burdens service men and women \nbear with an unfair Tax Code. This narrowly tailored remedy will grant \nequal tax relief to the members of our uniformed and foreign services, \nand restore fairness and consistency to our increasingly complex Tax \nCode.\n  This military tax package is a clear show of support for our men and \nwomen in uniform. It is the right thing to do, and I hope that all my \ncolleagues will support this critical measure.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Armed Forces \nTax Fairness Act, S. 351.\n  Whether we are at war, as is currently the case, or at peace, members \nof the armed services should not be treated unfairly by the Tax Code as \na result of their decision to serve our county.\n  Inequities in the Tax Code that disadvantage men and women in uniform \nnot only make it harder for them to support their families and \nthemselves, but also threaten our own security by making it harder for \nthe armed services to recruit talented service men and women.\n  We have a responsibility to eliminate any disincentives to serving in \nthe United States military, and this bill does much to fulfill that \ngoal.\n  The two most important provisions in this bill are relaxed rules on \nthe treatment of capital gains on the sale of a home by military \npersonnel, and an above-the-line deduction on travel expenses for \nmembers of the National Guard and Reserve.\n  Anyone who has ever served in the military or grown up in a military \nfamily knows that frequent travel is a way of life for those in \nuniform. A U.S. Marine might spend a year or two at Camp Pendleton, in \nmy home State of California, then transfer to Quantico, and finally end \nup at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina.\n  Under current law, that Marine might not qualify for the home sale \ncapital gains exclusion available to most homeowners, due to his or her \nfrequent postings to different bases, or to combat duty abroad. This \nbill corrects that inequity, and makes it easier for all military \npersonnel to sell their home tax free.\n  National Guard and Reserve members would also benefit under the bill \nfrom an above-the-line deduction for travel expenses up to $1,500. This \nputs those who serve on the National Guard and Reserve on equal footing \nwith those who travel on company business and do not pay for those \nexpenses out of after-tax income.\n  No one who chooses to serve in the Guard or Reserve should have to \npay for a plane ticket or hotel room out of their after-tax income in \norder to join their unit when called up for duty.\n  This bill also contains a number of smaller, but no less important, \nprovisions designed to ease the tax burden on military personnel, such \nas the treatment of service academy appointments as scholarships when \npersonnel apply to tuition programs and Coverdell Education Savings \nAccounts.\n  I wish we could do more in the Senate to keep our soldiers, pilots, \nand sailors out of harm's way during the current conflict in Iraq. I \nwish we could pass a bill that guarantees that each and every one of \nthem returns home safely to their husbands, wives, children, and \nparents.\n  We cannot do that. But by passing this bill we can improve their \nfinancial security and make it easier for them to continue to serve and \nto protect our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Armed \nForces Tax Fairness Act substitute offered by Senator Grassley. This \nlegislation is a critical step towards full tax fairness for our \nmilitary personnel and Foreign Service officers.\n  The American people and Congress stand with our men and women in \nuniform, and this is the right time to advance tax parity.\n  Last Congress, I was proud to cosponsor the Foreign and Armed \nServices Tax Fairness Act of 2002, which included many of the \nprovisions that we are passing today. I was pleased to cosponsor the \nbill again this Congress when it was reintroduced.\n  This legislation will bring some commonsense changes to the way \nmilitary and Foreign Service families are treated under the Tax Code. \nIt will allow military and Foreign Service families to exclude up to \nhalf a million dollars in capital gains from home sales; make death \ngratuity benefits tax exempt; exclude compensation from the Homeowners \nAssistance Program; provide a deduction for the National Guard's \nunreimbursed travel expenses; clarify that dependent care assistance \nfor military families is exempt from taxation; and support education \nindividual retirement accounts for students at service academies.\n\n[[Page S4483]]\n\n  The legislation also extends these benefits to the families of the \nvictims of the space shuttle Columbia tragedy. The Columbia provisions \naddress many of the goals in the Assistance for Families of Space \nShuttle Columbia Heroes Act, which I cosponsored with Senator Baucus.\n  Finally, I would like to emphasize a crucial provision addressing IRS \ntreatment of terrorist organizations. Currently, when the United States \ndesignates an entity a terrorist organization, there is a long delay \nbefore the IRS revokes its tax-exempt status. There is no reason to \npostpone the action, but it takes time to update these lists. This bill \nwill automatically suspend the tax-exempt status of designated \nterrorist organizations, expediting the consequences of the \ndesignation. Last Congress, Senators Grassley and Johnson introduced \nbills with this practical remedy, but we have yet to pass it into law. \nThe House version of the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act does not contain \nthis language, but I will work with my colleagues in both bodies to \nensure that when we send this bill to the President, this important \nprovision is included.\n  Mr. President, the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act supports our men and \nwomen in uniform during these trying times. I urge my colleagues to \ngive it their full support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today with great pride to \nsupport the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act. As I speak, America's \nmilitary is fighting in the dangerous and inhospitable deserts of Iraq. \nAnd when I watch the remarkable news coverage of the progress in Iraq, \nI am awed by the skills, dedication, and courage of our fighting \nforces. Passing this legislation is the least that we can do to show \nthose brave men and women that we support them, we are proud of them, \nand their nation is grateful for their sacrifice.\n  This Congress ought not to pretend that the bill we are considering \nis some altruistic gift to the men and women serving our country in the \nmilitary. Rather, today we will pass legislation that restores basic \nfairness to the tax code. We demand extraordinary sacrifices of our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. They are often stationed far \naway from their families. They are frequently uprooted and forced to \nsell their homes on short notice. And in a military increasingly \ndependent on the National Guard and Reserves, we ask some of our vital \ntroops to travel great distances at their own expense to train with \ntheir units.\n  Often the burden of these sacrifices is increased by the \ninflexibility of the Tax Code. For example, a serviceman stationed in \nSaudi Arabia obviously cannot meet the residency requirements \nassociated with the capital gains tax exclusion for his house in the \nStates. It is spectacularly unfair for us to send a soldier away from \nhis home, and then punish him with increased taxes if he decides to \nsell that home. The bill we will pass today rectifies this problem by \nsuspending the residency requirements for military personnel that are \naway from home on active duty assignment.\n  This bill also ensures that the full death gratuity payment made to \nthe survivors of military personnel killed on duty will be exempt from \nincome tax. The death benefits paid to survivors are intended to cover \nfuneral costs and immediate expenses while the family gets back on its \nfeet. The current death benefit is not large; it is $6,000. \nInexcusably, half of that benefit is subject to income tax. This \nlegislation excludes the full value of the death benefit from tax. To \nsay that the survivors of those recently killed in Iraq deserve to \nreceive the entire death benefit, tax-free, is an extraordinary \nunderstatement.\n  One of the most important provisions of this bill is the above-the-\nline-deduction for overnight travel expenses for members of the \nNational Guard and Reserves. Many of these troops travel more than 100 \nmiles to serve with their units. They have to pay the costs of \ntraveling to their base; and many of them also have to pay for their \nmeals and lodging while away from home. Under current law, these \nexpenses can be deducted from income only if the individual itemizes \ndeductions on his or her tax return. This onerous requirement prevents \nmany eligible individuals from taking advantage of the deduction.\n  The bill we will pass today ensures that the expenses associated with \novernight travel to attend National Guard and Reserve meetings can be \ndeducted even if a person does not itemize deductions. This provision \nis expected to save National Guardsmen and reservists more than $800 \nmillion over the next 10 years. We have seen how valiantly these \nmembers of our Armed Forces are serving--leaving their homes, families, \nand regular jobs, to serve in Iraq, Afghanistan, or wherever their \nCommander in Chief sends them. It is the least we can do to minimize \nthe financial burden this service places on them and their families.\n  I have highlighted just a few of the important provisions of this \nbill. Let me speak for a moment about how important this legislation \nwill be for my own State of West Virginia. West Virginians have a proud \ntradition of serving in the military. Tens of thousands of West \nVirginians are serving on Active Duty in our Army, Navy, Air Force, and \nMarine Corps. More than 3,000 West Virginia members of the National \nGuard and Reserves have been activated. I am pleased to be able to \nsupport legislation that recognizes their sacrifices and rewards their \nservice.\n  The Senate passed legislation very similar to this bill last year. I \nwas extremely disappointed that the House of Representatives did not \nact on that bill in the 107th Congress. We should waste no more time. \nRecently, the House passed a bill to provide tax fairness for members \nof our Armed Forces. However, the Senate has taken the responsible step \nof offsetting the costs of these changes to the tax code. The Senate \nbill will close loopholes that currently allow some individuals to \nrenounce their American citizenship simply to avoid paying income \ntaxes. I can think of no better way to finance tax relief to the brave \npatriots in our military than by forbidding anyone to shirk income \ntaxes by renouncing citizenship in the United States. The tax loophole \nthat rewards such unconscionable behavior ought to be closed and now is \nthe time to do so. I urge the House of Representatives to approve the \nSenate bill.\n  Let me close by thanking all of the members of our Armed Forces. \nWhether they are currently serving overseas or at home, whether they \nwill see combat this week or provide support from far away, all these \nbrave men and women are making America very proud. This legislation \nrecognizes their sacrifices. I urge my colleagues to support the bill \nand hope that Congress will send it to the President without delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/27/senate-section/article/S4483-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4483-S4488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   EXPRESSING GRATITUDE OF UNITED STATES TO NATIONS PARTICIPATING IN \n                        COALITION TO DISARM IRAQ\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the measure is laid \naside, and the Senate will proceed to the consideration of S. Con. Res. \n30, which the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 30) expressing the \n     sense of Congress to commend and express the gratitude of the \n     United States to the nations participating with the United \n     States in the Coalition to Disarm Iraq.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 1 hour of debate equally \ndivided between the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require \non this initial statement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Warner and Allen be added as \ncosponsors of S. Con. Res. 30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I rise in support of this resolution thanking those \nnations participating with the United States in the ``Coalition to \nDisarm Iraq.'' I am pleased that this resolution enjoys the strong \nsupport of the ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Relations, \nthe Senator from Delaware, and the leadership on both sides of the \naisle.\n\n[[Page S4484]]\n\n  Our resolution cites the important diplomatic initiatives originally \nundertaken by our allies in Europe in support of U.S. resolve to \nenforce U.N. Security Council Resolution 1441. On January 30, 2003, the \nPrime Ministers of Denmark, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, and the \nUnited Kingdom, and the Presidents of the Czech Republic and the \nSpanish Government issued a declaration stating the ``the Iraqi regime \nand its weapons of mass destruction represent a clear threat to world \nsecurity.'' The declaration went on to say that ``. . . our governments \nhave a common responsibility to face this threat. . . .''\n  These European leaders were immediately joined by the Foreign \nMinisters of Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, \nMacedonia, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. In a declaration of \nFebruary 5, 2003, the Foreign Minister stated in part: ``the clear and \npresent danger posed by Saddam Hussein's regime requires a united \nresponse from the community of democracies. We call upon the United \nNations Security Council to take the necessary and appropriate action \nin response to Iraq's continuing threat to international peace and \nsecurity.''\n  This is not the first time the Senate has commended the important \ncontributions made by the leaders and Foreign Ministers of these \ncountries, but at a time when some question international support in \nIraq, we thought it important to revisit their statements of support \nand reiterate our gratitude.\n  In addition to these statements of support, our resolution identifies \nadditional nations that have expressed their support for coalition \naction in Iraq. Nations around the world are providing important \ndiplomatic and strategic support in a number of ways, including \nexpressions of political support, overflights and basing authorization, \nintelligence-sharing, and other important strategies contributions. \nThis list includes long-standing U.S. allies and relatively new \npartners in the war on terrorism: large nations with strong militaries \nand small nations who share our view of the inherent threat posed by \nIraq's weapons of mass destruction. In addition to the nations \nmentioned, international support grows each day. In an effort to \nacknowledge the contributions of each, I will list those nations who \nhave made their contributions public to date: Afghanistan, Angola, \nAustralia, Azerbajian, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El \nSalvador, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Georgia, Honduras, Iceland, Japan, Kuwait, \nMacedonia, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Mongolia, The Netherlands, \nNicaragua, Palau, Panama, The Philippines, Rwanda, Singapore, Solomon \nIslands, South Korea, Tonga, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.\n  More specifically, our resolution expresses our Nation's sincere \ngratitude to Australia, Denmark, Poland, and the United Kingdom, whose \nforces have joined with the United States in sending troops into harm's \nway. Each of these nation is making important contributions to \ncoalition efforts to disarm Saddam Hussein's regime of its weapons of \nmass destruction. In addition, we thank the numerous other nations that \nare providing military and logistical support to operations in the \nregion.\n  We also pay special tribute to the leaders of the United Kingdom, \nAustralia, and Spain. Prime Minister Tony Blair, Prime Minister John \nHoward, and President of the Spanish Government, Jose Maria Aznar, have \nprovided courageous leadership to efforts to disarm Iraq, and the \nSenate of the United States commends them for their efforts and \nexpresses its thanks.\n  I welcome the opportunity to introduce this resolution of gratitude \nto our allies around the world who are supporting our efforts in Iraq \nin so many important ways. I am hopeful this resolution will receive \nthe unanimous support of the Senate, to ensure a strong expression of \nappreciation and commendation of the important contributions by members \nof the international community who are making the ``Coalition to Disarm \nIraq'' a success.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague, the chairman \nof the committee, in support of S. Con. Res. 30, which commends and \nexpresses the gratitude of the United States to the other nations \nparticipating with us in the Coalition to Disarm Iraq. The American \npeople and this Congress stand with our Commander in Chief and behind \nour men and women in uniform. It is their responsibility, and the \nCommander in Chief's, to prosecute this war in Iraq, but it is our \nresponsibility to give them the support they need and deserve.\n  There may be difficult days ahead, but I am confident of the \nextraordinary skill and ultimate success of our endeavor. As we gather \nhere today, the sons and daughters of four countries--the United \nKingdom, Australia, Poland, and Denmark--are fighting alongside our \ntroops. Our purpose today is to thank them from the bottom of our \nhearts for the courage they are demonstrating. It is to tell their \nfamilies and loved ones of our gratitude for their sacrifice and to \nexpress to their leaders our profound admiration for their \ndetermination to join other nations, including ours, in a common and \njust cause.\n\n  Several dozen nations are supporting this coalition in other ways--\npolitically, diplomatically, and strategically. They, too, have our \ndeep appreciation. The Senator from Indiana has read the names of those \nnations.\n  Let me say a word to the leaders and the people from friendly \ncountries and allies who do not support our effort to disarm Saddam \nHussein's regime. This Senator and many others disagree profoundly with \nthe choices they have made. But this Senator, at least, respects--\nequally profoundly--that that choice is the right of a sovereign nation \nto make, to differ with us.\n  I think it is time that we move beyond the finger-pointing and \nrecriminations that have been flying across the Atlantic and around the \nworld. We need one another. We will need one another in other \nendeavors. It is time to, again, heal the differences. We could not \ncome together in war, but we are going to have to come together in \npeace.\n  This resolution expresses that hope. By its words, it ``welcomes and \nencourages the active involvement of [the countries in this coalition], \nother nations, and key international organizations in the \nreconstruction and civil administration of Iraq after the conflict.''\n  When this war ends--hopefully, that will be soon--we will face a \ntremendous responsibility and an equally important opportunity in terms \nof Iraq's future. Even as our thoughts and prayers are with our \nPresident, our troops, and our allies, we need to think about and act \non that future now.\n  Why is this so important? I believe it is important because it is \nprofoundly against the interests of the United States to be left the \nsole responsibility for Iraq. As my friend, and the friends of many \nhere, Tom Friedman, has put it: We may have to rent this country for a \ntime; but it is not our desire to own it.\n  There are three reasons for that:\n  First, it will cost tens of billions of dollars and take years to \nrebuild an Iraq that is secure, whole, free, and governed by its own \npeople. We should not bear that burden or responsibility alone.\n  Second, an indefinite American military occupation of Iraq would fuel \nresentment throughout the Middle East, bolster al-Qaida's recruitment, \nand make Americans a target for malcontents everywhere. We need to make \nthe peace in Iraq the world's responsibility, not just our own.\n  Third, failure to engage the U.N. and as many countries as possible \nin post-Saddam Iraq would miss an opportunity to repair the damage that \nhas been done to the U.N., to our alliances, and international \ncooperation--all of which we will need to win the war against \nterrorism, to contend with North Korea and Iran's nuclear programs, to \nslow the spread of weapons of mass destruction, to deal with outbreaks \nof disease, and to contend with so many other threats that have no \nrespect for borders.\n  I hope the administration will spare no effort in securing the \nsanction of the United Nations for everything that will have to be done \nto keep the peace in Iraq after the war, to provide humanitarian aid, \nto rebuild the country, and to help put Iraq back into the hands of its \nown people.\n\n[[Page S4485]]\n\n  By gaining the U.N.'s approval, we would help political leaders \naround the world whose people oppose the war justify their \nparticipation--including financial participation--in building the \npeace. It has not been lost on any of our colleagues in the last \nseveral days of debate, nor upon our fellow Americans; it is dawning on \nthem that in the last gulf war, we paid between 17 and 20 percent of \nthe cost of the war. For this gulf war, we are lucky to pay the \ntotality of the bill--if not 100 percent, very close to it. The meter \nis just beginning to run. The chairman of the committee and I have held \nhearings over the last 10 months on this issue. We don't have any firm \nnumber, but we have estimates that it is going to cost--after we win--\nanywhere from $19 billion a year to numbers well in excess of that. It \nis in our interest--our direct interest--that other nations participate \nin making Iraq secure.\n\n  By gaining U.N. approval, as I said, we would help the political \nleaders around the world who know that is in their interest as well--\nwhose people oppose the war--to justify their participation, including \nfinancial participation. And we would demonstrate a U.S. commitment to \nrebuild ties to the U.N., which will be important in our long-term \nsecurity.\n  I personally think Kosovo provides a powerful precedent for such a \ncourse of action. In Kosovo, we chose not to pursue a use of force \nresolution at the U.N. that we knew Russia would veto. I was in this \nChamber urging that we bypass the U.N. and go directly to a coalition \nof the willing--in this case, the EU and NATO--to gain support for what \nmany of us here strongly believed was in the interest of the United \nStates, the interest of Europe, and in the humanitarian interests of \nhundreds of thousands of people. We moved.\n  But even before the first bombs fell, we worked closely with the \nSecurity Council on an agreement to put the U.N. and other countries \nfront and center in Kosovo for humanitarian aid and civil authority \nonce the peace was made. As a result, we did not have to build the \npeace alone. Our motives were not questioned alone, and we did not bear \nthe costs alone. Evidence the fact that we were carrying roughly 15 \npercent of the freight, 15 percent of the personnel, after Milosevic \nwas defeated.\n  I know there is tension between those who see the efficiency of an \nAmerican military occupation and those who seek the legitimacy of a \nU.N.-led effort.\n  I have made close to a dozen trips, during and after the war in \nBosnia and Kosovo, to the Balkans. I can tell you, there is no U.N. \norganization, there is no multilateral organization, there is no \norganization in the world that can deliver with the speed and \nefficiency whatever is needed that equals that of the U.S. military; it \ndoesn't exist--whether it is building a road, digging a well, or \nsecuring a neighborhood. But the fact is, we have to find a place \nbetween that efficiency and the need for legitimacy.\n  In the immediate weeks after the war, our military will have to be in \ncharge of the country, and long term, we will have to be in charge of \nthe security side of the equation in the country. Longer term, our \ngoal--working with our allies and the international community--must be \nto put Iraq back in the hands of the Iraqi people, and this, again, in \norder for it to have legitimacy and, in my view, the prospect of \nsucceeding, will have to be viewed by the region and the rest of the \nworld as having been and gotten the imprimatur of the international \ncommunity. The last thing we need to do is look as though we are \nputting in a puppet government--which is not our intention--in Baghdad \nin order to serve our purposes. There will be no legitimacy, and it \nwill commit us much longer and in a more costly way.\n  During this critical interim period, we must achieve a very difficult \nbalance. On the one hand, we have to avoid prolonging American military \noccupation, and, of course, for as long as our troops are there, \nsecurity must be their responsibility--U.S. responsibility, not the \nresponsibility of the U.N. or any other organization. We also had a \nbite out of that apple in the Balkans, in Bosnia. It did not work. It \nwas a mistake. We corrected that mistake in Kosovo. But it should not \nbe their role long term to administer Iraq or to choose its future \nleaders.\n  We don't want the American military having to make political \ndecisions day in and day out and being blamed for every grievance. That \nwould fuel resentment and turn us from liberators into occupiers. We do \nnot want the American military putting in place a new Iraqi government, \nin my view. It would be seen as a puppet and, I believe, with no \nlegitimacy.\n  On the other hand, we must not leave too quickly or hand over power \nto the Iraqis who lack the ability, the authority, and the institutions \nto govern their country--and risk Iraq coming apart at the seams.\n  Again, this is a different circumstance in Iraq than it was in Bosnia \nand in Kosovo, but we had a piece of that in both those countries.\n  This is a difficult balance. I am not suggesting any absolute \nformula, but I am suggesting that, to the degree the American military \ncommander is seen to be handpicking and/or putting in place a new Iraqi \nregime, a new Iraqi government, it will diminish its legitimacy. To the \ndegree to which an American sergeant, lieutenant, or captain has to \nstand someplace in Kirkuk and tell a returning Kurd, who was expelled \nthrough ethnic cleansing 15 years ago, whether he can go into his home \nand expel the Arab Sunni living there, that is a problem for us. I do \nnot want some American GI having to make that decision, although they \nare qualified to make it. They should not have to be the ones to make \neach of those decisions.\n  Again, the handoff in the transition will be difficult, but as long \nas we move toward involving the international community without \nyielding any of our security interests, that is the way to go.\n  How would they deal, for example, as I said, with the Kurds, the \nTurkmen, and Arabs literally fighting over the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, \ntrying to claim that city? How will they contend with uncooperative \nethnic leaders bent on revenge instead of reconciliation?\n  We are the ones who will have to provide the military muscle for the \ncoalition to interface between those groups, but we should have the \nrest of the world in on the deal and the responsibility. Instead, \nsomeone must be given the authority to resolve the incredibly \ncomplicated problems that will arise, and we should look to those \nexperiences, as I said, in the Balkans, some of it good, some of it not \nso good, and draw from that experience.\n  We should empower an international civil servant to be the country's \nhigh commissioner or representative at some point as this transition \ngoes forward. He or she should be backed up by an international \ncivilian administration that empowers Iraqis, by a credible \ninternational security force with American forces at its core, American \nforces in the lead.\n  God willing, this war will continue to go well. Casualties on all \nsides, God willing, will be few, and, God willing, a victory will be \nsooner than later. And working with the international community, God \nwilling, we will put Iraq on the path to a democratic society.\n  Even if we succeed in these difficult endeavors, we should not expect \nIraq's promise that will come from this new government to automatically \ntrigger progress throughout the region. Indeed, we will not truly win \nthe peace unless we adopt and pursue a broader strategy for the Middle \nEast. I believe the President has recognized that by underscoring and \nendorsing the road map between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Now \nwe must follow through and show a consistent commitment to its \nimplementation.\n  Finding a solution to this problem would exponentially increase our \nability to promote and support democracy and democratic reform \nthroughout the region. We must do that for the sake of its people and \nfor the safety of our own. For when there are no democratic outlets, \ndissent moves underground, it turns into resentment, and it is \nventilated by extremism and even terrorism. So we must make it clear to \nour friends in that region that their future and their future with us \nrequires--requires--a move toward democratization.\n  If we listen to the voices of Arabs themselves, if we heed the wisdom \nof the U.N.'s Arab development report that ties progress to empowering \nwomen, reforming economies, and expanding political participation, we \ncan\n\n[[Page S4486]]\n\nand will help infuse a sense of hope in a region that lacks hope.\n\n  Mr. President, by refusing to disarm, a defiant Saddam has made the \nfateful choice between war and peace. This is not an exercise of a \ndoctrine of preemption. This is an exercise of enforcing a peace \nagreement. This is an enforcement action, enforcing an agreement a \ndefeated president made in the early nineties to the whole world at the \nUnited Nations saying: If you let me remain in power, I commit to keep \nthe following conditions to this peace agreement. That is what this \nwas.\n  If this had been 1919, we would have been in Versailles having to \nsign an agreement. It was 1991, and it was at a time when the United \nNations was available to us.\n  He made this choice. He made the choice between war and peace. Let us \nmake sure that in winning the war, we also win the peace.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator McCain \nbe added as a cosponsor to this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chairman has 23\\1/2\\ minutes remaining, \nand the ranking member has 12\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as the distinguished Senator from Delaware has pointed \nout, the resolution addresses very specifically the future, and I cite \nlanguage from the resolution we are considering. Clause 5 says:\n\n       (5) welcomes and encourages the active involvement and \n     participation of these countries--\n\n  And those are the countries we have listed in the resolution--\n\n     other nations, and key international organizations in the \n     reconstruction and administration of Iraq after the current \n     conflict in Iraq;\n\n  That is an important clause. This is a resolution of commendation, of \naffirmation. This is our expression, as the U.S. Senate, of thanks, and \nwe are very specific about the nature of contributions many nations \nhave made, and their leaders specifically.\n  It is our intent to be inclusive deliberately and to indicate that we \nwelcome the very broadest participation in the work to disarm Iraq of \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  Having said that, we also welcome their thoughts, their \ncontributions, their revenues, their physical support as we think of \nthe postwar situation. That is a very important set of situations, as a \nmatter of fact.\n  I appreciate the good counsel of my colleague from Delaware when he \ntalks not only about the inclusiveness and the need for participation \nalong with us to share both the opportunities and the burdens but, \nlikewise, the fact this will not happen by chance; this is going to \nrequire active American diplomacy.\n  I commend the President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of \nDefense, Dr. Rice, and others who have been visibly active in this \nrole. But this is a role in which we can assist as a body in commending \nthe nations today and through all of the contacts any of us may have \nwith these nations to indicate ways in which they can be helpful and \nreasons they should be helpful.\n  The distinguished Senator from Delaware, as chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee last year, commenced hearings which he has cited \ntoday on the post-war Iraq situation. We could not have predicted last \nsummer or last fall precisely in the circumstances, but at some point \nit was apparent to many of us that it would be important for those \nweapons of mass destruction to be found and to be destroyed. Our prayer \nthen was that the coalition of nations in the United Nations, working \nthrough the Security Council or other groups, might, in fact, be \npersuasive; that declarations of the weapons would be made and that \ninternational authorities that could work with us in verifying their \ndestruction. We are still in that quest. The large coalition we have \ntalked about today is determined, in fact, to find the weapons and to \ndestroy them, to rid the world of the problems of proliferation that \ncould endanger any of the nations we are citing today, and others who \nhave not chosen to join with us as yet.\n\n  Our resolution is not one of censure or condemnation. We are not \nabout the job of finger-pointing and asking why or why not. We are \naffirmative. We are saying affirmatively, these nations have taken a \nstand, and we hope they will take a larger stand because there will be \nmuch work to do. We hope there will be more joining with us in an \ninclusive move.\n  As the Senator from Delaware has spoken, and I concur with him, we \nwould include in that, as our resolution does, international \norganizations, our NATO allies, the United Nations, others who are very \nimportant for the future of the world in many sectors quite apart from \nthe one we are discussing today.\n  Having said that, it is important that we all understand that we are \ngoing to have to stay the course with regard to operations in Iraq, \nboth with regard to the military situation, the disarmament situation, \nand the reconstruction situation. That will not be easy. The expense of \nthat, regardless of the estimates--and many learned people throughout \nthis country and throughout various organizations have been addressing \nthis issue, our own government has been addressing the issue because it \nwill be soon upon us, but the necessity of staying the course is \nabsolutely imperative not only with regard to our credibility as a \nnation and the welfare of the people in this country and the people of \nIraq and others who are with us, but with regard to the surrounding \nneighborhood and everybody who may be impacted by the military action \npresently.\n  The great fear of many nations, either expressed or unexpressed, is \nthat without extraordinary leadership and statesmanship, there will be \nchaos in Iraq in the postwar situation. There are many historical \nreasons for that which most of us have reviewed in the course of \ndiscussing Iraq.\n  The whole origin of current Iraq, the repression of the Kurds which \ndid keep the peace, albeit in a very cruel and harmful way to the \npeople who were involved in the country, and frequently with enormous \nloss of life to the neighbors, as Iraq and the Saddam regime invaded \nother countries, used weapons of mass destruction to kill hundreds of \nthousands of people outside of Iraq, quite apart from those he \nrepressed within the country. This is the history of a situation that \nis not on the face of itself correcting, or that of a unified spirit, \nor with lots of basis for democratic institutions and the ways in which \npeople might find their way automatically.\n  I commend the Senator from Delaware for pointing out that it is not \nour purpose--and we point that out in what we are saying today--to be \ngovernors of Iraq. The whole idea is Iraq for the Iraqis, for people \nwho come forward to take leadership swiftly and surely, but with the \nright instincts with regard to human rights, freedom of expression, and \na respect for other nations around them, and with all of the pursuits \nthat we think are important to express up front. This is one of the \nbasic reasons nations have joined with us, and we commend them as they \ncommend us. This is a coalition of the willing with regard to \ndisarmament, but it is a coalition of countries that are striving \ntoward some common ideals as to how people should live and how they \nshould treat each other.\n\n  We have a very large job, and I make that point now because some have \ncharged that the future has been muted, that there is an impression \nthat somehow or another the war will happen, hopefully will be over \nswiftly and surely, the disarmament will occur, and some Americans, \nquite apart from the coalition of the willing we have listed, may have \nthe impression that we are going to leave. In fact, many Americans, \nunless we have an up front debate, may very well favor that position \nand say this is a dangerous part of the world.\n  Granted, the Iraqis have lots of problems. We are all for them \nworking it out and doing the best they can. This is\n\n[[Page S4487]]\n\nlikely to lead to the chaos that is generally feared.\n  Nations, not altogether cynically, advocated the continuation of the \ncurrent regime because they said it would create stability. Some \nnations were prepared to accept tyranny because at least it brings \nstability. There are not going to be changes of boundaries, changes of \ngovernment, people coming and going with strange doctrines. Or, from \nour standpoint, having watched a failed state in Afghanistan prior to \nthe time that al-Qaida was utilizing camps, utilizing organization and \nfinance, using that failed state as an incubator, attacked America, \nIraq is a much larger country. A failed state there is conceivably an \nincubator for even more harm, whether it be al-Qaida or any number of \nother groups, some national, some unknown to us, who find sustenance, \nwho find the possibility for proliferation of dangerous weapons and \nperhaps in due course weapons of mass destruction.\n  To allow chaos to occur would be a monumental foreign policy and \nsecurity policy failure by the United States. That is why we need to be \nforward looking, affirmative, inclusive, signing up more partners, \ncommending those who come as they come.\n  I have heard some say, the contributions of some of the countries \nthat are listed in our resolution are very modest. In some cases, they \nhave barely said: We are for you. We think you are on the right track. \nWe want to identify with the United States.\n  They say: Where is the beef? Where are troops? Where is money? Where \nare supplies? Those are legitimate questions. I would simply respond \nfor each of the nations that we list today. They have made a \ndeclaration that could be fateful with regard to those who have \nauthority in those countries. The leaders of those countries must \nanswer to their parliaments, to their people, to others in the press \nand those who play some role in public opinion. This was not a casual \nassociation or declaration. Nor will it be after the war is over, and \nthe responsibility for Iraq comes front and center for all of us.\n  By ``all of us,'' I mean the countries we now have gathered together \nin the commendation and those, prayerfully, that will join us. That, \nhopefully, at some point will include all the nations of the United \nNations and of NATO. It will include those that may not be with us as \nof this moment.\n  I will take at least a minute of this debate to commend our \ncolleague, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, simply because he was a person, in \nmy own experience as a young person, as mayor of Indianapolis going \nwith him to Brussels when he was a counselor to President Nixon and \nrepresenting this country in a group called the Challenges for a Modern \nSociety, as we talked about the problems of urbanization in our NATO \ncountries, the problems of the environment, the problems of jobs for \npeople. With Daniel Patrick Moynihan at my side, I invited the mayors \nof all the countries of the world to come to my city of Indianapolis in \n1971, and he came.\n  He gave a great speech about international relations, what NATO could \ndo. He gave it at a time that he was on the threshold, as it turned \nout, of going into a diplomacy as our Ambassador to India and then to \nthe United Nations.\n  I remember visiting with him when he was our Ambassador. It was a \nyear in which both of us were considering candidacies for the \nSenate, which, in fact, occurred in the year of 1976, successfully, for \nboth of us. We came to this body together and served for 24 years.\n\n  Throughout that period of time, his counsel, I am sure if he were on \nthe floor today speaking on some issue, would have been to be \ninclusive, to be hardheaded, to understand the facts, to understand the \nhistory, the traditions, the difficulties, sometimes the cynicism and \nthe remorse, but also the triumphs that can come with successful \ndiplomacy and successful international relations. Those were missions \nhe undertook gladly on behalf of our country and finally in service \nwith the Senate.\n  I mention that spirit today because I think it is appropriate. This \nis an important resolution. I appreciate the decision of the leadership \nto take it up now before this weekend, before any more time passes, \neven this sense of appreciation and mission and what is to follow, it \nseems to me, is critically important for all Americans, both to \nunderstand and then to participate in the debate which we surely will \nhave.\n  I ask unanimous consent Senator Hagel be added as a cosponsor to this \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield such time to the Senator from Virginia as he \ndesires.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague and longtime friend. \nThis is a very important step that the Chamber is about to undertake \nwith this vote. I anticipate it will be a vote of resounding support \nfor this initiative and this resolution. It sends a signal far beyond \nthe shores of our Nation.\n  I also wish to say a word about the distinguished chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee. We have served in this Chamber together, \nfor me a quarter of a century, for 25 years. I have known committee \nchairmen on both sides of the aisle and we take great pride, the entire \nSenate, in this magnificently trained individual. He has trained almost \nall his life to take on these responsibilities.\n  He is too modest to talk about it, but we often reminisce about our \nsomewhat modest participation in the U.S. Navy many years ago when he \nwas the foreign policy adviser to one of the more distinguished chiefs \nof naval operations in contemporary naval history. At a very young age \nhe began to assume the mantle of responsibilities of foreign affairs. \nWe are fortunate to have him at the helm, together with his \ndistinguished colleague, the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden, who \nlikewise has spent much of his life in the field of foreign affairs. \nThese two fine leaders bring to this Chamber this important piece of \nlegislation which has my strong support.\n\n  But, as it relates to this coalition, our thoughts and our hearts and \nour minds go out to the families who have lost their soldier, sailor, \nairman, marine in this conflict, and those who have suffered the brunt \nof battle and now bear the scars of conflict.\n  We owe a great debt to these men and women who so proudly wear the \nuniform of our country, and who are willing to take the risks. I \nmentioned earlier today, if you look at the 290 million citizens \nprivileged to live in this great Nation, the United States of America, \nless than one-half of 1 percent are currently wearing the uniform and \nassuming the risks as their forebears did, over the 200-plus years of \nthis great Republic. Indeed, we owe them a tremendous, great, \ngratitude.\n  This unified support is one that our President, a distinguished \nCommander in Chief throughout this conflict, has worked so hard to put \ntogether. This resolution recognizes in many ways the efforts of our \nPresident and the Secretary of State, to some extent the Secretary of \nDefense, and others to put it together.\n  The coalition is currently engaged in very hard and dangerous work, \nto eliminate the weapons of mass destruction from the hands of a proven \ndespot, and to give a measure of freedom and democracy to the long-\nsuffering people of Iraq. Some 47 nations have publicly declared \nsupport. I do not doubt there are others in the silence of their \ncouncils that are likewise very sympathetic and are constructively \nengaged in this effort. Each member of the coalition that we cite here \ntoday has demonstrated they will face the threat and take the risk as \nrelates to their individual contributions. Certainly, the forces of \nGreat Britain, again under the courageous leadership of Prime Minister \nTony Blair, together with the Australians, Danish commandos, the Czech \nand Slovak units, and countless others are providing the forces \nnecessary to bring about the goals I have just mentioned.\n  Every contribution, no matter how large or small, has its value. Not \nonly its value, but it is part of the overall matrix to enable the \naccomplishment of these goals. Even though small in\n\n[[Page S4488]]\n\nproportion, that small participation is essential to the overall \nsuccess.\n  I hope this coalition will grow in numbers in due course, because the \nimportance is vital to a better understanding, not only here at home \nbut across the world, as to the noble goals this coalition has \nundertaken.\n  I thank my colleagues who are managing this bill. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will speak using leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader has that right.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, last Thursday the Senate paid tribute to \nthe military personnel and civilians of the United States who are \ncurrently engaged in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Today, the Senate \nlikewise pays tribute to the member states of the ``Coalition to Disarm \nIraq'' that are supporting or serving in operations against Saddam \nHussein's regime.\n  S. Con. Res. 30 reflects our understanding that to join with us in \nthis endeavor places a political, military and financial burden on our \npartners. But shared by many, the burden is lighter.\n  In particular, as we in the United States comfort our own who have \nsuffered injury or the death of a family member in this conflict, our \nprayers are with those in other countries who likewise have family \nmembers separated from their loved ones and, in some cases, who have \nborne the burden of the ultimate sacrifice.\n  Since the campaign to disarm Iraq began several months ago, literally \ndozens of nations have provided diplomatic, military, logistical, and \nstrategic support, to accomplish our shared objective, the disarmament \nof Iraq.\n  We are especially grateful to Australia, Denmark and Poland, whose \nmilitary forces have joined American and British forces on the \nbattlefield to disarm and liberate Iraq. We have a long friendship with \nthe Australian, Danish and Polish people. Your governments' willingness \nto stand with us now will long be remembered.\n  Finally, I salute the political courage and vision of leaders such as \nPrime Minister John Howard of Australia and President Jose Maria Aznar \nof Spain. In their conduct they give us the very definition of \nleadership.\n  When the people of Iraq are free from the repressive dictatorship \nthat they have lived under for decades, I have no doubt that they will \nthank the coalition states, and especially those who risked, and \nsacrificed, their lives to help them attain the freedom to which they \nare entitled.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 5\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last week, the Senate passed a resolution, \nby unanimous vote, that expressed the sense of the Senate in commending \nour troops who are now fighting the war against Iraq. At that time, I \nexpressed my reservations about extraneous clauses in the resolution \nthat implied that Congress acted properly in authorizing the President \nto begin this war.\n  Soon the Senate will vote on a resolution to commend those nations \nthat are in support of U.S.-led efforts to disarm Saddam Hussein and \nend his regime. Now that war has begun, the United States needs to act \nwith the greatest amount of international support. The countries that \nare supporting our efforts deserve our gratitude, even though I believe \nmore could have been done to build a more robust coalition which would \nmore equally share the burdens of war in Iraq.\n  But this resolution, like its predecessor, not only refers to the \nthanks that we wish to send to our friends and allies. The resolution \nalso contains eight whereas clauses, some of which speak to United \nNations Security Council Resolution 1441. After reading these clauses, \nit seems to me that the resolution, intentionally or not, implies that \nthe President of the United States acted properly in initiating a war \nagainst Iraq based upon the authority of Resolution 1441. I disagree \nwith that conclusion.\n  The resolution contains two whereas clauses that describe joint \nstatements issued by several nations on January 30, 2003, and February \n5, 2003. A reading of these joint statements can be interpreted to \nargue that Resolution 1441 was a sufficient basis from which to launch \na war on Iraq. I do not agree that the United Nations authorized the \nuse of force against Iraq. The U.N. Secretary General seems to share my \nview on this point.\n  The Senate should give its thanks to those countries that give their \nsupport to our troops in the field. I hope that the United States will \nwork with these countries to address the long-term reconstruction needs \nof Iraq. I hope that the administration will begin to repair our ties \nwith our other allies that did not share our view of the need to use \nforce in Iraq. But I do not believe that it is proper to give a one-\nsided view of the diplomacy that brought us to this point in the \ncontext of thanking our friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/27/senate-section/article/S4488-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4488-S4490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     S. CON. RES. 30 AND S. 351, THE ARMED FORCES TAX FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nsupport of S. Con. Res. 30 and S. 351, The Armed Forces Tax Fairness \nAct.\n  I am pleased to see so many Americans and communities coming \ntogether, in support of our troops. Here in our nation's capitol, we \nthink about our troops everyday. We know how hard they all are fighting \nfor our freedoms and for the freedoms of the Iraqi people. We thank \nthem for what they are doing and want them to know our thoughts and \nprayers are with them and their families.\n  My colleagues in Congress and I have the opportunity to lighten the \nburden service members often encounter while deployed, or upon their \nreturn home, with The Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act of 2003. This act \nwould allow the American men and women serving our country at home and \nabroad a small, well-deserved thank you in the form of tax benefits and \nrelief.\n  This reward for those who defend our freedom would help to ensure \nthat the men and women who put themselves in harms way when America \ncalls have peace of mind when it comes to things many take for granted, \nlike filing tax returns or collecting travel reimbursement. The \nprovisions of this act will save military families nearly $500 million \nin taxes over the next ten years. They deserve nothing less.\n  Thousands of activated military, National Guard, Reservists, and \ntheir families in my home state of Montana will directly benefit from \nthis act, and the benefit to members of our armed services on a \nnational scale is immeasurable. It is important that we continue to \nsupport our soldiers in any way we can, recognizing the sacrifice they \nmake for the security of our great Nation.\n  We have the best fighting force in the world. I remain certain that \nour troops will succeed in their efforts to disarm Saddam Hussein and \nfree the Iraqi people. I am confident in our military and know that \nthis effort will be accomplished as soon as possible so that all our \ntroops can safely return home to their families.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today the Senate is expressing its \ngratitude to the nations of the world that support the U.S. \ndetermination to remove Saddam Hussein from power and eliminate his \nregime's weapons of mass destruction. I wholeheartedly endorse this \nresolution and the message it sends to the world about so many nations' \nview of Saddam Hussein's regime and about the resolve and bravery of \nthe men and women who have stepped in harm's way to remove the threat \nhe poses to international peace and basic human decency.\n  According to press reports, thousands of additional United States \ntroops have entered Iraq over the last day or so. At the same time, \ntens of thousands of their comrades continue their relentless and \ncourageous march to Baghdad, making all Americans proud as they battle \nextreme conditions and irregular--even illegal--tactics by the enemy. \nEach day, our admiration of these troops and their performance grows.\n\n[[Page S4489]]\n\n  Unfortunately, as well as our troops have performed, much more \nfighting apparently lies ahead. Earlier this week, Secretary Rumsfeld \ndeclared that we are closer to the beginning than the end of this \nconflict. And press accounts indicate many in the military believe the \nconditions in which they will be fighting could get even more \ndifficult.\n  Administration reports suggest that the closer our troops get to \nBaghdad, the greater the risk that Iraq will resort to chemical or \nbiological weapons. Apparently, concern is growing within the \nadministration that desperation could cause Saddam's sympathizers to \nresort to the use of poison gas to defend their despicable leader and \nhis repressive regime.\n  I recently received a demonstration of what our troops must do to \nsurvive and continue to carry out their mission in an environment \ncontaminated with toxic agents. While these briefers expressed \nconfidence our soldiers in Iraq have both the necessary equipment and \ntraining to deal with a chemical attack, I pray the 250,000 American \ntroops in the gulf--and the British, Australian, and Polish ground \ntroops fighting alongside them--will not have to make use of that \ntraining. But the very fact that our troops are equipped and trained to \ndeal with this possibility demonstrates that the risk of a chemical \nattack is very real.\n  All the soldiers in the coalition as well as their governments \ndeserve our heartfelt appreciation for their willingness for to join us \nin this important cause. We owe them each an enormous debt of \ngratitude.\n  Senators Lugar and Biden were right to want to thank those countries \nwho through their words or deeds have expressed support for our effort \nin Iraq. As I have said on a number of occasions, international support \nof our effort in Iraq is critical to share the costs and risks of both \nthe fighting as well as the postwar reconstruction.\n  According to information provided by the administration, three other \ncountries--Great Britain, Australia and Poland--have contributed ground \nforces to fight alongside the U.S. troops in the region. While we are \ngrateful for the willingness of any country to stand with us, we are \nparticularly grateful to these three countries that have deployed their \nyoung people to stand and fight with our troops.\n  While it may be too late for other countries to provide ground forces \nto assist us in the fighting, it is not too late for many others to \nback their words up with tangible help for what comes after the \nfighting ends. Administration officials indicate they are pressing to \ndevelop additional support as this conflict unfolds. That is the right \nthing to do, and I strongly encourage and support those efforts.\n  We will want the concrete assistance of our friends and allies as the \nmilitary effort continues and as we prepare for rebuilding a post-\nSaddam Iraq. To that end, this resolution calls on these and other \ncountries as well as key international organizations to support the \nreconstruction and administration of a post-Saddam Iraq.\n  In closing, Mr. President, allow me to express my debt of gratitude \nto the families of the troops carrying out this effort in the Persian \nGulf. Yesterday afternoon, on this floor, Senator Tim Johnson, whose \nson Brooks is currently serving in Iraq with the Third Brigade of the \n101st Airborne, talked about the intense emotions the families of our \ntroops and our allies are going through. They never know whether the \nnext bit of breaking news will include something about their sons or \ndaughters, mothers or fathers. We owe profound gratitude to them as \nwell.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the remainder \nof our time on the resolution.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 30\n\n       Whereas on September 12, 2002, the President of the United \n     States, appearing at the United Nations, called on that \n     institution and its member states to meet their \n     responsibility to disarm Iraq;\n       Whereas on November 8, 2002, the United National Security \n     Council approved Security Council Resolution 1441 under \n     chapter VII of the United Nations Charter by a vote of 15-0, \n     giving Iraq a final opportunity to comply with its \n     disarmament obligations;\n       Whereas on January 30, 2003, the Prime Ministers of \n     Denmark, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, and the United \n     Kingdom, and the Presidents of the Czech Republic and the \n     Spanish Government, issued a declaration regarding Security \n     Council Resolution 1441, wherein they stated that ``[t]he \n     transatlantic relationship must not become a casualty of the \n     current Iraqi regime's persistent attempts to threaten world \n     security . . . The Iraqi regime and its weapons of mass \n     destruction represent a clear threat to world security. This \n     danger has been explicitly recognized by the United Nations. \n     All of us are bound by Security Council Resolution 1441, \n     which was adopted unanimously.'';\n       Whereas the January 30, 2003, declaration continued to \n     state that ``Resolution 1441 is Saddam Hussein's last chance \n     to disarm using peaceful means. The opportunity to avoid \n     greater confrontation rests with him . . . Our governments \n     have a common responsibility to face this threat . . . [T]he \n     Security Council must maintain its credibility by ensuring \n     full compliance with its resolutions. We cannot allow a \n     dictator to systematically violate those resolutions. If they \n     are not complied with, the Security Council will lose its \n     credibility and world peace will suffer as a result.'';\n       Whereas on February 5, 2003, the Foreign Ministers of \n     Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, \n     Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia issued a \n     declaration regarding Security Council Resolution 1441, \n     stating that ``the United States [has] presented compelling \n     evidence to the United Nations Security Council detailing \n     Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs, its active \n     efforts to deceive United Nations inspectors, and its links \n     to international terrorism . . .

The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we all have an opportunity today to show \nsupport for our men and women in uniform in faraway places such as \nIraq.\n  The bill before us is the Armed Services Tax Fairness Act. It is a \nbipartisan product. The bill represents the Senate's position pretty \nmuch as it was last year when this bill was brought up in the Senate. \nThe revenue loss of the military tax relief package is offset with a \ncrackdown on tax-motivated expatriates. I ask my colleagues to please \nshow their support for our troops and support the Armed Forces Tax \nFairness Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is a time to honor our men and women \nfighting for us overseas. I am here honoring PFC Stryder Stoutenburg \nfrom Missoula, MT, who died in the current conflict. Each of my \ncolleagues knows personnel who have died in Iraq. We honor them. We \ngrieve for their families. We are working hard to give the best \nbenefits we can for them.\n  This bill is not going to heal wounds. It is not going to bring \npeople back. It is not going to bring our loved ones back home right \naway. It is a small token of something we can do in honor of the men \nand women, mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters who are fighting \nfor America.\n  I strongly urge us to give a resounding vote in favor of the men and \nwomen, this small token, to help them. It shows we care. I urge a very \nstrong vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the \nbill, as amended, pass? The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman), and the Senator from \nGeorgia (Mr. Miller), are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I have had the pleasure to review Mr. Selna's distinguished \ncareer and I am confident that he will make a fine Federal judge.\n  Judge Selna graduated Order of the Coif from Stanford Law School in \n1970. Upon graduation he joined the prestigious law firm of O'Melveny & \nMyers, where he maintained a sophisticated commercial practice. Upon \nbecoming a partner in 1978, Judge Selna was involved in many high \nprofile cases, including representing the National Football League in \ndefending antitrust claims. In the period immediately preceding his \nappointment to the Superior Court, his practice consisted of litigating \ncomplex commercial disputes, typically involving high technology issues \nand companies.\n  While in private practice, Judge Selna provided many hours of pro \nbono services to various organizations. For example, he has provided \nhundreds of hours of legal services on behalf of the Newport Harbor \nMuseum in a successful constitutional challenge to Federal funding \nrestrictions in the 1989/1990 appropriation for the Endowment for the \nArts. In addition, he has provided legal advice while serving on the \nboard of Phoenix House of Orange County, a nonprofit drug \nrehabilitation organization. I would like to commend Judge Selna for \nthe many hours he has given to better his community.\n  Since 1998, Judge Selna has served with distinction on the Orange \nCounty Superior Court. His judicial experience on the State bench will \nserve him well in the Federal district court. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in strong support of Judge Selna's nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.

SIMON, OF INDIANA, TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT \n               JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF INDIANA\n\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Philip P. Simon, of \nIndiana, to be United States District Judge for the Northern District \nof Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, we will soon vote on the nomination of \nPhilip Simon to be considered for a position on the United States \nDistrict Court of Northern Indiana. It is because of that I rise once \nagain to commend this remarkable jurist.\n  Judge William Lee and Judge James Moody informed me of their \ndecisions to assume senior status after distinguished careers of public \nservice. Both of these individuals are remarkable leaders on the \nFederal bench, and I applaud their leadership to Indiana and to the \nlegal profession.\n  Immediately upon hearing of these decisions, I notified the White \nHouse and was asked by the President to help find the most qualified \ncandidates to fill these two important positions in Hammond and Fort \nWayne. I took this role very seriously and selected the candidates who \nwould best serve the Northern District of Indiana.\n  After sharing my selections with my friend and colleague Senator Evan \nBayh, I submitted the names and applications of three outstanding \ncandidates to the White House for their consideration. The President \nrecently selected Assistant United States Attorney Philip Simon and \nUnited States Magistrate Theresa Springmann.\n  Philip Simon has a remarkable record as an Assistant United States \nAttorney. As Chief of the Criminal Division, he is responsible for \noverseeing all criminal prosecutions in the Northern District of \nIndiana. He has supervised and participated in prosecutions involving \nlarge-scale drug distribution rings, illegal firearms trafficking, \nwhite collar fraud cases, environmental crime, and mob related \nracketeering cases. In addition, he is in charge of a public corruption \ntask force in Lake County, Indiana.\n  Philip has been the recipient of a number of awards and \ncommendations. In 1995, the Mutual Insurance Companies of Indiana \npresented the Sherlock Award to Philip for his work to combat insurance \nfraud. In 1999, Philip was given the Director's award by Janet Reno, \nthe highest award given to an Assistant United States Attorney by the \nJustice Department.\n  Aside from his outstanding public service, he is a dedicated \ncommunity leader with an interest in assisting children and families \nwith autism.\n  I believe that Philip Simon will demonstrate remarkable leadership to \nNorthern Indiana and will appropriately uphold and defend our laws \nunder the Constitution. I encourage my colleagues to support his \nnomination.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to support Philip P. Simon, \nwho has been nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of Indiana.\n  Our nominee has had a distinguished legal career. Upon graduation \nfrom Indiana University Law School, Mr. Simon joined the law firm of \nKirkland & Ellis as an associate, where he focused on general \ncommercial and construction-related litigation, products liability, and \nemployment discrimination and issues.\n  He next began a long career with the United States Attorney's Office, \nserving first in the Northern District of Indiana, then in the District \nof Arizona, and finally returning to the Northern District of Indiana, \nwhere he currently serves as Chief of the Criminal Division. During his \n13 years with the U.S. Attorney's Office, Mr. Simon has handled a \nvariety of issues ranging from routine drug cases to large scale drug \ndistribution rings, public corruption cases, firearms violations, \nkidnapping, and white collar fraud.\n  Mr. Simon is also a member of the Federal Bar Association, the \nIllinois State Bar Association, and the Chicago Bar Association.\n  I am confident that Mr. Simon's extensive litigation experience will \nmake him an excellent addition to the Federal bench.\n\n[[Page S4497]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the \nquestion is, will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of \nPhilip P. Simon, of Indiana, to be United States District Judge for the \nNorthern District of Indiana?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask that the yeas and nays be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The President will be notified of the Senate's \naction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/27/senate-section/article/S4497-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while there are continuing problems caused \nby the administration's refusal to work with Democratic Senators to \nselect consensus judicial nominees who could be confirmed relatively \nquickly by the Senate, today we again demonstrate what can happen when \nthe administration works with us.\n  In spite of the President's lack of cooperation, the Senate in the 17 \nmonths I chaired the Judiciary Committee was able to confirm 100 judges \nand vastly reduce the judicial vacancies that had built up and were \nprevented by the Republican Senate majority from being filled by \nPresident Clinton. Last year alone the Democratic-led Senate confirmed \n72 judicial nominees, more than in any of the prior 6 years of \nRepublican control. Not once did the Republican-controlled committee \nconsider that many of President Clinton's district and circuit court \nnominees. In our efforts to turn the other cheek and treat this \nPresident's nominees better than his predecessor's had fared, we \nconfirmed 100 judges in 17 months. Yet not a single elected Republican \nhas acknowledged this tremendous bipartisanship and fairness. When \nChief Justice Rehnquist thanked the committee for confirming 100 \njudicial nominees, this was the first time this accomplishment had been \nacknowledged by anyone from a Republican background. I thanked him last \nweek when I appeared before the Judicial Conference.\n  Almost all of the judges confirmed are conservatives, many of them \nquite to the right of the mainstream, and many are pro-life. Many of \nthese nominees have been active in conservative political causes or \ngroups, but we moved fairly and expeditiously on as many as we could.\n  We cut the number of vacancies on the courts from 110 to 50, despite \nan additional 60 new vacancies that had arisen. I recall that the \nchairman said in September of 1997 that 103 vacancies, during the \nClinton Administration, did not constitute a ``vacancy crisis.'' He \nalso repeatedly stated that 67 vacancies meant ``full employment'' on \nthe Federal courts. Even with the vacancies that have arisen since we \nadjourned last year, we remain below the ``full employment'' level that \nSenator Hatch used to draw for the Federal courts with only 50 \nvacancies remaining on the district courts and courts of appeals, \naccording to the Judiciary Committee website. Unfortunately, the \nPresident has not made nominations to a number of those seats, and on \nmore than half of the current vacancies he has missed his self-imposed \ndeadline of a nomination within 180 days. Of course, several of the \nnominations he has made are controversial.\n  This year the President has taken the truly unprecedented action of \nrenominating candidates voted down in committee in spite of the serious \nconcerns expressed by fair-minded members of this committee. That is a \nsignificant problem.\n  This year we have had a rocky beginning with a hearing that has \ncaused a great many problems we might have avoided. The chairman's \ninsistence on terminating debate on the Cook and Roberts nominations is \nanother serious problem. Of course, the administration's unwillingness \nto work with the Senate so that we may be provided the documents and \ninformation needed to proceed with a final vote on the Estrada \nnomination has already proved to be a significant problem. The \nopposition to the Sutton nomination is also extensive.\n  Nonetheless, the Senate has proceeded to confirm 113 of President \nBush's judicial nominees, including 13 this year alone. The Senate \nconfirmed the controversial nomination of Jay Bybee to the Ninth \nCircuit, another pro-life judicial nominee. Already this year the \nSenate has confirmed more circuit court judges than Republicans allowed \nto be confirmed in the entire 1996 session. In addition, I note that it \nwas not until September, 1999, that 13 of President Clinton's judicial \nnominees were confirmed in the first session of the last Congress in \nwhich Republicans controlled the Senate majority. This year we are 6 \nmonths ahead of that schedule.\n  The California nominee comes from the bipartisan selection \ncommissions Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer have established in \nCalifornia and the Indiana nominee has the bipartisan support of his \nhome State Senators. I congratulate the nominees and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/27/senate-section/article/S4497-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know there are a group of us who wish \nto speak about Senator Moynihan. I think that would be the next order \nof business, and so I will proceed.\n  Let me say that yesterday all of us were caused great sorrow when we \nheard the terrible news that Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a giant \namong us, had passed from our midst. While the sadness is still there, \ntoday I rise to pay tribute to Pat Moynihan and to the extraordinary \nlife that he led.\n  It can rarely be said about someone that they changed the world and \nmade it a better place just with their ideas. Senator Moynihan was such \nan individual. He was a font of ideas. He was not afraid to utter them \nand he uttered them in such a way that people listened, paid attention, \nand changed the way they lived for the better.\n  Pat Moynihan was a friend to me, a mentor. I first met him when I \nattended his course at Harvard while I was a student and he was a \nprofessor. Throughout the many years, he extended me so many kindnesses \nI can't even count them. But beyond the personal--and every one of us \nhas our personal stories about Pat--is what he did for all of us. He \nwas known in the Senate as a unique individual, as a person of ideas in \na body that, frankly, has always needed more of them. He was the kind \nof Senator that the Founding Fathers, as they look down on this body, \nwould look at and smile and say: That's the kind of person we wanted to \nserve in the Senate.\n  I think the Washington Post editorial said it very well today. It \nsaid:\n\n       He pursued with distinction enough careers for half a dozen \n     men of lesser talents and imagination--politician, \n     Presidential adviser, diplomat, author, professor and public \n     intellectual.\n\n  As someone who is barely managing to pursue only one of those many \ncareers, I can't help but observe that, as you look around, there are \nno more Pat Moynihans in part because of the man--Pat Moynihan's \nvision, erudition, intellect, dazzling wit, and moral conviction were \nsecond to none--and in part because of the times. Pat Moynihan was one \nof the preeminent public intellectuals in a time when such figures and \ntheir ideas could command the Nation's attention in a way that I fear \nis now all but gone from American life. I hope and pray that is not \ntrue.\n  But we mourn his passing. We mourn the passing of his time from the \nnational stage and from this beloved institution that he loved so well \nand served so well in for 24 years, the Senate.\n  In the coming days, many will pay tribute to Pat Moynihan's \nleadership and vision on so many ideas where his mark on policy and his \nmark on individuals are well known. There are children born in this \ncountry and in foreign countries whose lives are better, who will live \nbetter lives because Pat Moynihan lived and worked on this Earth.\n  His leadership in Social Security, in welfare reform, in poverty, in \ntax policy, in trade, in education, in immigration, in foreign policy, \nand most recently in government secrecy--any one\n\n[[Page S4498]]\n\nof those would have been enough to be a capstone of an ordinary \nSenator's career. But Pat did them all.\n  Adam Clymer of the New York Times chronicled Pat's career and life \nmovingly and brilliantly today. I ask unanimous consent his piece be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 27, 2003]\n\n     Daniel Patrick Moynihan Is Dead; Senator From Academia Was 76\n\n                            (By Adam Clymer)\n\n       Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Harvard professor and four-\n     term United States senator from New York who brought a \n     scholar's eye for data to politics and a politician's sense \n     of the real world to academia, died yesterday at Washington, \n     D.C. He was 76.\n       The cause, a spokesman for the family said, was \n     complications of a ruptured appendix, which was removed on \n     March 11 at the hospital, where he remained.\n       Mr. Moynihan was always more a man of ideas than of \n     legislation or partisan combat. Yet he was enough of a \n     politician to win re-election easily--and enough of a \n     maverick with close Republican friends to be an occasional \n     irritant to his Democratic party leaders. Before the Senate, \n     his political home from 1977 to 2001, he served two \n     Democratic presidents and two Republicans, finishing his \n     career in the executive branch as President Richard M. \n     Nixon's ambassador to India and President Gerald R. Ford's \n     ambassador to the United Nations.\n       For more than 40 years, in and out of government, he became \n     known for being among the first to identify new problems and \n     propose novel, if not easy, solutions, most famously in auto \n     safety and mass transportation; urban decay and the corrosive \n     effects of racism; and the preservation and development of \n     architecturally distinctive federal buildings.\n       He was a man known for the grand gesture as well as the bon \n     mot, and his style sometimes got more attention than his \n     prescience, displayed notably in 1980 when he labeled the \n     Soviet Union ``in decline.'' Among his last great causes were \n     strengthening Social Security and attacking government \n     secrecy.\n       In the halls of academe and the corridors of power, he was \n     known for seizing ideas and connections before others \n     noticed. In 1963, for example, he was the co-author of \n     ``Beyond the Melting Pot,'' which shattered the idea that \n     ethnic identities inevitably wear off in the United \n     States. Then, on the day that November when President \n     Kennedy was shot in Dallas, he told every official he \n     could find that the federal government must take custody \n     of Lee Harvey Oswald to keep him alive to learn about the \n     killing. No one listened.\n       Friends also observed the intense sense of history he \n     connected to immediate events. Bob Packwood, the former \n     Republican senator from Oregon, recalled his Democratic \n     friend's response in 1993 when a reporter on the White House \n     lawn asked what he thought of the signing of the Israeli-\n     Palestinian agreement to share the West Bank. ``Well, I think \n     it's the end of World War I,'' he said, alluding to the \n     mandates that proposed Middle Eastern boundaries in 1920.\n       Erudite, opinionated and favoring, in season, tweed or \n     seersucker, Mr. Moynihan conveyed an academic personality \n     through a chirpy manner of speech, with occasional pauses \n     between syllables. More than most senators, he could get \n     colleagues to listen to his speeches, though not necessarily \n     to follow his recommendations. He had a knack for the \n     striking phrase, but unease at the controversy it often \n     caused. When other senators used August recesses to travel or \n     raise money for re-election, he spent most of them in an 1854 \n     schoolhouse on his farm in Pindars Corners in Delaware \n     County, about 65 miles west of Albany. He was writing books, \n     9 as a senator, 18 in all.\n       Mr. Moynihan was less an original researcher than a bold, \n     often brilliant synthesizer whose works compelled furious \n     debate and further research. In 1965, his foremost work, \n     ``The Negro Family: The Case for National Action,'' \n     identified the breakup of black families as a major \n     impediment to black advancement. Though savaged by many \n     liberal academics at the time, it is now generally regarded \n     as ``an important and prophetic document,'' in the words of \n     Prof. William Julius Wilson of Harvard.\n       Five years later, his memo to President Nixon on race \n     relations caused another uproar. Citing the raw feelings \n     provoked by the battles of the civil rights era, Mr. Moynihan \n     suggested a period of rhetorical calm--``benign neglect'' he \n     called it--a proposal widely misinterpreted as a call to \n     abandon federal programs to improve the lives of black \n     families.\n       Nonetheless, he could also be an effective legislator. In \n     his first term he teamed with Jacob K. Javits, his Republican \n     colleague, to pass legislation guaranteeing $2 billion worth \n     of New York City obligations at a time when the city faced \n     bankruptcy. In a brief turn leading the Environment and \n     Public Works Committee in 1991 and 1992 he successfully \n     pushed to shift highway financing toward mass transit--and \n     get New York $5 billion in retroactive reimbursement for \n     building the New York State Thruway before the federal \n     government began the Interstate Highway System.\n       Although Mr. Moynihan's junior colleague for 18 years, \n     Alfonse M. D'Amato, became known as Senator Pothole for his \n     pork-barrel efforts of New York, Mr. Moynihan held his own in \n     that department.\n\n\n                     monument of bricks and marble\n\n       Long before he came to the Senate, and until he left, he \n     was building a monument of bricks and marble by making \n     Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue, a dingy street where he \n     came to work for President John F. Kennedy in 1961, into the \n     grand avenue that George Washington foresaw for the boulevard \n     that connects the Capitol and the White House. Nearly 40 \n     years of his effort filled the avenue with new buildings on \n     its north side, including the apartment houses where he \n     lived, restored buildings on the south, and cafes and a sense \n     of life all along.\n       Wherever he went, Mr. Moynihan explored interesting \n     buildings and worked to preserve architectural distinction, \n     from converting the main post office in Manhattan into the \n     new Pennsylvania Station, to the Customs House at Battery \n     Park and all around Washington. Last year, over lunch and a \n     martini at Washington's Hotel Monaco, an 1842 Robert Mills \n     building that was once the city's main post office, he \n     recalled how he had helped rescue it from decline into a \n     shooting gallery for drugs.\n       Daniel Patrick Moynihan was born in Tulsa, Okla., on March \n     16, 1927, the son of an itinerant, hard-drinking newspaperman \n     who moved the family to New York later that year to take a \n     job writing advertising copy. They lived comfortably in the \n     city and suburbs until 1937 when his father, John Moynihan, \n     left the family and left it in poverty.\n       Mr. Moynihan's childhood has been pseudo-glamorized by \n     references to an upbringing in Hell's Kitchen, which in fact \n     he encountered after his mother bought a bar there when he \n     was 20. But there was enough hardship and instability in his \n     early life so that when he later wrote of ``social \n     pathology,'' he knew what he was talking about.\n       Mr. Moynihan's mother, Margaret Moynihan, moved the family, \n     including a brother, Michael, and a sister, Ellen, into a \n     succession of Manhattan apartments, and Pat shined shoes in \n     Times Square. In 1943 he graduated first in his class at \n     Benjamin Franklin High School in East Harlem. He also \n     graduated to work as a stevedore at Piers 48 and 49 on West \n     11th Street.\n       He went to City College for a year, enlisted in the Navy, \n     and was trained as an officer at Middlebury College and at \n     Tufts University. Discharged the next spring, he went to work \n     that summer tending bar for his mother, then got his B.A. at \n     Tufts in 1948 and an M.A. at the Fletcher School of Law and \n     Diplomacy at Tufts in 1949.\n       In 1950 he went to the London School of Economics on a \n     Fulbright Scholarship, and he lived well on it, the G.I. bill \n     and later a job at an Air Force base. He started wearing a \n     bowler hat. He had a tailor and a bootmaker and traveled \n     widely, including a visit to Moynihan cousins in County \n     Kerry, Ireland.\n       Work on his dissertation did not consume him. In ``Pat,'' \n     his 1979 biography, Doug Schoen described a 1952 visit by two \n     former Middlebury colleagues: ``Impressed at first with his \n     elaborate file cabinet full of index cards, they found \n     that most of the cards were recipes for drinks rather than \n     notes on the International Labor Organization.''\n       Mr. Moynihan came home in 1953 and went to work in the \n     mayoral campaign of Robert F. Wagner. He went on to write \n     speeches for W. Averell Harriman's successful campaign for \n     governor in 1954, joined his administration in Albany and \n     rose to become his chief aide. It was there he learned about \n     traffic safety, which he described in a 1959 article in The \n     Reporter as a public health problem requiring federal action \n     to make automobile design safer.\n\n\n                         a semi-modest proposal\n\n       Another former campaign worker who came to Albany was \n     Elizabeth Brennan. Her desk and his were in the same room, \n     and they grew friendly. Rather suddenly in early 1955, when \n     they had never dated, Mr. Moynihan did not formally propose \n     but simply told her he was going to marry her.\n       They married in May 1955, and she often said she married \n     him because he was the funniest man she ever met.\n       His wife survives him, as do their three children: Timothy, \n     Maura and John, and two grandchildren.\n       While he was an enthusiastic supporter of John F. Kennedy, \n     work at Syracuse University on a book about the Harriman \n     administration and his Ph.D. kept his role in the campaign \n     sporadic. But Liz Brennan Moynihan organized the campaign \n     efforts in the Syracuse area.\n       His Ph.D. in international relations finally complete, he \n     left Syracuse in 1961 for Washington and the Labor \n     Department, rising to assistant secretary. One early research \n     assignment on office space for the scattered department gave \n     him an opportunity to assert guiding architectural principles \n     that have endured and produced striking courthouses: that \n     federal buildings ``must provide visual testimony to the \n     dignity, enterprise, vigor and stability of the American \n     government.'' That same report enabled him to raise the \n     Pennsylvania Avenue issue, and he was at work on development \n     plans on Nov. 22, 1963, when the word came that the president \n     had been shot in Dallas.\n       Beyond his failed efforts to protect Mr. Oswald, Mr. \n     Moynihan marked that grim assassination weekend with a widely \n     remembered\n\n[[Page S4499]]\n\n     remark about the death of the president he barely knew but \n     idolized and eagerly followed.\n       On Sunday, Nov. 24, he said in a television interview: ``I \n     don't think there's any point in being Irish if you don't \n     know that the world is going to break your heart eventually. \n     I guess we thought we had a little more time.'' He added \n     softly, ``So did he.''\n       His first book, written jointly with Nathan Glazer, had \n     come out earlier that year. ``Beyond the Melting Pot'' looked \n     at the different ethnic groups of New York City and scoffed \n     at ``the notion that the intense and unprecedented mixture of \n     ethnic and religious groups in American life was soon to \n     blend into a homogeneous end product.'' Ethnicity persisted, \n     they argued.\n       That concept won praise from the era's leading historian of \n     immigration, Harvard's Oscar Handlin, who called it a ``point \n     of departure'' in studies of immigrants. But in a foretaste \n     of academic criticism in years to come, he said their \n     methodology was sometimes ``flimsy.''\n       ``The Negro Family: The Case for National Action,'' a paper \n     he wrote at the Labor Department early in 1965, argued that \n     despite the Johnson administrations's success in passing \n     civil rights, laws, statutes could not ensure equality after \n     three centuries of deprivation. He said the disintegration of \n     black families had reached a point of ``social pathology.'' \n     He wrote: ``The principal challenge of the next phase of the \n     Negro revolution is to make certain that equality of results \n     will now follow. If we do not, there will be no social peace \n     in the United States for generations.''\n       He cited black unemployment, welfare and illegitimacy \n     rates. His emphasis on families headed by women led him to be \n     accused of blaming the victims for their predicament, but in \n     fact he wrote clearly, ``It was by destroying the Negro \n     family under slavery that white America broke the will of the \n     Negro people.'' Now, he wrote, the federal government must \n     adopt policies especially in education and employment, \n     ``designed to have the effect, directly or indirectly, of \n     enhancing the stability and resources of the Negro American \n     family.''\n       He left the administration in 1965 as liberals denounced \n     his paper, and then ran for president of the New York City \n     Council. He lost badly in the Democratic primary, but went on \n     to Wesleyan University and, in 1966, to Harvard as director \n     of the Joint Center for Urban Studies and a tenured professor \n     in the Graduate School of Education.\n       He spoke out against disorder, in urban slums and on select \n     campuses. Speaking to Americans for Democratic Action in \n     1967, he made it clear he though liberal pieties would not \n     solve black problems.\n       And in a passage that came to the eye of the Republican \n     presidential candidate Richard M. Nixon, he said liberals \n     must ``see more clearly that their essential interest is in \n     the stability of the social order'' and ``make alliances with \n     conservatives who share that concern.'' When Nixon was \n     elected, Mr. Moynihan made his alliance. He joined the White \n     House staff as assistant to the president for urban affairs.\n       That startled his friends, and his wife refused to move to \n     Washington. Mr. Moynihan, who never developed, even after \n     Watergate, the searing contempt for Mr. Nixon that animated \n     so many contemporary Democrats, explained that when the \n     president of the United States asks, a good citizen agrees to \n     help. Another biographer, Godfrey Hodgson, says that while \n     Mr. Moynihan never stopped thinking of himself as a liberal \n     Democrat, he shared the president's resentment of orthodox \n     liberalism.\n       While his advice to the president to end the war in Vietnam \n     stayed private, there were two ideas for which his time in \n     the Nixon White House was known.\n       In 1970 he wrote to the president on race relations, \n     arguing that the issue had been rubbed raw by ``hysterics, \n     paranoids and boodlers'' on all sides. Now, he wrote, race \n     relations could profit from a period of ``benign neglect'' in \n     which rhetoric, at least, was toned down. In a return of the \n     reaction to his paper on the Negro family, when this paper \n     was leaked it was treated as if Mr. Moynihan wanted to \n     neglect blacks.\n       He may have invited that interpretation by his quaintly \n     glib language, but in fact Mr. Moynihan was pushing an idea \n     that might have been of vast help to poor blacks, and whites. \n     That other idea for which he was known, the Family Assistance \n     Plan, sought to provide guaranteed income to the unemployed \n     and supplements to the working poor, and together to stop \n     fathers from leaving home so their families could qualify for \n     welfare. The president made a speech for the program, sent it \n     to Capitol Hill and let it die.\n       Afterward, though he remained on good terms with Mr. Nixon, \n     Mr. Moynihan went back to Harvard in 1970. Resentment over \n     his White House service chilled his welcome back in \n     Cambridge. His interests shifted to foreign affairs--perhaps \n     because the charges of racism left him no audience for \n     domestic policy, and made him welcome an appointment as \n     ambassador to India, where he negotiated a deal to end \n     India's huge food aid debt to the United States. He returned \n     to Harvard to protect his tenure in 1975, but moved that year \n     to the United Nations as United States ambassador.\n       There he answered the United States' third world critics \n     bluntly, often contemptuously.\n       In his brief tenure he called Idi Amin, the president of \n     Uganda, a ``racist murderer,'' and denounced the General \n     Assembly for passing a resolution equating Zionism with \n     racism: ``the abomination of anti-Semitism has been given the \n     appearance of international sanction.'' After eight months of \n     struggles with Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, who \n     wanted a less confrontational approach, he resigned in \n     February 1976.\n       That made him available for a run for the Democratic \n     nomination for the Senate, and he edged out the very liberal \n     Representative Bella Abzug in the primary before winning the \n     general election easily over the incumbent, James L. Buckley, \n     the Republican-Conservative candidate. With his wife in \n     charge of each campaign, he won three landslide re-elections.\n       He set one high goal--a seat on the Finance Committee as a \n     freshman--and reached it, along with a seat on the \n     Intelligence Committee. Early in office he joined Gov. Hugh \n     L. Carey, Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. and Senator Edward M. \n     Kennedy of Massachusetts in a St. Patrick's Day appeal to \n     Irish-Americans to stop sending money to arm the Irish \n     Republican Army, whom he privately described as ``a bunch of \n     murderous thugs.''\n       Every year he produced an analysis of federal taxes and \n     federal aid, known as ``the fisc,'' which showed that New \n     York was getting regularly shortchanged by Washington. He \n     worked to reduce that imbalance, both through Medicaid \n     funding on the finance Committee and public works on the \n     Environment and Public Works Committee.\n       And his colleagues always knew he was around. Every day of \n     the 2,454-day captivity of Terry Anderson, the Associated \n     Press reporter captured by 1985 by the Hezbollah in Lebanon, \n     he would go to the Senate floor to remind his colleagues, in \n     a sentence, just how many days it had been.\n\n\n                       Quarreled With White House\n\n       After loyally serving four presidents, he quarreled with \n     those in the White House while he was in the Senate. When he \n     arrived in 1977, he found President Carter too soft in \n     dealing with the Soviet Union and indifferent to its evil \n     nature.\n       But he quickly came to believe that the Soviet Union was \n     crumbling. In Newsweek in 1979 he focused on its ethnic \n     tensions. In January 1980, he told the Senate: ``The Soviet \n     Union is a seriously troubled, even sick society. The indices \n     of economic stagnation and even decline are extraordinary. \n     The indices of social disorder--social pathology is not too \n     strong a term--are even more so.'' He added. ``The defining \n     event of the decade might well be the breakup of the Soviet \n     empire.''\n       It was against that changed perception that he was sharply \n     critical of vast increases in military spending, which, \n     combined with the Reagan tax cuts, produced deficits that he \n     charged were intended to starve domestic spending. He called \n     a 1983 Reagan proposal for cutting Social Security benefits a \n     ``breach of faith'' with the elderly, and worked out a rescue \n     package that kept the program solvent for at least a decade \n     into the 21st century.\n       He also scorned the 1983 invasion of Grenada, the 1984 \n     mining of harbors in Nicaragua and the 1989 invasion of \n     Panama as violations of international law, and voted against \n     authorizing President George H. W. Bush to make war against \n     Iraq. It was not enough, he wrote in his book ``On the Law of \n     Nations'' in 1990, for the United States to be strong enough \n     to get away with such actions. The American legacy of \n     international legal norms of state behavior, he wrote, is ``a \n     legacy not to be frittered away.''\n       But probably his worst relations with a president came when \n     Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton sought passage of \n     national health insurance.\n       Certainly, the failure of health care legislation was not \n     primarily Mr. Moynihan's responsibility, but he had become \n     chairman of the Finance Committee in 1993, and health care \n     fell within its jurisdiction. He said the administration \n     should take on welfare reform legislation first, and carped \n     on television about their health plan, quickly fixing on the \n     role of teaching hospitals as the biggest issue in health \n     care. But otherwise he waited for Mr. Packwood and Senator \n     Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, to propose a \n     compromise. Mr. Dole had decided all-out opposition was the \n     better course for his party, and they never did.\n       Mr. Moynihan's career in the Senate was marked not by \n     legislative milestones but by ideas. Even so, Senator \n     Kennedy, the legislative lion, once described him in 1993 as \n     an exemplar ``of what the Founding Fathers thought the Senate \n     would be about,'' because of the New Yorker's breadth of \n     interests, ``having read history, and thought about it, and \n     being opinionated.''\n  Mr. SCHUMER. As a fellow New Yorker, I am going to speak of Pat \nMoynihan as a builder. He was known as a thinker, but we forget he was \nalso a builder, a builder of bricks and mortar, somebody who taught us \nin New York and the country to think grandly of public works once \nagain. Those who knew Moynihan best say that is where his heart truly \nlay.\n  The week after I won election for the Senate, Pat Moynihan called me \ninto his office. He told me he would announce he wasn't going to run \nagain. He said: I am going to bequeath to you a gift. I am going to \nrecommend that my staffer Polly Trottenberg work for you. Well I took \nhis advice and hired\n\n[[Page S4500]]\n\nher to be my Legislative Director and she has been with me ever since. \nHe did many nice things for me. That was certainly one of them.\n  Because she worked so long and well for him, I asked Polly today what \nPat Moynihan had regarded as his greatest accomplishment and she said \nsomething that surprised me. But when you think about it, it should not \nbe surprising. It was how he reclaimed Pennsylvania Avenue in this city \nand made it big and grand and beautiful again and how he lived out the \nrest of his days there with his wonderful wife Liz.\n  Pat Moynihan not only taught us to think grandly about public works \non the national scale, he also taught us to cherish our cities, to make \nthem lively and beautiful, and none so more than his two beloved \ncities, New York and Washington.\n  His groundbreaking work on Federal transportation policy remains \nwithout equal. Pat Moynihan is the father of ISTEA, the Intermodal \nSurface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, the most important piece \nof transportation legislation since President Eisenhower's Federal \nHighway Act of 1956.\n  Pat Moynihan, as a social scientist, urban planner, and old-fashioned \nNew York politician, helped change the course of American \ntransportation, weaning us from our highways-only approach that had \ndestroyed so many urban neighbors.\n  Instead, ISTEA encouraged so many communities to invest in other \nmodes, such as transit, rail, and even bipeds. I ride a bike every \nSaturday around New York. It is another small way I thank Pat Moynihan.\n  He provided citizens with far greater say in what types of projects \nwould be built in their communities. ISTEA was especially important to \nNew York. It enabled the State to restore some of our most important \nbut neglected public works, such as the magnificent Brooklyn Bridge as \nwell as dream new dreams like I-86 across the southern tier, and the \nSecond Avenue subway.\n  His passion and dedication to public architecture is well known and \ndates from his days as a young aide to President Kennedy who, right \nbefore his death, tasked Moynihan with restoring Pennsylvania Avenue \nhere in Washington. Moynihan succeeded brilliantly in his task, with \nthe final piece of Pennsylvania Avenue, the Ronald Reagan Building and \nInternational Trade Center, unveiled a few years ago and instantly \nhailed as one of the best new buildings to grace the Capital.\n  Of course, Senator Moynihan was also a leading force for architecture \nin New York. He was responsible for building a beautiful Federal \ncourthouse at 500 Pearl Street in Lower Manhattan, which we were proud \nto name after him. Completed in 1994, the Daniel Patrick Moynihan \nFederal Courthouse embodies the same spirit as his previous \narchitectural endeavors, an extraordinary work of art inside and \noutside.\n  He was responsible for the restoration of the spectacular Beaux-Arts \nCustoms House at Bowling Green and for recognizing what a treasure we \nhave in Governors Island.\n  He is beloved in Buffalo, at the other end of our State, for \nreawakening the city's appreciation for its architectural heritage, \nwhich includes Frank Lloyd Wright houses and the Prudential Building, \none of the best known early skyscrapers by the architect Louis H. \nSullivan, a building which Moynihan helped restore and then chose as \nhis Buffalo office.\n  Moynihan has also spurred a powerful and passionate popular movement, \nwhich is gaining strength as he leaves us, in Buffalo to build a new \nsignature Peace Bridge over the Niagara River.\n  His last project--one that I regret he didn't live to see completed--\nwas his beloved Pennsylvania Station. In 1963, Pat Moynihan was one a \ngroup of prescient New Yorkers who protested the tragic razing of our \ncity's spectacular Penn Station--a glorious public building designed by \nthe Nation's premier architectural firm of the time, McKim, Mead & \nWhite.\n  It was Pat Moynihan who recognized years ago that across the street \nfrom what is now a sad basement terminal that functions--barely--as New \nYork City's train station, sits the James A. Farley Post Office \nBuilding, built by the same architects in much the same grand design as \nthe old Penn Station. Pat Moynihan recognized that since the very same \nrailroad tracks that run under the current Penn Station also run \nbeneath the Farley Building, we could use the Farley Building to once \nagain create a train station worthy of our grand city.\n  He then did the impossible: He persuaded New York City, New York \nState, the U.S. Postal Service, the U.S. Department of Transportation, \nAmtrak, congressional appropriators, and President Clinton himself, to \ncommit to making this project succeed. And I can tell you, I don't \nthink President Clinton even knew what hit him.\n  Herbert Muschamp, the noted New York Times architecture critic, \npraised the new Penn Station design, which brilliantly fuses the \nclassical elements of the Farley Building with a dramatic, light-filled \nconcourse, when he wrote:\n\n       In an era better known for the decrepitude of its \n     infrastructure than for inspiring new visions of the city's \n     future, the plan comes as proof that New York can still \n     undertake major public works. This is the most important \n     transportation project undertaken in New York City in several \n     generations.\n\n  We have Pat Moynihan to thank for that and so many other things.\n  The epitaph given to Sir Christopher Wren, designer of St. Paul's \nCathedral in London, is an equally fitting epitaph for Senator Daniel \nPatrick Moynihan: ``Si Monumentum Requiris Circumspice''--``If you \nwould see this man's monument, look around.''\n  And not only look at the buildings, look at people, look at highways, \nlook at Government projects and programs--all of which Pat Moynihan had \na tremendous effect on.\n  I join with every New Yorker and every American in mourning Pat \nMoynihan's passing but celebrating his extraordinary life, his \nextraordinary career, celebrating the extraordinary man himself.\n  I give my heartfelt condolences to his family--Liz and Timothy and \nMaura and John and his grandchilden, Michael Patrick and Zora--and \ncount myself among the many others who will miss him dearly.\n  Mr. President, I will end with a prayer. It is my hope, it is my \nprayer, that God grant us a few more Pat Moynihans in this Senate, in \nthis country, in this world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I join my colleague in expressing our \nsense of loss at the passing of a man whom we knew, we admired, we \nrespected, we enjoyed.\n  Yesterday, we lost more than ``The Gentleman from New York.'' We lost \none of the great minds of America's 20th century. He devoted more than \n50 years of his life to public service in order to build a better \nworld. For Senator Moynihan, his service to his country and to the \nState he loved was more than his career. It was his calling.\n  For 24 years, New Yorkers had the benefit of his intellect and his \ndedication on the floor of this Senate. Whenever he headed to the \nSenate floor to speak, he kept the people of New York close to his \nheart. And he came armed with three signature items: his horn-rim \nglasses, a bow tie, and a great idea.\n  No one believed more in the power of restoration than Senator \nMoynihan: Restoration of our cities as economic and cultural centers; \nrestoration of our historic buildings as public places of pride; \nrestoration of the family, when given the proper tools to mend decades \nof despair; restoration of our Government to better serve its people.\n  It was Senator Moynihan who helped restore our sense of hope with his \nability to look at an abandoned building, a neglected neighborhood, or \nan empty school, and see not only what it could become but how to make \nit so.\n  He could ``see around corners,'' to quote his Irish heritage. I \nalways loved that phrase when applied to Pat Moynihan because it so \naptly described his unique ability to foresee how we might address a \ndifficult problem. Time after time, he could see our Nation's next \npressing challenge--and its solution-- even when it was decades away \nfrom our own national conscience.\n\n  His soul was anchored in the New Deal, but it was his ability to \nenhance the social contract to meet the challenges of the 20th and 21st \ncentury that transformed the lives of millions of New Yorkers and \nAmericans.\n  Whether it was Social Security, Medicare, education, health care, the\n\n[[Page S4501]]\n\nenvironment, fighting poverty, or historic preservation, every issue \nillustrated what Senator Moynihan did best: He used the power of an \nidea as an engine for change. He was an architect of hope.\n  It was Senator Moynihan who was able to articulate that poverty in an \nurban setting was just as isolating and devastating as in a rural \nsetting. This helped launch the war on poverty and the idea that we now \nknow as the earned income tax credit.\n  It was Senator Moynihan who realized that States such as New York and \nothers across the Northeast contributed more in taxes than we received \nback from the Federal Government. This prompted what he called the FISC \nReport, and his fight, which I carry on, to get New York its fair \nshare.\n  It was Senator Moynihan who looked at our historic places--from \nPennsylvania Avenue right here in Washington, DC, to Penn Station in \nNew York City--and saw how saving these great monuments to the past \nheld meaning and purpose for our future.\n  It was Senator Moynihan, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, \nwho helped write the 1993 Budget Act, pass the Economic Act, and the \nDeficit Reduction Act, that set the foundation for the prosperity of \nthe 1990s, lifted 7 million Americans out of poverty, and sent a clear \nmessage that the Federal Government did its best work when it did it \nresponsibly, living within a budget. Unlike what we have just seen here \non the floor over the last several days, Senator Moynihan understood \nthat a Government which lived within its means made real choices, not \nfalse choices, and then putting it on a credit card for our children to \nhave to pay.\n  It was Senator Moynihan who, in addition to all of these domestic \naccomplishments, forged a new era of foreign policy for America with \nhis work as Ambassador to India, and with his eloquence on behalf of \nthe United States, speaking up during a contentious time as Ambassador \nto the United Nations.\n  On a personal note, it was Senator Moynihan who welcomed me to his \nfarm in Pindars Corners on a picture-perfect July day in 1999 and \noffered his support and encouragement, sending me on my way with a \ngesture of profound kindness that I will never forget.\n  A few months ago, Senator Moynihan came to see me in my office. It is \nthe office he was in for so many years. He sat with me, and we talked \nabout the issues confronting this Senate. I asked his advice. I told \nhim I wanted to have a chance to talk with him further about so many of \nthe challenges that are facing us. Unfortunately, that was not to be. \nHis illness prevented him from coming back to the Senate and from \nhelping other Senators one last time.\n  Today, we are all thinking of him and his family. We extend our \ncondolences, and our gratitude for the life he lived, the example he \nset, and the countless contributions he made.\n  Senator Moynihan once said, in a very Irish way:\n\n       Well, knowledge is sorrow really.\n\n  He was right. The knowledge that he no longer walks among us brings \nsorrow to every New Yorker and American. He grew up in Hell's Kitchen, \nbut he brought a bit of heaven to the Senate. We are grateful for his \nbeing amongst us; his looking around those corners, seeing further than \nany of us could on our own.\n  Our thoughts and prayers go out to his wonderful wife Liz, his \nchildren, his grandchildren. We wish them strength, and we want them to \nknow that Pat Moynihan was a blessing, a blessing to the Senate, a \nblessing to New York, and a blessing to America.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me first of all commend both of our \ncolleagues from New York, Senators Schumer and Clinton, for their very \neloquent remarks about our former colleague and dear friend, Pat \nMoynihan. I know not only the Moynihan family but the people of New \nYork and others around this great country who have had the privilege of \nknowing and spending time with Pat Moynihan deeply appreciate their \ncomments and their words. I join in expressing my deep sense of loss of \na towering figure of American life, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, \nwhom we all know passed away yesterday. My heart certainly goes out to \nSenator Moynihan's family at this most difficult time, his remarkable \nwife Liz and their three children, Timothy, Maura, and John, as well as \nthe entire Moynihan family.\n  All of us, every single American, even those who may never have heard \nhis name or are unaware of his contribution, lost a member of the \nfamily in a sense with the death of Pat Moynihan. That is because for \nmore than half a century, Pat Moynihan served the American people as a \nsoldier, a teacher, as an author, an assistant to four American \nPresidents, an Ambassador to India and the United Nations and, of \ncourse, a Member of this Chamber for 24 years, from 1976 to the year \n2000.\n  Pat Moynihan, to those of us who knew him so well, was an \nintellectual giant who never lost sight of what makes America tick, in \nits most fundamental way our nation's people and our nation's families. \nHe had a deep appreciation and abiding of America's families as the \nbackbone of our nation's social and economic structure that has \nprovided us with stability and growth and success for more than two \ncenturies.\n  And he was, of course, an unparalleled leader in pointing out \nweaknesses in America's families and ways in which we might strengthen \nthem.\n\n  Generations of Americans, many of whom will never have known or \npossibly even have heard of Pat Moynihan, will reap the benefits of \nthis most compassionate and thoughtful leader among leaders.\n  A true American success story by any calculation, Pat Moynihan rose \nfrom the rough neighborhood of New York City's Hell's Kitchen to become \none of America's leading intellectuals. He earned a bachelor's degree, \ntwo masters degrees, a law degree, and a PhD as well as teaching \nappointments at Harvard, MIT, and Syracuse University.\n  Pat Moynihan was much more than simply a man of letters. He, above \nall else, combined his intellectual capacity with a strong sense of \naction; of getting things done.\n  Pat Moynihan brought life to the notion that ideas serve as the \nengine of democracy. Many of the most thoughtful and progressive \nlegislative programs that have improved the lives of his beloved New \nYork and all around our Nation and across the globe for the past 40 \nyears originated in the brilliant mind of Pat Moynihan. From protecting \nunderprivileged children, to passionately defending the Social Security \nsystem, to questioning America's role in the world at pivotal moments \nin our history, Pat Moynihan's intellectual agility was only matched by \nhis desire to make America a better nation, a fairer nation, and a more \nsuccessful one.\n  The description ``renaissance figure'' is too liberally applied to \npeople who don't deserve it, in my view. That is not the case with Pat \nMoynihan. He truly was a renaissance figure, a person who could breeze \neasily and expertly from issue to issue. He would expound upon what is \nneeded to improve mass transit systems nationwide one moment, explain \nwhat is needed to achieve excellence in our public education system in \nthe next, and finish off with his latest idea to bring majesty to the \narchitecture along Pennsylvania Avenue, all in a very seamless way.\n  I have heard the remarks of many of our colleagues and others over \nthe last 24 hours in sharing their grief over the loss of our friend. \nAs I have read and heard these remarks, in newspapers and public \naccounts, it struck me that the words describing Pat Moynihan that are \nbeing most repeated over and over again are courageous, compassionate, \nprincipled, thoughtful, brilliant, and the like.\n  Few individuals have been so universally revered by so many here in \nWashington and across the Nation for their determination to make a \ndifference in helping to steer our Nation in the right direction over a \nhalf century. That is because for decades Pat Moynihan embodied the \nhighest ideals and values of our Nation since its founding. This was \nrecognized by Democratic Presidents and Republican ones alike. He \nserved for both of them, and he served well. It was recognized by every \none of his Senate colleagues, regardless of party or ideology, who had \nthe great fortune to have worked with him in this Chamber.\n\n[[Page S4502]]\n\n  Frederick Douglass once said:\n\n       The life of a nation is secure only while the nation is \n     honest, truthful, and virtuous.\n\n  For 40 years Pat Moynihan lent those characteristics to the heart of \nthe U.S. Government. Pat Moynihan's death leaves a void in this \nChamber, and in this country, that will not soon, if ever, be filled\n  I would like to think that there will be more Pat Moynihan's coming \ndown the pike, to serve in this Chamber, and in other important \ncapacities nationwide. I would like to think that there will be more \nindividuals with the style, and wit, and substance of Pat Moynihan to \nhelp guide our nation through the multitude of complex issues we \nconfront now and into the future.\n  I would like to think so, but the truth is Pat Moynihan was one of a \nkind. We will have to make due without him. I only count my blessings \nthat I had a chance to serve with him in the United States Senate, and \nto have been able to call him a friend.\n  I conclude my remarks by expressing my deep sense of loss to Liz and \nthe rest of the Moynihan family. This country has lost a remarkable \nindividual, a person who made significant contributions to the health \nand well-being of this Nation. But to those of us who had the joy of \nserving with this delightful man from Ireland, we have lost a wonderful \nfriend, someone we will miss with a great sense of loss for the rest of \nour lives.\n  I express my gratitude and those of my family to the Moynihan family, \nthe people of New York, and to our colleagues and staffs and others who \nworked with him during those four decades of public service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today is a very sad day for America and for \nthose of us who served in the United States Senate with one of its most \nvisionary and accomplished members, a great man, a great American, \nSenator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, who died yesterday.\n  It stretches the mind just to think of all of the important positions \nthat Pat Moynihan held, including Cabinet or sub-Cabinet posts under \nfour Presidents: John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and \nGerald Ford. He served as Ambassador to India in the 1970s and then as \nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. He came to the United States \nSenate in 1977 already a scholar, author and public official of great \ndistinction and renown. In the 24 years he spent here, he only greatly \nexpanded his enormous reputation and body of work. Pat Moynihan was a \nSenator's Senator. Over the years, he earned the respect of every \nMember of the Senate--and we all learned a great deal from him.\n  Pat Moynihan was a person who showed tremendous vision throughout his \nlife. He showed foresight about the importance of a strong family and \nabout the importance of strong communities in America. He raised the \ncritical importance of these basic values and concerns about the \ndeterioration of these family values, long before others. He showed \ngreat foresight about our Constitution. One of the highlights for me in \nmy service in the Senate was joining Senator Moynihan and Senator \nRobert Byrd in fighting successfully against the line item veto as a \nviolation of our Constitution. And, he showed great foresight about the \nworld and the role of the United States in international affairs. His \nwork at the United Nations and in the Senate, as a former chairman of \nthe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and as chairman of the \nFinance Committee was marked by his perceptive, analytical, and worldly \nview on trade, foreign policy, and intelligence matters. Long before \nothers, Senator Moynihan was speaking of the economic and ultimately \nmilitary weaknesses of the Soviet Union and predicting its collapse--at \na time when most of the American intelligence community was \noverestimating its strength.\n  It is virtually impossible to list all of Pat Moynihan's \naccomplishments in the U.S. Senate. Among the most lasting, however, \nwill be his efforts on behalf of architectural excellence in the \nNation's Capital. He was a crucial force behind the return to greatness \nof the Pennsylvania Avenue corridor between the U.S. Capitol and the \nWhite House, the restoration of Washington's beautiful, elegant, and \nhistoric Union Station, and the construction of the Thurgood Marshall \nJudiciary Building here on Capitol Hill.\n  And Pat could pack a punch, wielding his sharp sense of humor as a \ndevastating weapon as when, in 1981, when the plastic covering used to \nprotect the workers on the then-new Hart Senate Office Building was \nremoved. No fan of the lack of architectural merit of the Senate's \nnewest office building, he suggested that the plastic be immediately \nput back. He commented, ``Even in a democracy, there are things it is \nas well the people do not know about their Government.''\n  The author or editor of eighteen books, Senator Moynihan was at the \nforefront of the national debate on issues ranging from welfare reform, \nto tax policy to international relations. His most recent book, written \nin 1998, ``Secrecy: The American Experience'' expands on the report of \nthe Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy of which \nhe was the Chairman. This is a fascinating and provocative review of \nthe history of the development of secrecy in the government since World \nWar I and argument for an ``era of openness.''\n  At home in New York, in a State which is known for its rough and \ntumble politics, he demonstrated leadership again and again, exercising \nthe power of intellect and the ability to rise above the fray. That has \nbeen a wonderful contribution not just to New York but to all of \nAmerica.\n  The ``Almanac of American Politics'' once noted ``Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan [was] the nation's best thinker among politicians since \nLincoln and its best politician among thinkers since Jefferson.'' Pat \nmade a huge contribution to this body and its reputation. I will never \nforgot him.\n  His wife, Liz, his children, grandchildren and the entire Moynihan \nfamily are in our hearts and our prayers today. Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan's memory will continue to serve as an inspiration to us all in \nthe Senate family--as he was in life--to better serve the country that \nhe loved so much.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, so many Senators have spoken so \neloquently about the loss of Senator Moynihan; but no one has been \nlistened to in their speeches like they listened to our friend in the \nbow tie with the staccato delivery. Standing in this Chamber, he would \noverwhelm with his original thoughts, including overwhelming this \nSenator who had the good fortune to listen to his ideas for all 24 of \nhis years here.\n  The saddest part about losing our friend is we lose him when we need \nhim most.\n  He was the authority on Social Security, just when we need someone to \nstand up and expose the numbers that these voodoo tax cuts are taking \nout of the Social Security trust funds. He was the United Nations \nAmbassador who spoke bluntly, just when we need a guy with an opinion \nto straighten out those people up in New York. He was the architect who \nturned Pennsylvania Avenue into a grand boulevard, just when we need \nsomeone to figure out how to protect against terrorism and not undo the \nbeauty he brought to this city.\n  Right to the point: he was from the world of intellect, not from the \nnonsense poll watchers. This Senator will miss the gregarious big man \nwith the biggest of the big ideas, who nevertheless got things done in \nthis Chamber.\n  My wife Peatsy joins me in extending our deepest sympathy to his \nwonderful wife Elizabeth and their family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, our dear colleague, Pat Moynihan, was a \ntrue giant in the Senate, and his loss is deeply felt by all of us who \nknew him and admired him. He was a brilliant statesman and legislator, \nand he was also a wonderful friend to all the Kennedys throughout his \nextraordinary career in the public life of the nation.\n  Forty-two years ago, President Kennedy enlisted many of the finest \nminds of his generation to serve in the New Frontier. Among the \noutstanding young men and women who answered his call was the brilliant \nyoung Irishman who became a special assistant to Jack's Secretary of \nLabor--and then an Assistant Secretary of Labor himself--Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan. On that snowy Inauguration Day in January 1961, the torch was \npassed to that new generation of Americans, and Pat Moynihan helped to \nhold it high in all the years that followed.\n\n[[Page S4503]]\n\n  Pat leaves an outstanding legacy of extraordinary public service and \nbrilliant intellectual achievement that all of us are proud of, and \nthat President Kennedy would have been proud of, too.\n  Throughout his remarkable career, Pat was on the front lines on the \ngreat social, political, and cultural challenges of the day. To know \nhim was to love him--the remarkable intellect, the exceptional clarity \nof his thinking--the abiding Irish wit that impressed and enthralled us \nall so often. We were not alone. Pat's qualities and achievements \ncaptivated, educated, and inspired an entire generation of Americans.\n  All of us in Congress and around the Nation learned a great deal from \nPat, and we will miss him dearly. His wisdom and experience contributed \nimmensely to the progress our country has made on a wide variety of \nissues. We loved the professor in him.\n  It was not unusual for Senators on both sides of the aisle to come to \nthe Senate floor to hear Pat speak--Senators sitting like students in a \nclass, trying to understand a complex issue we were struggling with.\n  The whole Senate loved and respected Pat. As he often said, ``If you \ndon't have 30 years to devote to social policy, don't get involved.'' \nHe dedicated his brilliant mind and his beautiful Irish heart to that \nchallenge, and America is a stronger and better and fairer nation today \nbecause of his contributions. With his great insight, and wisdom, he \nskillfully questioned the way things worked, constantly searching for \nnew and better ways to enable all Americans to achieve their dreams.\n  In the 24 years Pat served with us in the Senate, he was the \narchitect of many of the Nation's most progressive initiatives to help \nour fellow citizens, especially those in need. He left his mark on \nvirtually every major piece of domestic policy legislation enacted by \nCongress.\n  He had a central role in shaping the debate on welfare reform, and he \nwas a visionary when it came to protecting and strengthening Medicare \nand Social Security. He spearheaded the major transportation \nlegislation that provides indispensable support for highways throughout \nthe country and for mass transit in our cities.\n  An important part of Pat's legacy is the restoration of Pennsylvania \nAvenue, which my friend and colleague, Senator Schumer, referenced--the \nnation's principal thoroughfare. The key to that dream was the \npreservation of Lafayette Park, right across from the White House. \nJackie Kennedy Onassis put forward the vision that she and Pat shared \nto preserve that famous national square and the townhouses that \nsurround it, which are such a vital part of our history and our \narchitectural heritage.\n  Throughout his career, Pat worked brilliantly, effectively, \ntirelessly, and with great political skill, to promote the highest \nvalues of public service. And in doing so, he earned well-deserved \nrenown and respect from all of us in Congress on both sides of the \naisle, from Republican and Democratic administrations alike, from \npolitical thinkers, foreign policy experts, and leaders of other \nnations as well.\n  In a world of increasing specialization, there was no limit to his \ninterest or his intellect or his ability. In so many ways, he was the \nliving embodiment of what our Founding Fathers had in mind when they \ncreated the United States Senate. And he did it all without ever losing \nhis common touch, because he cared so deeply about the millions of \ncitizens he served so well, the people of New York.\n  One of my own happiest associations with Pat was our work together to \nend the violence in Northern Ireland and bring peace to that beautiful \nland of our ancestors. Pat and I worked closely with Tip O'Neill and \nHugh Carey on that issue, and they called us the ``Four Horsemen.''\n  Pat believed very deeply in that cause and in all the other great \ncauses he did so much to advance during his long and brilliant career. \nWhether serving in the Navy or as professor, adviser to Presidents, \nAmbassador, or Senator, Pat brought out the best in everyone he \ntouched, and his mark on earth will be remembered forever.\n  At another dark time in our history, after President Kennedy was \ntaken from us, Pat said, ``I don't think there's any point in being \nIrish if you don't know that the world is going to break your heart \neventually.'' Pat's loss breaks all our hearts today, and we know we \nwill never forget him. We never forgot the lilt of his Irish laughter \nthat stole our hearts away.\n  My heart goes out to Liz and the entire Moynihan family. We will miss \nPat very much, and we will do our best to carry on his incomparable \nwork to make our country and our world a better place.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I spoke briefly last night of the sorrow \nwe all felt on hearing that our former colleague, Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan, passed away. This afternoon, I join with Senators Schumer, \nClinton, Kennedy, Dodd, and others to return to the floor to say a bit \nmore for the record about this truly remarkable man and about how much \nthe Senate and the Nation will miss him.\n  Opening this morning's newspapers at a time when news of the war in \nIraq seems to eclipse all else, I found it fitting that Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan was--as he was so often during his long public career--once \nagain front page news. Newspapers across the nation--and indeed, around \nthe world--are filled today with accounts of Senator Moynihan's life \nand work.\n  What has been written in just the short time since his death \nyesterday afternoon reminds us how extraordinary pat Moynihan really \nwas.\n  The New York times--the newspaper Senator Moynihan read religiously \nevery day, from cover to cover, we are told--reported that he ``brought \na scholar's eye for data to politics and a politician's sense of the \nreal world to academia.''\n  The Washington Post noted that he ``pursued with distinction enough \ncareers for half a dozen men of lesser talents and imagination: \npolitician, presidential adviser, diplomat, author, professor, public \nintellectual.''\n  In talking about Senator Moynihan with colleagues and friends last \nnight and today, it strikes me that everyone seems to come back to one \nidea: People like Pat Moynihan simply do not come along every day.\n  I said yesterday that he seemed larger than life. He was also, truly, \none of a kind. Senator Moynihan's myriad public accomplishments are \nbeing--and will no doubt continue to be--well documented.\n  Today, I want to add to what has been said in the press and on this \nfloor some of the less-frequently mentioned things that made Pat \nspecial to those of us who had the privilege to know him and work with \nhim.\n  Pat Moynihan enlivened the Senate. He did so in many ways, but there \nare three in particular that come to mind for me today.\n  First was the way he applied his encyclopedic mind to the \ndeliberations of the Senate. In our Democratic caucus meetings, in \ncommittee hearings, and here on the floor, he elevated our discourse. \nHe would make a point, and drive it home, by drawing on his sweeping \nknowledge of history, literature, poetry, and the arts. He could quote \nfrom hundreds of sources--from memory.\n\n  Listening to Pat speak extemporaneously, you might be treated to \nverbatim quotes from Disraeli or Churchill, Yeats or Robert Frost, \nDylan Thomas, Evelyn Waugh, Arthur Conan Doyle, or Shakespeare. He \nalways had just the right quote to support his argument, and he always \nquoted accurately.\n  In once read that the staff of the Shakespeare Theater here--where \nPat was a frequent patron--often noticed him silently mouthing the \nwords of the play--as the actors spoke them.\n  A second gift of Pat's that we all treasured was his ready sense of \nhumor. It was a puckish, mischievous wit, and it never failed to \nsurprise and amuse us.\n  I remember when the Hart Senate Office Building was completed. Pat \nwas never an admirer of the architecture of the Hart Senate Office \nBuilding. In\n\n[[Page S4504]]\n\nfact, he thought it was downright ugly. When the building was finished \nand the construction tarp was taken down, Pat introduced a resolution \nsaying the tarp should be put back up.\n  Pat also knew how to use his wit to disarm. He was famously blunt and \ndirect with the press. But he also knew how to use humor to avoid \nquestions he preferred not to answer.\n  Nearly every week, he invited the New York press corps into his \noffice in the Russell Building for coffee and to answer questions. If \nhe chose to, he could crack a hilarious joke and have the press in \nstitches. By the time they got through laughing, they had forgotten the \nquestion altogether.\n  Finally, Pat Moynihan was a fierce Senate institutionalist--a quality \nthat endeared him to me, to Senator Byrd, and to so many of us.\n  Pat Moynihan loved and revered this institution--much as he loved and \nrevered public service.\n  His respect for the Senate showed itself in many ways, from his stout \ndefense of Senate powers and prerogatives to his keen interest in the \narchitectural preservation of the Capitol Building and its environs.\n  Pat had a sentimental side, as many of us do, when it came to this \nbuilding.\n  On special occasions, he loved to present friends with a gift of \nsandstone bookends made from the old East Front of the Capitol. With \neach presentation of those treasured stones, Pat loved to tell an \nelaborate story about the political intrigue surrounding the extension \nof the East Front in the 1950s.\n  These are just a few of the special things that come to mind as we \nreflect on the unique life and legacy of our friend and former \ncolleague.\n  I said last night that in losing Pat Moynihan, New York and the \nNation have lost a giant. And, as Winston Churchill once said of \nanother great patriot, we shall not see his like again.\n  On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I again extend \nsincerest condolences to Pat's beloved wife and partner, Liz, to their \nchildren, Tim, John, and Maura, and to their grandchildren, Zora and \nMichael Patrick.\n  We thank them for sharing so much of their husband, father and \ngrandfather with us. Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this \nhour.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues to mourn \nthe passing of and express respect and admiration for the service of \nour former colleague, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, whom we recently lost.\n  Before I came to this body, I had heard a great deal about Pat \nMoynihan. Who had not? If you followed Government, if you were \ninterested in policy, Pat Moynihan probably said something that was \nvery important. He was way ahead of his time on some issues. On other \nissues, I disagreed with him rather strongly, but you knew if Pat \nMoynihan spoke, it was going to be worth listening to. If you did not \nagree with him, you were going to have to work hard to counter it.\n  I had some disagreements with the distinguished Senator from New \nYork. As a matter of fact, in the 1992 highway bill, I had a \nspectacular confrontation with him. We disagreed over a courthouse that \nwas included in the highway bill. Thereafter, we became very good \nfriends, and I think as a result of our rather tumultuous getting \nacquainted, I had the opportunity to spend a good bit of time with him.\n  We were neighbors in an area of the Capitol where we both had \nworkspaces. I spent a number of evenings enjoying a discussion with him \nas we watched the debates on the floor of the Senate. His ability to \ndiscuss and have insightful observations about so many subjects was \ntruly impressive. If I ever met a Renaissance man, it was Pat Moynihan.\n  I will give one example. Everybody knows the great role he played in \nrevitalizing Pennsylvania Avenue and the leadership he provided. He was \na great student of architecture. One of the projects we worked on in \nMissouri was saving the Wainwright Building, the first steel-framed \nskyscraper designed by Louis Sullivan. I mentioned it to him one day. \nHe proceeded to give me a short course in architecture and the role of \nLouis Sullivan and his draftsman, Frank Lloyd Wright, which went far \nbeyond the knowledge I had of the building in St. Louis. As a student \nof architecture, as a student who appreciated the benefits architecture \nbrings to the quality of life, he was absolutely without peer.\n  There were many other issues, and I know my colleagues will have many \nthoughts to share about him, but I wanted to rise to say to those he \nleaves behind that he was truly an outstanding servant, one whose \nfriendship and whose insights and experiences I personally will always \nhold dear. I know this body is far richer for his presence and his \nservice.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I also rise to join with my colleagues on \nthe passing of Pat Moynihan. Where does one start when a friend and \ncolleague leaves us?\n  When Senator Moynihan retired from the Senate, where he served our \ncountry and his State so well, he really did not leave us. Now in this, \nhis last transition, he will not leave us. He left so much of himself \nwith us. His words will remain with us for years to come.\n  I did not join the Senate until 1989. Being on the opposite side of \nthe aisle--I was one who had not earned his spurs yet--I did not have \nthe opportunity to get to know him until we went on a trip together to \nthe Persian Gulf during Desert Shield in 1990. I can say my life has \nbeen richly blessed serving with a lot of men and women who have since \nretired from this body. He was one of those people.\n  That was a great trip to the Persian Gulf. We spent a lot of hours in \nflight and spent a lot of hours in conversation, which was truly \nenlightening to this Senator from a rural State such as Montana. Our \nrelationship grew from that point, and I realized what a marvelous man \nhe really was.\n  He was a man true to his faith and principles. His intellect stood \nhim apart from most men I have ever known, but he coupled that \nintellect with good old-fashioned common sense and deep wisdom.\n  The subject matter of the conversation did not make any difference. \nHe could relate to anyone on a common ground. The ability to \ncommunicate with anybody who is not blessed with the same amount of \ninstitutional information or knowledge of any issue that may confront \npolicymakers on a daily basis is a wonderful talent. He was one I held \nin high esteem, as he was one of the most intelligent men I have ever \nknown.\n  It is unusual to find a person of that caliber to be blessed with a \ngreat sense of humor, and to put it on our level. He was quick, and his \nhumor would sneak up on you. A man of his own style, very comfortable \nwith himself, his presentations on the floor, in committee, or in \npublic were strictly Pat Moynihan. We shall miss his voice on the floor \nof the Senate for several reasons, and printed words cannot describe \nthat distinct sound.\n  I notice my friend from West Virginia is in the Chamber. Senator \nMoynihan sat only two seats behind Senator Byrd.\n  We can hear him today say: Mr. President, may we have order.\n  That was distinctly a call we all knew, understood, and respected. I \nshall miss him. I shall never forget him. Whatever accolades he may \nreceive, he earned every one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President:\n\n       There is a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive \n     down into the blackest gorges and soar out of them again and \n     become invisible in the sunny spaces. And even if he forever \n     flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the mountains; so \n     that even in his lowest swoop, the mountain eagle is still \n     higher than other birds upon the plain, even though they \n     soar.\n  I was saddened to learn last night of the death of one of the most \neducated, most versatile, and most gifted persons ever to bless this \nChamber, and one of my favorites, our former colleague, Senator Daniel \nPatrick Moynihan.\n  With doctorate and law degrees from the Fletcher School of Law and \nDiplomacy, he was a Fulbright scholar and the author of a number of \nsometimes controversial, but important, books. He held academic \npositions at several of our country's most prestigious universities, \nincluding Syracuse, Harvard, and MIT.\n\n[[Page S4505]]\n\n  Unable to settle into an academic life, Pat Moynihan went on to serve \nin high positions in the administrations of Presidents John F. Kennedy, \nLyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Gerald Ford--making him the first \nand only person to serve in the Cabinet or subcabinets of four \nsuccessive administrations. His Government work included serving as the \nAmerican Ambassador to India and as the United States Permanent \nRepresentative to the United Nations.\n  Even with this background, and these accomplishments, Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan still refused to rest. In fact, his greatest work, I might \neven go so far as to say his destiny, was still ahead. In 1976, he was \nelected to the first of four terms in the United States Senate.\n  I was then the Democratic whip. I knew I was going to be the next \nSenate majority leader, so I welcomed Pat Moynihan to the Senate and \nassured him I would do my best to see that he got appointed to the \nSenate Finance Committee. That is where he wanted to go.\n  So it was in this chamber that the talents, the skills, and the \npowerful intellect of this philosopher-statesman shined the brightest.\n  It was more than his outstanding work as a Senator from a large and \npowerful State.\n  It was more than his outstanding work as chairman of the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee and as chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee.\n  It was that he was a visionary with the strongest sense of the \npragmatic, an idealist with the most profound grasp of what was \npractical, an internationalist who always put our country first. With \nhis keen and profound historical perspective and his incredible breadth \nof knowledge ranging from taxes to international law, he had the \nuncanny ability to make us confront issues that needed to be \nconfronted, and to cut to the core of a problem and then help us to \nsolve it.\n  A person and a Senator not only of high intellectual quality, but \nalso high intellectual honesty, Senator Moynihan took on the \ncomplicated and politically sensitive issues, like Social Security, \nhealth care, and welfare reform, with passion and compassion; he took \non these mighty subjects with determination and foresight and with \nunflinching integrity.\n  I have never forgotten, and will never forget, our valiant fight \ntogether to challenge and defeat the line-item veto. I wish he were \nhere now. This was one of his many struggles to preserve and to protect \nour constitutional system. We need more Pat Moynihans who would take an \nunflinching stand for the Constitution and this institution. He truly \nbelieved in our Constitution just as he truly believed in the mission \nas well as the traditions, the rules, and the folkways of the United \nStates Senate. He knew that the American Government is not the monster \nthat demagogues fear and like to portray but a positive, creative force \nin American life that has helped all Americans to enjoy better, safer, \nand more productive lives.\n  Senator Moynihan retired from the Senate in the year 2000. But he was \none of those Senators who was so much a part of this institution that \nhe has never really left it. I still look over at his seat and sit in \nmy own and turn it in that direction and listen to him. I can hear him; \nI can still see him. Yes, just like I still see Richard B. Russell who \nsat at this seat and who departed this life on January 21, 1971; like I \ncan still see Everett Dirksen, that flamboyant Republican orator and \nleader; as I can see Lister Hill of Alabama, and the other great \nlawmakers with whom I have had the privilege and the honor of serving.\n\n  I look over there and see his unruly hair, his crooked bow tie, his \nglasses that always seemed about to fall off his face, and that \nunforgettable Irish twinkle in his eyes.\n  But I have missed his incredible grasp of the issues. I have missed \nhis intellectual vigor, and his incisive wit and wisdom. In these \ndifficult and trying times, I, and the Senate, have sorely missed his \ninnate sense of fairness, and his unbounded and unqualified \ndetermination to do the right thing regardless of political party or \npolitical consequences. As I said when he retired from the Senate, \n``His conscience is his compass. . . . Senator Moynihan states facts, \nthe cold, hard truths that many others in high places refuse to face \nand that some are unable to see.''\n  Senator Moynihan lived the lifetime of ten mortals. An author, \nambassador, a college professor, an outstanding public servant, and a \ngreat United States Senator, he accomplished so much. He leaves an \nindelible mark on this country. His legacy is intact. His was a \ncreative and successful life. And, he was blessed with a wonderful and \ngracious wife, Elizabeth. My wife, Erma, and I extend our deepest and \nheartfelt condolences to Pat's entire family.\n  I close my remarks by reciting the immortal words of Josiah Gilbert \nHolland:\n\n     God give us men!\n     A time like this demands strong minds,\n     great hearts, true faith, and ready hands.\n     Men whom the lust of office does not kill;\n     Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy;\n     Men who possess opinions and a will;\n     Men who have honor; men who will not lie.\n\n     Men who can stand before a demagogue\n     And brave his treacherous flatteries without winking.\n\n     Tall men, sun--crowned;\n     Who live above the fog,\n     In public duty and in private thinking.\n     For while the rabble with its thumbworn creeds,\n     It's large professions and its little deeds,\n     mingles in selfish strife,\n     Lo! Freedom weeps!\n\n     Wrong rules the land and waiting justice sleeps.\n     God give us men!\n\n     Men who serve not for selfish booty;\n     But real men, courageous, who flinch not at duty.\n     Men of dependable character;\n     Men of sterling worth;\n     Then wrongs will be redressed, and right will rule the earth.\n     God Give us Men!\n\n  Mr. President, those of us who knew Daniel Patrick Moynihan, \nespecially those of us who served with him here in the Senate, will \nremember his ``strong mind,'' his ``great heart,'' his ``true faith,'' \nand his ``ready hands.'' We will remember him as a man of ``dependable \ncharacter'' and ``sterling worth.''\n  Thank you, God, for giving us Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \noffering a tribute to the late distinguished Senator Patrick Moynihan, \na role model, an inspiration, a friend, and my fellow Senator. I can \nonly hope that with my poor speaking skills, in comparison certainly to \nhis, I can do justice to his many virtues and innumerable contributions \nhe made to this Nation. I know today many of my colleagues are lauding \nhim for his principled stands, even if it meant feeling exiled in \nSiberia. He many times fought the lonely and oftentimes frustrating \nfight, but he knew what was right and that sustained him through the \nyears of criticism and controversy and, ultimately, was normally proven \nright. He was a great role model.\n  In fact, when I first met the Senator from New York, one of the \nthings that came to my mind was what the German poet, Johann Wolfgang \nvon Goethe, once said:\n\n       Talents are best nurtured in solitude; character is best \n     formed in the stormy billows of the world.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       He who is firm and resolute in will, molds the world to \n     himself.\n\n  I can't think of anybody to which this statement applies better than \nto Senator Moynihan. He has always been willing to stand upon his \nprinciples, in solitude if necessary, to weather the stormy billows of \nthe world, to truly mold the world to himself.\n  He has been someone who has been the epitome of being firm and \nresolute in will, no matter the criticism, the controversy or the \ncircumstances.\n  In fact, when he first wrote his report to President Johnson, for \nexample, 40\n\n[[Page S4506]]\n\nyears ago, highlighting the rising out-of-wedlock birthrates that were \ntaking place in the country, he felt that this threatened the stability \nof the family, particularly minority families, one of the building \nblocks of our society. He was roundly attacked at that time. Rather \nthan seeing this report rightly as a chilling foreboding of problems to \ncome, people chose to turn a blind eye to the truth upon which he so \ncorrectly shed light. Now we have reached a stage where the out-of-\nwedlock birthrates in all the communities in our country have reached \ndangerous proportions, and everyone is in agreement about exactly how \ndangerous this is.\n  How many times we have heard, ``Patrick Moynihan was right.'' How \nmany times should we have had to hear it said? Senator Moynihan always \nunderstood the overriding importance of the truth, of ensuring that \nthere is substance behind one's politics and not just words. He showed \nthis time and time again.\n  For example, one of the most important chapters of our Nation's story \nof human freedom and dignity is the history and legacy of the African-\nAmerican march towards freedom, legal equality, and full participation \nin American society. Senator Moynihan understood the importance of this \nhistory, which is why in the 102d Congress he championed the effort to \ncreate a National African American Museum, a vital project upon which \nCongressman Lewis and I now have spent several years working and which \nwe hope to get to completion.\n  With Senator Moynihan's leadership, at that time the museum idea \nsuccessfully passed the Senate but, unfortunately, did not pass the \nHouse and to this day we picked up his mantle and are still working on \nit.\n  Senator Moynihan understood why it was so critical to honor this \nhistory, truly the history of not just African Americans but of our \nNation. His commitment was key to the first efforts.\n\n  As I seek to move forward the legislation to create the museum, I am \nhonored that I am now carrying on the work he began in this body. It \ncertainly makes for very big shoes to fill, but I am only hopeful that \nin his memory I may do just efforts justice.\n  Billy Graham once said:\n\n       Courage is contagious. When a brave man takes a stand the \n     spine of others are often stiffened.\n\n  This was always true when we associated with Senator Moynihan. \nSomehow, people seemed to stand a little taller, act more resolute. \nThey even argued better. No one could ever out argue Senator Moynihan, \nbut somehow the challenge of having such a talented opponent made one's \nown skills sharper.\n  There is so much more to my friend, though, than what is so obviously \nand publicly known. For example, so many of us here experienced his \nwonderful and robust sense of humor, something I wish everyone could \nhave had the pleasure of participating in seeing. Senator Moynihan was \nall of this and much, much more.\n  He was often described as the great statesman of the Senate, a breed \nthat seems more and more difficult to find in politics. He was always a \nsteadfast defender of American principles. He was also someone who \nbrought dignity, character, and humor to this body. He has been and \nalways will be the role model of the true statesman.\n  In the Second Epistle to Timothy, Paul writes:\n\n       I have fought the good fight, I finished the course, I have \n     kept the faith.\n\n  Senator Moynihan certainly did so. All of us here and across the \nNation have benefited.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as we bring to a close what has been a very \nproductive week over the last 4 days here in the Senate, we have had \nups and downs and a lot of very productive debate. Many sad events have \nbeen talked about on the floor, and many happy events have actually \nbeen talked about on the floor, with the range from the death of Daniel \nPatrick Moynihan, an icon who has spoken so many times from this floor \nto the American people--indeed, to the world--to the many comments made \nin morning business over the course of this week paying tribute to our \nmen and women, our soldiers overseas; a resolution today commending the \ncoalition of allies who support the United States and our British \nfriends in the efforts that are underway as I speak today; all the way \nto a budget that is a culmination, in many ways, of weeks and weeks of \nwork as we have defined the priorities of this body in spending the \ntaxpayers' dollars for the foreseeable future--a first step, the \nculmination of a lot of debate and discussion as we go through our \nconference with the House over the next several weeks.\n  We had a lot of ups and a lot of downs but a lot of progress, and we \nare doing the Nation's business at the same time we are paying respect \nto the incidents that are playing out before us in the international \nand domestic realm. Last night I had the opportunity of introducing the \nresolution, along with Senator Daschle, paying respects to Senator \nMoynihan and, as I mentioned in my opening comments today, once again, \nthe great legacy that he leaves all of us.\n  I would like to pay one final tribute to him, and read just a few \nparagraphs from the commencement speech he gave at Harvard in 2002, \nwhich has previously been printed in the Record.\n  The commencement speech at Harvard, 2002, is entitled ``Civilization \nNeed Not Die'' by Daniel Patrick Moynihan:\n       Last February, some 60 academics of the widest range of \n     political persuasion and religious belief, a number from here \n     at Harvard, including Huntington, published a manifesto: \n     ``What We're Fighting For: A Letter from America.''\n       It has attracted some attention here; perhaps more abroad, \n     which was our purpose. Our references are wide, Socrates, St. \n     Augustine, Franciscus de Victoria, John Paul II, Martin \n     Luther King, Jr., Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the Universal \n     Declaration of Human Rights.\n       We affirmed ``five fundamental truths that pertain to all \n     people without distinction,'' beginning ``all human beings \n     are born free and equal in dignity and rights.''\n       We allow for our own shortcomings as a nation, sins, \n     arrogance, failings. But we assert we are no less bound by \n     moral obligation. And finally, . . . reason and careful moral \n     reflection . . . teach us that there are times when the first \n     and most important reply to evil is to stop it.\n       But there is more. Forty-seven years ago, on this occasion, \n     General George C. Marshall summoned our nation to restore the \n     countries whose mad regimes had brought the world such \n     horror. It was an act of statesmanship and vision without \n     equal in history. History summons us once more in different \n     ways, but with even greater urgency. Civilization need not \n     die. At this moment, only the United States can save it. As \n     we fight the war against evil, we must also wage peace, \n     guided by the lesson of the Marshall Plan--vision and \n     generosity can help make the world a safer place.\n\n  Those are the words of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, again, in 2002. They \nreflect very much the global thinking, the compassion, the integrity, \nthe foresight of this great icon in this body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/27/senate-section/article/S4506-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4506-S4507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SUPPORTING COALITION TROOPS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to take just one final moment and \ncomment on our troops overseas. President Bush and Prime Minister Blair \nmet today at Camp David, just a few hours ago. Today we passed in this \nSenate unanimously a Senate resolution to commend the members of the \ncoalition for their support of this noble cause.\n  On this day of Prime Minister Blair's visit, I want him to know, and \nI want the Record to reflect, that the Senate and the American people \nare grateful for his courage, for the courage of the British people \nand, above all, for the courage of the British troops fighting shoulder \nto shoulder with the American troops in Iraq.\n  We have seen more evidence of the brutal tactics of Saddam Hussein's \nregime: Iraqi soldiers dressed in civilian clothes; Iraqi soldiers \nsurrendering and then firing on coalition forces; military equipment \nplaced in residential areas and near cultural sites; even reports of \nIraqi soldiers using women as shields and giving weapons to children.\n  These and other horrific acts that we have been able to witness \nfirsthand as they played out over the last 7 days lead us only to \nstrengthen our coalition's resolve. Let there be no doubt,\n\n[[Page S4507]]\n\nwe are engaged in a just war against evil.\n  We continue to see the courage of our troops. I am especially proud \nas a Tennessean of the 101st Airborne out of Fort Campbell. It is Fort \nCampbell, KY. But if you look on a map, you see almost all of it--I \nhave to be careful--almost all of the land, the majority of the land, \nis in Tennessee. The 101st Airborne, as we all know from the media \ncoverage, has been dispatched to the battlefield. I have had the \nopportunity to look at a number of photographs. Although I know it is \ndifficult for my colleagues in the room to see, I just want to share \none of those photographs.\n  The caption underneath it reads as follows:\n\n       U.S. Pvt. Elizandro Gonzales, of the 502nd Infantry \n     Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, Air Assault, prepares his \n     M249 light machine gun before pressing forward to the north, \n     Thursday, March 26, 2003 in Iraq.\n\n  And the caption continues to read:\n\n       Gonzales said that he and the rest of his ground assault \n     convoy were ready to take the fight to the enemy.\n\n  That is the caption from the reporter who was with the photographer \nwho took this individual picture.\n  I show that picture and mention it because I look forward to the \nopportunity of joining members of the families of many of these \nsoldiers on Sunday at Fort Campbell so that I can personally express my \nappreciation for the sacrifices they are making, their families are \nmaking, and their friends are making overseas for all of us.\n  Mr. President, our prayers and our people continue to be with our \nbrave men and women in battle in Iraq.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/27/senate-section/article/S4507-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               INTERNATIONAL LAW REGARDING OCCUPIED IRAQ\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, next week we are going to have a \nsupplemental appropriations bill of at least $75 billion before the \nCongress of the United States for the funding necessary for the \nmilitary action in Iraq, at least for the early part of that action, \nwhich number could not have been decided when we passed the \nappropriations bills in January because at that point there would not \nhave been any military action. I raise this issue now in conjunction \nwith what there is in international law in regard to a victorious power \nin a nation, after the war is done, of what can be used of the natural \nresources of a country for the victorious country to administer the \nnation as well as to rebuild that nation.\n  The reason I raise these points about international law is because \nthere is very clear international law about what a victorious nation \ncan do and cannot do in regard to the resources of the defeated nation. \nI raise this issue at this point because I want to make sure the \nAmerican taxpayers are not saddled with any of the costs of rebuilding \nIraq that can be legitimately paid for, under international law, out of \nthe resources of Iraq.\n  After the first full week of the conflict, the allied forces have \npushed well into the country, liberating Iraqi populations across \nwestern and southern Iraq. These developments, then, raise an issue \nthat must be explored and discussed before we obligate taxpayers' money \nto rebuilding Iraq; that is, with regard to the United States and \nallied occupation of Iraq, what does international law tell us? What \ndoes international law dictate with regard to our rights as the \noccupying power to administer Iraq's oil resources and our obligations \nto the citizens of Iraq?\n  The Hague Convention of 1907 and the Geneva Convention provide the \nbasis for international law with regard to the obligations and rights \nof an occupying power. They provide specific guidelines for \nadministering the resources of the occupied territory and the \nobligations of the occupying power to provide for the welfare and the \nsafety of the occupied people.\n  With regard to the rights of an occupying power to use public \nproperty and resources, article 53 of Hague regulations of 1907 \nprovides that an occupying power can only take possession of state-\nowned property, and any seizure of private property must be restored \nand compensation provided when peace is made.\n  Further, article 55 provides:\n\n       The occupying State shall only be regarded as administrator \n     and usufructuary of the public buildings, real property, \n     forests and agricultural works belonging to the hostile \n     State.\n\n  The rules of usufruct provide a tenant--in this case it would be the \nUnited States or the coalition forces--the right to use and enjoy the \nprofits of property owned by Iraq, as long as the property is not \ndamaged or altered in any way. In addition, the allied forces may use \nthe public assets only for the benefit of Iraq and the Iraqi people, \nand to defray the costs of administration.\n  Secretary Powell recently reaffirmed this right. When discussing the \nissue of oilfields, he stated:\n\n       You can be sure that they [meaning the oilfields] would be \n     protected and the revenue generated from any such oil fields \n     would be used in accordance with international law and to the \n     benefit of the Iraqi people.\n\n  The occupying power may also take possession of public movable \nproperty only if such property can be directly or indirectly used for \nmilitary operations. Clearly, Iraq's oil reserves are susceptible to \nmilitary use and thereby subject to seizure by U.S. military forces \nunder the laws of war to restore Iraq.\n  In addition, the oil produced from Iraqi wells may be considered \nsimilar to the produce of public land which, under article 55, may be \nappropriated by the occupying power.\n  With regard to the obligations of the occupying power, article 43 of \nHague regulations of 1907 state:\n\n       The authority of the legitimate power, having actually \n     passed into the hands of the occupant, the latter shall take \n     steps in his power to restore and ensure, as far as possible, \n     public order and safety.\n\n  The Geneva Convention, relevant to the protection of civilian persons \nin time of war, states that the occupying power is also responsible for \nestablishing a direct system of administration and maintaining the \npublic order.\n  The key restriction to the use of Iraq's oil is that the proceeds are \nlimited to occupation purposes, which includes measures taken in the \nfurtherance of fulfilling that obligation that I just read under \narticle 43, to reestablish peace and order to Iraq. Clearly, \ninternational law provides that the United States is entitled to use \nthe money from oil sales to pay for such obligations as long as food \nand water, health care, roads and bridges, schools and airports, as \nexamples.\n  Once a viable Iraqi government is established, the oilfields must be \nreturned to Iraq in a reasonable condition.\n  One final issue for debate will be the role of the U.N. in the \nreconstruction and administration of Iraq. For example, what will \nremain of the United Nations Oil For Food Program in post-Saddam Iraq? \nGiven the U.N.'s inability to fulfill its obligations with regard to \nenforcing Security Council Resolution 1441, it is unclear whether the \nU.N. will be relevant at all in the reconstruction efforts of Iraq.\n  It is my hope that the U.N. will follow the lead of the United \nStates, Britain, and the other 40 or more allies currently in Iraq \nenforcing the U.N. resolutions. After all, it must be made very clear \nthat the resources of Iraq will finally be available for the use of the \nIraqi people, for the betterment of those same people.\n  For far too long, we know the prisoners of Saddam's regime have been \ndeprived of their country's riches and forced to survive as peasants. \nWhile the responsibility for providing for the welfare of the Iraqi \npeople belonged to Saddam Hussein, he was, as we know, more interested \nin spending it on himself in the form of elaborate palaces and in the \npursuit of weapons of mass destruction.\n  The Iraqi people will finally share in the wealth of their country \nthat has always belonged to them rather than Saddam sharing it with his \nfamily and the cronies of his brutal regime.\n  I hope the Congress will take into consideration the rights the \ntaxpayers of the United States have under this Geneva Convention, to \nmake sure the resources for the rebuilding of Iraq come from Iraqi \nnatural resources and not from the American taxpayers. That should be \nfully taken into consideration, as some of the money we appropriate \nnext week will probably be used for that purpose of at first \nestablishing administration in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/27/senate-section/article/S4507-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4507-S4508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE PROTECTION OF LAWFUL COMMERCE IN ARMS ACT\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in\n\n[[Page S4508]]\n\nArms Act is an important piece of legislation that will address the \ngrowing problem of junk lawsuits filed with the intention of driving \nthe firearms industry out of business. I thank Senator Craig and \nSenator Burns for their efforts to ensure this legislation is addressed \nand moved through Congress.\n  This act does not curtail the legal rights of victims who suffer \ninjuries from the actions of firearm or ammunition manufacturers. The \npurpose of this legislation is to prevent the multiple lawsuits that \nhave materialized which name the firearms and ammunition industries as \ndefendants and attempt to hold these industries liable for the criminal \nacts of a third party.\n  These frivolous lawsuits target the legitimate firearm and ammunition \nindustries in attempts to destroy these industries. If firearm and \nammunition manufacturers were forced to pay for the criminal acts of \nthird parties, the concept of fairness would be eliminated. The impact \nof these suits would also affect this country economically and \nsocially. Any limitation of one's constitutional right to bear arms is \nnot acceptable. The destruction of the firearms and ammunition \nindustries would cause many Americans to lose their jobs. In addition, \nif the firearms and ammunition industries were destroyed, the right to \nlawfully bear arms may be curtailed. Many Alaskans depend upon the \nright to bear firearms for subsistence purposes as well as for self-\ndefense.\n  Courts across the Nation are wasting valuable time on frivolous \nlawsuits. At this time, 28 States have enacted legislation to prevent \nfrivolous lawsuits against the firearms and ammunition industries based \non the criminal behavior of others.

Unfortunately, these \nbeliefs are inconsistent with other studies of the way kids actually \nreact around guns, including a July 2002 report by the David and \nLucille Packard Foundation.\n  The American Academy of Pediatrics survey reported that an estimated \none third of American homes with children contain at least one firearm \nand nearly half of all firearms in homes with children are not stored \nsafely. According to the article, 87 percent of respondents predicted \nthat their children would not handle guns they found, whereas 13 \npercent predicted that there was a chance their children would do so. \nResearchers grouped parents' responses into three categories. First, 46 \npercent of respondents said ``my children would not touch guns because \nthey're too smart for that.'' Second, 35 percent said ``my children \nwould not touch guns because I've told them not to.'' And third, 11 \npercent said, ``my children would probably pick up or play with guns \nthey found, because that's just what kids do.''\n  However, the earlier David and Lucille Packard Foundation study \ndemonstrated that children often do not behave as their parents might \nbelieve. In fact, according to the foundation's report, children and \nyoung people are actually likely to handle a gun if they find one.\n  All parents want to ensure the safety of their children. One thing \nthe Senate can do to help is pass common sense safe storage legislation \nfor firearms. Under Senator Durbin's Child Access Prevention Act, \nadults who fail to lock up loaded firearms or an unloaded firearm with \nammunition could be held liable if that weapon is taken by a child and \nused to kill or injure him or herself or another person. The bill would \nalso increase the penalties for selling a gun to a juvenile and create \na gun safety education program that includes parent-teacher \norganizations, local law enforcement and community organizations. I \nsupport this bill, urge my colleagues to support it, and hope the \nSenate will act on it during the 108th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/27/senate-section/article/S4508-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred September 28, \n2001 in New York, NY. A Yemeni man was badly beaten in the Bronx while \nworking at his newsstand. Before dragging him outside and hitting him \nin the head with a bottle, the assailants, three local men, yelled, \n``You Arabs get out of my neighborhood! We hate Arabs! This is war!''\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/27/senate-section/article/S4508-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ESTATE TAX REPEAL\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I support estate tax repeal. But I am forced to vote \nagainst Senator Kyl's amendment for permanent repeal because of two \nconcerns. First, I am concerned about mounting deficits, and second, I \nbelieve that this amendment would result in payment reductions to rural \nproviders under Medicare.\n  The budget resolution we are debating today includes tax cuts that \ntotal $1.3 trillion. The budget also proposes that $725 billion of \nthese tax cuts be enacted immediately, under the reconciliation \nprocess.\n  Two years ago, we passed a $1.3 trillion tax cut. I supported that \ntax cut. But those were different times. We had a surplus. We did not \nforesee the significant decline in revenues. Or the deficits that \nfollowed.\n  This is not the time to reduce revenues by $725 billion. It would \nhurt our budget and our economy.\n  In order to prevent the passage of tax cuts that would drive up the \ndeficit and hurt our economy, I believe that we must reduce the size of \nthis tax cut.\n  While Senator Kyl has stated that he intends to pay for his \namendment, I am concerned that his offset would have a negative impact \non rural providers in Montana. The cost of his amendment is estimated \nto be $46 billion. And when asked how he proposed to offset this cost, \nhe stated that it should come from a general fund for Finance Committee \naction.\n  According to the Senate Budget Committee, this amendment would result \nin a negative allocation to the Finance Committee in 2009 through 2013. \nMore specifically, the committee's allocation for these years would be \nnegative $22 billion. That's minus $22 billion. Quite a deficit to \novercome, and those savings would be difficult to find.\n  Those of us who were here when the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 passed \nrecognize full well that these savings would come from Medicare. An \nestimated 90 percent of the savings passed by the Finance Committee in \nthe 1997 law came from the Medicare Program, through reductions in \npayments to providers.\n  I would hesitate to cut the program a year before the baby boom \ngeneration starts to retire to finance a tax cut that we pass in 2003. \nProviders are currently facing severe reductions in Medicaid payments. \nThey are coping with an uninsured rate that continues to climb, which \nmeans that they must shoulder an increasing burden of uncompensated \ncare. These problems may worsen by the time these cuts take effect. \nThey may also improve. But we cannot know for sure. And looking at the \ncurrent state of our health care system, I am simply not prepared to \ntake the chance that providers can sustain these cuts.\n  Mr. President, let me reiterate that I support estate tax repeal, and \nI will continue to support thoughtful and responsible changes to tax \npolicy. But I cannot support this amendment at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/27/senate-section/article/S4508-4", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4508-S4509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CITIZEN SOLDIER WEEK\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I take to the floor today to discuss the \nimportance of acknowledging the tremendous risks and sacrifices our men \nand\n\n[[Page S4509]]\n\nwomen in our Armed Forces make to ensure our continued freedom. In \nthese turbulent and difficult times it is more important than ever to \nexpress our sincere and deep appreciation for the service of our Guard, \nReserve, and active military.\n  To show our gratitude, I am pleased to announce that the first 7 days \nof June will be designated as Citizen Soldier Week. Through the passage \nof my resolution, S. Res. 58, we will recognize the unique sacrifices \nof members of the Reserves and National Guard.\n  Reserve and National Guard troops provide a substantial proportion of \nthe combat forces required to carry out military operations. In doing \nso, many leave higher-paying jobs and place their civilian careers on \nhold to answer the call when our country needs their service. To begin \nproviding the well-deserved recognition for their service, my \ncolleagues and I have worked to make the first week of June, 2003, \nCitizen Soldier Week.\n  As I discuss this resolution and the importance of recognizing our \ncitizen soldiers, I would like to make my colleagues aware of an active \nduty soldier, David S. Williams. David is a native of Chesapeake, VA \nwho was captured by Iraqi forces after his AH-64 Apache attack \nhelicopter was downed in central Iraq. I would like to offer my \nheartfelt concern and hope to David's family, and let them know I will \ndo everything within my power to ensure David's safe return to his \nloved ones and his mother in Chesapeake, VA.\n  While David isn't a reservist or National Guardsman, his capture, and \nthe effect it is having on his family and loved ones at home could \nhappen to anyone who has the gumption to volunteer, serve, and defend \nour freedoms around the world.\n  And for that, all American soldiers--and their families--should be \ncommended and thanked.\n  As our soldiers move closer and closer to Baghdad and continue to \nmeet treacherous resistance, I believe it appropriate and right for the \nSenate to consider legislation to provide long overdue benefits to \nthose who protect our cherished freedoms.\n  The Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act is an opportunity to provide our \nArmed Forces with logical tax relief to compensate them for their \ntireless and dangerous service to our country.\n  The men and women who join our military services are constantly faced \nwith uprooting their families, being shipped off to foreign lands for \nmonths at a time, and long and difficult hours on the job. The jobs \nperformed by our troops are often extremely demanding and come with \ngreat risk. As we are seeing daily in our liberation of the Iraqi \npeople, these missions come with the real potential of casualties. \nWhile no legislation can compensate for the risks taken by our Armed \nForces, I believe this legislation provides our troops deserved relief \nfrom unfair and burdensome tax.\n  The exclusion of tax from death gratuity payments should have been \nimplemented generations ago. The freedoms that every American enjoys \nare protected by the service and sacrifice of those brave Americans who \nlost their life for this country. For the Federal Government to tax any \nportion of a death gratuity payment is wrong and insulting. The debt \nowed to the men and women who have died fighting for the principles of \nthis country is incalculable, but the least this Government can do is \noffer the family some degree of comfort and compensation without asking \nfor a portion in a tax return. Nothing can replace a soldier, sailor, \nairman or marine who does not come home; however, at least we can offer \ncompensation without tax.\n  I fully support the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act. However, I believe \nthere are some other additional ideas that we, as the Senate, can adopt \nto improve the lives of those serving in our military. As many of my \ncolleagues are aware, our troops are accorded a tax exclusion when \nserving in designated combat zones.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced legislation that would expand those \ncombat zones to provide additional exclusion when our troops are \ndeploying to dangerous areas around the globe.\n  I believe the combat zones tax exclusion should include the period in \ntransit to that combat zone. By not subjecting military personnel to \nFederal or State taxes for this transit time, we would be providing a \nnecessary benefit for the dangers associated with entering a combat \nzone. Deploying to a combat zone is a military operation that has its \nown set of dangers, from accidents to the constant threat of terrorist \nattack from the moment they leave their home port. And, our military \npersonnel, including officers, should be covered by the full extent of \nthe combat zone tax provisions during this critical period.\n  As we focus on the ongoing conflict in Iraq, I would like to remind \nmy colleagues that we also have military personnel executing the war on \nterrorism. My legislation would also provide the proper tax breaks for \nservice men and women serving on Operation Enduring Freedom in \nGuantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the Horn of Africa. We know that these two \nareas remain filled with danger and instability from terrorist threats, \nso the combat zone exclusion should also be applied to these duty \nstations.\n  Many of my constituents know the dangers associated with operating in \nGuantanamo Bay. The soldiers of the 2nd Battalion, 116th Infantry \nRegiment of the Virginia National Guard are serving in Cuba. They are \nplaying an integral part in the war on terrorism and should be properly \nand fairly compensated for that service without taxation by the Federal \nGovernment during their service at Guantanamo.\n  I believe that personnel serving overseas in support of the global \nwar on terror are performing duties at least as hazardous as those \nperformed by personnel in some existing qualified hazardous duty areas.\n  As our Active, Guard and Reserve Armed Forces engage in a war with \nIraq, while continuing our worldwide campaign against terrorism, it is \nvital that we do all we can to support the men and women who bear the \nburden of our defense and security. Passage of the Armed Forces Tax \nFairness Act and the legislation I have introduced would further \nindicate to the brave men and women of the Armed Forces and their \nfamilies that their service is of great value and their sacrifices are \nunderstood and appreciated by a grateful Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/27/senate-section/article/S4509-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           BENEDICT COLLEGE GOSPEL CHOIR WINS NATIONAL TITLE\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS.

Although this Senator cannot always carry a \ntune, having the best choir in the land is a source of great pride to \nme and my State, and I wish to congratulate all the singers and the \nchoir's director, Mr. Darryl Izzard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/27/senate-section/article/S4509-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PAYING TRIBUTE TO ALMA ZWICK\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG.

She has \nalso been a member of the Haddon Township Rent Control Board and \ntreasurer of the Haddonview Tenants' Association.\n  Just as Alma Zwick has been dedicated to her fellow citizens, she has \nalso been dedicated to her family of three brothers, three sisters and \n28 nieces and nephews.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting Alma Zwick for her 25 \nyears of service to Camden County.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/27/senate-section/article/S4510-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4510]]\n                  TRIBUTE TO FIRE CHIEF ROBERT GIORGIO\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a brave \nhuman being. Robert Giorgio is the Fire Chief in the town of Cherry \nHill, New Jersey. In April of last year Chief Giorgio put himself in \nharm's way and performed honorably in the face of danger.\n  It was April 3, 2002, and Chief Giorgio was in his office when he \nheard reports of a vehicle that had crashed over a highway overpass on \na State highway in Cherry Hill. Although not required to respond to the \nincident, Chief Giorgio chose to do so.\n  When Chief Giorgio arrived on the scene he saw that the car was \nsuspended about five feet above the ground, just barely held in place \nby a small tree. There was also a fire from the engine compartment that \nwas spreading into the interior of the car. The driver, Deborah \nTrainor, was pinned behind the steering wheel.\n  Chief Giorgio gave orders to arriving firefighters and directed \ncivilians to use portable fire extinguishers. He quickly realized that \nthe units dispatched by the fire department would not reach the scene \nby the time the fire reached Ms. Trainor. Understanding the gravity of \nthe situation Chief Giorgio placed himself beneath the vehicle in an \nattempt to free her. To say that there was a serious chance of the car \nfalling on the Chief is a severe understatement. Though Ms. Trainor was \nburned by the fire, Chief Giorgio was successful in freeing her from \nthe car.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring and saluting this brave \nAmerican. Chief Robert Giorgio acted with honor and bravery in putting \nhimself in harm's way to save another person's life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/27/senate-section/article/S4510-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SSGT.

Jordan, United States Marine Corps, of Enfield, CT. \nStaff Sergeant Jordan lived as a true patriot and defender of our great \nNation's principles of freedom and justice. A veteran of Operation \nDesert Storm in the Persian Gulf and Operation Just Cause in Kosovo, \nStaff Sergeant Jordan was a proud family man and an example of the \npowerful American spirit that permeates this Nation's history.\n  A member of the 1st Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine \nExpeditionary Brigade, Staff Sergeant Jordan and his unit were ambushed \nwhen Iraqi soldiers feigned surrender before opening fire. By the time \nthe dust settled around this despicable and cowardly act, nine gallant \nmarines, including Staff Sergeant Jordan, were dead.\n  Staff Sergeant Jordan was more than a marine. He was a husband and a \nfather; he was devoted to his friends and to his family. He was known \nas ``Gump'' by those who knew and loved him. He quickly offered a hand \nwherever and whenever needed. Staff Sergeant Jordan was a true citizen \nsoldier--a model marine, and a credit to his family, his community, his \ncorps, and his country.\n  Staff Sergeant Jordan served as a messenger of high justice and \nidealism in the best tradition of American principles and patriotism. I \nam both proud and grateful that we have the kind of fighting force \nexemplified by Staff Sergeant Jordan serving in the Persian Gulf--and \nthe strong families back at home sending their love and support.\n  Our Nation extends its heartfelt condolences to his wife Amanda and \nhis son Tyler.

His region covers the \nNew York metropolitan area and his more than 2,000 officers secure \nsites including NBC Studios, JFK International Airport, and the Federal \nReserve Bank of New York. Prior to September 11, 2001, Summit Security \nhad 300 officers at the World Trade Center, many of whom assisted with \nthe evacuation of the two towers.\n  Mr. Bove is also a nationally acclaimed expert on school violence in \nAmerica. Since the Columbine tragedy in 1999, Mr. Bove has given \npresentations to over 15,000 educators, corporate representatives, and \nlaw enforcement officials. He also trained 100 New York Police \nDepartment Crime Prevention Specialists in advanced techniques of crime \nprevention and community policing.\n  Recently, the American Police Hall of Fame conferred five nationally \nacclaimed medals to Vincent Bove, including the Medal of Honor for \nPublic Service for outstanding leadership skills in reducing crime and \nassisting law enforcement throughout the United States; the J. Edgar \nHoover Gold Medal for his leadership in police and private security \nissues as a nationally respected law enforcement instructor; the \nKnights of Justice Medal for his outstanding service exemplifying the \nBiblical Act of the Good Samaritan in protecting the community; the \nPatriotism Medal for promoting faithfulness to the Federal, State, and \nlocal laws and for supporting the Constitution and Bill of Rights; and \nthe Civilian Medal of Appreciation for leadership in private security, \nwhich assists law enforcement officers.\n  He was also named the North Jersey Regional Crime Prevention Officers \nAssociation Recipient for ``Exceptional Service to Crime Prevention for \n2002.'' This award recognizes Mr. Bove for his achievements in the \nreduction of crime on both a local and national level. The same \norganization also recognized Mr. Bove with the 2002 ``Presidential \nAward for Dedicated Service'' for his service to the organization and \nthe community.\n  Vincent Bove is an amazing individual. He dedicates his life to \nmaking his fellow citizens and communities safer and more secure. I ask \nall my colleagues to join me in honoring Vincent Bove for his sense of \nduty, determination, and dedication in making our country a safer and \nmore secure place to live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/27/senate-section/article/S4510-4", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n JEAN HOEFER TOAL SALUTED FOR BRINGING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY TO SOUTH \n                            CAROLINA COURTS\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS.

A bill to amend the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \nCentury to provide from the Highway Trust Fund additional funding for \nIndian reservation roads, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to introduce the \nTribal Transportation Program Improvement Act of 2003. The bill is \ncosponsored by Senators Feinstein, Dayton, and Leahy.\n  The goal of this legislation is to help provide safe and efficient \ntransportation throughout Indian country. At the same time, this bill \nwill help promote economic development, self-determination, and \nemployment of Indians and Alaska Natives.\n  Roads that serve Indian Country are part of one single national \ntransportation network and Congress has long recognized the importance \nof improving transportation in Indian Country. I believe the Federal \nGovernment has an obligation to provide safe and efficient \ntransportation for all tribes. Indians pay the same Federal gasoline, \ntire, and other taxes, as all other Americans and are entitled to the \nsame quality of transportation.\n  This bill is a 6-year reauthorization and improvement of the Indian \nReservation Roads program, which funds transportation programs for all \ntribes. This year, Congress must reauthorize the IRR program, along \nwith all other transportation programs in TEA-21. I am introducing the \nbill today as the first step in the reauthorization process.\n  The Indian Reservation Roads Program was established in 1928, and in \n1946 the BIA and the FHWA executed the first memorandum of agreement \nfor joint administration of the program. Since 1982, funding for tribal \ntransportation programs has been provided from the federal Highway \nTrust Fund. Major changes to the program were again made in 1998 as \npart of TEA-21.\n  Today, the Indian Reservation Roads program serves more than 560 \nfederally recognized Indian tribes and Alaskan native villages in 33 \nStates. The IRR system comprises 25,700 miles of BIA and tribally owned \nroads and another 25,600 miles of State, county, and local government \npublic roads. There are also 4,115 bridges on the IRR system, and one \nferryboat operation, the Inchelium-Gifford Ferry in Washington State.\n  Of the 25,700 miles of BIA and tribal roads on the IRR system, only \nabout one quarter are paved. Of the 25,600 miles of State, county, or \nlocal government IRR roads, about 40 percent are paved. In total, over \ntwo-thirds of all IRR roads remain unpaved. Many of these unpaved roads \nare not passable in bad weather. In addition, about 140 of the 753 \nbridges owned by the BIA are currently rated as deficient.\n  Some of the roads on tribal lands resemble roads in third-world \ncountries. Some are little more than wheel tracks. Even though the IRR \nsystem has perhaps the most rudimentary infrastructure of any \ntransportation network in the country, over 2 billion vehicle miles are \nannually traveled on the system.\n  According to the Federal Highway Administration's most recent \nassessment of the nation's highways, bridges, and transit, only 34 \npercent of paved IRR roads are rated in good condition, 37 percent are \nrated only fair, and 29 percent are rated poor. Of course, these \nratings apply only to the paved roads on the IRR system, not the 33,000 \nmiles of dirt and gravel roads.\n  The poor road quality also has a serious impact on highway safety. \nAccording to FHWA, the highway fatality\n\n[[Page S4515]]\n\nrate on Indian Reservation Roads is four times above the national \naverage. Automobile accidents are the number one cause of death among \nyoung American Indians.\n  Reflecting the current poor state of roads throughout Indian country, \nFHWA now estimates the backlog of improvement needs for IRR roads at a \nwhopping $6.8 billion.\n  The current authorized funding level for IRR is $275 million from the \nhighway trust fund. As required in TEA-21, the BIA distributes highway \nfunding to federally recognized tribes each year using a relative need \nformula. This formula reflects the cost to improve eligible roads, road \nusage, and population of each tribe. Some modifications to the formula \nare currently being made as part of a negotiated rule making.\n  I hope all Senators recognize the broad scope of the IRR program and \nits impact on 33 of the 50 States. I'd like to read a list of the \nfiscal year 2002 distribution of IRR funding in the States that have \ntribal roads and ask unanimous consent that the table be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n Exhibit 1.--Approximate distribution of FY02 Indian Reservation Road \n                                Funding\n\n\n                                                             FY2002 IRR\n        State                                         Funding to Tribes\nArizona......................................................56,100,000\nOklahoma.....................................................34,000,000\nNew Mexico...................................................31,900,000\nAlaska.......................................................18,500,000\nMontana......................................................13,600,000\nSouth Dakota.................................................11,700,000\nWashington...................................................10,100,000\nWisconsin.....................................................6,600,000\nNorth Dakota..................................................6,500,000\nMinnesota.....................................................5,780,000\nCalifornia....................................................5,100,000\nOregon........................................................3,900,000\nUtah..........................................................2,970,000\nIdaho.........................................................2,850,000\nWyoming.......................................................2,070,000\nMichigan......................................................1,560,000\nNevada........................................................1,290,000\nNorth Carolina................................................1,190,000\nColorado......................................................1,100,000\nNew York........................................................949,000\nMaine...........................................................890,000\nKansas..........................................................851,000\nMississippi.....................................................706,000\nNebraska........................................................626,000\nFlorida.........................................................550,000\nTexas...........................................................220,000\nLouisiana.......................................................197,000\nRhode Island....................................................162,000\nIowa............................................................126,000\nAlabama.........................................................100,000\nSouth Carolina...................................................89,000\nConnecticut......................................................83,000\nMassachusetts....................................................47,000\n\nSource: BIA. Data are approximate because some reservations and roads \nextend into more than one state.\n\n  I know every Senator is keenly aware of the importance of \ntransportation to the basic quality of life and economic development of \na region. Safe roads are essential for children to get to school, for \nsick and elderly to receive basic health and medical treatment, and for \nfood and other necessities to move to shops and to consumers. Moreover, \ntransportation is critical to any community's efforts to sustain robust \neconomies and to attract new jobs and businesses.\n  Unfortunately, most tribes today lack the basic road systems that \nmost of us take for granted. Indian communities continue to lag behind \nthe rest of the Nation in quality of life and economic vitality. \nUnemployment rates in Indian country frequently top 50 percent and \npoverty rates often exceed 40 percent.\n  The limited availability of housing and jobs on the reservation \nforces people to commute long distances everyday for work, school, \nhealth care, basic government services, shopping, or even to obtain \ndrinking water.\n  I'd now like to take a moment to discuss the impact of the Indian \nReservation Roads Program on just one tribe, the Navajo Nation. I think \nmost Senators know that Navajo is the largest federally recognized \nIndian tribe. The current membership is about 280,000 people. By \nitself, Navajo lands hold about one quarter of the entire Indian \nReservation Roads program.\n  The Navajo Reservation covers 17.1 million acres in the States of \nArizona, New Mexico, and Utah. It is roughly the size of the State of \nWest Virginia. The reservation includes the three satellite communities \nof Alamo, Ramah, and To'hajiilee in New Mexico.\n  According to BIA, the Navajo IRR system includes 9,800 miles of \npublic roads, or about 20 percent of all IRR roads. However, 78 percent \nof the roads within Navajo are unpaved. Because of the nature of the \nsoil and terrain, many of the unpaved roads are impassable after snow \nor rain. Navajo estimates a current backlog of road construction \nprojects totaling $2 billion.\n  The safety of bridges is also a continuing concern on the Navajo \nreservation. Of the 173 bridges on Navajo, 51 are rated deficient. Of \nthe deficient bridges, 27 must be completely replaced and the rest need \nmajor rehabilitation.\n  The Navajo Nation also operates a transit system with 14 buses and \nthree vans. The system carries 75,000 passengers each year. The system \nserves both Navajo people as well as the nearby communities of Gallup, \nFarmington, Flagstaff, and Winslow.\n  Finally, the few roads that are being built on the Navajo Reservation \nare not being properly maintained. Funding for road maintenance is not \npart of the IRR program. Instead road maintenance is funded each year \nas part of the BIA's annual appropriation bill. Unfortunately, BIA's \nbudget lags woefully behind the need for road maintenance. Each year \nthe Navajo Region of BIA requests about $32 million to maintain about \n6000 miles of roads, but receives only about $6 million, or about 20 \npercent of the funds needed just to maintain the existing roads.\n  The bill I am introducing today will begin to address this crushing \nneed for road construction and transit programs throughout Indian \nCountry. The bill will benefit all tribes, both large and small. I'd \nlike to briefly summarize the major provisions of the bill.\n  First, the bill increases funding for the Indian Reservation Roads \nprogram to $2.775 billion for the six years from 2004 to 2009. Under \nTEA-21, the IRR program is currently authorized for $275 million per \nyear. This level represents less than 1 percent of annual federal \nfunding for road construction and rehabilitation. However, the 50,000 \nmiles of the IRR system represent about 5 percent of the Nation's \n957,000 miles of Federal-aid highways. I do believe the substantial \nincrease in IRR funding in my bill is fully justified based on the very \npoor condition of so many IRR roads as well as the importance of \ntransportation to economic development in Indian country.\n  Second, the bill removes the obligation limitation from the Indian \nReservation Roads program. This funding limitation was first applied to \nthe IRR program in 1998 in TEA-21, and over the six years of TEA-21 the \nlimitation will have cut about $31 million per year in much-needed \nfunding out of IRR. The reduction for 2003 is about $36 million. The \nIRR was not subject to any obligation limitation from 1983 to 1997, and \nmy bill restores the program to the status it had before 1998.\n  Third, the bill restores the Indian Reservation Bridge Program with \nseparate funding of $90 million over six years. TEA-21 had eliminated \nseparate funding for the Indian reservation bridge program in 1998. In \naddition, the bill streamlines the bridge program by expanding the \nallowable uses of bridge funding to include planning, design, \nengineering, construction, and inspection of Indian reservation road \nbridges.\n  Fourth, the bill increases the current limit for tribal \ntransportation planning from 2 percent to 4 percent. These funds will \nbe used by tribes to compile important transportation data and to \nforecast their future transportation needs and long-range plans. Many \nof the tribes have indicated they currently don't have funding for \nadministrative capacity building, and the additional planning funds in \nmy bill would address this need.\n  Fifth, TEA-21 established a negotiated rule making for distribution \nof funds based on the relative needs of each tribe for transportation. \nTo ensure the distribution is tied to actual needs, my bill requires \nthe Secretary of Transportation to verify the existence of all roads \nthat are part of the Indian reservation road system.\n  Sixth, the bill establishes a pilot program, in accordance with the \nIndian Self-Determination and Education Act, P.L. 93-638, authorizing \n12 tribes to contract directly with FHWA for IRR funding to improve \nefficiency and streamline the administration of the program. The 12 \ntribes will be selected to ensure representation from each region of \nthe country.\n  Seventh, the bill establishes a new six-year, $120 million tribal \ntransportation safety program. Tribes may\n\n[[Page S4516]]\n\napply directly to the Department of Transportation for grants to \nimprove transportation safety. The program parallels existing safety \nprograms for the states.\n  Eighth, I propose a new tribal transit program to provide direct \nfunding to tribes from the Federal Transit Administration. The new \nprogram would parallel the existing Indian Reservation Roads program \nfunded through FHWA. In general, while States may allocate to tribal \nareas some of their transit funding under the existing formula grant \nprograms for transit for elderly and disabled, section 5210, and for \nnon-urbanized areas, section 5311, they rarely do so. Because the \ntribes are at a disadvantage in having to compete for funding within \nthe States, I believe we need a direct funding program to allow tribes \nto provide better transit services to young people, elderly, and others \nwho lack access to private vehicles. The bill sets aside a very modest \nlevel of funding of $120 million over six years for the new tribal \ntransit program.\n\n  Ninth, the bill states the sense of Congress that the BIA should have \nsufficient funding to maintain all roads on the Indian Reservation \nRoads system. Maintenance of IRR roads is a Federal responsibility and \nadequate funding is needed to protect the Federal investment in \ntransportation infrastructure. Federal funding for road maintenance is \nprovided through the BIA's annual appropriations bill. Unfortunately, \nyear after year, the Appropriations Committees have failed to provide \nadequate funding for maintenance. Funding for BIA's road maintenance \nprogram has typically been around $25 million per year about one-fifth \nof the level needed to protect the federal investment in IRR roads.\n  The IRR system doesn't just serve Indian communities, but also \nvisitors, including tourists, recreational, commercial and industrial \nusers of roads and transit throughout Indian country. For the tribes, \ntransportation is an important contributor to economic development, \nself-determination, and employment for all Indian communities. This \nbill represents a very modest, but important step toward providing \nbasic transportation services throughout Indian country.\n  The proposals in my bill are similar to many of the recommendations \nof the National Congress of American Indians' TEA-21 Reauthorization \nTask Force.\n  I well appreciate that tribes in different regions of the country may \nhave different views and proposals on how best to improve Indian \ntransportation programs. I see my bill as just the first step in a \nyearlong process leading up to the reauthorization of TEA-21.\n  It is essential that we begin this process as soon as possible \nbecause I believe the tribes are being shortchanged in annual federal \nfunding. I was disappointed this year when the appropriations committee \ncut the funding for the IRR program in fiscal year 2003 to $238 \nmillion, about $40 million below the 2002 level. At the same time, \nFY2003 highway funding for the states was increased slightly above the \n2002 level. I believe this year's reduction in IRR funding may reflect \na lack of understanding on the part of many senators of the current \npoor state of transportation in Indian Country.\n  To try to raise awareness, last year I circulated a ``dear \ncolleague'' letter to the Chair and Ranking Members of the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee to urge them to fund the IRR \nprogram at the full $275 million authorized level. The bipartisan \nletter, signed by eleven of my colleagues, laid out the case for full \nfunding of the tribal transportation program in 2003.\n  My goal in introducing the bill today is to start the process of \nimproving IRR as soon as possible. The tribes cannot bear another cut \nin funding like occurred in 2003.\n  I hope that Chairman Campbell and Vice Chairman Inouye of the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs will soon hold hearings on the \nreauthorization of the Indian Reservation Roads Program. I look forward \nto working with them and the other members of the committee on \ndeveloping a consensus proposal that is fair to all tribes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the bipartisan \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 725\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Tribal Transportation \n     Program Improvement Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (A) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) because many Indian tribes are located in remote areas, \n     transportation is particularly important to the basic quality \n     of life and economic development of Indian tribes;\n       (2) safe roads are essential for--\n       (A) Indian children to travel to and from school;\n       (B) sick and elderly individuals to receive basic health \n     care and medical treatment; and\n       (C) food and other necessities to be delivered to shops and \n     consumers;\n       (3) transportation is critical to the efforts of Indian \n     tribes to--\n       (A) sustain robust economies; and\n       (B) attract new jobs and businesses;\n       (4) most Indian tribes lack the basic transportation \n     systems that other people in the United States take for \n     granted;\n       (5) Indian communities continue to lag behind the rest of \n     the United States in quality of life and economic vitality;\n       (6) unemployment rates in Indian country frequently exceed \n     50 percent, and poverty rates often exceed 40 percent;\n       (7) the limited availability of housing and jobs on Indian \n     reservations forces people to commute long distances each day \n     to travel to work or school, obtain health care, take \n     advantage of basic government services, go shopping, or even \n     obtain drinking water;\n       (8) the Indian reservation roads system established under \n     title 23, United States Code, comprises more than 50,000 \n     miles of roads under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Indian \n     Affairs and tribal, State, county, and local governments;\n       (9) more than \\2/3\\ of those roads are not paved, and many \n     resemble roads in third-world countries;\n       (10) as of the date of enactment of this Act, approximately \n     140 of the 753 bridges under the jurisdiction of the Bureau \n     of Indian Affairs are rated as being deficient;\n       (11) The Indian reservation roads system serves both \n     Indians and the general public and is part of a unified \n     national road network;\n       (12) even though the Indian reservation roads system is \n     perhaps the most rudimentary of any transportation network in \n     the United States, more than 2,000,000,000 vehicle miles are \n     traveled annually on the system;\n       (13) the poor quality of so many Indian reservation roads \n     has a serious impact on high safety;\n       (14) according to the Federal Highway Administration, the \n     highway fatality rate on Indian reservation roads is 4 times \n     the national average highway fatality rate on all roads;\n       (15) automobile accidents are the primary cause of death \n     for young Indian individuals; and\n       (16) the Federal Highway Administration estimates the \n     backlog of improvement needs for Indian reservation roads at \n     approximately $6,800,000,000.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to reauthorize, \n     expand, and streamline the Indian reservation roads program \n     to improve transportation safety and better meet the needs of \n     Indian individuals and other members of the traveling public.\n\n     SEC. 3.

This program plays a critical role in economic \n     development, self-determination, and employment of Native \n     Americans in 33 states, including Alaska Native Villages.\n       The IRR system comprises 52,738 miles of road. Half are BIA \n     and tribally owned roads and half are state, county and local \n     government roads. The system includes 4,152 bridges and also \n     one ferryboat. More than 2 billion vehicle miles are traveled \n     on the IRR system each year. Unfortunately, many of the roads \n     are among the worst in the nation. Over two-thirds of the \n     system is unimproved earth and gravel roads and about one-\n     quarter of the bridges are rated deficient.\n       The Federal Highway Administration described the state of \n     roads on reservations in its 1999 study of the nation's \n     highways and bridges: ``Some of the isolation (of Native \n     American communities) is perpetuated by a lack of \n     transportation facilities . . . Except for a few tribes with \n     oil and mineral resources, or recreational operations, nearly \n     all reservations are among the most economically depressed \n     areas of the country . . . Some tribal governments have been \n     successful in initiating economic development activities, \n     including small industries . . . These require a viable \n     Indian Reservation Roads (IRR) system.''\n       In 1998, Congress reauthorized the Indian Reservation Road \n     Program as part of Transportation Efficiency Act for the 21st \n     Century (TEA-21). Recognizing the huge backlog in basic \n     highway and transportation needs in Indian Country, the \n     authorized funding level was increased from $191 million per \n     year to $275 million. Last year the Transportation \n     Appropriations Act provided $279 million. We very much \n     appreciate your subcommittee's efforts in FY2002 to fund this \n     program at the higher level.\n                                                    ------ ------.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW:\n  S. 726. A bill to treat the Tuesday next after the first Monday in \nNovember as a legal public holiday for purposes of Federal employment, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would make Election Day a national holiday.\n  After the problems of the 2000 elections, a bipartisan Commission \nheaded by former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford was created to \nrecommend election reforms.\n  Among the reforms the commission recommended was making Election Day \na national holiday.\n  If you read the report, the advantage of making Election Day a \nnational holiday becomes obvious.\n  In a survey done by the U.S. Census shortly after the 2000 elections, \nthe number-one reason cited for not voting was because it conflicted \nwith work or classroom schedules. Declaring Election Day a national \nholiday would make it easier for millions of busy Americans to get to \nthe polls.\n  But declaring Election Day a national holiday has other advantages as \nwell, according to the Commission's report. More public buildings, \nespecially schools, would be available as polling places. And more and \nbetter trained poll workers would be available to staff polling places.\n  Businesses complain that a new Federal holiday will cost them money. \nBut this problem can be easily solved. Presently we celebrate Veterans \nDay on Nov. 11. On even numbered years, we could simply celebrate \nVeterans Day on the second Tuesday after the first Monday of November, \nwhich Congress has designated as Election Day for Federal elections.\n  The Commission's report noted that both Presidents Ford and Carter \nare veterans themselves and would not recommend any change that would \ndilute the significance of Veterans Day.\n  Rather, our two former Presidents found it fitting to hold the \n``supreme national exercise of our freedom on the day we honor those \nwho preserved it.''\n  This idea is also supported by civil rights, labor and other groups \ntrying to increase participation in our electoral process.\n  I think it is an idea whose time has come.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 726\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Democracy Day Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. TREATMENT OF ELECTION DAY IN SAME MANNER AS OTHER \n                   FEDERAL HOLIDAYS.\n\n       The Tuesday next after the first Monday in November in 2004 \n     and in each even-numbered year thereafter shall be treated as \n     a legal public holiday for purposes of statutes relating to \n     pay and leave of Federal employees.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING TREATMENT OF DAY BY \n                   PRIVATE EMPLOYERS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that private employers in the \n     United States should provide their employees with flexibility \n     on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November in \n     2004 and in each even-numbered year thereafter to enable the \n     employees to cast votes in the elections held on that day.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BYRD (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Burns, \n        Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Allard, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Bayh, \n        Mr. Enzi, Mr. Campbell, and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 727. A bill to reauthorize a Department of Energy program to \ndevelop and implement accelerated research, development, and \ndemonstration projects for advanced clean coal technologies for use in \ncoal-based electricity generating facilities, to amend the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 to provide incentives for the use of those \ntechnologies, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, time after time, coal has been there for \nthis country. Coal has been and will continue to be an important part \nof America--its history, its economy, and its people.\n  During World War I, when coal supplied the Nation's heat and powered \nour battleships and industries, President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed \nthat the Nation's war effort ``rested on the shoulders of [the American \ncoal] miner.''\n  During World War II, when enemy conquests in Asia and Africa \nthreatened to stop the worldwide flow of oil, the American government \nresponded by initiating a federally sponsored synthetic fuels program \nbased on coal. Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes acknowledged, \n``We should not have waited until war was upon us to begin the \ndevelopment of synthetic fuels.''\n  After the war, that program was dismantled. Far-sighted men warned of \nthe dangers of this decision. John L. Lewis, President of the United \nMine Workers, predicted a growing reliance upon foreign oil in the \npost-war era would one day result in outrageous prices at the gas pump \nand cars lined up for blocks to purchase gasoline.\n  Those of us old enough to remember the oil embargoes and energy \ncrises of the 1970s know how accurate that prediction was. Those oil \nembargoes and energy crises prompted the Carter Administration to \nestablish a national synthetic fuels program largely based on coal as \nthe United States was labeled ``the Saudi Arabia of coal.''\n  However, the Reagan Administration all but eliminated the Department \nof Energy's fossil fuels and renewable energy programs, and withdrew \nsupport for the development of alternative energy technologies.\n  How short-sighted that was. I correct myself. It wasn't just short-\nsighted, it was blind, and I said so at the time. In a speech on this \nSenate floor, I warned that the Reagan administration's cutbacks in our \nenergy programs were ``leaving us dangerously vulnerable to foreign \ntransgressions.'' Historians like to point out that those who do not \nremember the past are condemned to relive it. Why must we continue to \nrelive yesterday's mistakes? Can we not learn from the past?\n  Once again, concerns about our Nation's current and future energy \nneeds are on the minds of citizens across the country. Worrisome gas \nprices, erratic fuel costs, electricity supply needs, energy efficiency \nimprovements, and U.S. dependence on foreign oil are major challenges \nthat we must tackle. To develop a bipartisan, national energy plan, \nCongress must establish balanced energy policies that recognize the \nneed for both economic growth, energy security, and environmental \nprotection.\n\n[[Page S4519]]\n\nCoal will play a key role in that strategy.\n  It is paramount that we develop a comprehensive plan built on a \nbalanced portfolio of resources, technologies, and ideas. Such a plan \nmust look broadly across all sectors of the economy and set objectives \nto meet these needs both today and down the road. And, as we look at \nthe needs of our economy and our future, we need to better understand \nwhere to put critical and precious research and development resources \nand how to best stimulate these technologies in the marketplace.\n  Undoubtedly, fossil fuels will continue to be a primary source for \nmeeting our energy needs into the coming decades. Coal, used in cleaner \nand more efficient ways, will be a key component of that energy \nstrategy. Coal is this country's most abundant natural resource, \nproviding over half of the Nation's electricity and accounting for one \nthird of our Nation's total energy production.\n  Today, a bipartisan group of Members join me in introducing the \nNational Coal Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 2003. I \nvery much appreciate the support of Senators Rockefeller, Thomas, \nBurns, Dorgan, Allard, Durbin, Voinovich, Bayh, Enzi, Campbell, and \nConrad. We believe that this legislation will help to maintain our \nNation's fuel diversity by ensuring a key role for coal in our Nation's \nenergy future.\n  This initiative provides a roadmap to the future by authorizing $2 \nbillion over that next ten years for a clean coal technology \ndemonstration program to help speed these technologies from the \nlaboratory to the marketplace. Our legislation aims to improve air \nquality as well as the efficiency of the current fleet of coal-fired \npower plants by providing targeted tax incentives for the installation \nof these technologies at existing coal-fired facilities.\n  Additionally, this legislation will help meet the need for new \ninfrastructure by providing incentives to deploy a targeted number of \nadvanced clean coal technologies to prove their viability in the \nmarketplace now and in the future. Finally, it ensures that all \ngenerators of coal can compete for these targeted tax incentives on an \nequal basis. This initiative is an important component of a strategy to \nachieve energy diversity and independence.\n  I have been around Congress for a very long time--more than 50 years. \nRecently, I became the third longest serving Member of Congress. My \nassociation with coal started early in my life and has continued \nthroughout my many years of service in Congress. Coal has always been \nwith me, it has been there fore us. Coal is abundant. Coal is \naffordable. Coal is ours!\n  Clean coal research and development funding and tax incentive \nlegislation gained significant bipartisan and bicameral support during \nthe energy bill debates in the 107th Congress. This success was built \non the framework outlined, developed, and refined with my support in \npast Congress.\n  There is a little verse that goes:\n\n     God and soldier all men adore,\n     in time of trouble and no more,\n     for when war is over, and all things righted,\n     God is neglected and the old soldier slighted.\n\n  In times of national struggle and adversity, in times of war, coal \nhas been there. But in times of calm, when the urgency subsides, so \ndoes our national determination to establish and implement a \ncomprehensive energy strategy. To fail to incorporate a comprehensive \nenergy plan into our vision for the Nation's future would ultimately be \nto America's detriment.\n  The development of clean coal technologies is essential to the \nbetterment of our Nation's economic, energy, environmental, and \nsecurity future. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud today to join with my \ncolleague from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, and Senators Thomas, Burns, \nDurbin, Allard, Dorgan, Bayh, Voinovich, Enzi, Campbell, and Conrad, to \nintroduce the National Coal Research, Development and Demonstration Act \nof 2003. This is a bill I will work very hard to see enacted, because I \nbelieve both that the Nation's economy will grind to a halt without \ncoal, and because sustaining the indispensable role of the Nation's \nmost abundant energy source can only be accomplished by finding \nenvironmentally sensitive ways of using it.\n  This legislation is the byproduct of more than 5 years of effort to \nfoster new scientific research and commercial application of clean coal \ntechnologies. This has been a collaborative effort between members of \nCongress from both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Hill \nworking together with the coal and utility industries, the Department \nof Energy, the United Mine Workers, and academic and industrial \nscientists. The legislation we introduce today is substantially similar \nto legislation introduced in the 107th Congress, which formed the basis \nof the coal tax and coal R provisions of the comprehensive energy \nbill the Senate passed last year.\n  I have a particular interest in the clean coal tax provisions. I \naggressively argued for them in the Finance Committee, and I was \ngratified by the willingness of then-Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member \nGrassley to work with me to include meaningful coal tax incentives in \nthe bill this body passed by an overwhelming majority and sent to \nconference with the House. As a tax conferee, I again pushed hard for \ninclusion of the Senate-passed provisions, over the more expensive and \nless-inclusive House provisions. Unfortunately, the energy conference \nand the comprehensive energy legislation it was so close to producing \nwere allowed to die by some who thought this Congress would be a better \nsetting for consideration of a national energy policy.\n  The R provisions, and in fact the entire package we introduce here \ntoday, have had no more fervent champion than my colleague, the senior \nSenator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd. Indeed, Senator Byrd has been \na stalwart friend of coal far longer than the more than 5-year duration \nof this effort on clean coal technologies. I would be remiss if I did \nnot commend Senator Byrd for his dedication and diligence in advocating \nfor clean coal. I cannot overstate the importance of coal to our state \nof West Virginia. I am proud to join Senator Byrd in this effort to \nimprove the environmental performance of coal, and to affirm its \ncritical role in the economy of our State, and of the entire Nation.\n  When enacted, this legislation will foster crucial, collaborative, \nand cutting edge scientific research by the Department of Energy and \nits industry partners into technologies allowing increasingly cleaner \nand more efficient use of our Nation's most abundant fossil fuel, coal, \nas a fuel to produce electricity. At the same time, this bill will \ncreate tax incentives to help coal-fired utilities defray the high cost \nof installation of clean coal technologies on coal-fired power plants. \nWe have included incentives for clean coal technologies on both \nexisting power plants and those yet to be built. Clean coal \ntechnologies used to repower existing plants will allow them to meet \nour most stringent Clean Air Act standards for stationary source \nemissions. Installations of these technologies on existing facilities \nis important not only to protect the environment. Perhaps as \nsignificant for our economy, sustaining energy production from these \nreliable sources of electricity helps insulate consumers from the kind \nof extraordinary price shocks we have seen recently in the natural gas \nand petroleum markets.\n  New facilities designed and built with next generation, advanced \nclean coal technologies will be cleaner and more reliable still. Energy \nexperts estimate that to meet our Nation's burgeoning demand for \nelectricity, we may see more than a thousand new electricity generating \nplants built in the next 20 years. Modest incentives for installation \nof advanced clean coal technologies will give utilities the ability to \nchoose cheap and abundant coal as a fuel source, and still produce air \nemissions as clean or cleaner than those produced by natural gas \nplants.\n  The two sections of this bill concentrate on different aspects of the \ncoal picture, and will be considered by different committees in the \nSenate. Yet the programs and commercial development this bill will \nengender will work hand in hand. The advanced clean coal research and \ndevelopment funded by this bill, augmented by the data industry, \nacademic, and government scientists hope to gain from the performance \nof the reconfigured existing\n\n[[Page S4520]]\n\nplants, will hasten the deployment of a fleet of near-zero emission \ncoal-fired plans in the coming decade or two.\n  I represent a State that produces a lot of coal, and uses a lot of \ncoal. Between 98 and 99 percent of the electricity in West Virginia is \ngenerated with coal. This is higher than any other State in the Nation, \nbut West Virginia electricity consumers are by no means alone in their \ndependence on coal. The United States is dependent on coal to a degree \nthat I am sure comes as a surprise to most people. Coal produces more \nthan half of the electricity used in this country. It is the primary \nsource of electricity in 32 States, accounting for at least 55 percent \nof the electricity in 25 of these. Of the remaining 18 States, coal is \nthe second most prevalent source of electricity in six of them, and a \nclose third in two more. So, I thank my fellow cosponsors for their \nwork on this bill, but I say to my colleagues, this is not just \nimportant to those of us whose States produce coal. Coal will continue \nto be a vital economic resource for the entire country. Because of \nthis, and because the future health of our environment depends on good \ndecisions made today, I recommend this legislation to all of my \ncolleagues, and ask for their support in passing it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN (for himself, Mr. Stevens, and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 728.

A bill to prohibit fraud and related activity in connection \nwith authentication features, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n[[Page S4521]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Hatch, to \nintroduce the Secure Authentication Feature and Enhanced Identification \nDefense Act of 2003, also known as the ``SAFE ID'' Act. My good friend, \nthe Senior Senator from Utah, is joining me on this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Two of the terrorists who perpetrated the acts of 9/11 held false \nidentification documents, which they purchased from a broker of false \nIDs. That broker was convicted, but sentenced merely to probation. The \njudge and the prosecutor publicly lamented that the law did not subject \nsuch a person to harsher penalties. These events focused new attention \non an existing, growing problem--the ease with which individuals and \norganizations can forge and steal IDs and use them to harm our society. \nThese circumstances weaken our efforts in the fight against terrorism; \nidentity theft; underage drinking and drunk driving; driver's license, \npassport and birth certificate fraud, among others. In the post-9/11 \nera, we must do more to prevent the creation of false, misleading or \ninaccurate government IDs. This has become an issue of national \nimportance and therefore merits a national response.\n  In recent years, the ability of criminals to produce authentic-\nlooking fake IDs has grown immensely. Today, unfortunately, it is \nbecoming increasingly common for criminals to either steal or forge, \nand traffic in, the very items that issuing authorities use to verify \nthe authenticity of their IDs. These ``authentication features'' are \nthe holograms, watermarks, and other symbols, letters and codes used in \nidentification documents to prove that they are authentic. \nUnfortunately, today IDs carrying authentication features can be \npurchased on the Internet or through mail order outfits. In addition, \nbreeder documents, such as birth certificates, are desk-top published, \nwith an illegitimate embossed or foil seal. Put another way, not only \ndo crooks forge identification documents, they also now illegally fake \nor steal the very features issuing authorities use to fight that crime.\n  Under current law, it is not illegal to possess, traffic in, or use \nfalse or misleading authentication features whose purpose is to create \nfraudulent IDs. That is why I am today introducing the SAFE ID Act.\n  The SAFE ID Act would prohibit the fraudulent use of authentication \nfeatures in identity documents. Specifically, the SAFE ID Act adds \nauthentication features to the list of items covered by 10 U.S.C. \n1028(a), an existing law prohibiting fraud and related activity in \nconnection with identification documents. In addition, the Act requires \nforfeiture of any violative items, such as false authentication \nfeatures and relevant equipment.\n  It is rare that we have before us legislation that would effectively \naddress problems as disparate as homeland defense, identity theft and \nunderage drinking. The SAFE ID Act would do just that, by cutting the \nlegs out from under those who would misuse technology to mislead \ngovernment authorities.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Hatch, Chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, and my other colleagues, to secure consideration \nand passage of this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 731\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to create \nan independent and nonpartisan commission\n\n[[Page S4522]]\n\nto assess the health care needs of the uninsured and to monitor the \nfinancial stability of the Nation's health care safety net; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it has been said that, ``Good health and \ngood sense are two of life's greatest blessings.'' Senators Hatch, \nRockefeller, Jeffords and I hope to further the cause of good health \nand good sense today, through introduction of the Health Care Safety \nNet Oversight Act of 2003.\n  Currently no entity oversees America's health care safety net. This \nmeans that safety net providers--including public and teaching \nhospitals, emergency departments, community health centers and rural \nhealth clinics--are laboring on their own. They are like master \nmusicians performing without a conductor. Each is trying their hardest \nand performing their part--but no one is coordinating their efforts.\n  This Act changes that, by creating the Safety Net Organizations and \nPatient Advisory Commission--SNOPAC--an independent and nonpartisan \ncommission to monitor the health care safety net.\n  Safety net providers are often the last resort for patients unable to \nafford the health care they need. For example, in my State of Montana, \nwe have eight community health centers, serving about 44,000 Montanans \nper year. Without these health centers, many of these uninsured and \nunderinsured Montanans would have no place to turn.\n  According to a recent report, nearly 75 million Americans lacked \nhealth insurance at some time in the past two years--amounting to \nalmost one-third of all Americans younger than 65. Of these 74.7 \nmillion individuals, about 30 percent had no coverage at some time in \n2001 and 2002 while 65 percent had no coverage for at least six months.\n  And who are these people? In Montana, about 80 percent of uninsured \nindividuals are in working families. And self-employed workers--\nincluding owners of small businesses--and their dependents account for \nabout one-fifth of the uninsured in our State. Montana has one of the \nlowest rates of employer-sponsored insurance in the Nation, with about \n46 percent of Montanans receiving health insurance through their \nemployers.\n  So what do we do about this problem? How do we ensure that all \nAmericans, irrespective of color, creed, gender, or geography, have \naccess to qualify health care?\n  About 10 years ago Congress and the Administration worked on the \nproblem of the uninsured. A tremendous amount of time and effort went \ninto the Health Security Act, on both sides of the issue. As we know, \npassage of that bill failed. Since then, Congress has taken a more \nincremental approach to the uninsured. Congress passed legislation in \n1996 to ensure portability of health insurance. A year later, the CHIP \nprogram was signed into law, bipartisan legislation to cover children \nof working families. And last year, we worked together to provide \nhealth coverage for workers who lost their jobs because of increased \ninternational trade.\n  While these incremental steps have helped, we need to do more. Last \nyear I introduced bipartisan legislation to provide employers with tax \ncredits so they can offer their employees health insurance. And I am \nhopeful that the Baucus-Smith, OR bill can be enacted into law.\n  But the fact remains, for most uninsured and underinsured Americans, \nthe safety net is still the only place to turn.\n  Yet, the safety net has been seriously damaged in recent years. \nAccording to report a few years ago by the Institute of Medicine, the \nhealth care safety net is ``intact but endangered.''\n  And according to a report I requested of the General Accounting \nOffice, issued today, emergency departments across the nation are \nfacing severe overcrowding problems, forced to send patients to other \nhospitals. The GAO found that about two-thirds of hospitals reported \nasking ambulances to be diverted to other hospitals at some point in \nfiscal year 2001. And about 10 percent of hospitals reported being on \ndiversion status for more than 20 percent of the year.\n  September 11 taught us that we need to be ready. Our emergency \nresponse systems must be prepared to manage an unexpected terrorist \nattack. But based on the GAO's findings, it seems that we are far from \nprepared. If emergency departments cannot care for all the patients \nthey are sent under current conditions, how can we expect them to \nmanage a terrorist attack of potentially catastrophic proportions?\n  We need an entity responsible for recommending changes to our safety \nnet, including our emergency departments. And though SNOPAC will not \nsolve the problems of America's uninsured, it will work to ensure that \nsafety net is not further frayed. An independent, non-partisan \ncommission, modeled on the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission \n(MedPAC), SNOPAC will include professionals from across the policy and \npractical spectrum of health care. And like MedPAC, SNOPAC will report \nto the relevant committees of Congress on the status of its mission: \ntracking the well-being of the health care safety net.\n  SNOPAC is not a panacea. But it is a positive step toward a \ncoordinated approach in caring for the uninsured. Absent large-scale \nimprovements in the number of insured Americans, we should at least \nwork to monitor and care for what we already have--an intact, but \nendangered, health care safety net.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join me in this effort towards good \nhealth and good sense.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 733. A bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2004 for \nthe United States Coast Guard, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Coast \nGuard Authorization Act of 2003.\n  The Coast Guard serves as the guardian of our maritime homeland \nsecurity and provides many critical services for our Nation. Last year \nalone, the Coast Guard responded to over 39,000 calls for assistance, \nassisted $1.5 billion in property, and saved 3,653 lives. These brave \nmen and women risk their lives to defend our borders from drugs, \nillegal immigrants, act of terror, and other national security threats. \nIn 2002, the Coast Guard seized 117,780 pounds of cocaine and 40,316 \npounds of marijuana preventing them from reaching our streets and \nplaygrounds. They also stopped over 5,100 illegal migrants from \nreaching our shores. They conducted patrols to protect our vital \nfisheries stocks and they responded to over 12,000 pollution incidents.\n  In the wake of September 11, the men and women of the Coast Guard \nhave been working harder than ever in the service's largest peace-time \nport security operation since World War II. This rapid escalation of \nthe Coast Guard's homeland security mission continues today. Last year \nalone, the Coast Guard aggressively defended our homeland by conducting \nmore than 36,000 port security patrols, boarded over 10,000 vessels, \nescorted over 6,000 vessels, and maintained more than 115 security \nzones. While our new reality requires the Coast Guard to maintain a \nrobust homeland security posture, these new priorities must not \ndiminish the Coast Guard's focus on its traditional missions such as \nmarine safety, search and rescue, aids to navigation, fisheries law \nenforcement, and marine environmental protection.\n  And recently we have asked even more of the Coast Guard. Last \nNovember we passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002 which recently \ntransferred the Coast Guard from the Department of Transportation to \nthe new Department of Homeland Security. This historic law positions \nthe Coast Guard as a cornerstone of the new Department, but also \nrecognizes that the Coast Guard is responsible for many other missions \non which Americans depend.\n  First and foremost, it ensures that the Coast Guard will remain a \ndistinct entity and continue in its role as one of the five Armed \nServices. The Coast Guard plays a unique role in our government, by \nserving both an armed service as well as a law enforcement agency and \nthis must not be changed or altered. It also contains language which \nmaintains the primacy of the Coast Guard's diverse missions, prevents \nthe Secretary of this new department from making substantial or \nsignificant changes to the Coast Guard's non-homeland security \nmissions, and prohibits the new department from\n\n[[Page S4523]]\n\ntransferring any Coast Guard personnel or assets to another agency \nexcept for personnel details and assignment that do not reduce the \nService's capability to perform its non-homeland security missions.\n  By introducing the Coast Guard Authorization bill today, I intend to \ncontinue giving the Coast Guard my full support, and I hope my \ncolleagues will work with me to provide the Coast Guard with the \nresources that it needs to carry out its many critically important \nmissions. Unfortunately Coast Guard's rapid operational escalation has \ncome on the backs of its 38,000 men and women who faithfully serve our \ncountry. I believe we need to shift this burden off our people and \ninstead adequately provide the Coast Guard with the resources it needs.\n  The bill I introduce today authorizes funding and personnel levels \nfor the Coast Guard in Fiscal Year 2004. The bill authorizes funding \nfor FY 2004 at $6.7 billion. This represents a 9.4 percent increase \nover the levels contained in last year's authorization bill and a 13 \npercent increase over the funds requested for Fiscal Year 2003. This \nauthorization will help restore the Coast Guard's non-homeland security \nmissions such as search and rescue, fisheries enforcement, and marine \nenvironmental protection to near their pre-September 11, 2001 levels.\n  This bill also includes numerous measures which will improve the \nCoast Guard's ability to recruit, reward, and retain high-quality \npersonnel. It addresses various Coast Guard personnel management and \nquality of life issues such by providing eligible enlisted personnel \nwith a critical skills training bonus, amending the number and \ndistribution of commissioned officers to retain needed skill sets and \nexperiences, expanding the Coast Guard's housing authorities to ease \nhousing shortages, and including several measures that grant the Coast \nGuard parity with the other Armed Services.\n  Another critical provision in the bill will enable us to better \noversee the historic and beautiful lighthouses that we have entrusted \nto non-profit groups across the country. Over the years we have \ntransferred numerous lighthouses and we need to ensure that these \ngroups continue to be responsible stewards of these national treasures. \nUnfortunately, we have recently learned of lighthouses which have been \nallowed to deteriorate and one that was even offered for sale through a \nreal estate broker. This provision will ensure these national treasures \nare protected and will allow the Secretary of Interior to monitor \nfuture lighthouse conveyances and ensure that they meet all of the \nconditions of the original transfers.\n  Finally, we must recognize that the United States Coast Guard is a \nforce conducting 21st century operations with 20th century technology. \nTo accomplish its many vital missions, the Coast Guard desperately \nneeds to recapitalize its offshore fleet of cutters and aircraft. The \nCoast Guard operates the third oldest of the world's 39 similar naval \nfleets with several cutters dating back to World War II. These \nplatforms are technologically obsolete, require excessive maintenance, \nlack essential speed, and have poor interoperability which in turn \nlimit their overall mission effectiveness and efficiency. Unfortunately \nthey are reaching the end of their serviceable life just as the Coast \nGuard needs them the most.\n  The Coast Guard is in the early stages of a major recapitalization \nprogram for the ships and aircraft designed to operate more than 50 \nmiles offshore. The Integrated Deepwater System acquisition program is \ncritical to the future viability of the Coast Guard. I wholeheartedly \nsupport this initiative and the system-of-systems procurement strategy \nthe Coast Guard is utilizing. This bill authorizes full funding for \nthis critical long-term recapitalization program.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 733\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the merits of the \nCoast Guard Authorization Act of 2003. This bill authorizes \nappropriations for fiscal year 2004 for the Coast Guard and will be \nintroduced by my subcommittee chairman Senator Snowe today. I thank \nSenator Snowe for her work on this legislation and her willingness to \nwork with me and others on the Commerce Committee to improve it.\n  The events of September 11 resulted in a new mandate for the Coast \nGuard as port security and homeland defense missions rose to the \nforefront of its responsibilities. Homeland Security officials realized \nthat our ports and sddcoastlines were vulnerable to terrorist attacks \nand quickly charged the Coast Guard with additional missions to help \nprotect the homeland. Though I have no doubt that the Coast Guard will \ncontinue to play a valuable role in our domestic security, as it \nshould, I have voiced my concern over the past year that traditional \nmissions have suffered as a result of these new security \nresponsibilities. Fishery patrols, drug and illegal immigrant \ninterdiction and Marine resources protection have in large measure \nfallen by the wayside since September 11. We simply cannot allow this \nto happen. We should provide the Coast Guard sufficient funding to meet \nits new and traditional missions.\n  In light of this, I am pleased that the bill increases the Coast \nGuard's budget by 10 percent, to $6.8 billion. This reflects a $500 \nmillion increase over last year's budget and is virtually identical to \nwhat the President has requested. Of this amount, roughly $4.7 billion \nis earmarked for operating expenses, an increase of $400 million over \nfiscal year 2003. The bill also authorizes $775 million for \nacquisition, construction and improvements, a $33 million increase over \nfiscal year 2003.\n  Although I support these budget numbers, I have not co-sponsored the \nbill because it does not include an authorization for the costs the \nCoast Guard will incur complying with the Maritime Transportation \nSecurity Act we passed last year. We know that the Coast Guard will \nrequire addition funds to oversee and coordinate the port security \nupgrades mandated by the law, and I feel strongly that a port security \nprovision needs to be added to the bill before it passes the Senate. \nConsidering that we are waging a war on terror, port security should be \npart of any Coast Guard reauthorization bill. Senator Snowe has agreed \nto work with me to draft additional language which would provide the \nCoast Guard with adequate funding. I look forward to\n\n[[Page S4526]]\n\ndrafting a comprehensive provision with my colleague to help the Coast \nGuard improve port security.\n  The Coast Guard has unique missions not covered by any other Federal \nagency. It is the only U.S. military service with domestic law \nenforcement authority, and it has taken on many new homeland security \nmissions since September 11. As such, I am pleased that the bill \nauthorizes an active duty personnel level of 45,500. I've consistently \nsupported raising personnel levels because the agency is charged with \npatrolling 95,000 miles of coastline, enforcing fish and marine \nconservation laws, conducting search-and-rescue missions, drug and \nillegal immigrant interdiction, along with its new homeland security \nmissions. This is an awesome responsibility for an agency that is \nsmaller than the New York City Police Department. Ultimately, as the \nCoast Guard becomes more integrated into the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, we may need to authorize higher personnel levels to ensure \nthat the agency can adequately meet all its missions.\n\n  I am also pleased that the bill includes a provision increasing \nfunding levels for the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. For the past 3 \nyears, emergency fund expenditures have exceeded the $50 million annual \nappropriation, reaching a projected high of over $100 million this \nfiscal year. The fund has relied on carryovers from prior year balances \nto augment the annual appropriation and meet the increased need. This \nprovision would increase the amount of the annual appropriation from \n$50 million to $150 million, thus reducing reliance on carryovers from \nprior year balances to augment the annual appropriation and meet the \nincreased need.\n  I will also be working with my colleagues to include several other \nimportant provisions in this legislation as we move forward. For \nexample, because the Coast Guard is still below pre-9/11 levels for \nfisheries enforcement, I will be seeking a provision that will require \nthe Coast Guard to better coordinate its fisheries enforcement efforts \nwith other Federal agencies, such as NOAA, and relevant State and local \nagencies. Also, some measures ought to be taken to extend certain \nprovisions of the Oil Pollution Act to vessels that, due to their size, \nstill pose a significant risk to our environment in the event of an oil \nspill.\n  Lastly, I would like to acknowledge the inclusion of a $25 million \nauthorization for the Loran-C radio navigation system, which is used by \nfishermen and general aviation pilots as well as the Coast Guard. The \nLoran system is very reliable, and I feel strongly that we should \ncontinue to fund it as a secondary navigation system to the Global \nPositioning System. Although GPS is certainly the most sophisticated \nand modern tracking system now in operation, it is imperative that we \nretain an alternative navigation system and not simply throw all of our \neggs in one basket. GPS signals can be jammed and are subject to \ninterference. The Loran-C provision has been in past Coast Guard \nreauthorization bills and was fully appropriated by the Congress for \nfiscal year 2003. It is important that we continue to support this \nsystem.\n  I support the provisions in this bill and I look forward to improving \nit as it moves through the legislative process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 735. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe exemption from tax for small property and casualty insurance \ncompanies; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \naddresses an inequity facing an important segment of the small business \ncommunity. This legislation is simple and straight forward--it adjusts \nthe current tax exemption that has existed since 1942 for small \nproperty and casualty, P, insurance companies so that it keeps pace \nwith inflation.\n  As the former Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I have heard from many small P \ninsurers in Missouri and across the Nation that they are having to \nconsider raising their premiums simply because the tax laws have not \nkept pace with inflation. Under current law, mutual and stock P \ninsurance companies are exempt from Federal income taxes if the greater \nof their direct or net written premiums in a taxable year do not exceed \n$350,000.\n  For companies that grow above the $350,000 threshold, current law \npermits electing P insurance companies to be taxed only on their \ninvestment income, provided their premiums do not exceed $1.2 million. \nUnfortunately, these thresholds, which were last updated in the Tax \nReform Act of 1986, have not been adjusted for inflation.\n  This situation has created an unintended outcome. Take, for instance, \na small P insurer in my State that started insuring the local farmers \nin the late 1980s. Over the ensuing years, the company's client base \nchanged very little, but the insurance premiums increased gradually to \nkeep pace with inflationary pressures. As a result, while the business \nitself has not grown, its premium base has and with it the loss of the \ntax exemption (or the alternative tax on investment income).\n  For the farmers and ranchers covered by the small P insurer, this \nloss is certain to mean higher insurance premiums, leaving the client \nwith the choice of cutting coverage or paying higher costs, neither of \nwhich is a real option. And for our agricultural community over the \npast few years, this choice is about the last thing they need.\n  The bill I introduce today would correct this problem by simply \nadjusting the $350,000 and $1.2 million thresholds to bring them up to \nthe level they would have been this year if the 1986 tax code had \nincluded an inflation adjustment. Accordingly, the tax exemption would \napply to P insurers with premiums that do not exceed $575,000, and \nthe alternative for taxation of investment income would apply to \ncompanies with premiums above $575,000 but not more than $1,971,000. \nThe bill would apply for taxable years beginning in 2003 and would \nindex both thresholds for inflation thereafter.\n  According to the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, \nthis legislation will help at least 665 small P insurance companies \nnationwide. In my State under current law, only 23 out of 86 small \ninsurance companies are currently tax-exempt. Under this proposed \nlegislation, at least 66 of the 86 small insurance companies will be \ncovered, thereby enabling them to continue providing critical insurance \ncoverage to small businesses across Missouri.\n  With this legislation, we have an opportunity to infuse some fairness \ninto our tax code and at the same time help the thousands of farmers, \nranchers, and entrepreneurs covered by small P insurers in this \ncountry. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation, and I look \nforward to working with the Finance Committee to see it enacted into \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 735\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act to strengthen \nenforcement of provisions relating to animal fighting, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Animal Fighting \nEnforcement Prohibition Act. I would like to thank my colleagues for \ntheir support in this endeavor to protect the welfare of animals. This \nlegislation targets the troubling, widespread, and sometimes \nunderground activities of dogfighting and cockfighting where dogs and \nbirds are bred and trained to fight to the death. This is done for the \nsheer enjoyment and illegal wagering of the animals' handlers and \nspectators.\n  These activities are reprehensible and despicable. Our States' laws \nreflect this sentiment. All 50 States have prohibited dogfighting. It \nis considered a felony in 46 states. Cockfighting is illegal in 47 \nStates, and it is a felony in 26 States. In my home State of Nevada, \nboth dogfighting and cockfighting are considered felonies. In fact, it \nis a felony to even attend a dogfighting or cockfighting match.\n  Unfortunately, in spite of public opposition to extreme animal \nsuffering, these animals fighting industries thrive. There are 11 \nunderground dogfighting publications and several above-ground \ncockfighting magazines. These magazines advertise and sell animals and \nthe materials associated with animal fighting. They also seek to \nlegitimize this shocking practice.\n  During the consideration of the Farm Bill last year, a provision was \nincluded that closed loopholes in Section 26 of the Animal Welfare Act. \nBoth the House and the Senate increased the maximum jail time for \nindividuals who violate any provision of Section 26 of the Animal \nWelfare Act from one year to two years, making any violation a federal \nfelony. However, during the conference, the jail-time increase was \nremoved.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today seeks to do three things. \nFirst, it restores the jail-time increase to treat the violations as a \nfelony. I am informed by U.S. Attorneys that they are hesitant to \npursue animal fighting cases with merely a misdemeanor penalty. To \nillustrate this, it is important to note that only three cases since \n1976 have advanced, even though the USDA has received innumerable tips \nfrom informants and requests to assist with State and local \nprosecutions. Increased penalties will provide a greater incentive for \nFederal authorities to pursue animal fighting cases.\n  Second, the bill prohibits the interstate shipment of cockfighting \nimplements, such as razor-sharp knives and gaffs. The specific knives \nare commonly known as ``slashers.'' The slashers and ice-pick-like \ngaffs are attached to the legs of birds to make the cockfighting more \nviolent and to induce bleeding of the animals. These weapons are used \nonly in cockfights. Since Congress has restricted shipment of birds for \nfighting, it should also restrict implements designed specifically for \nfights.\n  Finally, the bill updates language regarding the procedures that \nenforcement agents follow when they seize the animals. This regards the \nproper care and transportation of the animals that are seized. It also \nstates that the court may order the convicted person to pay for the \ncosts incurred in the housing, care, feeding, and treatment of the \nanimals.\n  This legislation is timely. Its need is emphasized with the recent \noutbreaks of Exotic Newcastle disease among poultry in my home state of \nNevada. Exotic Newcastle disease is a deadly virus that spreads through \nmigratory birds, vehicles, people's shoes, even across great distances \nthrough the air to attack birds of all types. It already has led to the \ndestruction of about three million chickens and other birds in Nevada, \nCalifornia, and Arizona. It is widely suspected that illegal \ncockfighting contributes to the continuing spread of this disease. \nAgriculture interests in every state that houses the poultry industry \nare at risk of destruction by the possible spread of this disease. One \nof the ways to ensure greater protection against the spread of Exotic \nNewcastle Disease is to enforce the ban on interstate shipments of \nbirds for the purpose of fighting. Our bill ensures that penalties are \nin place that will guarantee the enforcement of this ban.\n  I appreciate the strong support of Senators Allard, Cantwell, Dorgan, \nHagel, Harkin, Leahy, Levin, Lieberman, Lugar, Reid, and Wyden in this \neffort and look forward to the overwhelming support of my other \ncolleagues in the Senate. I also wish to recognize Representative \nRobert Andrews for his leadership on a House version of this bill. \nSurely, this is an issue that must be addressed as soon as possible. We \ncannot allow this barbaric practice to continue in our civilized \nsociety.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 738. A bill to designate certain public lands in Humboldt, Del \nNorte, Mendocino, Lake, Napa, and Yolo Counties in the State of \nCalifornia as wilderness, to designate certain segments of the Black \nButte River in Mendocino County, California as a wild or scenic river, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will \nprotect hundreds of thousands of acres of wilderness in Northern \nCalifornia. The Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Wilderness \nAct would designate 295,410 acres in 14 areas as Federal wilderness and \nwould protect 24.4 miles of the Black Butte Creek.\n  California's natural treasures have always been one of the things \nthat make California unique, drawing millions of people to them over \nthe years to revel in their wild beauty. But that beauty must not be \ntaken for granted. That is why I introduced the California Wild \nHeritage Act during the 107th Congress and will soon be reintroducing \nit. It was the first statewide wilderness bill for California since \n1984.\n  The California Wild Heritage Act would protect more than 2.5 million \nacres of public land, as well as the free-flowing portions of 22 \nrivers. Every acre of wild land is a treasure, but the areas protected \nin this bill are some of California's most precious.\n  I was thrilled that the 107th Congress passed legislation to \ndesignate over 56,000 acres of my statewide bill, lands in the Los \nPadres National Forest, as wilderness. It was a wonderful first step. \nWhile I look forward to passage of the entire statewide bill, it is \nimportant that we move now to designate these special places as \nCalifornia wilderness areas.\n  That is why today I am pleased to be joining Representative Mike \nThompson of California in introducing legislation that contains the \nportions of my bill in five counties in California's First \nCongressional District. Let me mention a couple of examples. In \nsouthwestern Humboldt and northwestern Mendocino counties, 41,100 acres \nof the King Range will be protected as wilderness. This is the wildest \nportion of the California coast, boasting the longest stretch of \nundeveloped coastline in the United States outside of Alaska. This bill \nalso protects 24.4 miles of the Black Butte Creek as a wild and scenic \nriver. Black Butte Creek is so wild it is only crossed by one road for \nits entire length.\n  This bill would also protect the precious plant and animal species \nthat make their homes in these areas. Endangered and threatened species \nwhose habitats will be protected by this bill\n\n[[Page S4528]]\n\ninclude the California brown pelican, steelhead trout, coho salmon, \nbald eagle, peregrine falcon, northern spotted owl, and Roosevelt elk.\n  For every Californian, there is currently less than half an acre of \nwilderness set aside. This is too little. During the last 20 years, \n675,000 acres of unprotected wilderness--approximately the size of \nYosemite National Park--lost their wilderness character due to \nactivities such as logging and mining. As our population increases, and \nCalifornia becomes home to almost 50 million people by the middle of \nthe century, these development pressures are going to skyrocket. If we \nfail to act now, there simply will not be any wild lands or wild rivers \nleft to protect.\n  Those of us who live in the United States have a very special \nresponsibility to protect our natural heritage. Past generations have \ndone it. They have left us with the wonderful and amazing gifts of \nYosemite, Big Sur and Joshua Tree. These are places that Americans \ncannot imagine living without. Now it is our turn to protect this \nlegacy for future generations--for our children's children, and their \nchildren. This bill is a start.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Kyl, \n        Mr. Reid, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 739. A bill to reauthorize and amend the Spark M. Matsunaga \nHydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Domenici, \nChairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and my \ncolleagues Senator Lieberman, Senator Kyl, Senator Reid, Senator Bayh, \nand Senator Inouye, in introducing legislation that affirms the \npriority and importance of hydrogen programs in Federal research and \ndevelopment initiatives and charts a course of action toward the \n``hydrogen economy.'' The legislation reauthorizes the hydrogen \nprograms in the Department of Energy and strengthens the Federal \ninteragency effort to promote hydrogen research and development \nprograms. It establishes a new program to demonstrate hydrogen \ntechnologies and their integration with fuel cells at Federal, State, \nand local government facilities.\n  Growing numbers of my colleagues in the Senate and in the House have \nindicated their interest in and commitment to promoting a hydrogen \neconomy for the future. This commitment comes from a substantial legacy \nin the House and the Senate. This bill carries the names of two former \nCongressmen--the late George E. Brown, Jr., and Robert S. Walker--to \nhonor their formidable and dedicated advocacy of hydrogen as a fuel \nsource. In the Senate, my predecessor, Senator Spark Matsunaga, created \nthe first formal hydrogen research program in this country, designed to \naccelerate development of a domestic capability to produce an \neconomically renewable energy source. He introduced legislation in 1982 \nand his perseverance led to the Matsunaga Hydrogen Act, enacted in 1990 \nshortly after his death. When I succeeded Spark in the Senate, I took \nup the cause of hydrogen and continue to believe that it is one of our \nbest hopes for independence from fossil fuels.\n  The Hydrogen Future Act of 1996, which followed the Matsunaga \nHydrogen Act, expanded the research, development, and demonstration \nprogram. It authorized activities leading to production, storage, \ntransformation, and use of hydrogen for industrial, residential, \ntransportation, and utility applications. It has enjoyed bipartisan \nsupport in Congress.\n  More recently in the 107th Congress, I have worked closely with \nSenator Harkin and my colleagues on the Energy Committee to reauthorize \nthe Hydrogen Future Act. We were able to include it in the Energy \nPolicy Act of 2002, the comprehensive energy policy bill considered by \nthe Senate during the spring of 2002. While the Senate and House were \nunable to come to agreement on the omnibus bill itself, progress was \nmade on the research and development provisions, including hydrogen. I \nam pleased that many of my colleagues have begun to recognize the \npotential of hydrogen as a clean source of energy. I expect the numbers \nwill only increase.\n  You may well ask, ``Why do we need the Hydrogen Future Act of 2003 \nwhen we have the President's initiatives for hydrogen?'' Because we \nneed to reauthorize the underlying Federal framework for the direction \nof and investment in hydrogen research and development. The \nauthorization for the program expired at the end of calendar year 2001. \nWhile I share the President's enthusiasm for hydrogen, I believe we \nmust provide a robust legislative foundation for research and \ndevelopment involving hydrogen--for fuel cells, for demonstration \nprojects at Government facilities, stationary and mobile projects, and \nnear- and short-term goals, as well as long-term goals. The Hydrogen \nFuture Act of 2003 reauthorizes and improves this strong foundation. I \nlike to call my bill a ``workhorse'' bill. It is not fancy, but we need \nit and it gets the job done.\n  The bill highlights hydrogen's potential as an efficient and \nenvironmentally friendly source of energy. It emphasizes the need for \nstrong partnerships between the Federal Government, industry, and \nacademia; and it underscores the importance of hydrogen research. The \nbill also encourages private sector investment and cost sharing for the \ndevelopment of hydrogen as an energy source. These basic steps will \nmove hydrogen closer to being a fuel we can rely on in many different \naspects of our lives.\n  In these days of soaring energy prices, oil cartels, air pollution, \nglobal climate change and greenhouse gases, hydrogen is a dazzling \nalternative. We can have a zero-pollution fuel. It can be produced \ndomestically, ending our dependence on foreign oil. The question is not \nwhether there will be a hydrogen age but when.\n  Hydrogen as a fuel can help us resolve our energy problems and \nsatisfy much of the world's energy needs. I am convinced that sometime \nin the 21st century, hydrogen will join electricity as one of our \nNation's primary energy carriers, and hydrogen will ultimately be \nproduced from renewable sources.\n  In the next twenty years, increasing concerns about global climate \nchange and energy security will help bring about the penetration of \nhydrogen in several niche markets. The growth of fuel cell technology \nwill allow the introduction of hydrogen in both the transportation and \nelectricity sectors. I realize that fossil fuels are and will continue \nto be a significant long-term transitional resource as we move toward \nrenewables. I am optimistic, however, that in my lifetime I will be \nable to see hospitals, homes, military bases and cars running on \nlocally-produced sources of hydrogen.\n  Clearly, this is a long-term vision for hydrogen energy as a \nrenewable resource. Progress on hydrogen technology is being made, and \nchallenges and barriers are being surmounted, at an accelerating pace \non a global scale. According to the Japanese Automobile Manufacturers \nAssociation, Toyota and Honda will sell or lease fuel cell vehicles in \nthe U.S. and Japan this year. Ford Motor Company is now showing its new \nhydrogen powered prototype, the Ford Model U. Fuel cells for \ndistributed stationary power are being commercialized and installed in \nvarious locations in the United States and worldwide. General Motors \nrecently unveiled a stationary, hydrogen-powered generator that could \nbe used to provide energy for homes and businesses. Transit bus \ndemonstrations are underway in the U.S. and Europe. The Nation's \ncapital city, Washington, DC, is one of the cities participating in the \nproject.\n\n  We are all familiar with Iceland's far-sighted bid to become the \nworld's first hydrogen-based economy. It has already made great strides \nin using renewable resources for its heating and electricity needs. The \nNation is committed to transforming its remaining fossil fuel-based \ntransportation sector, and its economically important fishing fleet, to \nhydrogen power. Iceland will have no need to import oil. Now there is a \nrevolutionary thought!\n  Closer to home, I am particularly pleased that the State of Hawaii is \ntaking the lead in ushering in the hydrogen era. The State has \nidentified hydrogen-based renewable fuels, and the jobs it can create, \nas a high priority, high-tech opportunity that can jump-start and \ndiversify our economy. The\n\n[[Page S4529]]\n\ncost of electricity and gasoline in Hawaii are important incentives for \nfinding cheaper, home-grown power. The Hawaii Natural Energy Institute \nof the University of Hawaii concluded that large-scale hydrogen use for \ntransportation can be competitive this decade.\n  I am particularly pleased with the public-private partnership between \nthe University of Hawaii's Natural Energy Institute, the Naval Research \nLaboratory, United Technologies Fuel Cells, and Hawaiian Electric \nCompany. In January 2002, the Institute announced a partnership with \nthe Department of Defense to establish a hydrogen fuel cell test \nfacility in Honolulu. The facility will house up to eight state-of-the \nart fuel cell test stands and related operations supporting fuel cell \ndevelopment. The Institute has made Hawaii a leader in the development \nand testing of advanced fuel cell systems and fuels processing.\n  In California, the State's zero emissions vehicle requirements favor \nearly introduction of hydrogen-powered vehicles. The city of Richmond, \nCA, opened the area's first hydrogen fueling station in October, 2002. \nThe hydrogen fueling station looks like a gasoline pump, and can supply \nthe daily fueling needs of a small fleet of vehicles at a fueling rate \nof one to two minutes per vehicle. These are important initiatives and \nillustrate the value of public-private partnerships along the pathway \nto a different energy source that requires an entirely different \ninfrastructure.\n  Despite the progress, problems and challenges remain. First, hydrogen \nproduction costs from fossil and renewable energy sources remain high. \nSecond, attractive low-cost storage technologies are not available. \nThird, the infrastructure is inadequate. We need to address these \nchallenges and barriers if we are to enjoy the benefits of an efficient \nand environmentally friendly energy sources.\n  An aggressive research and development program can help us overcome \nthese challenges by reducing production costs from fossil and renewable \nsources, advancing storage technologies, and addressing safety concerns \nwith efforts in establishing codes and standards. Our Nation needs a \nsustained and focused research, development, and demonstration program \nto make hydrogen a viable source of energy.\n  The strategy should focus on mid-term and long-term goals. We must \nsupport development of technologies that enable distributed electric-\ngeneration fuel cell systems and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles for \ntransportation applications. For the long term, we should look to \nhydrogen technologies that enhance renewable systems and offer us the \npromise of clean, abundant fuels.\n  The current Hydrogen Program, administered by the Department of \nEnergy, supports a broad range of research and development projects in \nthe areas of hydrogen production, storage, and use in a safe and cost-\neffective manner. Some of these new technologies may become available \nfor wider use in the next few years. The most promising include \nadvanced natural gas- and biomass-based hydrogen production \ntechnologies, high pressure gaseous and cryogas storage systems, and \nreversible Proton Exchange Membrane, PEM, fuel cell systems. Other \nprojects lay the groundwork for long range opportunities. These \nactivities need continued support if the Nation is to enjoy the \nbenefits of a clean energy source.\n  The Hydrogen Program utilizes the talents of our national \nlaboratories and our universities. The Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, \nSandia, and Oak Ridge National Laboratories, as well as Jet Propulsion \nLaboratory and National Renewable Energy Laboratory, are involved in \nthe program. The DOE Field Office at Golden, Colorado, and Nevada \nOperations Office in Nevada are also involved. University-led centers-\nof-excellence have been established at the University of Miami and the \nUniversity of Hawaii. U.S. participation in the International Energy \nAgency contributes to the advancement of DOE hydrogen research through \ninternational cooperation. The program has also built strong links with \nthe industry. This has resulted in strong industry participation and \ncost sharing. Cooperation between government, industry, universities, \nand the national laboratories is key to the successful development and \ncommercialization of new and environmentally friendly energy \ntechnologies.\n  Today we are introducing legislation that reauthorizes and expands \nthe Hydrogen Future Act of 1996. It highlights the need for a strong \npartnership between the Federal government, industry, and academia, and \nthe importance of continued support for hydrogen research. It fosters \ncollaboration between Federal agencies, state and local governments, \nuniversities, and industry, and modifies the current cost-sharing \nrequirements to enable more participation in research projects by small \ncompanies. It adds provisions for the demonstration of hydrogen \ntechnologies at government facilities to expedite wider application of \nthese technologies. The bill includes language to encourage \ninternational activities where appropriate in the DOE programs, both \nbecause of the need to develop world markets for our products and to \nencourage international development on a sustainable path. The \nlegislation clarifies the composition of the Hydrogen Technical \nAdvisory Panel that oversees the program for DOE and enhances inter-\nagency and inter-governmental cooperation in the hydrogen program.\n  The legislation we are introducing today authorizes $300 million over \nthe next five years for research and development for hydrogen \nproduction, storage and use. This will allow advancement of \ntechnologies such as smaller-scale production systems that are \napplicable to distributed-generation and vehicle applications, advanced \npressure vessels, photobiological and photocatalytic production of \nhydrogen, and carbon nanotubes, graphite nanofibers, and fullerenes.\n  The bill also authorizes $135 million for conducting integrated \ndemonstrations of hydrogen technologies at governmental facilities. \nThis provision will help secure industry participation through \ncompetitive solicitations for technology development and testing. It \nwill test the viability of hydrogen production, storage, and use, and \nlead to the development of hydrogen-based operating experience \nacceptable to meet safety codes and standards.\n  By supporting this bill, we will be ushering in a new era of non-\npolluting energy. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Bunning, Mr. \n        Hollings, Mr. Dayton, Ms. Landrieu, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, and Mr. Graham of South Carolina):\n  S. 740. A bill to amend title XVII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove patient access to, and utilization of, the colorectal cancer \nscreening benefit under the medicare program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Colon Cancer \nScreen for Life Act of 2003.'' I am pleased that my colleagues Senators \nCollins, Bunning, Dayton, Hollings, and Landrieu have joined me in \nintroducing this very important bill.\n  As many of my colleagues know from personal experience, colon cancer \nis a devastating disease, taking the lives of 57,000 Americans each \nyear. It is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and \nwomen and the second most common cause of cancer-related death in the \nnation. Close to 150,000 new cases are diagnosed each year.\n  But colon cancer can be combated, controlled, and potentially \nconquered if it's caught in the earliest stages. In fact, colon cancer \nis a rare form of cancer in that it can even be prevented through \nscreening--if pre-cancerous polyps are quickly identified and removed.\n  The survival rate when colon cancer is detected at an early, \nlocalized stage is 90 percent. But only 37 percent of such cancers are \ndiscovered at that stage. The later the disease is caught, the lower \nthe survival rate.\n  That's why, in 1997, Congress led the fight against colon cancer by \nmaking screening for the disease a covered benefit for every Medicare \nrecipient. That is especially significant because the risk of colon \ncancer rises with age.\n  Heightened awareness and greater access to treatment are working. \nOver the last 15 years, we've seen steady, if slow, annual declines in \nboth incidence rates and mortality rates tied to colon cancer.\n\n[[Page S4530]]\n\n  But we can do more, because barriers to screening still exist. Since \nthe preventive benefits were enacted in 1997, there has been only a one \npercent increase in utilization by Medicare beneficiaries of either a \nscreening or diagnostic colonoscopy. The Centers for Disease Control \nreports that screening for colon cancer lags far behind screening for \nother cancers.\n  We must do better and we can.\n  Modern technology has blessed us with extremely accurate screening \ntools, in particular the colonoscopy--which results in higher colon \ncancer identification rates and better long-term survival rates. A \nconsultation with a doctor before a colonoscopy is required to ensure \nthat patients are properly prepared before they undergo the procedure.\n  Unfortunately, Medicare does not pay for that consultation before a \nscreening, creating an obvious obstacle to preventive treatment for \nmany men and women. The Colon Cancer ``Screen for Life'' Act would \ncover these medical visits so that more Medicare beneficiaries will \nhave easy access to screening.\n\n  Further, with this legislation, just as Congress has done for \nscreening mammography, screening colonoscopy will not count toward a \nsenior's Medicare deductible. This will remove additional financial \ndisincentives to screening.\n  Finally, with this bill, we're breaking through another big barrier \nto early detection and treatment.\n  The medical reality is that colonoscopy procedures are invasive and \nrequire sedation to perform--making it safer for them to be conducted \nin a hospital setting, where safety standards and emergency procedures \nare in place, rather than in a private doctor's office. But when \ndoctors perform colonoscopies for Medicare patients in a hospital, they \ntake a hit on cost--because reimbursement for the procedure performed \nthere has decreased by nearly 36 percent since 1997.\n  As a result, to balance their budgets, doctors and hospitals may \nchoose to space out their Medicare patients, creating long waits for \nand limited access to these vital screenings.\n  The job of medical services should be cutting cancer, not cutting \ncosts. Unfortunately, today something as critical as colon cancer \nscreening is moderated not by the real needs of patients and their \nmedical doctors, but by market forces and market forces alone.\n  To address the problem, the ``Screen for Life'' Act would increase \nthe payment rates for colonoscopies performed in hospital facilities by \n30 percent. The result will be more access to early detection and \ntreatment and thousands of lives saved.\n  Colon cancer is a formidable foe, but we can make a difference in the \nfight against it. Early detection and treatment is our first line of \ndefense.\n  With the help of the Colon Cancer ``Screen for Life'' Act, I hope \nthat in a decade we'll have fewer cancer cases to contend with and more \nsurvivors to celebrate the simple fact that screening saves lives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SESSIONS (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Gregg, Mr. \n        Miller, Mr. Allard, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Ensign, Ms. Collins, Mr. \n        Crapo, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 741. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with \nregard to new animal drugs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today in order to bring attention \nto a problem that unfortunately goes largely unnoticed except by those \nwho are directly affected. Livestock and food animal producers, pet \nowners, zoo and wildlife biologists, and animals themselves face a \nsevere shortage of approved animal drugs for use in minor species.\n  Minor species include thousands of animal species, including all \nfish, most birds, and sheep. By definition, minor species are any \nanimals other than the major species--cattle, horses, chickens, \nturkeys, dogs, and cats. A similar shortage of drugs and medicines for \nmajor animal species exists for diseases that occur infrequently or \nwhich occur in limited geographic areas. Due to the lack of \navailabiliity for these minor use drugs, millions of animals go \nuntreated or treatment is delayed. Unnecessary animal physical and \nhuman emotional suffering results, and human health may be threatened \nas well.\n  Without access to these necessary minor use drugs, farmers and \nranchers also suffer. An unhealthy animal that is left untreated can \nspread disease throughout an entire stock of its fellow specie. This \ncauses severe economic hardship to struggling ranchers and farmers. For \nexample, sheep ranchers lost nearly $42 million worth of livestock \nalone in 2002. The sheep industry estimates that if it had access to \neffective and necessary drugs to treat diseases, growers' reproduction \ncosts for their animals would be cut by up to 15 percent. In addition, \nfeedlot deaths would be reduced by 1 to 2 percent, adding approximately \n$8 million of revenue to the industry.\n  Alabama's catfish industry ranks second in the Nation. Though it is \nnot the State's only aquacultural commodity, catfish is by far its \nlargest. The catfish industry generates enormous economic opportunity \nin the State, particularly in West Alabama, one of the poorest regions \nin the State.\n  The catfish industry estimates its losses at $60 million per year \nattributable to diseases for which drugs are not available. Indeed, it \nis not uncommon for a catfish producer to lose half his stock due to \ndisease. The U.S. aquaculture industry overall, including food fish and \nornamental fish, produces and raises over 800 different species. \nUnfortunately, this industry has only 6 drugs approved and available \nfor use in treating aquaculture animal diseases. This results in \ntremendous economic hardship and animal suffering.\n  Because of limited market opportunity, low profit margins, and the \nenormous capital investment required, it is seldom economically \nfeasible for drug manufacturers to pursue research and development and \nthen seek approval for drugs used in treating minor species and for \ninfrequent conditions and diseases in all animals.\n  I, along with Senator Bingaman, Senator Allard, Senator Collins, \nSenator Crapo, Senator Miller, Senator Craig, Senator Ensign, and \nSenator Lincoln, resolve to improve this situation by introducing the \nMinor Use and Minor Species Animal Health Act of 2003. This legislation \nwill allow animal drug manufacturers the opportunity to develop and \nobtain approval for minor use drugs which are vitally needed by a wide \nvariety of animal industries. Our legislation incorporates the major \nproposals of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine to increase the \navailability of drugs for minor animal species and rare diseases in all \nanimals. The Act creates incentives for animal drug manufacturers to \ninvest in product development and obtain FDA marketing approvals.\n\n  This legislation creates a program very similar to the successful \nHuman Orphan Drug Program that has dramatically increased the \navailability of drugs to treat rare human diseases over the past 20 \nyears.\n  The bill establishes two new ways to lawfully market new animal \ndrugs:\n  First, it establishes a conditional approval mechanism for new animal \ndrugs for minor uses and minor species. Conditionally approved new \nanimal drugs must meet the same new approval requirements for safety as \nnew animal drugs approved under section 512 of the FDC Act. However, \nthe effectiveness standard for conditionally approved drugs would \ndiffer from the effectiveness standard for new drugs approved under \nSection 512 in that a ``reasonable expectation of effectiveness'' \nrather than ``substantial evidence of effectiveness'' would be \ndemonstrated. If the FDA approves an application for conditional \napproval, this approval will be in effect for 1 year, renewable for a \nmaximum of 4 additional 1 year terms. This conditional approval is \nintended to allow drug sponsors to recoup some development costs \nthrough marketing the product prior to full, unconditional approval.\n  Second, this legislation provides for an index of legally marketed \nunapproved new animal drugs for some non-food minor animal species. The \nindex is intended to provide a way to lawfully market those minor \nspecies drugs for which there is unlikely to be sufficient financial \nincentive to seek a full or conditional approval. If the FDA determines \nthat a new animal drug is eligible for listing on the index, the new \ndrug will be added to the index if the\n\n[[Page S4531]]\n\nbenefits of using the drug outweigh the risks, taking into account the \nharm caused by the absence of an approved or conditionally approved \ndrug for the use in question. The addition of a drug to the index will \nbe based in large part on a report of an independent expert panel.\n  The Minor Use and Minor Species Animal Health Act will not alter FDA \ndrug-approval responsibilities that ensure the safety of animal drugs \nto the public. The FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine currently \nevaluates new animal drug products prior to approval and use. This \nrigorous testing and review process provides consumers with the \nconfidence that animal drugs are safe for animals and consumers of \nproducts derived from treated animals. Current FDA requirements include \nguidelines to prevent harmful residues and evaluations to examine the \npotential for the selection guidelines to prevent harmful residues and \nevaluations to examine the potential for the selection of resistant \npathogens. Any food animal medicine or drug considered for approval \nunder this bill would be subject to these same assessments.\n  The Minor Use and Minor Species Animal Health Act is supported by 43 \norganizations, including the American Farm Bureau Federation, the \nAnimal Health Institute, the American Veterinary Medical Association, \nand the National Aquaculture Association. This is vital legislation.\n  This Act will reduce the economic risks and hardships which fall upon \nranchers and farmers as a result of livestock diseases. It will benefit \npets and their owners and benefit various endangered species and \naquatic animals. The Act also will promote the health of all animal \nspecies while protecting human health and will alleviate unnecessary \nanimal suffering. This is common-sense legislation which will benefit \nmillions of American pet owners, farmers, and ranchers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Leahy, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Mr. Smith, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. \n        Bingaman):\n  S. 742.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``International Disability and \n     Victims of Warfare and Civil Strife Assistance Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following finding:\n       (1)(A) According to the International Committee of the Red \n     Cross, there are tens of millions of landmines in over 60 \n     countries around the world, and it has estimated that as many \n     as 24,000 people are maimed or killed each year by landmines, \n     mostly civilians, resulting in amputations and disabilities \n     of various kinds.\n       (B) While the United States Government invests more than \n     $100,000,000 in mine action programs annually, including \n     funding for mine awareness and demining training programs, \n     only about ten percent of these funds go to directly aid \n     landmine victims.\n       (C) The Patrick Leahy War Victims Fund, administered by the \n     United States Agency for International Development, has \n     provided essential prosthetics and rehabilitation for \n     landmine and other war victims in developing countries who \n     are disabled and has provided long-term sustainable \n     improvements in quality of life for victims of civil strife \n     and warfare, addressing such issues as barrier-free \n     accessibility, reduction of social stigmatization, and \n     increasing economic opportunities.\n       (D) Enhanced coordination is needed among Federal agencies \n     that carry out assistance programs in foreign countries for \n     victims of landmines and other victims of civil strife and \n     warfare to make better use of interagency expertise and \n     resources.\n       (2) According to a review of Poverty and Disability \n     commissioned by the World Bank, ``disabled people have lower \n     education and income levels than the rest of the population. \n     They are more likely to have incomes below poverty level than \n     the non-disabled population, and they are less likely to have \n     savings and other assets . . . [t]he links between poverty \n     and disability go two ways--not only does disability add to \n     the risk of poverty, but conditions of poverty add to the \n     risk of disability.''.\n       (3) Numerous international human rights conventions and \n     declarations recognize the need to protect the rights of \n     individuals regardless of their status, including those \n     individuals with disabilities, through the principles of \n     equality and non-discrimination.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to authorize \n     assistance for individuals with disabilities, including \n     victims of landmines and other victims of civil strife and \n     warfare.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this \nmeasure and commend Senator Campbell for his leadership on this matter. \nThis is a measure the Senate passed last year as S. 1644. The Senate's \naction in May, 2002, unfortunately met with resistance in the House of \nRepresentatives and our bill was not enacted into law last year as it \nshould have been.\n  Senator Campbell correctly proceeded to reintroduce the bill as S. \n330, earlier this year. The bill provides for two things: highway signs \nto guide visitors to veterans cemeteries and a criminal provision for \nthe willful destruction of memorials and cemeteries for our Armed \nForces veterans.\n  I have urged all Senators, Republicans and Democrats, to support this \nmodest legislative effort to help honor our Armed Forces veterans. In \naddition, of course, I will continue to support efforts to improve \nmedical services, veterans hospitals, and other benefits for the women \nand men who risk and have risked their lives and livelihoods to protect \nall of us.\n  I asked the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to include this \nmatter on the agenda for Judiciary Committee action last week I thank \nhim for accommodating our request and am happy that this bill was \nreported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee to the full Senate. I \nam confident that the Senate will again pass it. I trust that this year \nthe House of Representatives will act favorably on this good \nlegislation to honor our veterans.\n  Mr. FRIST.
