Mr. President, the Senate will immediately resume \nconsideration of S. 1, the prescription drug benefits and Medicare \nbill. There are approximately 33 pending amendments from last week and \nyesterday. We continue to make good progress. Under the order from last \nnight, we have two consecutive votes this morning at 11 o'clock on the \nRockefeller amendment No. 976 and the Bingaman amendment No. 984. Also, \nlast night we reached an agreement to vote at 2:25 this afternoon in \nrelation to the Dodd amendment No. 969 on open enrollments. This \nmorning, the two managers will be working through the pending \namendments and will attempt to set up additional votes for this \nafternoon.\n  I reiterate once again we will finish this bill this week, possibly \nThursday night. It could be a very late Thursday night. I predict it \nwill be a late night tonight, Tuesday night, Wednesday night, and \nThursday night. If we spill over to Friday or even Saturday, we will \nfinish this bill before the recess. I do encourage Members to come \nforward with their amendments as soon as possible and make those \navailable to the managers if you plan on offering those amendments. We \nhave a lot of work to do. The cooperation of Members will be very much \nappreciated over the next 2, 3 days.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/24/senate-section/article/S8385-7", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8385-S8386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PASSAGE OF S. 1157 AND S. 239\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me just make one final comment. In \nwrapup last night, we had two very important pieces of legislation pass \nthrough the body. We are debating throughout each day the prescription \ndrug benefits and Medicare bill, yet we have other important matters.\n  Last night, we passed S. 1157, which establishes a National Museum of \nAfrican American History. Senator Brownback has been working on getting \nthis bill cleared for full Senate action since its introduction on May \n23 of this year. I publicly thank him for his efforts and attention on \nthis important issue so that the Senate was able to pass it \nexpeditiously.\n  Also last night, the Senate passed S. 239, the Trauma Care Systems \nPlanning And Development Act, which I introduced in January of this \nyear. This bill directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \ncollect, compile, and disseminate information regarding trauma care and \nemergency medical services, and, in so doing, takes into special \nconsideration people in rural areas who might not otherwise have access \nto that care.\n  I mention those two very important pieces of legislation because I \nwant our\n\n[[Page S8386]]\n\ncolleagues to be aware we did pass them late last night.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/24/senate-section/article/S8386-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could say through the Chair to the \nleader, as the leader indicated, we have more than 30 amendments. To \nvote on those would take 12 hours, or something like that. The two \nmanagers last night indicated they thought two-thirds of the amendments \nthat are pending could be accepted by the two managers.\n  We have on our side probably no more than six more amendments to \noffer on this legislation. Senator Boxer is here to offer her \namendment. We have several more that could follow that. Then we have an \nimportant amendment that Senators Conrad and Lincoln offered. Senator \nLincoln offered it on Friday, but she withdrew it, and she wants to \nreoffer that today.\n  I think if we do not have some flareup as a result of someone wanting \nto change the basic components of the bill, it is very likely we can \nfinish this bill in a reasonably short period of time. I hope the two \nmanagers, who were meeting after we adjourned last night, have been \nable to make headway in working through the money we have left over \nthat has created so much interest. Anytime there are a few dollars--and \nthis is more than a few dollars--left on the table, so to speak, there \nare a lot of people who are after that money. I hope that can be \nresolved in some fair manner. But if that is the case, then I think \nyou, the distinguished Republican leader, can complete this bill in a \nreasonably short period of time.\n  On our side, we have done our best to have amendments ready to offer. \nSenator Boxer is in the Chamber. She will not take a great deal of time \non her amendment. We have the other key amendments we believe are ready \nto be offered and can be done in a short period of time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Chair. In brief response, through the Chair, I \nthink it is a very accurate assessment of where we are. The managers \ncontinued to meet last night and will continue to meet this morning as \nwe put together the various amendments. So I am very satisfied with the \ncontinued progress we are making and appreciate Members on both sides \nof the aisle coming forward with their amendments. With that, I think \nwe will be able to stay on schedule, giving good, adequate time for \ndebate and amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/24/senate-section/article/S8386-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n\n[[Page S8387]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself and \n     Ms. Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered 1001.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                (Purpose: To eliminate the coverage gap)\n\n       On page 49, strike line 3 through page 50, line 2 and \n     insert the following:\n       ``(2) Limits on cost-sharing.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The coverage has cost-sharing (for costs \n     above the annual deductible specified in paragraph (1) and up \n     to the annual out-of-pocket limit under paragraph (4)) that \n     is equal to 50 percent or that is actuarially consistent \n     (using processes established under subsection (f)) with an \n     average expected payment of 50 percent of such costs.\n       ``(B) Application.--Notwithstanding the succeeding \n     provisions of this part, the Administrator shall not apply \n     subsection (d)(1)(C) and paragraphs (1)(D), (2)(D), and \n     (3)(A)(iv) of section 1860D-19(a).\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I offer this amendment in the true spirit \nof making this bill work, making it a bill that isn't confusing for our \nseniors, a bill that doesn't cause a hardship, as the existing bill \ndoes, for those who are the sickest.\n  In this amendment I have the support not only of several colleagues \nbut of the AARP, which very strongly supports it. As you know, they \nhave been choosing their amendments very carefully. Also we are \nsupported by the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \nMedicare. So we have both the largest senior citizen organizations \nbacking this amendment.\n  I was proud to give the national Democratic radio address on \nSaturday. I did it on this particular issue. The issue I will be \naddressing through this amendment is ending the benefit shutdown that \noccurs in this bill just at a point in time when seniors need their \nbenefit the most. I will explain it because it isn't that complicated \nonce you explain it.\n  Let me take a step back and say the best thing about the bill before \nus is it starts a Medicare benefit prescription drug benefit for our \nseniors. We have been talking about this for years. We have been \npushing it for years. Since Medicare was created 38 years ago, seniors \nhave been waiting for a prescription drug benefit. I must say, the \nolder I get the more I realize the revolution we have seen in medicine, \none that is now one of prevention. If one takes a high blood pressure \nmedicine, if one can't control it any other way, it becomes absolutely \na lifesaving benefit. If one doesn't do that or one can't afford to do \nthat, the chances of stroke or heart disease go up immeasurably. So the \nbest thing about the bill before us is that it begins something so many \nof us have fought for so long.\n  Unfortunately, the plan is wanting. The plan needs to be improved. It \nis very complicated. I have read this from a Senator on the Republican \nside. I heard from a Senator on the Democratic side:\n\n       No one really understands this.\n\n  That was a reference to Senators. I have a handle on what this bill \ndoes. I have had to work; I have had my staff work. I am fortunate to \nhave a good staff. I have talked to my colleagues. But if it took me so \nlong to figure this out, what will it do to our people.\n  One of the improvements we should make is this amendment I offer. I \nwant to explain exactly what I mean when I say a benefit shutdown. It \nhas been called a number of things--a coverage gap, a donut hole. But a \nbenefit shutdown really explains it because here is what happens. You \nare going about your business. You are paying your premium. You are \ngetting your 50-percent benefit after you pay your deductible. And \nbingo, you hit a certain point and what happens? No more benefit.\n  I have studied 100 different plans that offer a benefit. Ninety-nine \nof them don't have any of this. One of them has this, but it is a very \nrich plan and the benefit shutdown is very small. So this is the only \nplan I have ever seen in existence that has this ridiculous benefit \nshutdown. I don't understand why it happened, but I guess the bill was \na compromise so that is why we have it.\n  Let me explain what it means. I will show a couple of charts to you. \nAfter a senior pays $275 in a deductible, they start getting 50 percent \nof the cost of the drug reimbursed. So it is a 50-percent benefit, once \nyou have paid your deductible. By the way, every month you have at \nleast a $35 premium.\n  Now all of a sudden, you get to $4,500 worth of drugs and your \nbenefit shuts down and the next $1,300 you have to pay out of your own \npocket. I know the State of the Presiding Officer is not much different \nfrom mine in the sense that our seniors are mostly low income. Many of \nthem are living on their Social Security checks, maybe a little more, \nbut since the market went down, many of them are relying on their \nSocial Security checks. For them to have to pay $1,300 right in the \nmiddle of a year is absolutely outrageous. That is why AARP is \nsupporting my amendment. They sent out a letter on my amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              American Association\n\n\n                                           of Retired Persons,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 2003.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: AARP supports your amendment to close \n     the coverage gap that exists in the drug benefit design of S. \n     1.\n       Throughout the debate over a Medicare prescription drug \n     benefit, AARP has voiced our members' concerns about the need \n     for affordable and adequate coverage. Chief among these \n     concerns continues to be the existence of a gap in the \n     benefit. We appreciate the efforts made by the Finance \n     Committee to close the gap and we believe the Senate should \n     finish the job.\n       AARP members find the notion of a gap in coverage to be a \n     major barrier to enrolling in a Medicare drug benefit. They \n     tell us that they are unaware of similar features in any of \n     the insurance products they routinely purchase. Our members \n     do not understand why coverage would cease at a time when \n     their drug expenses increase. The continued existence of this \n     benefit gap threatens the workability of the benefit by \n     jeopardizing adequate enrollment, and thus the program's \n     ability to spread risk. Therefore, we urge the Senate to \n     eliminate this coverage gap.\n       Thank you for your leadership on the issue. We look forward \n     to working with you and other members of the Senate to enact \n     a prescription drug benefit that will provide meaningful \n     relief to current and future Medicare beneficiaries.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William D. Novelli.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will read it. That is why they said I could mention on \nthe national radio address that they support my amendment--a $1,300 \ncost after you hit $4,500.\n  Let's take the case of someone who has $7,000 a year in drug costs--\nand many people do. Their estimated annual premium? At least $420, \nmaybe a little more. Their deductible? $275. They pay 50 percent of the \ncost of their medication, $2,113, until they get to $4,500. Now comes \nthe benefit shutdown where they have to pay 100 percent of the cost \nbetween $4,500 and $5,812. It is actually $1,312. Then they get a good \ncatastrophic benefit where they pay 10 percent. Look at what the senior \nis paying for this benefit: $4,239 out of a $7,000 bill.\n  The point is, because of this benefit shutdown and the huge penalty, \na lot of our senior citizens would get a better drug benefit if they \nwent to Canada and bought their drugs. This is a fact. They would be \nbetter off if they went to Canada and bought their drugs. But we can \nfix it today. We can end this benefit shutdown, and then the benefit \nwill be far better.\n  Another way to look at the benefit shutdown is to see how unfair it \nis to our beneficiaries. You are paying your monthly premium every \nsingle month; $35 is what we are suggesting. But it could go up. We \nhaven't reined in what they could charge you. Anyone who has dealt with \ninsurance companies and HMOs knows that costs go up. Even Medicare has \nhad to raise its costs a little bit. But by the way, because Medicare \nadministrative costs are so low, at 3 percent, compared to these \ncompanies which could be as high as 25 percent, Medicare keeps the \ncosts down. But under this bill, you only get Medicare if you can't get \na private company. So I am telling you, we are going to have seniors \nmaybe facing increases in their premiums. But let's give it a shot. \nLet's say it is only $35. It is $35 a month every single month. And \nguess what happens in October, if you have this kind of $500-a-month \nexpense--just to use that as an example--you do not get that benefit \nfor almost 3 months out of the year.\n\n[[Page S8388]]\n\n  What kind of plan is this? Fortunately, it is voluntary so people \nhave to think long and hard if it makes sense for them to do it. And I \nwill give credit where credit is due. For our lowest income people, it \nmay be a decent deal. But for your average recipient, to have to \nexplain why they get no benefit for 3 months puts us in a terrible \nsituation. It harkens back to the days when we did a catastrophic \nbenefit and seniors took it. Then when they realized what it was, they \nwere so angry, they were just throwing themselves on legislators' \nautomobiles to protest. I am not kidding. This happened.\n  I don't want to see that happen. I want to see us do a good bill, one \nthat is really straightforward, not confusing. So we have a real \nproblem for our vulnerable citizens.\n  The last chart I am going to show is this chart because I said I \nwould read to you from AARP's letter that they sent me. I hope \ncolleagues will listen to what they say:\n\n       AARP members find the notion of a gap in coverage to be a \n     major barrier to enrolling in a Medicare drug benefit. They \n     tell us that they are unaware of similar features in any of \n     the insurance products they routinely purchase. Our members \n     do not understand why coverage would cease at a time when \n     their drug expenses increase. The continued existence of this \n     benefit gap threatens the workability of the benefit by \n     jeopardizing adequate enrollment, and thus the program's \n     ability to spread risk. Therefore, we urge the Senate to \n     eliminate this coverage gap.\n\n  Mr. President, that is exactly what my amendment does. Let me go \nthrough this one argument at a time.\n\n       AARP members find the notion of a gap in coverage to be a \n     major barrier to enrolling in a Medicare drug benefit.\n\n  Well, clearly, Mr. Novelli and the AARP understand the fact that you \nhave a barrier when you know that perhaps for 3 months, even though you \nare paying your premium, you get no benefit. Again, we have studied all \nthe plans. Virtually no plan in America has a benefit shutdown. So \nlet's make this bill better.\n  Let's see the next thing AARP says:\n\n       They tell us that they are unaware of similar features in \n     any of the insurance products they routinely purchase.\n\n  Absolutely. Only in the Congress could somebody come up with this way \nto save money. It is ridiculous. You are penalized if you are really \nsick. You are penalized if you are really sick because if someone gets \ncancer and has to buy very expensive drugs, or a family member gets \nAlzheimer's and they are trying to treat the disease in a way so they \ncan have their loved one around longer, that is when they get hit with \na benefit shutdown. How unfair is that?\n\n       Our members do not understand why coverage would cease at a \n     time when their drug expenses increase. The continued \n     existence of this benefit gap threatens the workability of \n     the benefit by jeopardizing adequate enrollment, and thus the \n     program's ability to spread risk.\n\n  What does that mean? It means that as seniors learn what this program \nis about, they may well come to the conclusion, depending on the size \nof their drug bill, that they are better off making a trip to Canada. \nThey will save more than going through all the rigmarole--Senator \nClinton showed on a chart the rigmarole you have to be involved in, and \nbecause the way the bill has tried to really privatize this benefit, \nyou are at the risk of the marketplace. The risk of the marketplace is \nOK when you are buying a car; it is OK if you are buying a dishwasher. \nYou are at the risk of the marketplace. Yes, if it was a year when \npeople held back and didn't produce a new product, OK, you are \ndisadvantaged; OK, that is the risk. But to put seniors at the risk of \nthe marketplace for drugs is a very bad idea indeed.\n\n       Therefore, we urge the Senate to eliminate this coverage \n     gap.\n\n  This letter is signed by William Novelli, executive director and CEO \nof AARP. It is a nonpartisan organization that supports this amendment \nstrongly. We want to close this gap. We want to stop this benefit \nshutdown. Again, a very graphic way to show what happens to you is to \nsay that seniors will pay half of their annual drug cost from $276 to \n$4,500--that is their 50 percent benefit--and then they face a $1,300 \nbenefit shutdown, just at the time they need their medicine the most. \nIt makes no sense.\n\n  You know, $1,300 may not sound like a lot to some of our Senators \nhere. We get good pay and, by the way, we have a pharmaceutical benefit \nin our health plan. It is a very good one. It is an excellent one. You \nknow what. It doesn't stop when you hit a certain level. Our \npharmaceutical benefit just keeps on going. It just keeps on coming, as \ndo pharmaceutical benefits in practically all the plans in America \ntoday.\n  Just think about the administrative overhead to figure this one out. \nYou are going along and, all of a sudden, this red arrow kicks in: \nStop. I want to know how much it is costing us to administer this kind \nof deal. You can imagine, you get a note in the mail. Your benefit \nstops. You have paid $4,500. You go back and check your records. No, I \ndidn't, I have only paid $4,200. You call up the administrator: You \nhave made a mistake. Well, no, I didn't. Well, yes, you did.\n  How many hours will a senior who is confused and upset have to spend \non the phone? How many hours will an administrator have to spend \nworking on the details of this? Too long, I can tell you that.\n  This plan, as it is before us, if this amendment doesn't pass, pulls \nthe rug out from underneath the people who are going to need the help \nthe most. So if we are in this in order to offer a plan that people \nwill utilize, then let's support this amendment. It is as simple as \nthat.\n  Many seniors take medicines to manage chronic health problems. I \ndiscussed that at the beginning. How wonderful is it that today we can \navoid horrible outcomes by taking pills that will help keep our blood \npressure down, regulate our heart rate, keep our insulin in check--I \ncould go on and on and on. Some of our seniors are cutting their pills \nin half because they cannot afford it. How tragic would it be if, after \nthey think they are going to have this great benefit, they find out \nthey could do better going up to Canada and buying the pills because \nmaybe it comes out to 25 percent when all is said and done, when you \nput in the benefit shutdown, the premiums cost, and the deductible. It \njust may not add up. How sad it would be if, after all the hoopla we \nare associating with this bill, the bill itself is inadequate.\n  I received a letter from a constituent in San Marcos, CA. She has an \nannual prescription drug cost that will top $10,000. Well, she will be \nhit with this benefit shutdown.\n  Another constituent from Indio, CA, told me she has made five trips \nto Mexico over the last several years to purchase her prescriptions. \nThis senior drives all day long to Mexico in order to purchase \naffordable heart medicine that she needs to survive, that she needs so \nthat she can wake up every day and see her grandchildren, and take a \nwalk, and have a quality of life. She is awaiting a benefit that will \nmake it easy for her to go down to her corner pharmacy and say: Here is \nmy card; I am ready to go. But this particular senior is going to be \nshocked to find out that if she is in the category of the benefit \nshutdown, it is going to cost her $1,300, plus at least $35 a month, \nplus a deductible.\n  A retired physician from Marina del Rey told me that a pill he takes \nfor heart disease went up 600 percent--from $15 to $85. So for seniors \nwho have to take an assortment of medicine to manage chronic diseases, \nthe cost really starts to add up.\n  I have 4 million senior citizens who are part of the Medicare Program \nin my State. If you take the population of Delaware, that is five \nDelawares. That is how many senior citizens I have, and they deserve a \nbreak.\n  Unfortunately, this bill gives them a break, a break in coverage. \nLet's close that break in coverage. Let's close that gap, stop the \nbenefit shutdown, and let's have a bill of which we all can be proud.\n  Again, this benefit shutdown is unheard of if we look at all the \nplans. It would not happen to you, Mr. President, if you have FEHBP. It \nwill not happen to your wife, your kids, or you. It does not happen to \nme. I do not walk in and they say: Oh, Senator, sorry, you are in that \ntime of the year; gee, just for these 3 months, you do not get any \nbenefit at all. I guarantee you, if our plan did that, there would be \nshouting at the caucus lunches: What kind of plan do we have that we \nwalk in, in the middle of the year, and somebody tells us we do not \nhave coverage? We are paying our premium.\n  We would not stand for it.\n\n[[Page S8389]]\n\n  Why are we giving a plan to the seniors we represent that is far \nworse than the plan we have? Because we want to give tax breaks for the \nwealthy few, and so we cannot afford to do this?\n  This is not a costly fix. CBO is telling us it is $60 billion out of \na $400 billion bill. Let's figure out a way to pay for it. It is easy. \nI can tell you right now the administrative costs in this bill range \nfrom 15 percent to 25 percent. That is $100 billion. Why are the \nadministrative costs so high? The private sector is doing it, not \nMedicare. Medicare has a 3-percent overhead. The private sector has a \n10- to 20-percent overhead. Let's take the bill back and figure it out \nand close this benefit shutdown.\n  I do not want to be the Senator who stands up and votes for this with \na smile on my face and then have a senior stand up and say: Senator, I \nwalked into my pharmacy in October. I have $500-a-month drug expenses, \nand guess what, I have no benefit. I had to pay $1,300 out of my own \npocket just when I needed the drugs the most. Why are you doing this to \nme? Why don't you do it to yourself?\n  That is what I hope they say.\n  I am so happy we are discussing a Medicare drug benefit, believe me. \nI share the views of a lot of my colleagues that it is time we have \none, but to have this plan, the only plan in the country virtually that \nhas a benefit shutdown, is an embarrassment to me. We do not have it in \nthe Senate plan. They do not have it over in the House, I assure you of \nthat.\n  We should not have a benefit that starts and stops. What is really \nfrosting Senator Graham is that seniors even have to pay a premium \nduring this benefit shutdown. So he has an amendment--we have not voted \non it yet--that says at least for October, November, and December, do \nnot charge seniors a premium.\n  It is the same as if someone walked in a store and said: I want to \nbuy a TV set, here is my money; I am going to pay it off over 3 months, \nhere is my money. And they say, thank you very much; you are not \ngetting a TV set; we will deliver it in 3 months. But you advertised \nit. No, you have to pay me 3 months, and then I will send you your TV \nset.\n  In a free market economy, this is a very sick idea. This does not \nmake any sense. In our society, if you put money down, you pay for a \nbenefit, you pay for a product, you get it.\n  I think Bob Graham has a good idea: If you are going to do this to \nseniors, then do not make them pay their premium. At least show some \nregard for the person.\n  You are a senior; you are on several drugs; you are feeling good; the \nmedicine really helps you; you have signed up for the plan; you have \npaid your deductible; you start getting your 50 percent benefit; and, \nboom, it is over, when you reach $4,500. Your benefit shuts down.\n\n  I cannot say it enough. It is unheard of to pay a $1,300 penalty for \nsickness. I cannot say it enough.\n  You have signed up. A few months go by, and you add the costs up in \nyour head trying to figure out how much your medicine is costing. You \nrealize you are going to hit the $4,500 benefit shutdown. Your doctor \nsays you need to keep taking the medicine because you are worse, and he \nknows you are worried about entering the benefit shutdown. You are \ngoing to be hit with the full cost of those drugs for that period. What \nare you going to do?\n  You sit down and you crunch the numbers. You ask: How can I cut \ncosts? You may well skip your medicine; you may well cut the pills in \nhalf; and you may well threaten your health and your life.\n  The benefit shutdown is wrong. It goes against everything we do in \nthis country. Nobody else does this. It is not that expensive to fix. \nYou are going to need a calculator every time you try to figure out \nwhat you have to save. You are going to need a good accountant.\n  A shutdown is going to cause trouble with the administration of this \nbenefit. People will be calculating: Gee, Mr. Thomas has used $3,925. \nLet's get him on the watchlist. Mrs. Boxer over there, she has used \n$4,000. Then suddenly you are cut off. You call up and you do not \nunderstand it. It is going to take hours to explain it to a senior \ncitizen.\n  In closing my discussion of this amendment--and I will be asking for \nthe yeas and nays on this amendment--the National Committee to Preserve \nSocial Security and Medicare and the AARP, the two biggest senior \ncitizen organizations in this country, endorse this amendment.\n  I am to again read from Mr. Novelli's letter because this says it all \nin a very clear way, and I hope my presentation has demonstrated that \neverything Mr. Novelli, the CEO of AARP, has stated is true:\n\n       AARP members find the notion of a gap in coverage--\n\n  That is benefit shutdown--\n\n       to be a major barrier to enrolling in a Medicare drug \n     benefit. They tell us that they are unaware of similar \n     features in any of the insurance products they routinely \n     purchase. Our members do not understand why coverage would \n     cease at a time when their drug expenses increase. The \n     continued existence of this benefit gap threatens the \n     workability of the benefit by jeopardizing adequate \n     enrollment and thus the program's ability to spread risk. \n     Therefore, we urge the Senate to eliminate this coverage gap.\n\n  Signed William Novelli, AARP.\n  I thank the AARP because I know they are calling colleagues and \nexplaining this. Just remember, do unto others as you would like them \nto do unto you. Do my colleagues want to have their drug benefit \nchanged so that just when they need their pharmaceutical product the \nmost, they tell you it is not covered for you; it is not covered for \nyour wife; it is not covered for your husband; it is not covered for \nyour children? Mr. President, you do not want that. Why are we doing it \nto the seniors? At least give them a break and close down this benefit \nshutdown because if we do not, if we do not vote for this amendment, \npeople are going to be at our doors because they are not going to \nunderstand it.\n  If my colleagues vote for this amendment and we fix this, we can \ntruly say we have made this a far better plan, a plan more like our \nown, a plan more like the other 100 plans I have looked at.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Is there a \nsufficient second? At this time, there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I renew my request for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask that all pending amendments be \ntemporarily laid aside so the Senator from Arkansas can offer an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the ranking member of the Finance Committee, as \nwell as the chairman, for their diligence in this very important issue.\n  I say to my colleagues, I do not think we will be taking up an issue \nquite as critical as this one for quite some time when we reflect both \non the economy of our country and the quality of life we want to \nprovide our seniors in this Nation and, more importantly, when we think \nabout where our Nation is going in terms of the demographics and the \nnumber of seniors we actually have in this country, going from 41 \nmillion Americans over the age of 65 to an explosion in the next 15 to \n20 years of almost 70 to 75 million Americans over the age of 65.\n  In looking at this prescription drug package, I hope we all will look \nat it not only as an ability to provide the seniors the kind of quality \nof life we want to provide them but that we also look at it as an \neconomic issue in terms of what it is going to cost us in this great \ncountry to provide the kind of quality of care in the next 20 years if \nwe do not look at a prescription drug\n\n[[Page S8390]]\n\npackage which is going to provide our seniors with the ability to live \ntheir lives in a way where it will be less costly to the more expensive \nareas of health care and, more importantly, they will be able to live \nthe final years of their life in comfort and certainly more comfortable \ncircumstances, hopefully at home, and have the quality of life we want \nthem to have.\n  Medicare has been a successful, stable program for millions of \nseniors and individuals with disabilities for over 40 years. Medicare \nhas succeeded in guaranteeing hospital coverage and physician coverage \nfor a population which was largely uninsurable. Now we are debating \nadding prescription drug coverage to the Medicare Program and we should \ndo it in a way that echoes that same stability in the program seniors \nenjoy.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1002\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, at this time I send an amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mrs. Lincoln], for herself, Mr. \n     Conrad, Mr. Miller, and Mr. Carper proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1002.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To allow medicare beneficiaries who are enrolled in fallback \n   plans to remain in such plans for two years by requiring the same \n  contracting cycle for fallback plans as Medicare Prescription Drug \n                                 plans)\n\n       On page 83, strike lines 1 through 7, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(5) Contract to be available in designated area for 2 \n     years.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if the Administrator \n     enters into a contract with an entity with respect to an area \n     designated under subparagraph (B) of such paragraph for a \n     year, the following rules shall apply:\n       ``(A) The contract shall be for a 2-year period.\n       ``(B) The Secretary is not required to make the \n     determination under paragraph (1)(A) with respect to the \n     second year of the contract for the area.\n       ``(C) During the second year of the contract, an eligible \n     beneficiary residing in the area may continue to receive \n     standard prescription drug coverage (including access to \n     negotiated prices for such beneficiaries pursuant to section \n     1860D-6(e)) under such contract or through any Medicare \n     Prescription Drug plan that is available in the area.\n       At the end of title VI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

I am extremely proud to offer this amendment with my \ncolleagues, Senators Conrad and Miller. Our amendment seeks to make the \ndrug benefit more predictable and reliable for seniors by allowing them \nto remain for 2 years instead of 1 year in what we are calling the \nfallback plan that is outlined in S. 1. As I mentioned when I began \nspeaking this morning, Medicare is here because over 40 years ago more \nthan a majority of seniors in this Nation were uninsurable. We were \nfinding that private industry was not finding this group of individuals \nprofitable enough to actually be in the marketplace and provide them a \nplan. So I think it is critical, as we look at what we are trying to do \ntoday in reforming Medicare and providing a prescription drug plan, \nthat we look at what history has shown us and that we are careful to \nmake sure the plan we provide is going to meet the needs as well as to \nbe fair for all seniors in this great Nation and across the \ndemographics of our country.\n  Senator Conrad and I raised this issue in the Finance Committee \nseveral weeks ago, since our States are primarily rural and have not \nhistorically been attractive to the private insurance industry. This \namendment we are offering today simply requires the same 2-year \ncontracting cycle for fallback plans as is required for the private \ndrug-only insurance plan.\n  We want to make sure the private plans that can come in for a 2-year \ncontract for our seniors who are out in rural areas, who are \ndisproportionately low income, who are less attractive in many ways for \nthese private entities to serve, will have the same opportunity and the \nsame stability other regions of the Nation will have because those \nfallback plans will be there for the same amount of time as the private \ninsurance industry.\n  In the underlying bill, Senators Grassley and Baucus took a number of \nsteps to encourage private drug-only insurance plans to contract with \nMedicare and deliver the drug benefit. They created a special \ntransition risk corridor in the first 2 years to encourage these plans \nto participate, and they gave the administrator of CMS additional tools \nto get the plans in there. If the administrator determines that at \nleast two plans cannot stomach accepting the minimum requirements for \naccepting risks described in the bill, then the administrator can \nreduce the amount of risk plans needed to assume. Alternatively, the \nadministrator can increase the reinsurance percentage or the subsidies \nto encourage drug-only insurance plans to participate.\n  By doing all of these things, this bill acknowledges these plans \ncurrently do not exist in nature, as has been the statement of our \ncurrent CMS administrator, and they must be enticed to come in and do \nthe job. In other words, we have basically bent over backwards in this \nbill to bring private plans into this arena of Medicare prescription\n\n[[Page S8391]]\n\ndrugs, particularly in areas where they traditionally have not come.\n  However, there is still no guarantee they will. That is why I am glad \nSenator Grassley and Senator Baucus created a Medicare-guaranteed drug \nplan, or safety net, called the fallback. If the administrator exhausts \nall his options and still no two plans want to come in and deliver \ndrugs to our elderly, then a Medicare-guaranteed plan or a fallback \nplan will deliver that drug benefit.\n  The only problem I have with the fallback is it is available for \nseniors for only 1 year at a time. This means if private insurers \ndecide to test whether they want to offer the benefit in a community, \nseniors lose access to the fallback plan even if the new plan is \nsignificantly more expensive for them and/or more restrictive.\n  What does this mean in real life? Imagine this scenario in this \nchart. We have it on a chart so it certainly makes a lot of sense. \nThere is an 85-year-old senior in rural Arkansas who enrolls in a \nfallback plan, fallback No. 1, in 2006 because there is only one \nprivate drug-only plan that is available in that area. Then in 2007, \nanother private drug-only plan B enters the region so she must leave \nthe fallback and enroll in one of them even if the new plans are not \nbetter for her.\n\n  She chooses private plan A. She suddenly has a different premium, a \ndifferent cost sharing, a different formulary, and a different set of \npreferred network pharmacists. She must figure out if her drugs are \ngoing to be covered or not and where they must go to get them.\n  Then the next year, in 2008, private plan A leaves so she must again \nleave her plan. She enrolls then in plan B and gets used to the new \npremium, the new formulary. But then plan B departs in 2009. With no \nplans in the area, she enrolls in a new fallback plan with a whole new \npremium, a whole new formulary and pharmacy network, and it could go on \nand on.\n  I don't usually use charts, but I feel very comfortable with this \nchart because we have seen this happen before. We have seen it in rural \nareas where Medicare+Choice has come in, they have enticed our seniors, \nand then they have left very quickly, leaving seniors without any kind \nof coverage, having to go back to the traditional Medicare product. We \nknow it can exist because we have seen it before.\n  What we want to do is to simply give seniors, particularly in rural \nareas, more stability in what we are proposing in this Medicare \nprescription drug plan. This is certainly a very real circumstance that \ncould happen as the seniors move in and out--the fact that even in the \nfallback plans there is no standard design, so even when a fallback \nplan leaves and comes back 2 years later, it will still be a whole new \nscenario.\n  Both in the caring for my aging parent and my husband's aging \nparents, as well as my husband's grandmother who will be 106 this \nyear--which is amazing in itself--providing them with more confusion is \nnot where we want to go. We want to make this as simple as possible. We \nwant to make it as easy a transition as we possibly can. Their \nmanagement of multiple diseases or chronic problems is heavy enough in \nterms of the weight on their shoulders and their emotion. Providing \nthem every year with the unfortunate circumstances of having to find a \nnew formulary, find a new premium, a new pharmacist provider is \nabsolutely not what we are trying to do.\n  I plead with my colleagues, I don't want to be in such a horrible \nposition as this. I don't want to force my constituents in it either. \nIt would be confusing to me. All we are asking of our colleagues is to \ngive the fallback plan the same opportunity to succeed as we are giving \nthose private plans, to make sure it will be there in a way that \nseniors will have some stability.\n  I hope our amendment can be adopted. It simply requires that 2-year \ncontract, putting it in line with the current private sector business \npractices that happen in the real world. After all, that is what we are \ntrying to do, make sure we provide a plan that is common in the real \nworld. We use the analogies of plans that already exist--the FEHBP plan \nthat we have as Federal employees. We look at what already exists in a \ntraditional Medicare plan now. We want to make sure we provide as much \ncontinuity for our seniors as we possibly can.\n  This amendment goes a long way to ensure more consistency and \nstability for our seniors. This amendment improves seniors' choices by \nproviding them the option not to bounce back and forth between plans \nwith different benefits and premiums. It improves fairness by allowing \nseniors in both drug-only and fallback plans to remain in those plans \nfor the same 2-year timeframe. It improves the stability of the benefit \npackage by reducing the year-to-year variability in premiums, in cost \nsharing, in formularies, in local pharmacists.\n\n  I don't know how many questions other Members get from their seniors, \nbut I get a ton of them. In my State offices, seniors call all the time \nfor help with benefits and concerns about things that are not covered \ncurrently under Medicare. If you have not got it already, you can well \nimagine what the barrage on your staff and your offices is going to be \nwhen these seniors find themselves, particularly in rural areas, where \nthey are flip-flopping back and forth from one plan to another every \nyear without an understanding of what that plan actually is going to \nprovide.\n  This amendment also aligns contract cycle with current business \npractices. The PBMs serving the private sector typically have 3- to 5-\nyear contracts. Requiring the fallback plans to have a 2-year contract \nbetter reflects the real-world practices and increases the guarantee \nthey will bid to serve regions where drug-only plans have failed to \ncome. It also continues to allow seniors to enroll in drug-only plans \neven if a fallback plan is available for 2 years. Nothing prevents a \nsenior from enrolling in a private drug-only plan if one is available \nin the region.\n  That goes back to one of the best arguments for this plan. That is, \nif the private plans are there and are working, you do not have to \nworry; the fallback plan is not even going to be there to begin with. \nIt is not even going to exist if there are two competing private drug-\nonly plans in the region. This is completely hypothetical if, in fact, \nthe underlying premise that the private drug-only plans are going to \nreach out to every region of the country and they will be there \noffering a good benefit to all of our seniors.\n  The problem is we have history. We know it traditionally has not \nworked in our rural areas. We want to make sure our seniors get the \nsame consideration other seniors in this great country get. It \ncontinues to give drug-only plans first bidding rights. Fallback plans \nonly come to the regions after the CMS administrator has determined \nthat two private drug-only plans will not be available, after he has \nexhausted all of these tools, of which we have given him many in order \nto entice these plans in there.\n  It has a very minimal scoring impact. This amendment buys a lot in \nmaking the system more stable but costs almost nothing. It is very \nreasonable in cost, and we pay for it, so there is no problem in terms \nof what we are talking about doing.\n  I am very proud to have worked on this amendment with my colleague, \nSenator Conrad, who will speak about the importance of the amendment in \nmaking the drug benefit more predictable and reliable for seniors. I am \npleased Senator Miller has joined. Many other Senators I have visited \nare anxious to know about the policy we begin in this drug package for \nMedicare seniors, that we absolutely enter into what we are doing with \nthe knowledge that legislation we work on here we understand is not a \nwork of art, it is a work in progress; as we move through these \nprocesses to improve legislation, that we will take the time to \nunderstand small details. If we can supply the fallback the same \nopportunity, then we can also make sure this bill is going to be good \nfor everybody.\n  We know as we move through the debate on this bill, as we move \nthrough the implementation, there will be multiple changes that will \noccur. It is important, as we take the time as we initially debate this \nissue, that we recognize all parts of our Nation are not exactly alike, \nthat a one-size-fits-all is not going to fit every region of this \nNation.\n  Most importantly, every senior in this great country is just as \nimportant as the other. If you are a low-income senior living in a \nrural part of this Nation and have worked hard your entire\n\n[[Page S8392]]\n\nlife and want to retire in the same area in which you grew up and where \nyou raised your children, you are not going to be slighted in a \nprescription drug package simply because of where you live or the fact \nyou worked at a lower income job and may not have as much to retire on \nas other seniors across this Nation.\n  I hope as we move forward in this amendment and in this bill, we will \nrecognize there are places where we can improve it. We will lead the \ncharge, knowing that is what our job is, that is what this great \ndeliberative body is for. It is to make the improvements along the way \nand to push a bill forward that, in the long term, will provide a \nbetter benefit for people across this Nation. But, most importantly, we \nmust recognize our Nation is diverse. That is a huge part of its \nstrength. Those of us who come from rural areas recognize that \nsometimes our needs are met in different ways.\n\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a look at this very simple \namendment that doesn't cost much but can make up a great deal of ground \nin this bill in bringing parity for all seniors across this Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see my friend from North Dakota is \neager to address the Senate. I will just be a few minutes on this \nparticular amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1001\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to commend the Senator from California, Senator \nBoxer, for her amendment. I will support this amendment for the very \nsound reasons she has outlined here on the floor of the Senate.\n  Just going back very quickly, in 1965 we passed Medicare and we said \nto our seniors: Pay into the fund, play by the rules, and your health \nbenefits will be attended to. Therefore, we provided the \nhospitalization and the physician fees. At that time, only 3 percent of \nall private companies provided any kind of prescription drug \nprotection.\n  We have made extraordinary progress in recent years with the \ndevelopment of prescription drugs to tend the needs of all of our \ncitizens and particularly the elderly. Now prescription drugs are as \nimportant as hospitalization and physician fees.\n  What this overall debate has generally been about, in terms of the \nprescription drug program, is how and when are we going to pass a \nprescription drug program that will be worthy of our senior citizens \nand do for our senior citizens what the hospitalization program and the \nphysician programs, which are under Medicare, Part A and Part B, do for \nour seniors.\n  This particular proposal we have before the Senate now has two very \nimportant gaps. The Senator from California has pointed out one very \nimportant gap, a failure to provide services to many of our elderly. \nThere is a second important gap and that is how we treat our retirees.\n  Senator Boxer has outlined the benefit gap that exists under this \nproposal. What we are talking about is seniors are going to be spending \n$1.8 trillion over the next 10 years. This bill only provides for $400 \nbillion. It is only really about 22 percent of all that is going to be \nnecessary for our seniors over the period of the next 10 years.\n  The issue before us is, first, whether seniors will be able to get \nthe prescription drug program through their Medicare program. I believe \nthe way this bill is constructed they will be. Second, what will the \namount available to them be. Clearly, this bill is short.\n  What the Senator is reminding us about, with her excellent \npresentation, is that if the Senate itself had the will we could be \nproviding the complete amount necessary to meet all the needs of our \nsenior citizens. I believe that is what we should do.\n  We have had this debate before in the Senate under the Graham-Miller \nproposal last year, which I was proud to support. That would have cost \nclose to $600 billion over a period of 8 years. The House Democrats had \na different proposal that would have been, actually, close to $1 \ntrillion. But it would have made all the difference and would have \nattended to the needs of our elderly people.\n\n  The Senate has made a different judgment. They have decided they were \ngoing to provide $3 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthiest \nindividuals, and give short shrift to our seniors with a $400 billion \nproposal. That is what we have here in the Senate.\n  We have had opportunities, even while we were debating the tax \nproposal. A number of us offered amendments and said let's just take \nthe reduction in the top three rates and perhaps the dividend tax \nreduction and, instead of going ahead with those additional deductions, \nuse those resources and put them onto a prescription drug program.\n  We got 49 votes here in the Senate. We got 49 votes here. This body \nis evenly divided, effectively, on the concept that the Senator from \nCalifornia has provided. Virtually half of this Senate wants to provide \nthe full benefits which would be included in the Boxer amendment. That \nis what I think needs to be done if we are going to provide a \nmeaningful benefit to seniors.\n  As this chart points out and as the Senator has explained, after \npaying the $275 dollar deductible, for expenditures up to $4,500, we \nare finding 50 percent of all the expenditures effectively are paid \nfor. Then we have the benefit gap in here, which is sometimes known as \nthe donut hole. And then we find the expenditures for our seniors up at \n90 percent in the high-cost areas.\n  It is this area the Senator from California is addressing. I imagine \nshe would like, as well, to try to do something about reducing this \ndeductible or even the premiums as well. Her amendment certainly would \ndo that.\n  We are back to the real choice of what is important. Are we as a \nNation going to say it is more important to have a prescription drug \nprogram worthy of its name and support the Boxer amendment? Or, are we \ngoing to fail to do that? I, as one Senator, as long as I am in the \nSenate, am going to continue to fight to be sure we provide the \nresources to do for prescription drugs what we are doing for our \nseniors under hospitalization and also with physician fees. I think \nthat is what is fair. That is what is necessary. That is what we mean \nwhen we talk about having a good prescription drug program. That is \nwhat is really called for if we are going to be true to our senior \ncitizens.\n  I thank the Senator for raising this issue again. It is really a \nquestion of choices. It is a question of priorities. This Senate has \nmade a judgment, a decision previously that what we ought to do is \nprovide tax reductions of $3 trillion, and therefore there are those \nwho say we cannot afford to do what we should be doing for the senior \ncitizens of this country. I regret it. It does seem to me the \namendment, which says let's go ahead and pass the Boxer amendment and \nthen we will sort through the pressures we are going to have on our \nbudget in the future and perhaps review some of those excessive tax \nreductions--it seems to me that is in the Nation's interest.\n  This is a question of priorities. It is a question of choice. It is a \nquestion of value. The Senator from California has made what I think is \na compelling case about what is needed to do the job. Mr. President, 22 \npercent is what this downpayment is. I consider it a downpayment. As \nI mentioned on all occasions, I think the downpayment is out there. I \nam going to do everything I can--I am sure the Senator from California \nis as well--to make sure there is not just a downpayment, but there is \ngoing to be a continuing effort on our part to make sure the senior \ncitizens are going to be treated fairly.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to ask a couple questions. The Senator used the \nterm ``donut hole.'' I used the phrase ``benefit shutdown.'' It's all \nthe same. But on the chart, between the yellow and the red, is a big \nwhite space. That means that between $4,500 and $5,800 essentially \nthere is no benefit. This is a cost.\n  My friend is right. All we had to do is tighten up a little bit on \nwhat our colleagues wanted to do for the people who earn $1 million a \nyear. It would not have taken that much. The cost of this, after the \n$400 billion, is $60 billion. We got that from CBO, a $60 billion cost.\n  My question is basically this: Does he not believe, when you really \ntake a look at this, the administrative costs of making this work are \ngoing to be quite large? Think about the accounting that has to go into \nit, to track everybody's benefit. You have to do it\n\n[[Page S8393]]\n\ntwice. Once between $4,500 and $5,800, and then it goes to 90 percent. \nI am convinced, I say to my friend, there will be some administrative \nsavings here.\n  Also I would make the point that because this bill--I know he agrees \nwith me on this--relies too much on the private sector, the \nadministrative costs are sky high. Medicare runs a 3 percent \nadministrative cost. The private sector runs between 15 and 25 percent. \nAs a matter of fact, in the House bill they are saying it is a 25 \npercent cost of the entire bill.\n  So I say to my friend, this particular amendment is not that large a \ncost when you really look at administrative costs going in.\n  The reason I do not offset it, I say to my friend, is because I think \nour smart Senators and their smart staffs can sit down and figure out a \nway to pay for this thing where you can take a lot out of \nadministration. I just wonder if my friend agrees that the complication \ninvolved here is worth removing.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, the complication is costly. We know for a fact we \nspend $5,000 on health care for every man, woman, and child. We are \nspending $1.4 trillion a year for every man, woman, and child in \nAmerica at the present time. That is even before we get into this. \nForty percent out of every health care dollar is nonclinical. It is \nnonclinical. There is not an industry in the world that has that kind \nof, effectively, overhead.\n  If we reduce that from 40 cents to 35 cents, it would be $70 billion \na year. If we took it down to 30 cents, which is not unreasonable, that \nwould be $140 billion a year. It gives you some idea of what is in the \nhealth care system that is not really being translated into good kinds \nof services. And that is a very important issue and question.\n  I think the Senator is right, that there is a very high \nadministrative cost generally in terms of our health care system, and \nthere are things that can be done about it. I hope we will have the \nchance to address those. We have some ideas. But I must say, now the \nquestion really has to do with the questions of priorities, about how \nwe are going to act. The fact is, we have the amount that is in the \nbudget which is only the $400 billion, and you stretch it and stretch \nit, and pull it and pull it, and you get this kind of result. It isn't \nthe kind of result that would be there if the Senator from California \ndrafted the bill or if I drafted the bill, but this is where we are. I \nam going to do everything I possibly can to make sure we are going to \nhave a complete system.\n  I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 976\n\n  Mr. President, I know we are going to go to a vote at 11 o'clock. I \nwould like to take just a minute on the amendment we are going to be \nvoting on. As I understand it, it is the Rockefeller amendment that \nwill be directed toward the retiree issue.\n  One of the great strengths of Medicare is that it is for everyone. \nRich and poor alike contribute to the system. Rich and poor alike \nbenefit from it.\n  At bottom, Medicare is a commitment to every senior citizen and every \ndisabled American that we will not have two-class medicine in America. \nWhen a senior citizen enters a hospital, Medicare pays the same amount \nfor their care whether they are a pauper and a millionaire. When a \nsenior citizen goes to a doctor, she has the peace of mind of knowing \nthat Medicare has the same obligation to pay for her treatment no \nmatter what her financial circumstances and the doctor has no financial \ninterest in rationing her care according to the contents of her bank \naccount.\n  Through the Medicaid program, we do try to provide extra help for \nthose who are poor. But the fact that Medicaid provides extra \nassistance for the poor does not reduce Medicare's obligation to \nprovide equal treatment for all. Medicare always has primary payment \nresponsibilities for the services it covers. Medicaid is always \nsupplementary.\n  Medicaid provides critical help to the poor and the elderly, but it \ndoes not provide the same reliable guarantees of equal treatment that \nMedicare does. Under Medicaid, States have limited the number of days \nof hospital care they would provide or the number of doctors' visits \nthey will support. States have placed arbitrary limits on the number of \nprescriptions.\n\n  This legislation sets an undesirable precedent for treatment of poor \nsenior citizens who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. For \nevery other benefit, these senior citizens enroll in Medicare, and \nMedicaid supplements Medicare's coverage. But for this benefit, the \nbill says that the poor are excluded from Medicare. The only benefits \nthey get are from the Medicaid program. Medicare is for all senior \ncitizens who paid into the program during their working years not just \nsome senior citizens. And it should stay that way.\n  This amendment rights this wrong. It says we will not take away the \nMedicare that the poor have earned by a lifetime of hard work. It \ndeserves the support of the Members. I hope it is adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1002\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the amendment of my \ncolleague from Arkansas. This is an amendment we brought up in the \nFinance Committee.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, will the Senator from North Dakota yield \nfor a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the managers of the bill have asked we \nenter a unanimous consent agreement that the time between 10:50 and 11 \no'clock be equally divided on the Rockefeller amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would object to that because I don't \nwant to be taken off my feet when I am finishing the presentation on \nour amendment. It is going to take me more than 2\\1/2\\ minutes, so I \nobject to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I say to the Senator, let me know, if there is maybe 8 \nminutes equally divided, would you have time to do that?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to do that.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we have 8 \nminutes equally divided, starting at 10:52.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, as I stated earlier on the Senate floor, I \nbelieve the bill before us is a step in the right direction. It \nprovides much-needed and long-awaited prescription drug assistance to \nMedicare beneficiaries across the Nation. I commend Senator Grassley \nand Senator Baucus for putting this proposal together.\n\n  But while I support this effort, I also recognize its shortcomings. I \nthink one of the biggest weaknesses of this bill--other than the fact \nthat it is not the kind of full prescription drug plan that many had \nhoped for because there are not sufficient dollars to support such a \nplan--is the fact this underlying legislation has too much instability. \nIt creates confusion.\n  We could have a senior being in four different plans in 4 different \nyears. And if there is anything I think we know, it is that seniors \nwant certainty. They want to know what they are getting. But under this \nplan, seniors could be bounced back and forth between different plans, \ndepending upon how many private drug-only plans enter an area. That is \nthe first problem. If a senior is in a fallback plan and two private \nplans enter the area, they will be forced to leave a plan they may \nlike, and they have no choice in the matter.\n  The second problem is, every time they switch between drug-only and \nfallback plans, their benefits could change. This chart demonstrates \nthat uncertainty. Premiums are uncertain. Deductibles are uncertain. \nThe coinsurance, coverage gap, the covered drugs, and even access to \nlocal pharmacies with no extra charge--all of those things are subject \nto change.\n  The third issue is this very ability isn't just a problem that could \noccur when a senior goes from a drug-only plan to a so-called fallback \nplan. It could also happen if seniors go from one fallback plan to \nanother.\n  When you add this all up, this is the type of situation a senior \ncould face, as shown on this chart. The Senator from Arkansas earlier \nused this chart. It shows what could happen to a senior being in four \ndifferent plans in 4 different years, with different premiums,\n\n[[Page S8394]]\n\nwith different copays, with different formularies--that is, different \ndrugs being covered--with different rules with respect to whether they \ncan use their local pharmacy without additional cost.\n  All of these are subject to change from year to year. Every one of \nthese--the premiums, the deductibles, the coinsurance, the coverage \ngap, the drugs that are covered--is subject to change. That is not the \ncircumstance we want to construct for our seniors.\n  In one year of this benefit, only one drug-only plan enters a region. \nA senior enrolls in the fallback plan to get drug coverage. In 2007, \nanother private plan enters, and the senior is compelled to leave the \nfallback plan. Whether they like that plan or don't like it, they are \nforced to leave it.\n  In the third year, we might see private plan A leave the program and \nthe senior then be put in private plan B, again with different rules, \nwith different copays, with different premiums, with a different \ncoverage gap. And then again, if private plan B left the area, they \ncould again be in a different fallback plan--four different plans in \nfour different years.\n  I am particularly concerned that rural seniors could face the \nsituation I just described. To date, private plans have not had much \ninterest in coming into those areas. Only 2 percent of rural counties \nhad two or more Medicare+Choice plans in August of 2001.\n  This amendment seeks to create more stability and to provide the kind \nof certainty our seniors want. I hope my colleagues will look upon this \nplan with favor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the National Council on \nthe Aging endorsing this amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The National Council\n\n\n                                                 on the Aging,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 23, 2003.\n     Hon. Blanche Lincoln,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lincoln: The National Council on Aging \n     (NCOA)--the Nation's first organization formed to represent \n     America's seniors and those who serve them--supports the \n     amendment you are offering along with Senator Conrad to \n     provide for a two-year contract cycle for the fallback plan \n     in the Senate Medicare proposal.\n       It is clear from the prescription drug proposal being \n     considered in the Senate that beneficiaries desperately need \n     more stability and less confusion. We are concerned that \n     under the structure currently proposed, vulnerable seniors \n     could be forced to ping-pong back and forth every year from \n     one plan to another--plans with potentially much different \n     premiums, benefit structures, and formularies. We must do \n     everything possible to avoid this kind of instability and \n     confusion, which upset far too many seniors in recent years \n     who enrolled in Medicare+Choice programs. This unfortunate \n     experience must not be repeated.\n       We deeply appreciate the fact that, unlike the House bill, \n     the Senate bill includes a failsafe mechanism to ensure that \n     prescription drug coverage is guaranteed for every \n     beneficiary choosing to participate.\n       Given the authority and flexibility in the Senate proposal \n     to negotiate with private plans to reduce their risk in an \n     effort to encourage their participation, we do not expect a \n     significant number of beneficiaries to need the fallback \n     plan. However, in those instances when it is necessary to \n     guarantee access to drug coverage, seniors should not be \n     disadvantaged by subjecting them to a system that could be \n     disruptive and disturbing.\n       Thank you for your efforts and leadership on behalf of \n     America's seniors. We urge Senators to support your \n     amendment, which will further enhance the stability and \n     fairness of the Senate Medicare proposal.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     James Firman,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 976\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 8 minutes \nof debate evenly divided on the Rockefeller amendment. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask to be yielded 2 minutes of the 4 \nminutes on the Rockefeller amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \n3 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend and \ncolleague from West Virginia.\n  I hope the body will support this amendment. I have spoken about the \nbill generally and expressed my optimism about it despite the serious \nshortcomings I have. It is a major step in the right direction. We can \nenhance that by adopting what Senator Rockefeller is offering us today: \nThe ability to ensure that employers will continue to offer \nprescription drug coverage for their retirees.\n  What we don't want to do, as we move forward with this program, is to \nsupplant existing retiree programs. That would be a great setback for \nus. The bill, as presently crafted, does not count payments made by the \nretiree benefit plan that are out-of-pocket expenditures by the \nindividual beneficiary. This will vastly increase the amount of money \nan employer will have to pay in order to act as an effective supplement \nto the Medicare drug benefit, a so-called wraparound to Medicare. In \nother words, this bill would actually discourage employers from playing \neven that reduced role in terms of prescription drugs.\n  The Rockefeller amendment will address this problem so that employer \ncontributions are counted toward an individual's out-of-pocket costs. \nWe will offer an amendment ourselves that would add even a bit more. \nBut this is a major amendment and a critical one. It would be a great \nirony indeed, as we move forward with our plan, that we end up \ndiscouraging employers from participating, as they have, in providing \ntheir retirees with the kind of protections they need. It would \nactually cost them more. It is very important we adopt this amendment. \nThis is a critically important question.\n  Even before we got into this whole business, the benefits being \nprovided by employers, by nonprofits, and others have been important in \nterms of enhancing a retiree's ability to pay for prescription drugs \nand not have to make the choice of food on the table or prescription \ndrugs or to self-medicate by reducing the amount of prescription drugs \nthey get. No one in this place wants to be a party to actually \nencouraging employers to step away from the very important part they \nalready play in providing these benefits for their employees and \nretirees.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia. It is a very important \namendment. I strongly endorse it and hope it will be adopted.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment No. \n976 offered by Senator Rockefeller to protect retirees from losing \ntheir hard won health care benefits. I also support amendment No. 998 \noffered by Senator Dodd to encourage employers to continue to provide \nretirees with health care coverage.\n  I have seen how a community is devastated when a company pulls the \nretiree health care plan out from under their feet. Last year, when \nSenator Rockefeller and I worked on adding steel retirees to the trade \nadjustment assistance health care tax credit, the writing was on the \nwall for Bethlehem Steel. A once proud company, that was the backbone \nof several communities in Maryland, West Virginia, New York, and \nPennsylvania had been crippled by illegal dumping of foreign steel.\n  Now Bethlehem Steel is no more and nearly 20,000 of their retirees \nand their families in Maryland, nearly 100,000 total, are left without \nthe health care for which they worked their whole lives. We provided \nsome relief for these retirees.\n  But we cannot let other retirees face the fear of losing their health \ncare; face going bankrupt trying to afford their drugs, or face a \nconfusing new system.\n  This legislation does not privatize Medicare: it does not coerce \nseniors to leave the Medicare they trust to get the drugs they need. \nYet it does rely too heavily on private insurance companies. It should \nbe a benefit for seniors and not a benefit for insurance companies that \nhave let seniors down so many times before. Yet it puts the health care \nbenefits of millions of seniors in jeopardy by creating an incentive \nfor employers to drop retiree health care coverage.\n  That is why I will join my colleagues in offering amendments to \nstrengthen the bill.\n  What would this amendment do?\n  CBO, our nonpartisan, unbiased analyst tell us that 37 percent of \nseniors with employer-sponsored coverage will lose that coverage if \nthis bill is passed.\n\n[[Page S8395]]\n\n  These retirees earned their retiree health care benefits. The benefit \npayments made on their behalf should be counted as their contributions \ntoward the catastrophic cap. They earned their health care coverage. It \nis a part of their benefit package as a worker and should count just as \nthe wages they pay for their prescription drugs count.\n  Why is this amendment important?\n  Employers want to do the right thing but are being squeezed at the \nbottom line. Prescription drug costs account for about 40 percent to 60 \npercent of employer retiree health care costs. What does that mean for \nU.S. employers? U.S. employers face competition from overseas where the \ncost of health care, including prescription drugs, is subsidized by the \nGovernment. What does this mean for U.S. retired workers? Unless this \namendment is adopted, a senior could have closer to $10,000 in drug \ncosts before they get the relief of the catastrophic cap. Unless this \namendment is adopted millions of seniors could lose their retiree \nhealth care coverage.\n  Under some estimates, this bill would give insurance companies up to \n$25 billion to provide drug benefits to seniors. Yet thousands of \nemployers already provide quality health care benefits to their \nretirees, benefits that include prescription drugs.\n  Congress should use the same test as a doctor would: Do no harm.\n  In passing this bill, we could decimate the ability of employers to \nprovide health care coverage for their retirees. I think we should fix \nthis.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to stand up for American \nbusinesses, stand up for America's workers, and stand up for America's \nseniors and support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I hear often from many on the other side \nof the aisle that the Republican Party is the party of big corporations \nand corporate bailouts: This is a $66 billion, big corporation bailout \nbeing offered by Members on the other side of the aisle, $66 billion to \ncorporate America that is already getting a huge benefit under this \nbill. We are already, by providing prescription drugs to all retirees, \ngiving them the ability to basically back away, as has been discussed, \nfrom providing basic prescription drugs and still add on, if they want \nto add on additional benefits to the bottom line benefit. The cost \nsavings already in the bill to corporations are in the billions and \nbillions of dollars. But that is not enough. We have to give big \ncorporate America another $66 billion so they can provide even more \ngenerous benefits to their retirees on top of the generous benefit we \nhave in this legislation.\n  I find it almost incomprehensible that we are arguing that at a time \nwhen we are providing literally tens of billions of dollars--maybe even \nmore than that--to corporate America to help relieve some of their \nretiree health care costs, now we have to add $66 billion more over the \nnext 10 years to corporate America.\n  This is a very unwise amendment. It is a very costly amendment, $66 \nbillion. In addition, you are seeing already that corporate America is \ngetting out of the retiree health care business because it is very \nexpensive. One of the reasons we are moving forward with this \nlegislation is because of that. We have seen the percentage of retiree \nhealth plans drop from 71 percent to 44 percent just in the last 15 \nyears. This is a trend that is ongoing. One of the reasons we are \nstepping in with this universal benefit is to address that issue.\n  To in effect provide an additional amount of money to corporations to \nbasically help them maintain their effort in this area is a folly. It \nis a very costly proposal and should be, hopefully, defeated.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the argument made by the Senator from \nPennsylvania is interesting because what he is basically saying is that \nit is more important that corporate America not be allowed to keep one \nout of three of their people they currently sponsor, who are retirees \nwho worked for them and who have been getting health benefits from \nthem, out of the picture.\n  He talked about the cost to corporate America. My sort of worry is \nabout the cost to the U.S. Government. That is what we do if we don't \npass my amendment; we just dump everything on the U.S. Government.\n  So this amendment will make sure we do not jeopardize the drug \ncoverage of millions of retirees, one out of every three, who already \nreceive drug coverage from employer-sponsored plans. This amendment is \ngoing to ensure that the contributions made on the beneficiaries' \nbehalf by their former employers count toward that beneficiary meeting \nthe catastrophic limit. That is not now the case.\n  Employer-sponsored retiree health benefits are the single greatest \nsource of coverage for retirees--the Presiding Officer understands what \nI am saying--the single greatest source of retiree health benefits \navailable. In fact, 37 percent of all retirees who have corporate-\nsponsored plans simply lose them if this does not pass.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I hope we will pass my amendment. It is worse for \nemployees. It is worse for employers. I hope my colleagues will support \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania has 1 minute 39 seconds remaining of \nthe majority time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, under the existing legislation, \nemployers are allowed to continue to offer benefits to their employees. \nMany will. Many will change the structure of the benefit in which they \noffer to wrap around the existing Medicare benefit, as they do now with \nMedicare.\n  Their retiree insurance plans currently wrap around the existing \nMedicare plan. Future retiree plans will wrap around. Giving \ncorporations $66 billion over the next 10 years as an incentive to give \nmore generous benefits is nothing but a corporate giveaway and costs \nthe taxpayers literally billions of dollars. It is an unwise transfer \nof Government dollars, taxpayer dollars to big corporations, that \nalready have very generous health care plans, as well as retirement \nplans. It is not focused on what we should be focusing on here, which \nis the poorest of the poor.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Hagel) \nand the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Lugar) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), the \nSenator from Florida (Mr. Graham), and the Senator from Massachusetts \n(Mr. Kerry) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``nay''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 43, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 233 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--52\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--43\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n\n[[Page S8396]]\n\n\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Biden\n     Graham (FL)\n     Hagel\n     Kerry\n     Lugar\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 984, as Modified\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. It is my understanding that the Senator from New Mexico \nis ready to modify his amendment. With the modification, I accept that \namendment. We would not have a vote. I urge we proceed to the amendment \nof the Senator from New Mexico for consideration of his modification.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Reserving the right to object, could we at least \nunderstand what the modification is.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator from New Mexico will explain that.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, when I came to the Senate floor a few \nminutes ago, we were just informed by the Republican staff that CBO \nestimates the amendment we were planning to vote on would cost $5 \nbillion. This is all brandnew information. It is erroneous information, \nbut I have no way to contradict what CBO is saying.\n  Therefore, I send an amendment to the desk to modify my amendment to \nrequest a study by MedPAC on this issue which would come back to us \nwithin a year. At that point, we could make a determination as to \nwhether we want to take the action I had originally been proposing. Let \nme explain.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to modify my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 984), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       After section 404, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 404A. MEDPAC STUDY AND REPORT REGARDING MEDICARE \n                   DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE HOSPITAL (DSH) \n                   ADJUSTMENT PAYMENTS.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission \n     established under section 1805 of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395b-6) (in this section referred to as ``MedPAC'') \n     shall conduct a study to determine, with respect to \n     additional payment amounts paid to subsection (d) hospitals \n     under section 1886(d)(5)(F) of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395ww(d)(5)(F))--\n       (1) whether such payments should be made in the same manner \n     as payments are made with respect to graduate medical \n     education under title XVIII and with respect to hospitals \n     that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients \n     under the medicaid program; and\n       (2) whether to add costs attributable to uncompensated care \n     to the formula for determining such payment amounts.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, MedPAC shall submit a report to \n     Congress on the study conducted under subsection (a), \n     together with such recommendations for legislation as MedPAC \n     determines are appropriate.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the issue to which this study will give \nthe answer is the question of whether disproportionate share hospitals \nthat are the same net hospitals, that serve many of the individuals who \nwould not have any health insurance, should continue to receive the DSH \npayments we have legislated they are entitled to, even after this \nprescription drug legislation becomes law. I strongly believe they \nshould. My amendment was intended to ensure they receive those \npayments.\n  I fear the system we are adopting, which will move people into \npreferred provider organizations, will in fact reduce the payments to \nthese disproportionate share hospitals, which I don't believe is the \npurpose or the intention of the Senate. That is the issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the study to give an answer as to \nwhether that problem exists.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. As I indicated, we accept that amendment, and I would \nlike to have it adopted on a voice vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is unfortunate we did not get the score \non the Senator's amendment until just recently. The chairman and I have \nbeen in constant contact. I have called several times today the CBO \nDirector in order to get the scores in time for amendments. The good \nnews is Senators have come to us so we are able to prioritize \namendments and therefore calls to CBO are on amendments that will be \nsequenced so we can help them get the scores. We are trying our best to \nget CBO scores. The Senators can help us and help CBO get the scores by \ngetting amendments to us early so we can sequence them.\n  On the other hand, it is very helpful if CBO can work as diligently \nas possible themselves and live up to their side of the bargain and get \nthe scores to us. I hope we do not face this situation again where we \nget the score moments before an amendment is voted on, even though CBO \nknew this amendment was coming up; they had at least 24 hours' advance \nnotice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 984), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We have had so many Democrat amendments that have been \noffered. We have reserved time for Republicans to fit in. It is my \nunderstanding that Senator Smith of Oregon is prepared to offer an \namendment from our side. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Smith be \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, will there be a unanimous \nconsent offered for sequencing votes later this afternoon?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in answer to the distinguished Democrat \nwhip, there is an effort being made at the staff level to put together \na series of votes. In further response, we are not prepared at this \npoint to ask unanimous consent, but we will have such a request to make \nfor stacking of votes and an order for votes.\n  Mr. REID. For the information of Senators, my understanding is that \nthe two leaders want to have a series of votes starting at 2:25 this \nafternoon; is that right?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is my understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 962\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Smith], for himself and Mr. \n     Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered 962.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide reimbursement for Federally qualified health \n            centers participating in medicare managed care)\n\n       At the end of title VI, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer this amendment that \nwill protect the health care safety net and ensure access to quality \nhealth care for low-income Medicare beneficiaries who rely on our \nNation's community health centers. I am pleased to be joined in this by \nmy colleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, who has been a strong \nadvocate for the medically underserved. It is a privilege to work with \nhim on this amendment.\n  This is an issue that affects the entire country, not just my State \nof Oregon. We all have community health centers. Health centers are the \nfamily doctor to more than 13 million people, more than 5 million of \nwhom are uninsured, and nearly 1 million are low-income Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  For many of these individuals, their local health center is the only \naccessible provider of preventive and primary health care services. \nWhile the centers receive Federal Public Health Service Act grant funds \nto support care for their uninsured patients, they rely on adequate \npayments from both Medicaid and Medicare for care provided to \nbeneficiaries under both programs.\n  In 1990, Congress recognized the importance of protecting the \nintegrity of the PHSA grant funds and required that health centers \nreceive reasonable cost payments under the traditional Medicare Part B \nProgram. This action on the part of Congress helped both to ensure that \nthe health centers are reimbursed sufficiently for the provision of \ncare to beneficiaries under the traditional Medicare program, and to \nprotect access to health center services for the uninsured. The \namendment we are proposing today simply would extend the same \nrequirement to new Medicare Advantage Programs.\n  Specifically, the amendment would ensure that health centers are \nprovided with a wraparound or supplemental payment, equal to the \ndifference between the payments they now receive under Medicare \ngenerally and the payments they will receive from Medicare Advantage \nplans. This is not a new concept.\n  Under current Medicaid law, a health center is reimbursed by a \nmanaged care organization the equivalent of what the managed care \norganization pays any other provider of similar services. In turn, the \nState Medicaid Program provides a wraparound or supplemental payment \nfor the difference between the managed care organization's payment and \nthe health center's reasonable cost. The absence of a wraparound \npayment system in the current Medicare managed care program, \nMedicare+Choice, has left many health centers struggling to provide \nservices to seniors under the program while trying to protect Federal \ngrant funds intended to support care for the uninsured.\n  In 2001, health centers in my home State of Oregon lost more than $55 \nfor each patient's office visit when they were enrolled under a \nMedicare managed care plan. In the same year, Oregon health centers \nlost almost as much revenue as they gained from the Medicare managed \ncare patients. It is estimated this new percentage will grow even \nlarger under the new Medicare Advantage Program. In fact, if current \nestimates are correct, health centers nationwide can expect to \nexperience an average loss of $35 per office visit under the Medicare \nAdvantage Program. Simply put, what this means is that without a \nwraparound payment system for health care centers contracting with \nMedicare Advantage plans, these centers will have no choice but to \nreach deep into their Federal grant funds, money that is supposed to go \nfor care to the uninsured, in order to make up for the loss in Medicare \npayments. This will only serve to put further strain on health centers \nas well as the public safety net overall.\n  The President and the Congress have called upon this Nation to double \nthe capacity of health centers and build a stronger primary care \ninfrastructure for America's communities. America's health centers are \ntrying to meet that challenge and still meet the health care needs of \nthe Nation's growing uninsured.\n  In the last 3 years alone, health centers added more than 800,000 new \nuninsured patients to their roles, raising the number of uninsured \nAmericans served by these centers to one in every eight Americans.\n  Our amendment would protect the vital mission of health centers to \nprovide access to care to underserved rural and inner city communities. \nIt would also bolster the goal of the President and the Congress to \nstrengthen our health care safety net.\n  I have a letter in support of my amendment. I ask unanimous consent \nthe letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Oregon Primary Care Association,\n\n                                      Portland, OR, June 23, 2003.\n     Senator Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: On behalf of the 16 public and private, \n     not-for-profit community health centers throughout the State \n     of Oregon, I would like to extend our sincere gratitude for \n     your sponsorship of the amendment to the Medicare reform bill \n     which will implement ``wrap around'' payments for Federally \n     Qualified Health Centers serving seniors under Medicare \n     managed care.\n       As you know, Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) \n     serve a critical role in their communities. In Oregon alone, \n     more than 150,000 individuals rely on FQHCs for their primary \n     health care needs each year. In the many rural areas of the \n     state, in particular, FQHCs are often the only primary care \n     providers available to serve Medicare, Medicaid and uninsured \n     patients. The wrap around payments that you have proposed \n     will ensure that FQHCs are adequately reimbursed for the cost \n     of treating recipients of Medicare + Choice and the new \n     Medicare Advantage program. Without adequate reimbursement \n     for treating these Medicare managed care patients, FQHCs \n     would be unable to continue to provide comprehensive, high-\n     quality services to many of the seniors who rely on health \n     centers for their care.\n       Senator Smith, our state is fortunate to have your \n     leadership in Washington. Thank you again for your support \n     and sponsorship of this measure that will significantly \n     impact seniors and other underserved Oregonians being served \n     by community health centers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Craig Hostetler,\n                                               Executive Director.\n  Mr. SMITH. Senator Bingaman and I are convinced that this amendment\n\n[[Page S8398]]\n\ngoes a long way toward answering the concerns of health centers about \nhow the Medicare Advantage Program will impact their ability to \ncontinue to provide high-quality health care services to their \npatients.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague from New Mexico for his efforts \nand his cosponsorship of this amendment and I urge all our colleagues \nto support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague from Oregon \nfor his leadership on this important issue. We have all worked on a \nbipartisan basis with the administration to increase our support for \ncommunity health centers. We have all begun to recognize the very vital \nrole they play in providing health care to many of our citizens \nthroughout the country.\n  This amendment is absolutely crucial if we are going to ensure that \nthe unintended effect of the legislation before us is not to drain \nfunds away from community health centers as more and more people decide \nthey want to sign up for these preferred provider organizations.\n  This is crucial legislation. It is very important we do this in the \ncase of the Medicare prescription drug area, just as we did in the case \nof Medicaid.\n  I again compliment my colleague and I am honored to be a cosponsor of \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Prewar Intelligence Investigation\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the news is just on the wires that six \nBritish troops have been killed near Basra in Iraq. Every day--every \nday--brings us sad tidings of American and/or Allied troops being \nkilled in Iraq.\n  How much longer--how much longer, Mr. President--are our American \nfighting men and women going to have to remain in harm's way in a \nforeign land? How much longer are our National guardsmen and women and \nreservists going to have to be away from home?\n  The President announced not too long ago that major hostilities had \nended. Were we told by this administration how long our military forces \nwill be required to run these terrible risks that daily confront them \nin this biblical land of Mesopotamia, land between the two great \nrivers? I often asked the question, before the war began, What is going \nto be the cost? What is the plan? What is the administration's plan? \nWhat about the morning after the war ends?\n  No announcement has been made at this point that the war has ended, \nonly that major hostilities no longer exist. And then there were public \ndisagreements as to how many Americans would be needed in Iraq to bring \nabout a safe and secure society.\n  I try to put myself in the place of a father or a husband of one of \nour military personnel in Iraq. I try to imagine the pain and the \nsuffering on the part of those who wait--who wait--at home for the \nreturn of their loved ones.\n  Last fall, the White House released a national security strategy that \ncalled for an end to the doctrines of deterrence and containment that \nhave been a hallmark of American foreign policy for more than half a \ncentury.\n  This new national security strategy is based upon preemptive war--\nsomething unheard of in the past experiences, practices, and policies \nof our Nation--preemptive war against those who might threaten our \nsecurity.\n  Such a strategy of striking first against possible dangers is heavily \nreliant upon interpretation of accurate and timely intelligence. If we \nare going to hit first, based on perceived dangers, the perceptions had \nbetter be accurate. If our intelligence is faulty, we may launch \npreemptive wars against countries that do not pose a real threat \nagainst us or we may overlook countries that do pose real threats to \nour security, allowing us no chance to pursue diplomatic solutions to \nstop a crisis before it escalates to war. In either case, lives could \nbe needlessly lost. In other words, we had better be certain that we \ncan discern the imminent threats from the false alarms.\n  Just 96 days ago, as of June 24, President Bush announced that he had \ninitiated a war to ``disarm Iraq, to free its people and to defend the \nworld from grave danger.'' The President told the world:\n\n       Our nation enters this conflict reluctantly--yet, our \n     purpose is sure. The people of the United States and our \n     friends and allies will not live at the mercy of an outlaw \n     regime that threatens the peace with weapons of mass \n     [destruction].\n\n  The President has since announced that major combat operations \nconcluded on May 1. He said:\n\n       Major combat operations in Iraq have ended. In the battle \n     of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed.\n\n  Since then, Mr. President, the United States has been recognized by \nthe international community as the occupying power in Iraq. And yet we \nhave not found any evidence that would confirm the officially stated \nreason that our country was sent to war; namely, that Iraq's weapons of \nmass destruction constituted a grave threat to the United States--a \ngrave threat to the United States.\n  We have heard a lot about revisionist history from the White House of \nlate in answer to those who question whether there was ever a real \nthreat from Iraq. But it is the President who appears to me to be \nintent on revising history.\n  There is an abundance of clear and unmistakable evidence that the \nadministration sought to portray Iraq as a direct, deadly, and imminent \nthreat to the American people. But there is a great difference between \nthe handpicked intelligence that was presented by the administration to \nCongress and the American people when compared against what we have \nactually discovered in Iraq. This Congress and the American people, who \nsent us here, are entitled to an explanation from this administration.\n  On January 28, 2003, President Bush said in his State of the Union \nAddress:\n\n       The British Government has learned that Saddam Hussein \n     recently sought significant quantities of uranium from \n     Africa.\n\n  Yet, according to news reports, the CIA knew this claim was false as \nearly as March 2002. In addition, the International Atomic Energy \nAgency has since discredited this allegation.\n  On February 5, Secretary of State Colin Powell told the United \nNations Security Council:\n\n       Our conservative estimate is that Iraq today has a \n     stockpile of between 100 and 500 tons of chemical weapons \n     agents. That is enough to fill 16,000 battlefield rockets.\n\n  But, the truth is, to date we have not found any of this material, \nnor those thousands of rockets loaded with chemical weapons.\n  On February 8, President Bush told the Nation:\n\n       We have sources that tell us that Saddam Hussein recently \n     authorized Iraqi field commanders to use chemical weapons--\n     the very weapons the dictator tells us he does not have.\n\n  Well, I say to my fellow Senators, we are all relieved that such \nweapons were not used, but it has not yet been explained why the Iraqi \nArmy did not use them. Did the Iraqi Army flee their positions before \nchemical weapons could be used? If so, why were the weapons not left \nbehind? Or is it that the army was never issued chemical weapons?\n  We need answers. We need answers to these and other such questions.\n  On March 16, the Sunday before the war began, in an interview with \nTim Russert, Vice President Cheney said the Iraqis want ``to get rid of \nSaddam Hussein and they will welcome as liberators the United States \nwhen we come to do that.'' Vice President Cheney said the Iraqis want \n``to get rid of Saddam Hussein and they will welcome as liberators the \nUnited States when we come to do that.''\n  He added:\n\n       . . . the vast majority of them would turn Saddam Hussein \n     in in a minute if, in fact, they thought they could do so \n     safely.\n\n  But, today Iraqi cities remain in disorder. Our troops are under \nattack as well as our allies. Our occupation government lives and works \nin fortified compounds, and we are still trying to determine the fate \nof the ousted murderous dictator.\n  On March 30, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, during the height \nof the war, said of the search for weapons of mass destruction:\n\n\n[[Page S8399]]\n\n\n       We know where they are. They're in the area around Tikrit \n     and Baghdad and east, west, south, and north somewhat.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, Baghdad fell to our troops on April 9 and Tikrit \non April 14, and the intelligence about which Secretary of Defense \nRumsfeld spoke has not led us to any weapons of mass destruction. \nWhether or not intelligence reports were bent, stretched, or massaged \nto make Iraq look like an imminent threat to the United States, it is \nclear that the administration's rhetoric played upon the well-founded \nfears of the American public about future acts of terrorism. But upon \nclose examination, many of these statements have nothing to do with \nintelligence because they are, at root, just sound bites based on \nconjecture. They are designed to prey upon public fear.\n\n  The face of Osama bin Laden morphed into that of Saddam Hussein. \nPresident Bush carefully blurred these images in his State of the Union \nAddress. Listen to this quote from the President's State of the Union \nAddress:\n\n       Imagine those 19 hijackers with other weapons and other \n     plans--this time armed by Saddam Hussein. It would take one \n     vial, one canister, one crate slipped into this country to \n     bring a day of horror like none we have ever known.\n\n  Judging by this speech, not only is the President confusing al-Qaida \nand Iraq, but he also appears to give a vote of no confidence to our \nhomeland security efforts. Isn't the White House the brains behind the \nDepartment of Homeland Security? Isn't the administration supposed to \nbe stopping those vials, canisters, and crates from entering our \ncountry rather than trying to scare our fellow citizens half to death \nabout them?\n  Not only did the administration warn about more hijackers carrying \ndeadly chemicals, the White House even went so far as to suggest that \nthe time it would take for U.N. inspectors to find solid smoking gun \nevidence of Saddam's illegal weapons would put the United States at \ngreater risk of nuclear attack from Iraq.\n  National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice was quoted as saying on \nSeptember 9, 2002, by the Los Angeles Times:\n\n       We don't want the ``smoking gun'' to be a mushroom cloud.\n\n  ``Threat by Iraq Grows,'' this is the headline that was in the Los \nAngeles Times.\n  Well, talk about hype. Mushroom clouds? Where is the evidence for \nthis? Where is the evidence for that hype? There isn't any.\n  On September 26, 2002, just 2 weeks before Congress voted on the \nresolution to allow the President to invade Iraq and 6 weeks before the \nmidterm elections, President Bush himself built the case that Iraq was \nplotting to attack the United States.\n  After meeting with members of Congress on that date, the President \nsaid:\n\n       The danger to our country is grave. The danger to our \n     country is growing. The Iraqi regime possesses biological and \n     chemical weapons. . . . The regime is seeking a nuclear bomb, \n     and with fissile material, could build one within a year.\n\n  Well, these are the President's words. He said that Saddam Hussein is \nseeking a nuclear bomb. Have we found any evidence to date of this \nchilling allegation? No.\n  But President Bush continued on that autumn day:\n\n       The dangers we face will only worsen from month to month \n     and from year to year. To ignore these threats is to \n     encourage them. And when they have fully materialized, it may \n     be too late to protect ourselves and our friends and our \n     allies. By then, the Iraqi dictator would have the means to \n     terrorize and dominate the region. Each passing day could be \n     the one on which the Iraqi regime gives anthrax or VX--nerve \n     gas--or some day a nuclear weapon to a terrorist ally.\n\n  Yet, 7 weeks after declaring victory in the war against Iraq, we have \nseen nary a shred of evidence to support the President's claims of \ngrave, dangerous chemical weapons, links to al-Qaida, or nuclear \nweapons.\n  Just days before a vote on a resolution that handed the President \nunprecedented war powers, President Bush stepped up the scare tactics. \nOn October 7, just 4 days before the October vote in the Senate on the \nwar resolution, the President had this to say:\n\n       We know that Iraq and the al-Qaida terrorist network share \n     a common enemy--the United States of America. We know that \n     Iraq and al-Qaida have had high-level contacts that go back a \n     decade.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       We've learned that Iraq has trained al-Qaida members in \n     bomb-making and poisons and deadly gases. . . . Alliance with \n     terrorists could allow the Iraqi regime to attack America \n     without leaving any fingerprints.\n\n  President Bush also elaborated on claims of Iraq's nuclear program \nwhen he said:\n\n       The evidence indicates that Iraq is reconstituting its \n     nuclear weapons program. Saddam Hussein has held numerous \n     meetings with Iraqi nuclear scientists, a group he calls his \n     ``nuclear mujahideen''--his nuclear holy warriors. . . . If \n     the Iraqi regime is able to produce, buy, or steal an amount \n     of highly enriched uranium a little larger than a single \n     softball, he could have a nuclear weapon in less than a year.\n\n  Wasn't that enough to keep you awake, Senators? This is the kind of \npumped-up intelligence and outrageous rhetoric that was given to the \nAmerican people to justify a war with Iraq. This is the same kind of \nhyped evidence that was given to Congress to sway its vote for war on \nOctober 11, 2002.\n  We hear some voices saying, well, why should we care? After all, the \nUnited States won the war, didn't it? Saddam Hussein is no more. Iraq \nis no longer a threat. He is either dead or on the run, so what does it \nmatter if reality does not reveal the same grim picture that was so \ncarefully painted before the war. So what. So what if the menacing \ncharacterizations that conjured up visions of mushroom clouds and \nAmerican cities threatened with deadly germs and chemicals were \noverdone. So what.\n  Our sons and daughters who serve in uniform answered the call to \nduty. They were sent to the hot sands of the Middle East to fight in a \nwar that has already cost the lives of 194 Americans to this moment, \nthousands of innocent civilians, and unknown numbers of Iraqi soldiers. \nOur troops are still at risk. Hardly a day goes by that there is not \nanother attack on the troops who are trying to restore order to a \ncountry teetering on the brink of anarchy. When are they coming home?\n  The President told the American people we were compelled to go to war \nto secure our country from a grave threat. Are we any safer today than \nwe were on March 18, 2003? Our Nation has been committed to rebuilding \na country ravaged by war and tyranny, and the cost of that task is \nbeing paid for in blood and in treasure every day.\n  It is in the compelling national interest to examine what we were \ntold about the threat from Iraq. This is not revisionist history. These \nwords are plain English words that I have quoted. It is in the \ncompelling national interest to know if the intelligence was faulty. It \nis in the compelling national interest to know if the intelligence was \ndistorted. It is in the national interest to know if the intelligence \nwas manipulated.\n  Mr. President, Congress must face this issue squarely. Congress \nshould begin immediately an investigation into the intelligence that \nwas presented to the American people about the prewar estimates of \nSaddam's weapons of mass destruction and the way in which that \nintelligence might have been misused. This is no time for a timid, \ntippy-toe Congress. Congress has a responsibility to act in the \nnational interest and to protect the American people, and we must get \nto the bottom of this matter.\n  Although some timorous steps have been taken in the past few days to \nbegin a review of this intelligence--I must watch my words carefully, \nfor I may be tempted to use the word ``investigation'' or ``inquiry'' \nto describe this review, and those are terms which I am told are not \nsupposed to be used--the proposed measures appear to fall short of what \nthe situation requires. We are already shading our terms about how to \ndescribe the proposed review of intelligence: cherry-picking words to \ngive the American people the impression that the Government is fully in \ncontrol of the situation, and that there is no reason to ask tough \nquestions. This is the same problem that got us into this controversy \nabout slanted intelligence reports. Word games, lots and lots of word \ngames.\n  This is no game. For the first time in our history, the United States \nhas gone to war because of intelligence reports claiming that a country \nposed a threat to our Nation. Congress should not be content to use \nstandard operating procedures to look into this extraordinary matter.\n\n[[Page S8400]]\n\n  We should accept no substitute for a full, bipartisan investigation \nby Congress into the issue of our prewar intelligence on the threat \nfrom Iraq and the use of that intelligence.\n  The purpose of such an investigation is not to play preelection year \npolitics, nor is it to engage in what some might call ``revisionist \nhistory.'' Rather, it is to get at the truth. The longer questions are \nallowed to fester about what our intelligence knew about Iraq, and when \nour intelligence knew it, the greater the risk that American people, \nwhom we are elected to serve, will lose confidence in our Government.\n  This looming crisis of trust is not limited to the public. Many of my \ncolleagues were willing to trust the administration and vote to \nauthorize war against Iraq. Many Members of this body trusted so much \nthat they gave the President sweeping authority to commence war. As \nPresident Reagan famously said, ``Trust, but verify.'' Despite my \nopposition, the Senate voted to blindly trust the President with \nunprecedented--unprecedented, unprecedented--power to declare war. \nShame. While the reconstruction continues, so do the questions, and it \nis time to verify.\n  I have served the people of West Virginia in Congress for half a \ncentury. I have witnessed deceit and scandal, coverup and aftermath. I \nhave seen from both parties Presidents who once enjoyed great \npopularity among the people leave office in disgrace because they \nmisled the American people. I say to this administration: Do not circle \nthe wagons. Do not discourage the seeking of truth in these matters.\n  The American people have questions that need to be answered about why \nwe went to war with Iraq. To attempt to deny the relevance of these \nquestions is to trivialize the people's trust and confidence.\n  The business of intelligence is secretive by necessity, but our \nGovernment is open by design. We must be straight with the American \npeople. Congress has the obligation to investigate the use of \nintelligence information by the administration in the open so that the \nAmerican people can see that those who exercise power, especially the \nawesome power of preemptive war, must be held accountable. We must not \ngo down the road of coverup. That is the road to ruin.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendments be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1004\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask that amendment No. 1004, which \nis at the desk, be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to freeze the \n  indirect medical education adjustment percentage under the medicare \n                        program at 6.5 percent)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title IV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. FREEZING INDIRECT MEDICAL EDUCATION (IME) \n                   ADJUSTMENT PERCENTAGE AT 6.5 PERCENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1886(d)(5)(B)(ii) (42 U.S.C. \n     1395ww(d)(5)(B)(ii)) is amended--\n       (1) in subclause (VI), by striking ``and'' at the end; and\n       (2) by striking subclause (VII) and inserting the following \n     new subclauses:\n       ``(VII) during fiscal years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, \n     and 2008, `c' is equal to 1.35; and\n       ``(VIII) on or after October 1, 2008, `c' is equal to \n     1.6.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment Relating to Determination of \n     Standardized Amount.--Section 1886(d)(2)(C)(i) (42 U.S.C. \n     1395ww(d)(2)(C)(i)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``1999 or'' and inserting ``1999,''; and\n       (2) by inserting ``, or the Prescription Drug and Medicare \n     Improvement Act of 2003'' after ``2000''.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I rise, along with Senators \nKennedy, Talent, Biden, Kerry, Murray, Reed, Specter, Bond, Clinton, \nFeinstein, and Durbin to offer an amendment for America's teaching \nhospitals.\n  The teaching hospitals in our country perform a vital role in \ntraining the doctors and nurses who conduct medical research and \nprovide care to the needy. But the foundation of this essential public \nservice is beginning to crack under the strain of Medicare reductions \nand a range of other financial pressures.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 made cuts \nto indirect medical education, called IME, which is an add-on for \nMedicare reimbursements to teaching hospitals. The add-on was reduced \nfrom 7.7 percent in 1997 to 6.5 percent in 1999. Further reductions \nwere scheduled beginning in 2000, but those cuts were delayed until \nlast October, and now the reimbursement rate has been dropped from 6.5 \npercent to 5.5 percent. That 1 percentage point means our Nation's \nteaching hospitals will lose almost $800 million this year, $4.2 \nbillion over the next 5 years.\n  My amendment restores the reimbursement rate to 6.5 percent in fiscal \nyear 2009. By putting this off until fiscal year 2009, of course, we \nare avoiding any Budget Act point of order.\n  There are 1,100 teaching hospitals in our country where Americans \nreceive world-class care. Every State has at least one, so every \nSenator will have affected constituents. Teaching hospitals train \nnearly 100,000 doctors every year, and chances are, Mr. President, your \nphysician and mine were trained at teaching hospitals.\n  In 1983, the Federal Government recognized that teaching hospitals \ncost more than their nonteaching counterparts because they incur costs \nto train our health care providers of the future. They provide clinical \nresearch in new procedures, technology, and treatments. Perhaps most \nimportantly, they ensure a steady stream of high-quality physicians who \nare equipped to meet the health care challenges of the 21st century. \nThey are also a major provider of indigent care in the United States. \nBut education and training costs extra money.\n  The Government added the IME payment to encourage teaching hospitals \nto invest in our future, but, unfortunately, we have chipped away from \n11.6 percent in 1983 to today's rate of 5.5 percent, which is a factor \nbased on a hospital's resident-to-bed ratio included in Medicare \nreimbursement. We cannot continue to decimate funding at these \nhospitals that educate our medical students and expect quality medical \ncare in the 21st century.\n  Teaching hospitals in Texas have lost $26.8 million in reimbursements \nin 2003 alone. Our State is not the hardest hit. New York lost $141 \nmillion; Pennsylvania, $78 million; and Michigan, $50 million.\n  One example in my State exemplifies what is happening in every \nteaching hospital in our country. Methodist Hospital in Houston trains \nmore than 200 residents a year and works closely with Baylor College of \nMedicine to effectively train physicians in radiology, cardiology, and \nneurology with the newest technology. Methodist purchased an MRI \nmachine for $4.5 million. That MRI will not only provide preventive \nmedicine to help diagnose illnesses sooner, it also teaches the next \ngeneration of health care professionals what they cannot learn in the \nclassroom.\n  This week, as we debate Medicare reform, it is imperative to reaffirm \nour commitment to America's teaching hospitals as these hospitals are \nin financial distress. If we do not restore funding, not only will they \nsuffer, so will our health care system, particularly patient care.\n  I ask for the support for this amendment. I ask for the yeas and \nnays. I will ask for unanimous consent to stack the next two votes, but \nI also ask unanimous consent the vote on my amendment be in the next \nseries of votes.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, it is my understanding the \nSenator has asked that following the Dodd vote we vote on Pryor and \nBoxer.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I was going to offer that unanimous consent.\n  Mr. REID. Did you ask unanimous consent on something else?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I was going to ask unanimous consent for the Pryor \namendment and the Boxer amendment and then ask my amendment be in the \nnext series of votes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I reluctantly have to object. I personally\n\n[[Page S8401]]\n\ncould care less, but until the two managers are here--unless you have \ncleared it with the two managers.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. No, I have not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Texas has requested the yeas and nays. Is there a \nsufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays are \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent following the vote this \nafternoon in relation to the Dodd amendment No. 969, the Senate vote \nconsecutively in relation to the following amendments: Pryor amendment \n981, Boxer amendment 1001; provided further that there be 2 minutes \nequally divided between each of the votes with no amendments in order \nto the amendments prior to the vote.\n  Mr. REID. We do not object.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. And I ask the Democratic leader work with me to be in \nthe next series of votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the distinguished Senator from Texas we will try \nto do that. It seems the right thing to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/24/senate-section/article/S8401-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the hour of 2:15 \nhaving arrived, there will now be 10 minutes evenly divided prior to a \nvote in relation to the Dodd amendment, No. 969.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, do I need to ask unanimous consent the \npresent amendment be temporarily set aside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is unnecessary.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in the 5 minutes I have, let me discuss it \nvery briefly with my colleagues.\n  This amendment would allow Medicare beneficiaries the freedom to move \nbetween plans for the first 2 years that this benefit is in effect, \nfrom 2006 to 2007. Under the present bill, you have to make a decision \nimmediately and then you are locked into that decision for a year. Then \nyou would have an open enrollment period for a month after that, and \nthen you would be locked in for another year.\n  What we are offering with this amendment is initially seniors be \ngiven a 2-year window in order to decide which plan works best for \nthem. Then you would go to the 1 year with the 1-month open enrollment. \nBut, initially, given the tremendous amount of potential confusion \nabout which of these various alternatives would work best for people, \nthey ought to be given a bit more time than to have to make an almost \ninstantaneous decision about which of these plans is best suited for \nthem.\n  One of the hallmarks that has been used to describe this bill is it \nis to give people choice--flexibility and choice. All we are suggesting \nis an additional 2 years, if you will, not requiring an immediate \ndecision but a 2-year window in order to make that choice so people are \nmore well informed.\n  There are a number of areas in the underlying bill that do not go \nnearly far enough, in my view, to serve Medicare beneficiaries. But I \nbelieve this is a good first step, at least as presently proposed. I am \ninclined to be supportive of this bill. These are some small points I \nthink could help make this a better bill.\n  If enacted, the underlying bill would require, as I mentioned, \nMedicare beneficiaries to choose a prescription drug plan and to stay \nwith that plan for a minimum of 1 year. With the enactment of such \nbroad and sweeping changes in the Medicare Program, I am fearful many \nMedicare beneficiaries will face great uncertainty trying to find the \nbest plan to meet their particular needs. Beneficiaries would be faced \nwith a menu of plans offering varying premiums, copayments or \ncoinsurance, drug formularies, and all the other variables that make up \na prescription drug benefit. It may not be immediately clear to people \nover the age of 65 which of these plans is going to best suit their \nneeds. It is not difficult to imagine a scenario where this could \nbecome a significant problem, possibly even affecting the health and \nwell-being of the beneficiary we are trying to assist with this \nlegislation.\n  A senior on a tight budget might enroll in a plan in an area that \noffers slightly lower premiums and coinsurance. Perhaps that \nbeneficiary is on blood pressure medication and, after enrolling in the \nplan, discovers the particular medication--which she has been taking \nfor years and has proven to be effective for a condition, with minimal \nside effects--is not part of the formulary for the plan she chose \nimmediately.\n  What I am suggesting is, What are her options? As the bill is \ncurrently written, she is stuck with that plan for at least a year. So \nshe can try to navigate the hurdles and obstacles that would allow her \nto take an off-formulary drug, or switch to another drug that might not \nbe as effective or cause severe side effects. These are not optimal \nchoices.\n  One of our stated goals is to give seniors as much of a choice as \npossible, and I am firmly behind that goal, as I mentioned at the \noutset of these remarks.\n  I do not want to suggest for a second that we should reduce choice or \ncreate simplicity, nor do I question the importance of cost-control \nmechanisms such as formularies. However, with choice and \ndifferentiation comes uncertainty. I believe we can greatly relieve \nthis uncertainty by allowing those initially choosing prescription drug \nplans for the very first time the opportunity to move from one plan to \nanother to determine which of these plans offers the best plan to fit \ntheir needs, and to give them the opportunity of doing that for a 2-\nyear period, and then go to the open enrollment period and a 1-year \nafter that.\n  I asked people in my own State to take a look at this proposal. In \nfact, this language comes from them. Their suggestion is this language \nI have on this chart. I will read from it:\n\n       The amendment which you are proposing is essential to \n     ensure fair and informed access to the health plans which are \n     planned under the terms of S. 1.\n\n  By the way, these people are very much supportive of what Senator \nGrassley is doing in this bill. They say:\n\n       Our experience with Medicare beneficiaries in Connecticut \n     and nationally has shown that the ability of a Medicare \n     beneficiary to change from plan to plan, especially during \n     the period after initially choosing a plan, is of utmost \n     importance. Making choices about which health plan is best is \n     often confusing for a Medicare beneficiary, especially for \n     those who are elderly, frail or having medical problems. \n     Comparing plans and choosing the right plan can be a \n     complicated process, and Medicare beneficiaries who discover \n     they have not made the most informed choice, whose experience \n     with a plan demonstrates it is not adequate to meet their \n     needs, or who have changes in their life circumstances, need \n     to have some ability to change from one plan to another. Only \n     with this ability to change can they be assured the \n     opportunity to receive the kind of health care they want, and \n     the fullest health benefit they need, to meet their \n     individual circumstances under the Medicare program.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. All we are asking is, instead of forcing people to make \nthat initial decision, they be given that 2-year window to sort this \nout. And then you move into the 1 year and the window opens, and so \nforth. I do not think this has any significant financial implications. \nIt is just allowing people to make intelligent, good choices which all \nof us want to provide people, particularly older Americans who could be \nterribly confused by choosing formularies and coinsurance and copayment \nplans. All that has to be done at the outset once this bill becomes \nlaw.\n  I have used a little more time than I said I would to try to explain \nthe amendment, but I want it to be clear to my colleagues why I think \nthis is a\n\n[[Page S8402]]\n\nvery reasonable suggestion to make an improvement to this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Presiding Officer for his indulgence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my colleague, \nSenator Lieberman, be added as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if they don't want to talk, I will be glad \nto take a little more time to explain this amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will yield the man 1 minute of my \ntime.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the man from Iowa for yielding the 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. DODD. The man from Connecticut appreciates the man from Iowa \ngiving him 1 more minute.\n  Mr. President, very briefly, the existing underlying bill says you \nhave to make this choice about which plan you want to go into almost \nimmediately once this proposal becomes law. We are suggesting that at \nthe outset you give people a 2-year window to shop wisely. They may \nmake the decision right away. They may make it within a month or two. \nBut knowing how confusing this can be, knowing that different \nformularies provide for different medications, we ought to provide \npeople at least some opportunity to get this right to the extent they \ncan. So this is merely opening up that window from an immediate choice \nto a 2-year choice--anytime within that 2 years to make that right \nchoice.\n  There have been some who wondered, if you move from one plan to the \nnext, what are the cost implications? I will be glad to respond to \nthat. We do not think that is terribly complicated to figure out. If \nyou have reached your deductible levels, obviously, the same would have \nto apply. You would not start all over in that 1-year period. So \nwhatever costs you have incurred, whatever expenditures you have made \nor not made would move from one plan to the next, at least as far as \nthe cost goes.\n  So the additional time should not have any additional financial or \nfiscal implications but merely the choice of saying to people, who are \nolder Americans: You get a little more time to sort this out. That is \nall I am suggesting with this amendment.\n  I would hope the committee might support it. It is not a radical \nproposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  I know the Senator from Connecticut has well-intentioned motivations \nbehind his amendment. The reason why I oppose the amendment is not \nbecause of any ill intent. But we have very carefully crafted this \nproduct before us after the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan and \nthe open season and the practice there. As far as I know, we do not run \ninto Federal employees complaining because they cannot change more \noften than once a year. So I am going to ask my colleagues to vote \nagainst this amendment.\n  It has some costs. I will speak about that. The open enrollment \nperiod in S. 1, as I said, is modeled after the annual open enrollment \nperiod of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. I believe this \nprogram has been in place for more than 40 years, so we have a lot of \nexperience with it. Consequently, it is a good pattern for us to craft \nthe legislation before us for senior citizens in retirement for their \nhealth benefits.\n\n  Each year seniors would be able to examine the choice of plans and \nselect the plan that is best suited to their needs. The amendment \nbefore us proposes to allow seniors to change plans more than once \nduring a continuous open enrollment period that would last for 2 years. \nWhile this may seem a good idea on the surface, it is an invitation, I \nbelieve, to more expensive health care for our seniors. I think it is \ngoing to lead to chaos and plan instability.\n  It is very important, at least in the opening years, as we get these \nnew programs underway that there be some predictability in order to \nencourage more plans to compete. The more plans competing, the better \nbenefits we ought to get for our seniors at a lower price.\n  It seems to me that providing a long, continuous open enrollment \nperiod allows any and all seniors to wait until they are sick before \nenrolling in a more comprehensive plan. You can understand that we need \nto have a situation where people are seen buying insurance and doing it \nin a way in which they manage their own risk as opposed to doing it in \nthe case of only an emergency. This is where you get the insurance \naspect that is so important in what we are trying to accomplish.\n  So if you do that, as the Senator from Connecticut suggests, it is \ngoing to add costs to the program because it permits healthy enrollees \nto stay in the cheaper basic plan until an illness drives them to a \ngenerous plan. The generous plan then would become the plan just for \nsick enrollees.\n  I have a statement here that the CBO says this would have a cost of \n$8 billion over the years 2004 to 2008, and $23 billion for the 10-year \nperiod 2004 to 2013.\n  I am going to yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this is one time. Unlike Federal employees, \nwho are 30 or 35 years of age, this plan is all new. What we are saying \nis, for the very first 2 years--that is all, just the first 2 years--\ngive seniors the flexibility so they do not have to sign up for a plan \nimmediately. You get a couple years within that timeframe to make your \nchoice, then you go into the 1-year cycle as all the rest of us do. But \nfor older Americans, it is very confusing--very confusing--for them to \nhave to make that choice at the get-go, right at the very beginning. So \nthat 2-year window, to have some flexibility to make a choice that best \nserves your interest, I think is a reasonable request to make for our \nolder Americans. That is the end of it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an equal 30 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have some sympathy for what the \nSenator from Connecticut says because so many times I have said to my \nconstituents, this is voluntary. You are going to have your choice to \ngo into another plan or change plans. I emphasize the ability to change \nplans. In addition, we have to have some stability even in the early \nyears. Most importantly, when we are developing a new prescription drug \nbenefit, the most vast improvement in Medicare in 35 years, I think it \ndemands more stability than when you get down the road a ways.\n\n  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. 969. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the United States may be the only country in the world \nthat does not protect its population from price gouging when it comes \nto prescription drugs. Last week, the Senate took a very important step \nin eliminating that by adopting the Dorgan-Cochran amendment by a vote \nof 62 to 28 to allow the reimportation of prescription drugs from \nCanada.\n  This amendment gives that amendment teeth. It gives HHS 2 years to \nact, and if they do not act within 2 years, then it becomes illegal for \nprescription drug companies to sell their products in the United States \nfor more than they sell them in Canada.\n  Some people call this price control. I respectfully disagree, but if \nyou call it price control, that means 62 of us last Friday stood up for \nprice controls. What it does in reality is introduce competition on \nprices.\n  There is one drug called tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is a fantastic breast \ncancer drug. One could buy it before it became generic for $241 for 60 \npills in the United States, and for $34 for 60 pills in Canada. The \ndifference between $241 and $34 is very significant, and that is what \nwe are trying to fix.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues can hear me. What \nthe Pryor amendment does has nothing to do with reimportation. What it \nsays is, if the Secretary does not certify that the drugs are safe \ncoming from Canada after 2 years, we will adopt the Canadian pricing \nscheme for pharmaceutical products in this country. So the Government \nof Canada will set prices for pharmaceutical drugs in this country. We \nwill be ceding to the Government of Canada the right to set prices for \ndrugs in the United States of America.\n  If we want to have price controls for drugs, we should have a debate \nto do that, but we should not be ceding to a foreign government the \nright to set drug prices in this country, and that is what this \namendment does.\n  Whether you are for reimportation, whether you are for price controls \nfor drugs, do not give up the right to set the price controls to a \nforeign government who will set them for the United States. And that is \nwhat this amendment does. I urge an overwhelming negative vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  Mr. REID.

There are 2 minutes equally divided for \nconsideration of the Boxer amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to explain in 1 minute a very \nimportant amendment that will really improve this bill. This amendment \nis endorsed by the AARP--they feel very strongly about it--in addition \nto the other major seniors organizations to preserve Social Security \nand Medicare. In the bill right now, there is a benefit shutdown when \nyou reach $4,500 worth of purchased drugs. That means seniors will face \na $1,300 deficit before they start getting the benefit. I will just \nimplore my colleagues, there is not any other prescription drug plan in \nthis country that does this. This is a really terrible problem for our \npeople. Just when they need help the most, they stop getting help.\n\n  I conclude, since we have so little time, by reading what AARP says:\n\n       AARP members find the notion of a gap in coverage to be a \n     major barrier to enrolling in a Medicare drug benefit. They \n     tell us that they are unaware of similar features in any of \n     the insurance products they routinely purchase.\n\n  In closing, they say:\n\n     . . . we urge the Senate to eliminate this coverage gap.\n\n  Please make this bill better, friends. It is the least we can do for \nseniors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to make four \npoints.\n  First, we had an additional $30 billion when this bill was originally \nmarked up in the Finance Committee. We put all $30 billion into filling \nthe donut, so we have done as much as we can with the money allocated.\n  Second, this amendment costs $64 billion. We would bust the \nagreement, which is to stay within the budget of $400 billion.\n  Third, according to CMS, only 2 to 12 percent--depending on your \nestimates--are going to be affected by this ``coverage gap.''\n  Finally, there is no standard benefit. This is sort of a mystery I \ndon't know why we don't talk about more. This is a typical design of \nwhat a benefit would look like. But under this bill, the companies \nbidding on these pharmaceutical contracts can design the benefit any \nway they want. They can have a donut. They do not have to have\n\n[[Page S8404]]\n\na donut. The only thing they are required to do is have a $275 \ndeductible for those plans of 160 percent of poverty and above and have \n$3,700 in total spending before the catastrophic kicks in. The donut is \nillusory, and I ask my colleagues to vote no on the amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \namendment No. 1001 offered by my colleague from California, Senator \nBoxer.\n  The Senate is debating legislation to provide seniors with \nprescription drugs that is a start but there are also many shortcomings \nwith this bill. One of most glaring shortcomings is the gap in drug \ncoverage. It doesn't make sense. As drug costs rise, benefits get shut \noff and seniors with high drug costs have to pay all of their drug \ncosts from $4,500 to $5,800. I think that is cruel.\n  How would this amendment address this shortcoming?\n  It is simple. This amendment would let seniors continue to have \ncontinuous coverage until you hit the catastrophic cap of $5,800 so \nthat means no gap. And, then your copay would drop to 10 percent just \nlike in the bill. No figuring out when you hit the coverage gap. No \nfiguring out how long you are going to be in the hole. No paying \npremiums and not getting benefits. You simply get drug coverage.\n  Why is this amendment important?\n  The coverage gap imposes a ``sickness tax'' on seniors. Once drug \nspending reaches $4,500 and this is a senior who clearly is facing \nserious health problems this senior would now have to pay $1,300 of \ntheir own money without any help from the Government even though they \nare still paying premiums to stay in the plan.\n  What does this mean?\n  Millions of our seniors will have no drug coverage for several months \nout the year. Their coverage will just stop and for many; it may not \nstart back up again until the next year.\n  This is wrong. I believe honor thy mother and father is not just a \ngood commandment to live by, it is good public policy to govern by. \nThat is why I feel so strongly about Medicare. Congress created \nMedicare to provide a safety net for seniors. I don't think there \nshould be any holes in that net. That is why I support this amendment \nand urge my colleagues to also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The yeas and nays have been previously ordered on this amendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. \n1001.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. \nCampbell) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING HEALTH INSURANCE \n                   COVERAGE OF LEGAL IMMIGRANTS UNDER MEDICAID AND \n                   SCHIP.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 1996, in the Personal Responsibility and Work \n     Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193; \n     110 Stat. 2105)(commonly referred to as the ``welfare reform \n     Act''), Congress deliberately limited the Federal public \n     benefits available to legal immigrants.\n       (2) The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \n     Reconciliation Act of 1996 allows a State the option of \n     electing to offer permanent resident legal aliens that have \n     been living in the United States for at least 5 years the \n     same benefits that their State citizens receive under the \n     temporary assistance for needy families program (commonly \n     referred to as ``TANF'') and the medicaid program.\n       (3) As of the date of enactment of this Act, 22 States have \n     elected to give the permanent resident legal aliens who \n     reside in their States the same TANF and medicaid benefits as \n     the States provide to the citizens of their States.\n       (4) This Act, the Prescription Drug and Medicare \n     Improvement Act of 2003, is not a welfare or medicaid reform \n     bill, but rather is a package of improvements for the \n     medicare program that is designed to provide greater access \n     to health care for America's seniors.\n       (5) The section heading for 605 of this Act as reported out \n     of the Committee on Finance, was titled ``Assistance with \n     Coverage of Legal Immigrants under the medicaid program and \n     SCHIP,'' and, as reported, related directly to the provision \n     of benefits under\n\n[[Page S8405]]\n\n     the medicaid and State children's health insurance programs, \n     not to benefits provided under the medicare program.\n       (6) The reported version of section 605 would have directly \n     overturned the reforms made in the 1996 welfare reform Act.\n       (7) The reported version of section 605 would have greatly \n     expanded the number of individuals who could receive benefits \n     under medicaid and SCHIP.\n       (8) No hearings have been held in the Committee on Finance \n     of the Senate concerning why the 5-year residency requirement \n     for legal aliens to obtain a Federal public benefit \n     established in the welfare reform Act needs to be overturned \n     or why the reported version of section 605 should be included \n     in a medicare reform package.\n       (9) Congress must reauthorize the temporary assistance for \n     needy families program later this year and should hold \n     hearings regarding whether the 5-year residency requirement \n     for legal aliens to obtain a Federal public benefit should be \n     overturned as part of the reauthorization of that program.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Committee on Finance of the Senate should hold \n     hearings in connection with the reauthorization of the \n     temporary assistance for needy families program, or in \n     connection with reform of the medicaid program, regarding \n     whether the 5-year residency requirement for legal aliens to \n     obtain a Federal public benefit that was established in the \n     1996 welfare reform Act should be overturned for purposes of \n     the medicaid and State children's health insurance programs.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be set aside for consideration at the appropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, I call up my amendment which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments will \nbe set aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg], for himself, \n     Mr. Reed, Mr. Reid, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Corzine, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 982.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To make prescription drug coverage available beginning on \n                             July 1, 2004)\n\n       At the end of title I, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. IMPLEMENTATION OF TITLE.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the \n     amendments made by this title shall be implemented and \n     administered so that prescription drug coverage is first \n     provided under part D of title XVIII beginning on July 1, \n     2004.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to talk about my amendment \nwhich is designed to change the effective date of this bill.\n  My amendment is cosponsored by Senators Reed of Rhode Island, Reid of \nNevada, Clinton, and Corzine.\n  My amendment is very simple: Let's give our seniors a prescription \ndrug benefit just as quickly as we can. They need it now. Let's not \ndelay any longer than practicable to get it into place.\n  Under the current proposal, comprehensive drug coverage does not \nstart until July 2006. Imagine that, 2006. It is not fair to seniors \nwho are expecting a benefit almost immediately. They will have seen \nPresident Bush sign a bill with some fanfare and will have seen lots of \nMembers of Congress crowding the stage with him, and everyone will say: \nWe have put a prescription drug benefit into place. When seniors learn \nthat the benefit begins in 2006, they are going to feel deceived, \ntricked, and angry.\n  My amendment changes the effective date of the coverage to July 1, \n2004. There is not any reason to have our seniors wait any longer for a \nprescription drug benefit.\n  The original Medicare plan was signed into law by President Johnson \non July 30, 1965, and 11 months later, July 1, 1966, all persons \neligible were enrolled. The entire system for Medicare was created in \njust 11 months.\n  When we look at this chart, we see what is planned with the Bush/\nSenate prescription drug benefit. We are looking at 30 months, and we \nare looking at the creation of an entire Medicare system which took \njust 11 months to put in place. That was done without the luxury of \ntoday's high-speed computers. It was just President Johnson and his \nadministration getting the entire system in place in 11 months.\n  My amendment essentially follows the same timetable. If President \nJohnson was able to create the entire Medicare system in just 11 \nmonths, then surely President Bush should be able to add a drug benefit \nin the same amount of time.\n  Look at the timeline the President has set for this Medicare drug \nproposal: 30 months. Why so long? Our clue is, what? Election day. That \nis illustrated on this chart. Sixteen months from now, this prolonged \neffective date is conveniently well past election day.\n  The administration's Medicare agency, CMS, says it needs 30 months. \nThat is very convenient timing for political purposes, but it is \nterrible timing for America's seniors.\n  President Johnson, a true Texan, had a can-do attitude, and there is \nno reason this administration cannot dedicate itself to completing this \ntask in 11 months. We need to give seniors meaningful drug coverage as \nsoon as possible, not 2006.\n  The reality is that 5.5 million seniors currently on Medicare will \nnot be alive in 2006. If there are insufficient funds in the budget for \nthis amendment, then it is the result of choices made by the President \nand his party. They chose to provide a massive tax cut to the \nwealthiest among us, and they chose it at the price of Medicare.\n  The issue is simple: If we give a prescription drug benefit, why \nwould we want to withhold it? This bill is about fooling the American \npeople about the mission here. It is more about elections than \ncorrecting the problems associated with a prescription drug program. I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, we have some time remaining. How much time remains on \nour side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no set amount of time. The Senator \nhas consumed 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I know the Senator \nfrom Nevada is interested in speaking.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume in opposition to the Lautenberg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Maybe I should ask, are we under time constraints?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are no time constraints.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. What the Senator from New Jersey wants to do I wish we \ncould do. I personally was somewhat astounded when we asked experts at \nthe Congressional Budget Office, experts at the Office of Management \nand Budget, experts in the Department of Health and Human Services, how \nmuch time it would take to get this new prescription drug program \nunderway. We were advised to start it in the year 2006.\n  In an ideal world, all seniors would have access to our comprehensive \nprescription drug benefit next year. But our plan, I am sorry to say, \ncannot go into effect until 2006. Therefore, we need to do something to \nhelp our seniors right now. Part of S. 1 does that. They have been \ndoing it because seniors, as I am sure the Senator from New Jersey is \ntrying to respond to, have been waiting a very long time for Congress \nto act and pass a prescription drug benefit, in the end, helping them \nwith the tremendous costs they are paying for prescription drugs.\n  This obviously is not satisfying to the Senator from New Jersey who \nwould like to get this plan underway much sooner. Because of the \nwaiting period until the year 2006 to get the very comprehensive \nprogram underway, we included in our plan a temporary prescription drug \ndiscount card. This is a voluntary program that all seniors can partake \nof next year. It is available for an annual fee costing no more than \n$25. Since our low-income seniors need extra help, this fee would be \nwaived. It provides for a 10-percent\n\n[[Page S8406]]\n\nto 25-percent discount on all costs of prescription drugs. There are \nsome seniors for whom even a 10-percent to 25-percent discount is still \na hardship to purchase prescription drugs. So we have added to this for \nreally low-income seniors to receive a $600 annual help in purchasing \nprescription drugs during this interim period of time, 2004 and 2005. \nThey will be required to pay a minimal copayment of 10 percent when the \nspending of the $600 subsidy is in place. Spouses who receive the low-\nincome benefit are also allowed to pool share their deposits.\n  When the comprehensive drug program begins January 1, 2006, the \ndiscount card program automatically ends. However, low-income seniors \nwill be able to use their allotment of $600 until June 2006.\n  Almost 10 million Medicare beneficiaries with significant \nprescription drug needs will realize savings from this endorsement \nprogram. The Center for Medicare Services projects that the Medicare \nbeneficiaries will save between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion in the \nprogram the very first year.\n  As I said, I feel, not for reasons I like to give to my fellow \nSenators, that we cannot expect this comprehensive new prescription \ndrug program for seniors, which happens to be the first major \nimprovement in strengthening of Medicare since 1965, to go into effect. \nMaybe we can push and push and push, but this first major expansion of \nMedicare in 38 years ought to be carefully done and done right. \nConsequently, that is why we have deferred to the judgment of the \nCongressional Budget Office, Office of Management and Budget, as well \nas the Secretary of HHS. We have tried to compensate for the long \nperiod of phasing with the discount card and the $600 subsidy.\n\n  I wish I could do more. I wish I could vote for the Senator's \namendment but I cannot. I ask my colleagues to vote against it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I say to our friend from Iowa, the discount card \nallows somewhere between 10 and up to 25 percent. With seniors spending \nan average $2,300 a year on medication, even a 20-percent discount does \nnot provide nearly enough relief. Frankly, it is hard to understand why \nit has to take 2\\1/2\\ years to get the program into place. I rather \nsuspect it has less to do with the perfection of the program than it \nhas to do with some other cause. It cannot take that long. We have all \nof these seniors on record. They are medical enrollees now. Why can't \nwe get this going?\n  As a matter of fact, my colleague from Minnesota, who is going to say \nsomething, thinks it should be done in an even shorter period of time \nthan my amendment provides.\n  I ask my colleague if he would like to say something. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I join with my Senator from New Jersey. He \npersuaded me to be reasonable. This is the reasonable alternative \nproposal, July 1 of 2004. I have great respect for the chairman of the \nSenate Finance Committee, the Senator from Iowa. I sense his difficulty \nbecause I don't believe the senior citizens of anywhere else in America \nwill be any different from the senior citizens of Minnesota who will \nbe, I believe, absolutely beside themselves to learn this program they \nhave waited years for Congress to enact will be enacted but it will not \nbe ready for 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  I suggest perhaps one of the reasons is that this is not a system \nthat can be easily put in place or administered. The chairman is trying \nto accommodate, if I understand his remarks correctly, the \nadministration, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services. They said this program as designed cannot \nbe put together and administered and operational until January 1, 2006.\n  I suggest that is pretty strong evidence that is not a very good \nsystem for delivery of these services. We have insurance companies that \nare going to be providing policies--they are in the business of \nproviding insurance for people. It can't take them 2\\1/2\\ years to \ndesign this program. Regarding CMS or HHS, the Department itself, we \nhear from this administration how their management of Government is so \nmuch improved over their predecessor's. Is it going to take them 2\\1/2\\ \nyears to design this program when, as my colleague from New Jersey, \nSenator Lautenberg, pointed out, 40 years ago they were able to take \nthe whole Medicare Program and put that in effect in 11 months?\n  Not only do I support the amendment offered by Senator Lautenberg, \nbut I have to say for those who are advocating this as the preferred \nalternative to extending Medicare to cover prescription drugs, if they \ncannot get the program up and running in a lot less than 2\\1/2\\ years--\neither 6 months as I would propose, or a year--then this is the wrong \nprogram because this is not a viable alternative, and it is not viable \nfor the senior citizens of Minnesota or anywhere else, in my judgment.\n  To say people are going to get a discount card--they can get discount \ncards already. They don't need Congress to do anything more than that \nfor 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  Just taking the figure the Senator from Iowa offered, if I understand \nit correctly, of savings for seniors in America, Medicare \nbeneficiaries, of $1.26 billion the first year, it sounds like a lot of \nmoney--it is a lot of money--but there are 40 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries in the country. If you divide $1.26 billion in savings by \nthose 40 million, that is about $30 per Medicare beneficiary in the \nfirst year.\n  We are going to go back with this to the senior citizens of \nMinnesota, and those with disabilities who are being crushed by these \nprices, who see them going up all the time due to the greed and \nprofiteering of the pharmaceutical industry. We are told here we have a \nbill, because it is the only one the majority of the Senate will agree \nto, that is not going to do anything--nothing at all, under our \nGovernment, on behalf of seniors and on behalf of all American \nconsumers of prescription drugs, to bring these prices down. Instead, \nthey are going to get a discount card that is going to save them on \naverage $30 a year? We ought to be ashamed of ourselves, first of all. \nThis bill is not what it is purporting to be, which is real relief for \nanybody who needs it now, not January 1, 2006.\n  If my colleagues do not support this, I think we are sending a very \nstrong message to America that this is not a viable program to begin \nwith, and the pharmaceutical industry has, one more time, succeeded in \nputting their profits ahead of the needs of people in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I know the Senator from New Hampshire would like to go \nahead. I will speak for just a minute or 2 before he does.\n  I very much agree with the Senator. It seems absurd that we have to \nwait until 2006 before this program goes into effect. I very much \nunderstand the concern of the Senator.\n  Let me say this to all of us who are concerned. Before the conference \nreport comes back, I am going to do my level best by pushing the CBO \nand CMS, asking a lot of tough questions of these agencies, to see if \nthere is some way we can get this put together earlier. It is my hope \nwe could bring back a conference report that has an earlier date, \nsignificantly earlier date. My guess is the private sector could get \nthis done pretty quickly. It would not take a full 2 years to get it \ndone.\n  I just pledge to my colleagues, this is one Senator who is going to \ndo his level best to try to get an earlier date. The current date just \ndoesn't make sense. We need to ask some tough questions and get some \nanswers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If the Senator from New Hampshire will just give me a \nminute, I have a unanimous consent request on votes coming up I would \nlike to propound.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 4:20 the Senate proceed to a vote in \nrelation to Dayton amendment No. 957, to be followed by a vote in \nrelation to the Lincoln amendment, No. 1002; to be followed by a vote \nin relation to the Lautenberg amendment, No. 982, with 2 minutes \nequally divided for debate for each succeeding vote after the first; \nfurther, that no amendments be in order to the amendments prior to the \nvotes; and finally that the second and\n\n[[Page S8407]]\n\nthird votes be limited to 10 minutes in length.\n  I ask unanimous consent that prior to the first vote, Senator Sununu \nbe recognized for up to 5 minutes in order to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I ask the vote occur at 4:25 \nand I be given 5 minutes after Senator Sununu.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I modify my unanimous consent request accordingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DAYTON. Reserving the right to object, I ask the Senator, in \nterms of the motion, that 2 minutes be evenly divided for my amendment, \nthe first amendment. Is there something different for that?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. You would have 1 minute and I would have 1 minute.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I object to that. I was told by the Senator's staff I \nwould have 2 minutes, 4 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. REID. He can take a minute of my time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. You will get 2 minutes, one from your leader. Can we go \nahead?\n  Mr. DAYTON. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1010\n\n  (Purpose: To improve outpatient vision services under part B of the \n                           medicare program.)\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all pending \namendments be set aside for purposes of offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk. I ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Sununu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1010.\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment that \neffectively mirrors a piece of legislation I introduced earlier this \nyear. This amendment will extend benefits under Medicare for vision \nrehabilitative services; that is, rehabilitative services for those \nseniors with a vision impairment.\n  As we debate this important prescription drug legislation, I think \none of the cornerstones, one of the principles that is at stake is the \nobjective of giving seniors more options and more choices for their \nhealth care and, in doing so, to create an option for a more holistic \napproach to their health care that perhaps focuses, to a greater \nextent, on preventive measures and other services that improve \nindependence and improve a senior's quality of life.\n  This legislation is very much in keeping with that objective and that \ngoal. This will extend coverage for vision rehabilitative services \nunder Medicare, but it does this under the existing physician fee \nschedule. It does it without creating a new provider network or a new \nfee schedule. As a result, the cost of this legislation is estimated, \nover a 5-year period, to be just $8 million. That was an independent \nestimate that has been done. Of course, I will seek scoring under the \nCongressional Budget Office for the purpose of this bill.\n  It is legislation and a set of services that is geared toward \nimproving the level of independence and quality of life for those \nseniors who are affected by a vision impairment. For the sake of \nreference, there are over 3.5 million Americans who are affected by \nvision impairment in the United States. That means vision loss that \ncannot be treated with eye glasses, that cannot be treated with surgery \nor other techniques. These seniors need help in learning how to \nnavigate in their own homes, how to deal with the obstacles of daily \nlife, and how to learn to live and work with that vision impairment.\n  The cost of vision impairment to America and to our seniors can be \nhuge. The CDC estimates over $20 billion in costs annually due to falls \nand due to injuries that have occurred as a result of vision loss. Hip \nfractures alone, due to vision loss, are estimated to cost our country \nover $2 billion per year.\n  For those reasons, I envision under this legislation cost savings in \nthe long term to be quite significant for the modest cost of improving \ncoverage for these vision rehabilitative services.\n  This is a piece of legislation I introduced earlier this year for \nwhich I was pleased to receive bipartisan support. We have 14 \ncosponsors--seven Republicans, seven Democrats--and among them a number \nof the members of the Finance Committee.\n  I certainly believe this takes the right approach toward \nstrengthening Medicare in a way that gives more focus to the kind of \npreventive care and the kind of medical maintenance that improves the \nindependence and quality of life for our seniors.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, under the consent we obtained, I was to have \n5 minutes to speak. I would ask that 1 minute of that time be given to \nSenator Dayton, so he can have his 2 minutes. I ask the Chair to notify \nme when I have used 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 982\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my first elective job was when Medicare came \ninto being. I was the chairman of the board of trustees at a place \ncalled Southern Nevada Memorial Hospital. It is now called the \nUniversity Medical Center. At that time it was the largest medical \nfacility, hospital facility in Nevada.\n  At that time 40 percent of the seniors who came into that hospital \nhad no insurance, and children, other relatives, and friends had to \nsign a piece of paper before they came into the hospital that they \nwould be responsible for the bills. Medicare changed all that.\n  In 1965, when Medicare was created by Congress, it took 11 months \nafter the bill was signed to put a new program in place. That was back \nin the days of slide rules and adding machines. That was, of course, \nbefore we had computers that had any ability to function.\n  Today our senior citizens need help with soaring drug prices. They \ndeserve the security of knowing they will be able to buy the medicines \nthat can keep them alive and healthy.\n  So today if we are telling our seniors to wait for that help and that \nsecurity until the year 2006, I do not think they are going to accept \nthat. It will be too late for millions of seniors, people who have \nworked hard all their lives to make this the greatest and richest \ncountry in the world--the only superpower left in the world. Certainly, \nif that, in fact, is the case, we should have a prescription drug \nbenefit for senior citizens.\n\n  It might be too late for Alice and Frederick Williams of Reno. They \nworked hard all their lives and raised four children. But Alice \ncontracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion. Today she is also \nbattling heart disease and a thyroid condition, and Frederick is \nrecovering from prostate cancer. Together, they have to spend $350 \nevery month on prescription drugs. That is $4,200 a year. They don't \nhave it.\n  Jackie Ridley, it might be too late for her. She is a retired \nteacher, who spoke at a Committee on Aging hearing in Las Vegas. She \nand her husband had all kinds of problems: heart disease, high blood \npressure, diabetes, and emphysema. Between them, they had 25 \nprescriptions. Before Jackie's husband passed away, they faced out-of-\npocket expenses of more than $1,000 every month. And sometimes, to make \nit to the next month, they cut back on some of their medicine. We have \nheard that before.\n  These Nevada seniors, and millions more like them in every single \nState, need help now, not 3 years from now. They deserve security now, \nnot in 2006. That is why I rise to support the Lautenberg amendment. It \nwould make this prescription drug benefit effective sooner rather than \nlater.\n  The bill is confusing enough without asking some senior citizens to \napply for one benefit now, and then come\n\n[[Page S8408]]\n\nback in 2 years to apply again. Our seniors have enough to worry about \nwithout wondering if they will be ruined financially before the benefit \ntakes effect.\n  The American people know that when Congress really wants to get \nthings done, we can take action quickly. Now they are looking for us to \nhelp them, seniors who have worked hard to make this country strong and \nprosperous.\n  I urge the support of the Lautenberg amendment.\n  I yield back whatever time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 3 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 957\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I understand, under the previous order, I \nhave 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 957 and ask the \nclerk to report it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Thank you, Mr. President. I will proceed.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is a matter of simple fairness. It says \nthat whatever prescription drug coverage we in Congress vote for for \nsenior citizens and other Medicare beneficiaries in this legislation, \nthen the Members of Congress will get for ourselves, our coverage, \nunder prescription drugs for the life of this particular legislation.\n  I have heard many of my colleagues say we want to give seniors \ncoverage that is as good as we get ourselves. I heard a lot of senior \ncitizens in Minnesota say they want coverage as good as Members of \nCongress get for themselves. Well, unfortunately, the bill that is \nbefore us this week is not even close to that parity.\n  If you calculate the total benefits provided, the value of this bill \nis about half of what Members of Congress get, what we pay as part of \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan system. But, nevertheless, \nit is about twice as good as what the seniors of America and those with \ndisabilities and others are going to be able to obtain from what we are \nlikely to pass.\n  Furthermore, as we have been discussing earlier, this does not even \nbegin until January of 2006. Medicare beneficiaries will get a discount \ncard instead. Well, then, Members of Congress should get a discount \ncard--and nothing more--as well. I think after what I heard the Senator \nfrom Iowa say, I would include a few members of the administration \nsince they are the culprits in this delay, but I will save that for \nanother time. With the premiums, deductibles, and the absence of any \ncoverage at all from $4,500 to $5,800, if it is good enough for the \nseniors of America, then it is good enough for the Members of Congress.\n  I point out to my colleagues who would like to keep the benefit level \nthey have today----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds to \nconclude my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. The amendment Senator Durbin has offered, which we will \nhave a chance to vote on and discuss later this week, would provide \nseniors with a comparable package to what we have in Congress. So I \nurge the support of that amendment, for that reason among many others. \nBut if we are not going to be as generous to senior citizens as we are \nto ourselves today, then we are going to have to, in my view, bring \nourselves down. I would rather bring everyone else up, but what is fair \nfor them is fair for us.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield back my time and wish to vote now.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 957.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McConnell. I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. \nCampbell) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. Reid. I announce that the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the \nSenator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator from \nConnecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily absent.,\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nFlorida (Mr. Graham) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nwould each vote ``yea''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there are 2 minutes \nequally divided prior to the vote on the Lincoln amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arkansas. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I plead with my colleagues to take a \nvery serious look at the amendment before us. I know they are hearing \ndifferently from downtown perhaps, but I want them to take a look at a \nrecent CBO study that has indicated to us there is negligible impact in \ngiving parity to the fallback plan.\n  CBO has given us a recent study that indicates there is negligible \nimpact on the private plans in allowing parity with the fallback plans \nthat may be needed in some of our rural areas to ensure that all of our \ncitizens across this great land get the same benefit in a prescription \ndrug package.\n  Fifteen of our States have no Medicare+Choice or private plans \ncurrently. We know it is going to be difficult. Let's make sure a \nfallback plan is there for seniors, that the continuity is there for \nthem. All we want to do is make sure they will have the same 2-year \ncontract cycle that the private plans will have.\n  Again, approximately 80 percent of the people in this country are in \nfee-for-service plans. Let's make sure those who are in our rural \nStates are going to see the parity in these two plans. Just remember, \nif the private plans are not there or happen to be there, there will be \nno fallback plan, so you do not have any problem with that.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I encourage my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment. First off, it is \nbad enough to have one fallback, which I believe will dramatically \ndiscourage private plans from participating in a stand-alone drug \nbenefit. To have two is even worse.\n  The fact is, the Secretary has the authority under this legislation \nto balance the risk. With a fallback plan,\n\n[[Page S8409]]\n\nthere is no risk on the private sector. All the risk for a plan is on \nthe public sector. We give the Secretary the ability to dial back the \nrisk to everything but zero, and the fallback plan is zero. We believe \ngiving the Secretary the discretion will at least encourage the private \nsector to come in, which they will under this bill, and take some risk, \nwhich means they will have some incentive to control costs. If they \nhave no risk, they have no incentive and, thereby, the cost of the \nprogram goes up.\n  Having one fallback plan is a very bad idea. Expanding this very bad \nidea is a worse idea, and I hope we vote against the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the remaining two votes in this series \nbe limited to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Madam President, my amendment is very simple. It \nsays, if you are going to give, then don't take it away. If you are \ngoing to give a prescription drug benefit, then, by golly, start it in \na timely manner, and start it, let's say, by July of 2004 instead of \n2006.\n  What kind of a benefit is this when 5.5 million of our present living \nseniors, I am sorry to say, will not be here at that time, 30 months \nhence. In 11 months, President Lyndon Johnson initiated the idea of \nMedicare and had it passed and in place--11 months. Why in the world is \nit going to take 30 months?\n  I do not believe we ought to be looking at these discount cards, \nwhich are available generally in the community today, as the stopover \nuntil 30 months have gone by. It is an outrage that this date is \nchosen, I think not because they want to delay the benefit for seniors \nbut, rather, because it coincides with an election. I do not think we \nought to stand for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I sympathize with those who feel a \nneed to get this program going sooner than we have it in this \nlegislation. But the fact is, CMS has told us it is physically \nimpossible to get this benefit up and running in the year 2004. Now, \nknowing that, we have provided a prescription drug discount card, \nstarting on January 1, 2004, in order to get immediate relief from the \nhigh cost of prescriptions for our seniors.\n  The amendment would spend close to $24 billion in fiscal year 2004--\nthe amendment that is before us--and that is money that is not in the \nbudget. We deal with the needs of our seniors in a fair way with this \nbill, the discount card, and the $600 help for them for each of the \nnext 2 years. So I urge my colleagues to take all this into \nconsideration and oppose the amendment.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 982.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Kansas (Mr. \nBrownback) and the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Campbell) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from Kansas \n(Mr. Brownback) would vote ``no''.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the \nSenator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) and the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the two leaders have met and talked to the \nmanagers. We will have, in approximately 30 minutes, two votes. Senator \nDodd has agreed to take 20 minutes on his two amendments. He can divide \nit however he deems appropriate. Following that, the Senate will still \nbe in\n\n[[Page S8410]]\n\nsession. People will offer amendments, if they desire, but it is \ncontemplated these two votes will be the last votes of the evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 998\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 998.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 998.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To modify the amount of the direct subsidy to be provided to \n               qualified retiree prescription drug plans)\n\n       On page 129, strike lines 3 through 20, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(2) Amount of payment.--The amount of the payment under \n     paragraph (1) shall be an amount equal to the monthly \n     national average premium for the year (determined under \n     section 1860D-15), as adjusted using the risk adjusters that \n     apply to the standard prescription drug coverage published \n     under section 1860D-11.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, this first amendment is intended to \naddress one of the major problems with this bill, and that is the \nimpact the legislation could have on Medicare beneficiaries who are \ncurrently receiving prescription drug coverage under the employer-\nsponsored retiree benefit plans.\n  I will quickly point out to my colleagues who may be saying we voted \non this with the Rockefeller amendment that this is very different. The \nRockefeller amendment was designed to provide encouragement to \nemployers to supplement the existing prescription drug benefit. This \namendment is designed to provide that encouragement only to employers \nwho would be picking up the total cost of the prescription drug \nbenefit, not just acting as a supplement. So it is very different. It \nis not the wraparound. This is an optional choice by the retiree or the \nemployer. If they are the primary provider of the drug benefit, they \nwould be covered by this amendment.\n  For employers intending to act as a supplement to the coverage, we \ndecided that today; unfortunately, it was voted down. With that in \nmind, clearly in this bill most of us believe what we ought to be \ntrying to do is support, not supplant, the valuable efforts of \nemployers already providing prescription coverage to retirees.\n  As presently written, I am concerned the bill would lead many retiree \nbenefit plans to scale back or drop entirely the prescription drug \ncoverage they presently provide. However, this amendment would provide \nan increased subsidy to employers, because we want to encourage them to \nprovide this benefit to retirees. It seems to me it is in our interest \nto encourage them to stay involved. They would get a subsidy, as long \nas they continue to offer prescription drug coverage to retirees only \nas the primary provider, not as a supplement--not as a wrap around the \nnew Medicare benefit.\n  The scope of this problem is not small at all. In fact, I was \nsurprised to learn how many seniors would be impacted by the unintended \nchange to retiree benefit coverage. About one-third of all Medicare \nbeneficiaries receive prescription drug coverage through an employer-\nsponsored health care plan. That is by far the largest source of \nprescription drug coverage for seniors.\n  These plans have played a very critical role in providing security to \nseniors, while Congress has been unable over the last number of years \nto pass a prescription drug benefit plan under Medicare. Retiree \nbenefit plans should continue, in my view, to play that role even after \na drug benefit plan is enacted. In many cases, the drug coverage \nprovided by retiree benefit plans is significantly more generous than \nthe plan we are debating here.\n  Furthermore, many seniors have become familiar and comfortable with \nthe coverage offered by their former employers.\n  Understandably, they do not want to give it up for a plan about which \nthey are confused and uncertain or may not be as beneficial to them.\n  We should be doing, in my view, everything in our power to provide \nthese seniors with a choice, with the option of staying with their \nemployer-sponsored plan. Thus, this amendment.\n  Unfortunately, the option may not be available for many seniors. That \nis why I put up this chart. I wish to focus the attention of those who \nmay be following this debate to the left side of this chart. The right \nside I will talk about briefly, but the most significant numbers are on \nthe left side of the chart. I will get to them in a minute.\n  While the numbers vary slightly, depending upon which study one \nconsults, they come to the same conclusions, roughly the same numbers, \nand they are very disheartening. Between 1993 and 2001, the percentage \nof large employers, those who employ more than 500 people, offering \ncoverage to Medicare-eligible retirees dropped from 40 to 23 percent, \nalmost in half over 7 or 8 years. In the last 2 years, 13 percent of \nall employers offering future retiree coverage have elected not to do \nso. Those retaining coverage are experiencing annual cost increases on \nthe order of 14 percent. It has been tremendously expensive. As a \nresult, they are substantially raising the cost-sharing burdens for \nindividuals enrolled in these plans.\n  The chart on the left-hand side illustrates the crisis that employer-\nsponsored plans are facing today and are going to continue to face in \nthe future. The numbers are based on a survey conducted by the Kaiser \nFamily Foundation and Hewitt Associates in December of 2002.\n  The graph shows that the actions large employers have taken over the \nlast 2 years to deal with the rapidly increasing retiree health care \ncost--these numbers may not be clear to everyone, so I will recite \nthem--a large number of employers have increased individual costs in \nsome way. Forty-four percent have increased retiree contributions to \npremiums, while 36 percent increased cost sharing. In addition, 14 \npercent have shifted all costs to the individual retiree, and 13 \npercent have eliminated the plans altogether. Finally, nearly half of \nemployers surveyed increased cost sharing for prescription drugs, as \nshown by the bar depicting 49 percent.\n  The numbers on this chart do not bode well, is the point I am trying \nto make, for those seniors who currently receive health care benefits \nfrom their former employers. Given the enormous financial pressures \nbeing felt by employers and the encouragement this bill already \nprovides--in the form of a 64 percent subsidy--to keep employers from \ndropping coverage, it seems to me that if the employees decide to stay \nwith their existing coverage, we believe that subsidy ought to go from \n64 percent to 100 percent of the national average premium. That is what \nwe are trying to do with this amendment.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that almost 40 percent \nof seniors who currently have their prescription drug medicines covered \nby retiree benefit plans would lose their coverage under the plan \nbefore us. So even with the 64 percent subsidy, 37 percent of retirees \nwould be dropped from these plans. We are raising through this \namendment that subsidy to 100 percent which we think will do a lot to \nkeep these employer-based plans in place so that retirees would have \nthat option of sticking with those retiree plans.\n\n  I supported the Rockefeller amendment. I mentioned that earlier. This \nis different. This is very different. If you are just supplementing the \nbenefit plan, then you would not be covered by the Dodd amendment. That \nwas the Rockefeller amendment, and the Senate voted it down. My \namendment says only if you are the primary provider of the prescription \ndrug benefit would you get the kind of subsidy we are talking about, \nfrom 64 to 100 percent. That would mean approximately an additional \n$400 a year per retiree paid to the employer. This would encourage \nemployers to retain the full prescription drug coverage they presently \nprovide rather than cutting back coverage and simply supplementing a \nnew Medicare benefit.\n  The underlying bill has a provision that would provide a subsidy to \nemployers for every Medicare-eligible retiree who elects to remain in \nan employer-sponsored plan as an alternative\n\n[[Page S8411]]\n\nto the Medicare prescription drug plan. That subsidy would be \napproximately, as I mentioned, 64 percent of the national average \npremium for prescription drug coverage.\n  This amendment would very simply increase that subsidy to the full \nnational average premium. This would mean an additional $35 a month per \nbeneficiary or roughly $400 a year paid directly to employer-sponsored \nplans as long as they continue to offer an alternative to Medicare \nprescription drug coverage, bringing the total subsidies to almost $100 \nper month when we combine the 64 percent that is in the bill and what \nwe are adding with this amendment.\n  To receive this subsidy, employers would have to offer a prescription \ndrug plan that is competitive with the Medicare benefit because the \nsubsidy would only be paid for beneficiaries who remain in the \nemployer-sponsored plan and do not enroll in Medicare Part C or D.\n  We simply cannot allow retiree benefit plans to disappear. That would \nbe a great mistake, in my view. This amendment is designed to keep them \nif we can. It is a modest amendment considering the benefits that could \naccrue to the retirees, giving them the option of sticking with an \nemployer-based plan.\n  If CBO is right, under the plan before us, almost 40 percent of these \nretirees will lose that prescription drug coverage under their \nemployer-based plans. I do not think we want to have that happen. I \nurge the adoption of this amendment, and I hope my colleagues will be \nsupportive of it.\n  I see the chairman of the committee who I know wants to respond to my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dodd have up to 20 minutes and \nSenator Grassley up to 10 minutes for debate on amendment Nos. 970 and \n998 concurrently. I further ask unanimous consent that following that \ndebate, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the amendment No. \n970, to be followed by a vote in relation to amendment No. 998, with no \nsecond-degree amendments in order to the amendments prior to the vote. \nFinally, I ask unanimous consent that at 10 a.m. tomorrow the Senate \nproceed to a vote in relation to the Grassley, or his designee, \namendment, regarding the benchmark, with no amendments in order to the \namendment prior to the vote; provided further, that this vote be \nsubject to the approval of both leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senator from \nConnecticut has graciously indicated the time he has used would be \ncounted toward this time.\n  Mr. DODD. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. That being the case, the vote will occur around 6:15 p.m., \nfor the information of Members.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately 6:20 p.m. Is there objection? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I can finish, I can give the chairman a \nchance to respond.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter signed by 33 of the labor \nunions in this country in support of my amendment be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    June 23, 2003.\n       Dear Senator: If the Medicare drug bill before the Senate, \n     S. 1, becomes law, 37 percent of retirees who now have \n     employer-sponsored health benefits will lose that coverage. \n     That's 4.4 million retirees that will be made worse off if S. \n     1, as drafted, is enacted into law. Such an act will \n     represent an enormous and irreversible blow to the employer-\n     based system that is the backbone of our nation's health care \n     system.\n       As you know, retiree health coverage is already in crisis. \n     Drug costs constitute 40 to 60 percent of employers' retiree \n     health care costs, and steep price increases are prompting \n     employers to eliminate drug benefits, cap their contributions \n     or drop retiree coverage altogether. In fact, just 34 percent \n     of all large firms (200 or more employees) offered retiree \n     benefits in 2002, down from 68 percent of all large firms in \n     1988.\n       Both public and private employers need immediate relief for \n     their retiree prescription drug costs, but S. 1, as now \n     drafted, will exacerbate an already dire situation for \n     retiree coverage by discriminating against retirees with \n     employer-sponsored coverage.\n       By using a trick definition of out of pocket costs--``true \n     out of pocket''--S. 1 will effectively deny retirees \n     catastrophic coverage by not counting any drug costs covered \n     through an employer plan. This ensures seniors with retiree \n     benefits will get less Medicare coverage than any other \n     beneficiary. As a result, employers that choose to ``wrap \n     around'' the Medicare benefit and provide assistance for \n     costs not covered by Medicare will find the gap in coverage \n     does not end for these retirees.\n       Two amendments will be offered to address this critical \n     flaw. The first, offered by Senator Rockefeller, would \n     eliminate the ``true out of pocket'' definition so that \n     retirees receive the same benefit as all other beneficiaries. \n     The second amendment, to be offered by Senator Dodd, would \n     increase the subsidy to employers that retain retiree \n     benefits.\n       Although some may claim that the ``true out of pocket'' \n     trick will save money for Medicare, any provision that \n     encourages employers to drop their retiree benefits will only \n     end up costing the federal government more--and hurt millions \n     of seniors in the process. Seniors who have retiree benefits \n     have worked a lifetime and made wage concessions over the \n     years with the expectation that they would have retiree \n     benefits. To change the rules of the game at this point and \n     give them less than other Medicare beneficiaries is patently \n     unfair.\n       We urge you to support the amendments aimed at encouraging \n     both public and private employers to continue providing \n     retiree health benefits. Congress must enact a drug benefit \n     that supports, not threatens our fragile employer-based \n     system of health coverage.\n       We have many other concerns with the Senate bill, including \n     the enormous gap in coverage and the reliance on uncertain \n     and historically unstable private insurance plans. And we \n     have very grave concerns that the conference report you will \n     be asked to consider will incorporate elements of the House \n     bill that are entirely unacceptable to the millions of \n     American we represent. In particular, the House bill would \n     introduce full competition into Medicare beginning in 2010--a \n     blatant attempt to undermine the traditional Medicare program \n     and start it on a ``death spiral'' of caring for the sickest \n     beneficiaries and unsustainable costs.\n       We strongly believe that adding a prescription drug benefit \n     to Medicare is the most urgently needed reform and one that \n     has been promised to our nation's elderly and disabled. \n     However, we cannot accept legislation that does so at the \n     expense of retirees who now have employer-sponsored coverage \n     and the very future of Medicare.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n         John J.

Mr. President, I will read a pertinent passage because this \nis really the heart of this issue. I mentioned earlier, one-third of \nall retirees get coverage under the private employer-based plans. If \nCBO is right, almost 40 percent of retirees will lose their coverage \nunder this bill, and employers would start dropping them because they \ndo not get the subsidies, then I think we have to understand what the \nimplications mean for a lot of people. I do not believe my colleagues \nintend this to be the case, but this is what is going to happen if we \nare not careful.\n  The letter reads in part:\n\n       If the Medicare drug bill before the Senate, S. 1, becomes \n     law, 37 percent of retirees who now have employer-sponsored \n     health benefits will lose that coverage.\n\n  That is according to CBO.\n\n       That's 4.4 million retirees that will be made worse off if \n     S. 1, as drafted, is enacted into law. Such an act will \n     represent an enormous and irreversible blow to the employer-\n     based system that is the backbone of our nation's health care \n     system.\n\n  The letter goes on:\n\n       . . . any provision that encourages employers to drop their \n     retiree benefits will only end up costing the federal \n     government more--and hurt millions of seniors in the process. \n     . . .\n       We urge you to support the [Dodd] amendment aimed at \n     encouraging both public and private employers to continue \n     providing retiree health benefits. Congress must enact a drug \n     benefit that supports, not threatens, our fragile employer-\n     based system of health coverage.\n\n  That is what my amendment is designed to do: to provide that subsidy \nif the retiree takes the option of continuing in the employer-based \nplan as the primary provider for health care coverage. If that is the \ncase, then I think we ought to provide that encouragement and \ninducement. They make a huge difference in people's lives. If CBO is \nright and we do not adopt this amendment, and 4.5 million people have a \nworse plan as a result of our action, we have taken a step back rather \nthan a step forward for that many seniors in our country. I don't know \nof anyone in this Chamber who would like to be a party to that.\n\n  For those reasons, I hope my colleagues could support the man from \nConnecticut on his amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am glad to speak about the man from Connecticut and \nhis amendment but not to support it.\n  First of all, we need to remember, with or without this subject \nbefore the Senate, these plans could be dropped without any hesitation. \nWe can have the prescription drug plan before the Senate, and there \ncould be some reason some companies would drop that. But right now, \nremember, our passage of this legislation is very much to fill a gap. \nWe are worried about people who do not have any coverage whatever.\n  As I have said before, we are all very concerned about the future of \nretirees' benefits and making sure retirees are treated fairly. Under \nthe beneficial before the Senate, retirees get the same protection from \nhigh prescription drugs and the costs as any other beneficiary. That is \na generous subsidy, far greater than they currently get, which would be \nzero.\n  The fact is, typical retiree plans provide much more generous \ncoverage, and the beneficiaries spend much less out of pocket for their \nprescriptions.\n  There has been a great deal of interest in the assumption by the \nCongressional Budget Office that corporations are going to drop their \ncoverage of prescription drugs for about 37 percent of the retirees in \nretiree health plans over the next 10 years. What we cannot forget is \nemployers, as I indicated, are already dropping or, maybe more, scaling \nback retiree health benefits not because of our legislation but because \nretiree health benefits are rising because of very high health care \ncosts. They have already been dropping plans or cutting them back for \nat least a decade, a point made by my colleague, Senator Dodd.\n  We have worked hard to address this problem in the underlying \nlegislation. One of the most significant future liabilities faced by \nretiree plans is the cost of prescription drugs. We have given \nemployers serious and generous subsidies. The Dodd amendment proposes \nto boost subsidies for employers beyond the 64 percent we have given \nthem already. This change would send millions more in taxpayers dollars \nto these corporations during the next decade. We had to put priorities \nfirst.\n  We have $400 billion. We have looked at States and the problems of \ndual eligibles. We looked at corporate retiree plans and what might \nhappen and what can we do to keep those that are going out of business \nor dumping theirs on a government plan. We have worked with a lot of \ndifferent problems. We have had to do the best we can to squeeze within \nthat $400 billion. We have tried to help the States to some extent on \ndual eligibles. We are trying to help corporations with incentives not \nto dump their retirees on this plan. I can go down a long list we have \ntried to squeeze in and prioritize.\n  The overriding goal was to help those who had no drug plans whatever. \nThat was very much a high priority. We have maybe 30 percent or a \nlittle more on private plans. We have people on Medicare with Medigap \npolicies. We have people who are duly eligible subject to Medicaid. But \nwe have 30 percent or more with zilch. We go beyond just helping those \nwho do not have any plan. But that has been our priority. We tried to \ndo it in a way that people who have better--and maybe most corporate \nretiree plans do have better incentives than what we can provide--and \nthey can continue to have better. But we cannot control entirely what \ncorporations are going to do. Particularly, you cannot do that on the \namount of money we have here.\n\n  As I indicated, this is a very expensive amendment that we cannot \nsqueeze into the $400 billion.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat the amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I will take 1 minute on this amendment and move to my \nsecond amendment.\n  This is an optional choice. We are not requiring employers to retain \nan employer-based plan. We are saying we know already, based on CBO's \nanalysis, that close to 40 percent of people under the employer-based \nplans will be dropped. We know that.\n  Our primary responsibility in this bill is to provide a good \nprescription drug benefit for people. We do not want to be in a \nsituation of actually causing people to have a worse plan than they \nhave.\n  My point is not to increase spending but to say, if you are going to \nprovide prescription drug coverage as an employer--and I want you to \ncontinue doing this; and we are being told 37 percent of the people \nwill be dropped--we will increase the subsidy. To encourage employers \nto continue doing it seems to me to be in our interest. That is why I \noffer this amendment and why it is so strongly supported by labor \nunions who believe this will be a major blow to almost 4.5 million \nretirees in the country. I urge adoption of this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 970\n\n  The second amendment I call up is amendment No. 970, and I ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment is pending.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me briefly explain this amendment. I commend the \ncommittee.\n  This bill does an awful lot for people who are really hurting. I want \nthe chairman to know I strongly support his efforts. Those who are \nreally hurting get real help with this bill. I commend the committee \nfor focusing on that. I commend him for it.\n  What this amendment does is a little different. We have all been \ntalking about donut holes. People watching this debate may wonder what \nwe are talking about, but the donut hole is in the plan when you reach \na certain level of your costs of prescription drugs. Even though you \nkeep paying the premiums of $35 a month, if your costs run somewhere \naround $4,500 to $5,800, during that period you are in the eye of the \nhurricane, and you do not get any help during that period.\n\n[[Page S8413]]\n\n  That is not true if you are below 160 percent of poverty. If you are \nbelow 160 percent of poverty, we will provide help to you even while \nyou are in the donut hole.\n  My amendment effects those in the donut hole who are between 160 and \n250 percent of poverty. That is an individual who makes $22,000 a year \nor a couple earning $30,000 a year. These are people who are really \nhurting out there as well. They are not as desperately poor as those at \n160 percent of poverty, but they are not much better off. But just in \nthe donut hole, could we say that those people might get a 50/50 deal \nin the donut hole, between 160 and 250 percent of poverty? In that one \nset of circumstances where the costs are running from $4,500 to $5,800, \nyou get a 50/50 deal if you are making $22,500, or a couple, $30,000, \nthat is what the amendment does.\n\n  I know the chairman is going to say these are great ideas and there \nis a cost associated, and there is. But we ought to provide some help \nto people in those earnings groups--$22,000 if you are single or \n$30,000 as a couple. These are probably cancer patients or patients \nwith serious medical costs. If you are paying somewhere around $4,500 a \nyear, up to $5,800 a year, you have a serious health care problem. If \nyou are making $22,000 or $30,000, as an individual or a married \ncouple, then to provide 50 percent of the cost of those prescription \ndrugs while you are in that donut hole I do not think is asking too \nmuch of us.\n  We should add just a little bit to accommodate these not even middle-\nincome people. It would be an unfair description to say these are \nmiddle-income people. There is nothing magic about 250 percent. I just \ntried to reach out a bit to that constituency here that will continue \npaying the $35 a month. They have to do that. They do not get anything. \nIf we could just reach a little further to that constituency, beyond \nthe 160 percent, between $4,500 and $5,800 in total spending. We try to \nprovide an additional bit of help for you, 50 percent of that cost. We \ncan't pick up all of it, that would probably be too expensive. I don't \nknow what the CBO numbers would be, but we will put you in the 50/50 \nbracket up to 250 percent of poverty just while you are in that \nsituation. That is what the amendment does. It is no more complicated \nthan that.\n  Again, I compliment the chairman. They have done a very good job \ntaking care of the very desperately poor in the country. But for people \nwho are not quite desperately poor--although I suggest some may tell \nyou that living on $22,000 a year as a single person or a couple over \nthe age of 65 with $30,000 worth of income, they are not out partying. \nThese people probably make choices between food and rent and medicines, \nparticularly if you are paying $4,500 a year or up to $5,800 a year for \nprescription drugs. That comes off the $22,000 or your $30,000. You do \nnot have to do the math to know where you are living, what \ncircumstances you are under.\n  So this is designed to provide some additional relief for people in \nthat category, moving it up just a little bit, up to that 250 percent \nfrom 160 percent while you are in the donut hole, only there, to get a \n50/50 break. You still pay 50 percent of the cost. You don't get 100 \npercent relief, but 50 percent of the cost, and that is what the second \namendment is designed to do.\n  I apologize for racing, but I am trying to get this in in the 5 \nminutes. This is obviously complicated stuff. I am trying to \naccommodate my colleagues who I know have other engagements this \nevening to explain what the amendments do. The time does not justify \nthe context, as to how important this would be to a lot of people in \nthis country. I don't know the numbers of the people in this income \ncategory, but I have to believe before we get done with this, to \nprovide some additional help for people in that category ought not to \nbe too much of a stretch when you consider that $22,450 for an \nindividual and $30,000 for a couple is going to put a lot of burden, a \nlot of pressure on you if you are already paying somewhere between \n$4,500 and $5,800 in prescription drug costs. This amendment would help \nthose people.\n  I hope the man from Connecticut might impress the chairman on this \none with his support. Hope springs eternal. I keep knocking on the \ndoor, seeing if I can't get some help.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I commend Senator Dodd for offering this important \namendment today. This amendment will address one of the gaping holes in \nthis plan--its failure to treat retirees and retiree health plans \nfairly. Today, we have the opportunity--and the obligation--to correct \nthat unfairness.\n  Ten million senior citizens depend on retiree health plans to fill \nthe gaps in Medicare. Especially given the limitations of the drug \nbenefit we are debating, supplemental coverage from retiree health \nplans is crucial. But retiree health plans are being abandoned or cut \nback all over the country--and prescription drug costs are a key part \nof the problem. For retirees who are over 65, prescription drugs make \nup about half of all plan costs--and as much as 80 percent of recent \ncost increases.\n  But the prescription drug plan before us treats those plans unfairly, \nby taking the unprecedented step of making senior citizens with retiree \nhealth plans second class citizens under Medicare. The Congressional \nBudget Office has concluded that even with the new assistance provided \nunder this plan, one-third of all retirees--4 million senior citizens--\ncould lose their supplemental drug coverage. That should be \nunacceptable to every Senator.\n  The issue is not one of providing a bail-out or a windfall to retiree \nhealth plans. It is one of simple fairness. Currently, whenever \nMedicare covers a benefit or service, Medicare is the primary payer for \nthat service. If a retiree health plan covers the service, it pays only \nfor what Medicare does not cover.\n  The reason for that is straightforward. Employers pay taxes to \nsupport the Medicare Program. So do retirees. So do active workers who \naccept lower wages during their working years in order to have \nsupplemental retirement health care in their retirement years.\n  But under this legislation, these workers and these employers do not \nget the full benefit of their contribution to the drug benefit. Because \nof the ``true out-of-pocket'' concept included in the bill, Medicare \ndoes not pay for catastrophic expenses of these workers, even though \nthe cost of covering these expenses accounts for more than one-third \nthe cost of the current bill.\n  And the higher the costs the retiree faces, the more the discrepancy \nbetween what Medicare pays for the retiree with employer-sponsored \ninsurance and what Medicare pays for all other senior citizens grows. \nIf the individual's drug costs are $6,000, Medicare pays $2,113 for the \nretiree with insurance but $2,281 for all other senior citizens. If the \nindividual's drug costs are $8,000, Medicare still pays $2,113 for the \nretiree with employer-sponsored insurance, but $4,081 for all other \nsenior citizens. And if the individual's drug costs are $10,000, \nMedicare still pays just $2,113 for the retiree, but pays $5,881 for \nall other senior citizens.\n  This is double taxation at its worst. These retired workers and \ncompanies are taxed twice. They pay once to support the Mecicare \nprogram. Then they are forced to pay again by being denied the Medicare \nbenefits their contributions have earned. During the debate on the tax \nbill we heard a lot about the injustice of double taxation of dividends \nfrom the other side of the aisle. Apparently, for them, double taxation \nof the unearned income of millionaires and billionaires is wrong, but \ndouble taxation of moderate income retired senior citizens is just \nfine.\n  The fact is that it is not fine. The American people understand that \nit is wrong. American companies struggling to provide for their retired \nworkers in this sour economy understand that is wrong. The Senate \nshould understand that it is wrong, too, and right this injustice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I had 5.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. First, let me explain to the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer why we refer to ``the man from Connecticut.'' When I was going \nto yield him some time, I didn't think of the word ``Senator.'' I said \nI will give 1 minute to the man from Connecticut, and I apologize.\n  First of all, I wish I had an exact number for this amendment. It has\n\n[[Page S8414]]\n\nsome costs, but I do not have an official score from the Congressional \nBudget Office so I cannot say that this costs X number of billions of \ndollars at this point. But it does have some cost.\n  I am going to try to convince the Senator from Connecticut that we \nhave done a lot in this legislation for people who are low income. \nMaybe it doesn't go as high up the economic ladder as he would like to \nhave us go. But my point is we have done an awful lot.\n  We worked very hard to minimize the gap in coverage with resources \nprovided in the budget resolution which would be roughly $400 billion. \nThe bill also provides generous coverage to lower income beneficiaries, \nthose who have income below about $15,000, and couples with incomes \nbelow about $20,000. They, in fact, have no gap in coverage. That is 44 \npercent of Medicare beneficiaries who are completely unaffected by the \nbenefit limit.\n  In the writing of this bill, a conscious decision was made to devote \nexcess dollars to filling in the gap in coverage for all seniors. Under \nthe underlying bill, the average senior at this income level will still \nsave more than $1,600 annually off the drug spending after paying an \naffordable monthly premium of $35 per month. This is a savings of about \n53 percent off annual drug costs for the average senior who would \nenroll in the drug benefit.\n  Let me remind everybody, this drug benefit is optional. People do not \nhave to join it. If anybody is saying I don't want to pay $35 per month \nto get this sort of coverage, then that person does not have to pay $35 \nper month for coverage because this is a voluntary program. So the \npeople who enroll in this program would save that $1,600, even beyond \nthe $35-per-month premium.\n  While I appreciate what the Senator from Connecticut is trying to do, \nit cannot possibly fit within the $400 billion that we have. We had to \ndraw a limit someplace. We drew the limit at 160 percent of poverty. So \nI cannot support his amendment. I am sorry to say that to the Senator \nfrom Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the chairman. He has been very gracious. This is my \nlast amendment. I have tried vainly over here in the last couple of \ndays with some amendments--I don't know what the implications are; I \nappreciate his candor, in terms of not knowing the cost of this \namendment--that would fill in the hole, to go from 160 to 250, for \npeople in that category. The reason I offered it is it occurred to me \nif you are paying that much in prescription drugs, somewhere around \n$5,000 a year for prescription drugs, and you are making $30,000 as a \ncouple or $22,000 as an individual, you probably have a pretty serious \nillness if you are paying about $5,000 in prescription drug costs.\n  It occurs to me that during that hole, we might try to do a little \nmore. We have done that, as the chairman says, very graciously for the \ndesperately poor in this country.\n  For those reasons, I urge the adoption of the amendment. I will let \nthe chairman proceed. The first amendment, I guess, we will do in that \norder.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield any time I have and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 970.\n  Mr. DODD. There are two amendments. Amendment No. 998?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We will vote on one at a time. Amendment No. \n970 is first.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, while I am at it, I would like to ask \nfor the yeas and nays on both the Dodd amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to that request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The yeas and nays are in order.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

GEOGRAPHIC RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN HOSPITALS \n                   FOR PURPOSES OF REIMBURSEMENT UNDER THE \n                   MEDICARE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, effective for discharges occurring during fiscal year \n     2004 and each subsequent fiscal year, for purposes of making \n     payments under section 1886(d) of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395ww(d)), hospitals located in the Bismarck, North \n     Dakota Metropolitan Statistical Area are deemed to be located \n     in the Fargo-Moorhead North Dakota-Minnesota Metropolitan \n     Statistical Area.\n       (b) Treatment as Decision of Medicare Geographic \n     Classification Review Board.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), for \n     purposes of section 1886(d) of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C 1395ww(d)), any reclassification under subsection (a) \n     shall be treated as a decision of the Medicare Geographic \n     Classification Review Board under paragraph (10) of that \n     section.\n       (2) Nonapplication of 3-year application provision.--\n     Section 1886(d)(10)(D)(v) of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395ww(d)(10)(D)(v)), as it relates to a \n     reclassification being effective for 3 fiscal years, shall \n     not apply with respect to reclassifications made under this \n     section.\n       (c) Process for Applications To Ensure that Provisions \n     Apply Beginning October 1, 2003.--The Secretary shall \n     establish a process for the Medicare Geographic \n     Classification Review Board to accept, and make \n     determinations with respect to, applications that are filed \n     by applicable hospitals within 90 days of the date of \n     enactment of this section to reclassify based on the \n     provisions of this section in order to ensure that such \n     provisions shall apply to payments under such section 1886(d) \n     for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2003.\n       (d) Adjustments To Ensure Budget Neutrality.--If 1 or more \n     applicable hospital's applications are approved pursuant to \n     the process under subsection (c), the Secretary shall make a \n     proportional adjustment in the standardized amounts \n     determined under paragraph (3) of such section 1886(d) for \n     payments for discharges occurring in fiscal year 2004 to \n     ensure that approval of such applications does not result in \n     aggregate payments under such section 1886(d) that are \n     greater or less than those that would otherwise be made if \n     this section had not been enacted.\n\n                           Amendment No. 1019\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the first amendment would provide \nimmediate prescription assistance to certain chronically ill \nbeneficiaries. We have a very curious circumstance. Under current law, \nMedicare Part B covers injectable drugs if they are routinely \nadministered by a physician in the office. However, if a similar drug \nis available that could be self-injected at home, it is not covered.\n  That makes no sense at all. This policy causes a significant burden \nfor seniors with certain illnesses such as multiple sclerosis, \nrheumatoid arthritis, and other diseases. This amendment would address \nthis problem by providing immediate coverage of drugs that could be \nadministered at home when they are used to replace drugs that are \ncovered when given in a physician's office. This transitional benefit \nwould expire when a comprehensive Medicare drug benefit is implemented \nin 2006.\n  I am proud to say I am working on this effort with Senator Murray of \nWashington, who has introduced similar legislation in bill form; \nSenator Smith, who is also on the Finance Committee, who has been a \nleading advocate of this approach; Senator Lincoln; and Senator \nJeffords. It is supported by more than 40 patient organizations.\n\n[[Page S8417]]\n\n  This is a common-sense policy which provides real and immediate help \nto thousands of America's seniors. It is entirely paid for by codifying \nthat Medicare is the secondary payer when beneficiaries have other \nprivate insurers that provide them with coverage.\n  I hope my colleagues will look with favor on this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1020\n\n  The second amendment would address payment inequity that has hurt \nAmerica's rural hospitals. As many know, rural health care providers \nare often forced to operate with significantly less resources than \nlarger urban facilities. In my State of North Dakota, rural hospitals \noften receive only one-half the reimbursement their urban counterparts \nget for treating the exact same illness.\n  For example, a rural facility in North Dakota receives approximately \n$4,200 for treating pneumonia, while a hospital in New York receives \nmore than $8,500 to treat that same illness. The funding disparity is \nsimply unfair and has placed many rural providers on shaky ground.\n  To address this situation, MedPAC has recommended various policies, \nincluding equalizing the standard payment amount, which has been 1.6 \npercent higher for urban facilities. There is no policy basis for this \ndifference.\n  Earlier this year the omnibus appropriations bill took steps to \nequalize the standardized amount but only until the end of fiscal year \n2003. This amendment finishes the job by making this change permanent.\n  Again, this amendment is fully paid for by the legislation codifying \nthat Medicare is the secondary payer when beneficiaries have \nalternative coverage.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1021\n\n  Finally, I am offering a third amendment that would address a \ndisparity related to whether certain hospitals are eligible to be \nreclassified for the purposes of the in-patient hospital wage index.\n  Under current law, hospitals have to meet certain mileage or \nproximity requirements in order to reclassify to the wage index value \napplied to another area of the State. In rural States such as North \nDakota, this restriction has produced unfair, certainly unintended, \nconsequences.\n  In my State, there are hospitals on the western side of North Dakota \nwhich are hundreds of miles from the eastern side of the State but \ncompete for the same labor pool--compete for the same doctors, the same \nnurses--and have the same costs. However, because of this mileage \nrestriction, they are not able to get paid the same. In fact, there is \nan 18-percent difference in the wage index between hospitals in \nBismarck, ND, and hospitals in Fargo, ND--an 18-percent difference. It \nmakes no earthly sense.\n  North Dakota hospitals have tried to address this situation by \nappealing to CMS on various occasions, to no avail. And the reason it \nhas been to no avail is because the law says you have to be contiguous. \nWell, there is a 200-mile difference between Bismarck and Fargo, but \nthey are in contiguous markets. They compete for the same doctors, the \nsame nurses, and they need to be treated in the same way.\n  This amendment would address this situation by allowing certain \nhospitals in my State to reclassify to another area of the State for \npurposes of the wage index. This change would be budget neutral.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these three important amendments.\n  Let me just say, if I can, to my colleagues, I am also working on a \nfourth amendment, the dialysis annual update formula. I am working on \nthat with Senator Santorum and the chairman and ranking member. We are \nhopeful of being able to work out that amendment at a later point.\n  Mr. President, these are the amendments I am seeking to have \nconsidered.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1019\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from North \nDakota in support of critical drug coverage for beneficiaries who \ncontend with the debilitating effects of Multiple Sclerosis. This \namendment would provide transitional coverage for the four FDA-approved \ntherapies in the 2-year interim until 2006, when the prescription drug \nplan will take effect.\n  Approximately 400,000 Americans have MS. In my home State of Oregon, \nit is estimated that there are 5,800 people living with MS. Currently, \nMedicare covers only one of the four FDA-approved MS therapies and only \nwhen administered by a physician.\n  This amendment would cover all four MS therapies, including when they \nare administered by the patients themselves, providing better coverage \nand better care for Americans with Multiple Sclerosis. While these \ntherapies do not cure MS, they can slow its course, and have provided \ngreat benefit to MS patients.\n  It is critical that MS patients have access to all approved drugs \nbecause some MS patients do not respond well to, or cannot tolerate, \nthe one MS therapy that is currently covered. Currently, many Medicare \nbeneficiaries with MS are forced to take the less effective therapy, to \npay the costs out of pocket, or forgo treatment.\n  Equally, this amendment is important to rural Medicare beneficiaries \nwith MS. By administering drugs themselves, rural beneficiaries can \navoid the costs and hassles of traveling long distances to health care \nfacilities to receive their MS therapy.\n  In the spirit of providing all Medicare beneficiaries with increased \nchoice, MS patients need and deserve the full range of treatment \nchoices currently available and self-administration helps ensure access \nto needed medications. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto join me in support of this amendment and to provide adequate and \ncomprehensive drug coverage for MS patients.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, with the graciousness of the Senator from \nNew York, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Washington be \nrecognized for up to 3 minutes to speak on one of the amendments \noffered by the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1019\n\n  Mr. President, I have a statement I will give for the Record, but I \nalso want to thank Senator Conrad for his work on the self-injected \nbiologics and the offering of this amendment tonight. I am delighted to \nbe a cosponsor on this amendment. It is something I have worked on for \nover 2 years. And as Senator Conrad said, we have patients today with \nMS, with rheumatoid arthritis, who are forced to go to a doctor, a \nmedical clinic in order to get the drugs they need.\n  This will save us money in the long run because people will be able \nto stay home. But, most importantly, it will allow people quality of \nlife in the care they need. I thank Senator Conrad and Senator Smith \nand the other cosponsors of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Conrad and Senator \nSmith in offering this amendment to give those on Medicare access to a \nnew, exciting group of drugs known as self-injected biologics.\n  Senator Conrad offered a similar amendment during the Senate Finance \nCommittee markup and received a commitment from the chair to work with \nus on this effort.\n  As a result of this commitment, Senator Conrad withdrew the \namendment. We have been working with CBO and Senator Baucus' staff to \naddress any concerns.\n  Currently, Medicare will only cover biologics if they are \nadministered in a physician's office or clinical setting. That means \npatients must travel to the physician's office to receive treatment. \nThis is not easy for many patients who have rheumatoid arthritis or \nMS--two diseases that can severely limit a person's mobility.\n  Fortunately, there are versions of these drugs that a patient can \ntake in their own home. It is a great innovation that will improve a \npatient's access.\n  Unfortunately, Medicare won't cover biologics that are administered \nin the home. That just doesn't make sense. I have been working to \ncorrect this inequity for the past 2 Congresses.\n  The Murray-Conrad-Smith amendment would provide 2 years of coverage, \nunder Part B, for those self-injected biologics that replace treatments \ncurrently available only in a physician's office.\n\n[[Page S8418]]\n\n  We allow for 2-year coverage to bridge the gap to implementation of a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit.\n  We have received a CBO score for the 2 years and believe that we can \nfind room in 2004 and 2005 to provide this important coverage for MS \nand RA patients.\n  This legislation is strongly endorsed by the Arthritis Foundation and \nwill provide additional coverage to all four MS self-injected or self-\nadministered treatments.\n  For MS, only one treatment is covered under Medicare, provided in a \nphysician's office.\n  I am hopeful that the managers of this legislation will be able to \naccept our amendment and end this discriminatory practice in Medicare.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the leadership \nSenator Murray has provided on this issue. I really took her \nlegislation and, because I am a member of the Finance Committee, I had \nan opportunity to offer it. But I want to make clear, this is a bill \nSenator Murray introduced. I was proud to pick it up in the Finance \nCommittee so it could be offered at the appropriate time there.\n  I thank her for her leadership. I think we are close to getting this \naccomplished. It will be a great tribute to the Senator from Washington \nand the legislative leadership she has provided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I join with my colleague from North \nDakota in thanking the Senator from Washington for championing this \ncause for so long because it is clearly long overdue. And I thank both \nSenators for presenting it to us in this context. I look forward to \nsupporting it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be \ntemporarily set aside so I may offer several amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That authority has already been granted.\n\n\n                      Amendments Nos. 1000 and 999\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak of four amendments \nI have filed. And I would like to discuss each in turn, starting with \namendment No. 1000, offered on behalf of myself, Senator Tim Johnson, \nand Senator----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1000\n\n  Mr. President, amendment 1000, offered on behalf of myself and \nSenators Tim Johnson and Jeff Bingaman, is being offered to ensure our \nseniors have information they need to make informed consumer choices \nabout their drugs, and also to ensure practitioners have the \ninformation needed to choose the right drug for a patient, and, \nfurther, that the private plans this bill would create have the \ninformation they need to make formulary and benefit design choices \nbased on sound science.\n  This amendment ensures that various Government agencies--NIH, FDA, \nCMS, and the others involved in this effort--conduct research comparing \nthe efficacy and, if applicable, the comparative safety of the top \ndrugs used by Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries who are Medicare \neligible.\n  Now often there are a number of competing drugs to treat the same \ncondition. But which is more effective? Oftentimes we just do not know.\n  While the FDA is responsible for determining safety and effectiveness \nof prescription drugs compared to a placebo, there is no Government \nentity responsible for examining whether drug A is more effective at \ntreating a particular condition than drug B. Meanwhile, drug companies \ndo not always have an incentive to do head-to-head trials of the drugs \nthey put out versus those of their competitors. But this information is \ncritical to all decisionmakers, to patients and consumers, to \npractitioners, and to the private plans that are being created.\n  Now clinicians have told me they are frequently trying to decide \nwhether to switch a patient from an old drug to a new drug. They are \nnot deciding between the old drug and a placebo; they are deciding \nbetween a drug they have used for a particular patient and then one \nwhich has come to their attention because it is now on the market, and \nthey are trying to decide: Which is best for my patient? They wish they \nhad more information that would enable them, besides trial and error \nand possible adverse consequences, to make that determination.\n  Clearly, consumers will also benefit from more sources of \ninformation. Right now advertising is a source available to consumers, \nbut this amendment will help us provide an unbiased, scientific source \nof information that consumers can compare side by side rather than just \na beautiful advertisement of people running through a field or twirling \ntheir grandchildren and then being told: This is the drug for the \ncondition you have. They will be able to say: Well, wait a minute. Here \nis the drug I have been prescribed, here is a drug I have heard about. \nLet me look on the Internet to see what the differences might be.\n  Now we have all heard of ``me too'' drugs, and there is nothing wrong \nwith ``me too'' drugs. Sometimes a ``me too'' drug will work \nincrementally better than a previous drug or it may be better \ntolerated. Even if a ``me too'' drug does not have those \ncharacteristics, it might be superior for a certain portion of the \npopulation but not for others. The problem is, we do not have that kind \nof comparative data.\n  My amendment directs NIH to do comparative efficacy trials for the \ntop Medicare drugs--the ones that are primarily prescribed for the \nMedicare population--for the kinds of conditions the Medicare \npopulation primarily suffers from.\n  No single study will settle that question once and for all, so my \namendment then directs the Agency for Health Research and Quality, \nAHRQ, to do what it does best, which is to synthesize the literature \nthat is out there as well as the NIH data to report information on the \ncomparative efficacy of these medical interventions that we are \nsubsidizing now in this bill for our seniors.\n  HHS will then make this comparative information available to \nclinicians, to Congress, to relevant Federal agencies. And it will, \nmost particularly and importantly, make that available to seniors so \nthey can make informed choices for themselves.\n  Under this amendment, we would put this information on the Internet. \nFDA would look at whether this information needs to be included in drug \nlabels, and drug ads would also contain this information so that they \ndo not mislead seniors.\n  One indicator of the rarity of these studies is that completion of a \ncomparative efficacy study can make national news. For example, many of \nus\n\n[[Page S8420]]\n\nread last December when the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute \npublished a study and discovered that it corrected the assumption that \nnewer drugs, such as calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors, which \ncost 30 to 40 times more than diuretics, were not more effective than \nthose long-time treatments for high blood pressure. This is information \nwe have needed for years. We have one of the most advanced health care \nsystems, if not the most advanced, in the world. If the information \nstream our doctors count is such a tiny trickle that the daily news can \nkeep track of all major developments, then this amendment must be \npassed in order to give us a sound scientific basis for the decisions \nthat are going to be made with the $400 billion that we are allocating.\n  When the research is done, as we learned about in the calcium channel \nblockers and ACE inhibitors versus old-fashioned diuretics, it is \nimportant and its benefits are immediately obvious.\n  In January 2003, the American Journal of Ophthalmology published an \narticle comparing the efficacy of two glaucoma drugs. One is \nlatanoprost and the other bimatoprost. These were compared in an NIH-\nsponsored randomized clinical trial. Despite the fact that the \nLatanoprost is currently the most popular medication, the study found \nthat Bimatoprost was more effective.\n  This is critically important because if we are going to be putting \nmoney into drugs and we are going to be holding out the promise to our \nseniors that finally help is on the way, then let's make sure these tax \ndollars are used to fund the drugs that are most effective.\n  In 1999, an NIH-sponsored study showed that a well-known, safe, cheap \ngeneric drug, Metoprolol, was just as effective for treating patients \nwith heart failure as a more expensive drug which had come on to the \nmarket just a few years earlier. Some may say these studies could \npromote a one-size-fits-all approach to prescribing, but to the \ncontrary, these studies can actually help make prescribing more nuanced \nand appropriate to each subpopulation.\n  For instance, in March 2003, the American Journal of Cardiology \nreviewed numerous clinical trials of medications used to treat what is \ncalled atrial fibrillation, a type of heart arrhythmia, and came up \nwith recommendations about what are the most effective drugs for use \nfor this condition based on what the underlying cause of the condition \nwas in each case.\n  As someone who is fast approaching the age of Medicare eligibility, I \nwant, both for my pocketbook and my health, to know that my doctor and \nI have the best information available about which drug is appropriate \nfor me. And I certainly think that we can, through this amendment, \nbegin to provide that information to ensure that seniors and their \nphysicians have good, solid data on which to make their decisions.\n  This amendment is supported by a number of groups that are aware of \nthe significance of trying to put into this bill some scientifically \nbased data on which to make these decisions. The RxHealth Value \nCoalition is supporting the amendment. I have a letter from them. They \nconsist of not only large employers--Verizon, General Motors, Ford, et \ncetera--but Blue Cross, Blue Shield, Kaiser, AARP, and many others.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the RxHealth Value letter of June \n24, 2003, supporting this amendment, in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                RxHealthValue,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 2003.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: As the 108th Congress considers \n     reforming the Medicare program and addressing one of the \n     programs major shortcomings--lack of an outpatient \n     prescription drug benefit, we want to express support for \n     your amendment to the Medicare legislation being considered \n     by the Senate that would provide limited support for the \n     Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Center for \n     Medicare Choices, which would be created by S. 1, the \n     National Institutes of Health and the Agency for Healthcare \n     Research and Quality to collaborate on studies to compare the \n     relative efficacy and safety of prescription medicines \n     designed to treat the same condition. It is this very \n     information that is vital to patients, practitioners, and \n     purchasers. With comparative information on prescription \n     medicines patients, practitioners and purchasers can make \n     better decisions with respect to choosing the prescription \n     medicines to take, prescribe, cover, and pay for.\n       RxHealthValue is a national coalition of large employers, \n     consumer groups, labor unions, health plans, health care \n     providers and pharmacy benefit managers that, through its \n     members, represents almost 100 million Americans. \n     RxHealthValue is committed to research, education and both \n     public- and private-sector solutions to ensure that Americans \n     receive the full health and economic value from their \n     prescription drugs. The Coalition's definition of ``value'' \n     includes effectiveness, cost, appropriate use and safety.\n       Your amendment is a very important component of any \n     Medicare prescription drug benefit proposal, since it is \n     imperative that the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \n     Services (CMS) and the proposed Center for Medicare Choices \n     (CMC) have the needed information to be a prudent purchaser \n     of prescription drugs. We are pleased that you ask the \n     National Institutes of Health (NIH) to add to the very \n     limited research results from which evidence-based reviews \n     get their information, and that you recognized the importance \n     of dissemination so that information gets to providers and \n     consumers when they need it. We agree that AHRQ's Evidence-\n     based Practice Centers (EPCs), which have been involved in \n     the innovative Oregon prescription drug program, would be an \n     outstanding vehicle for such reviews.\n       This legislation is especially important as Congress works \n     to provide Medicare beneficiaries with high quality \n     outpatient drug coverage. We applaud your efforts on this \n     important amendment and look forward to working with you and \n     others to ensure that improved information on prescription \n     drugs is available to all.\n       For more information on RxHealth's position on this and \n     other drug value initiatives, please contact Steve Cole, \n     RxHealthValue Policy Committee Chair, at 202-296-1314.\n       Again, thank you from the member organizations of \n     RxHealthValue:\n       Blue Cross/Blue Shield.\n       Kaiser.\n       AARP.\n       National Consumers League.\n       Verizon.\n       Association of Community Health Plans.\n       General Motors.\n       Ford.\n       Daimler Chrysler.\n       Families USA.\n       National Organization of Rare Disorders.\n       American Academy of Family Physicians.\n       Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy.\n       UAW.\n       AFSCME.\n       Pacific Business Group on Health.\n       Midwest Business Group on Health.\n       Washington Business Group on Health.\n       Advance-PCS.\n       Caremark Rx.\n       AFL-CIO.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Similarly, I have a letter from Consumers Union, dated \nJune 24, 2003, which also supports amendment No. 1000, and I ask \nunanimous consent that letter, too, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                              Consumers Union,\n\n                                                    June 24, 2003.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johnson: Consumers Union strongly supports \n     your amendment that would provide for study by the National \n     Institute of Health and the Agency for Healthcare Research \n     and Quality of the comparative effectiveness of prescription \n     drugs. The development of scientific evidence-based \n     information about the relative effectiveness of drugs has the \n     potential to dramatically increase consumers' (and \n     taxpayers') bang-for-the-buck paid for prescription drugs.\n       Millions of Medicare beneficiaries (in addition to the tens \n     of millions of uninsured and underinsured consumers \n     nationwide) are paying increasing out-of-pocket costs for \n     their prescription drugs. Despite these escalating costs, it \n     is often difficult for consumers and health care \n     professionals to ensure that consumers receive value for each \n     healthcare dollar spent.\n       The proposed amendment would create a resource for \n     independent information about the comparative medical \n     effectiveness of important medicines. We believe that this \n     information will substantially reduce the nation's \n     prescription drug expenditures, because consumers and doctors \n     will be able to make decisions using reliable evidence-based \n     information about comparative effectiveness. The amendment \n     would require this information to be made available through \n     the Internet to the public. As a result, consumers, \n     employers, state governments and the federal government will \n     have access to information that will enable them to choose \n     more cost-effective medicines without sacrificing medical \n     effectiveness or quality of care.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Gail E. Shearer,\n\n                                 Director, Health Policy Analysis,\n                                                Washington Office.\n\n\n[[Page S8421]]\n\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Finally, I have a letter from Families USA, dated June \n24, 2003, that similarly supports the amendment. I will read the \nfollowing paragraph from it:\n\n       It would be unfortunate if Congress decides to spend $400 \n     billion on pharmaceuticals over the next decade, without \n     providing a few dollars to ensure that what we are buying is \n     indeed worth buying.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record as well.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                 Families USA,\n\n                                                    June 24, 2003.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: Congratulations on your amendment to \n     help Americans understand which prescription drugs are truly \n     effective and safe. Families USA, the national health \n     consumer advocacy organization, strongly endorses the effort \n     of you and Senator Johnson to provide reliable, unbiased \n     information on pharmaceuticals.\n       Too often today, prescription drug information is \n     influenced by the manufacturer, by advertisements, and by \n     clinical studies financed by those who will gain from \n     favorable reports. Americans need an objective, reliable \n     source of information on which prescription drugs are most \n     effective.\n       It would be unfortunate if Congress decides to spend $400 \n     billion on pharmaceuticals over the next decade, without \n     providing a few dollars to ensure that what we are buying is \n     indeed worth buying.\n       Thank you again for you leadership on this important health \n     consumer initiative.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ronald F. Pollack,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, if we are serious about making changes \nthat will improve the health of our seniors on Medicare, I hope that we \nlook to establish in this bill the proposition that good information, \nsolid science that can be made available to seniors, to clinicians, to \nplans, be part of what we are establishing with the proposition that \nthis money needs to be well spent, well spent not only to safeguard the \ntaxpayers' dollars but well spent to ensure that our doctors and \npatients get the best possible treatment.\n  I also am offering amendment No. 999 that is intended to ensure that \nMedicare plans compete to improve rather than cut corners on quality. \nThis bill already includes a measure that I have supported, along with \nSenator Hatch and others, to commission the Institute of Medicine to \nensure the Medicare Program pays plans for providing higher quality \ncare.\n  Unfortunately, even for the many common diagnoses and treatments that \nare part of a senior's medical history, we lack the quality standards \nthat the Medicaid Program would use to help consumers make informed \ncomparisons and choices among health plans.\n  For some diseases, the National Commission for Quality Assurance does \ncollect information about health plans by providing data, for example, \non how well HMOs screen for breast cancer or provide flu shots for \nolder adults.\n  For many other diseases, however, we do not know which plans make \nsure that their diabetic patients get their eyes examined for retinal \ndamage, what percent of asthmatics receive adequate therapy to control \ntheir asthma, or many other issues that go to the heart of the quality \nof health care that is being provided to our seniors.\n  The data tells us that Medicare beneficiaries are often not receiving \nthe care they need to maintain their health. In 2001, for example, 23 \npercent of Medicare beneficiaries in private health plans did not have \ntheir cholesterol managed after a heart attack.\n  Now, my amendment is based on recommendations made by the Institute \nof Medicine. It authorizes a collaborative effort among the relevant \nGovernment agencies to develop quality indicators in the 20 most \nimportant areas identified in this Institute of Medicine report \nentitled ``Priority Areas for National Action.'' It authorizes the \nQuality Interagency Coordination Task Force--that is a task force that \nbrings together all the Federal agencies that are needed to collect \nhealth quality data--to implement these indicators so that they are all \ncollecting quality information in the same way. The Secretary of Health \nand Human Services would then develop demonstration programs for \ncommunities to engage in community-wide reporting, according to these \nquality indicators.\n  This amendment also has the potential to lower the cost of the \nMedicare Program. Because plans will provide quality measures that \nconsumers will use, health plans will want to implement those quality \nimprovement measures that have also been proven to lower health care \ncosts. One such program, as an example, is a diabetes intervention \nprogram implemented by Group Health Cooperative, a group model health \nplan in Washington State. This intervention program improved diabetic \nblood sugar control and saved between $685 and $950 annually from \nreduced hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and physician \nconsultations.\n  This is the kind of emphasis on quality that I think we need to put \ninto this bill. Otherwise, as we try to make sense of the variety of \noptions and choices that are available, we are not going to know what \nimproved quality or what decreases costs. That should be one of our \ngoals, and this amendment holds out the promise that the Medicare \nProgram, with proper implementation of quality indicators, can do \nboth--improve health and quality control and decrease costs.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 953\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I will also be talking about amendment \nNo. 953, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mrs. CLINTON] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 953.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (Purpose: To provide training to long-term care ombudsman)\n\n       On page 608, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. TRAINING FOR LONG-TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services, acting through the Director of the Administration \n     on Aging and in consultation with the Director of the Agency \n     for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Administrator of \n     the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, shall authorize \n     a program, to be developed and implemented by the National \n     Long-Term Care Ombudsman Resource Center, for the training of \n     long-term care ombudsmen in the use of quality of care \n     information.\n       (b) Training.--Under the program developed under subsection \n     (a), training shall be provided to long-term care ombudsman \n     to enable such ombudsman to educate consumers concerning--\n       (1) nursing home quality of care issues;\n       (2) available nursing home quality of care reports, \n     including existing quality data that the Administrator of the \n     Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has released for use \n     by the public in choosing long-term care facilities; and\n       (3) the manner in which an individual can successfully \n     integrate quality information into health care decision \n     making regarding nursing home decisions.\n       (c) Duties of Resource Center.--The National Long-Term Care \n     Ombudsman Resource Center shall--\n       (1) develop and maintain a curriculum for ombudsmen;\n       (2) develop, produce, and maintain training materials;\n       (3) conduct train-the-trainer programs at regional and \n     national levels; and\n       (4) act as a clearinghouse for best practices in \n     communicating the significance of nursing home quality \n     indicators to residents and their caregivers.\n       (d) Pilot Programs.--The Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services shall award grants for the establishment of 1-year \n     pilot demonstration programs in 10 States using long-term \n     care ombudsmen to educate consumers regarding home health \n     care quality. Such pilot demonstration programs shall test \n     the effectiveness of having a committed position within the \n     State dedicated to helping consumers use home health care \n     quality indicators.\n       (e) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services shall submit to Congress a \n     report concerning the effectiveness of the program \n     established under this section, including the benefits of \n     providing for dedicated staff who are responsible for \n     educating consumers to use home health quality indicators in \n     their health care decision-making.\n       (f) Authorization.--In addition to any other amounts \n     authorized to be appropriate for long-term care ombudsman \n     programs, there are authorized to be appropriated to carry \n     out this section $4,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 (of which \n     $1,000,000 shall be used to carry out subsection (d)), and \n     $2,000,000 for each fiscal year thereafter.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, amendment No. 953 would empower Medicare \nbeneficiaries and their families in making decisions about nursing\n\n[[Page S8422]]\n\nhomes and home health services. Data on nursing home quality is \npublicly available through a project strongly supported by \nAdministrator Scully, and I am very appreciative of that because that \ninformation is imperative.\n  However, I know from talking with people throughout New York that \nthere are still many problems in nursing homes with respect to errors \nand mishaps that undermine the quality of care, the quality of life \nand, in some respects, even the health of the nursing home residents. \nMany people still don't know about this existing quality data and about \nthe existing ombudsman program within the administration on aging that \nis intended to help families navigate nursing home decisions.\n  This amendment would establish a national long-term care ombudsman \nresource center, which will help to develop and train ombudsmen. The \namendment would establish pilot programs, including grants to create \nombudsman offices in 10 States. These are the people--it should really \nbe ``ombudspeople,'' I guess--who are uniquely positioned to know about \nthe facilities they serve. They visit the facilities regularly. They \nare often located at agencies in the local communities. They have \nfirsthand knowledge. They are very valuable resources. However, their \nknowledge, if it doesn't actually get to the users, the nursing home \nresidents and, more importantly, their family members or advocates, \ndoesn't help anyone.\n  This pilot project would fund specific ombudsman programs to provide \ncomprehensive outreach, public education, and individual consultation \nthat integrate quality information into health care decisionmaking. \nThrough this pilot project, the ombudsman center would be able to \nidentify the resources needed to actually provide consumer education on \nlong-term care and home health, as well as best practices and \ncollaborative models that could then be replicated around the country.\n  I ask my colleagues also to support this amendment because, again, I \nthink information is critical. We talk about trying to create more of a \nmarket for these health care resources. Markets exist on information. A \nmarket without good information is not really a market at all. So if we \nare going to move toward the private market and provide these private \nhealth plans as competition to the existing Medicare delivery system, \nthen I think we have to do more than just talk about the market. We \nneed to empower the consumers within the marketplace. Information is \nthat basis for empowerment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 954\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask the clerk to report amendment No. \n954, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mrs. Clinton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 954.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \n develop literacy standards for informational materials, particularly \n                           drug information)\n\n       On page 46, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n       ``(i) Health Literacy Standards.--\n       ``(1) In general.--For purposes of assisting eligible \n     entities in providing quality assurance measures as described \n     in subsection (c)(1)(B), the Secretary, acting through the \n     Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, \n     the Administrator of Health Resources and Services \n     Administration, the Director of the National Library of \n     Medicine, and the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall \n     develop standardized materials that pharmacists may use to \n     assist non-English speaking or functionally illiterate \n     patients in the safe and appropriate use of prescription \n     drugs. Such materials may include the use of pictures and the \n     development of standardized translations in multiple \n     languages of prescription labels and bottle labels and other \n     patient safety initiative information. Such materials shall \n     be available electronically for direct access by pharmacists.\n       ``(2) Authorization of appropriations.--There are \n     authorized to be appropriated to carry out this subsection, \n     such sums as may be necessary for each of fiscal years 2004 \n     and 2005.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, this amendment is intended to improve \nthe safety of the prescription drug program. As our seniors are using a \ngrowing number of medications to stay out of the hospital, to live \nhealthier and longer lives, we are inadvertently, but inevitably, \ncreating a burden on our seniors to understand and know how to use all \nof these prescription drugs. There are interactions, there are other \nissues, there are many problems with trying to sort out for our seniors \nhow drugs work, how they interact with one another. This is a very \nimportant issue that I think, again, we need to address at the \nbeginning of this process, not after some additional problems have been \ndiscovered.\n  In a recent study of adverse drug events published in the Journal of \nthe American Medical Association, 21 percent of preventable adverse \ndrug events were caused by patients not following drug prescription \ninstructions. That is just human nature. People make mistakes and, as \nyou get older, it is harder to read all that little writing on the \nprescription bottles. That is something that just kind of comes with \nthe process. Of course, we have many people for whom English is not \ntheir first language. We have others who have challenges with eyesight \nand literacy. So, clearly, our seniors, like the rest of us, could make \nmistakes.\n  Studies have found that one-third of patients often don't take the \nprescription the way they are supposed to because they don't understand \nit. Now, if you have a dose of a three-times-a-day antibiotic, and you \nalso have other prescription drugs to be taken five, six, seven times a \nday, or whatever the combination is, there are all kinds of \nopportunities for confusion because many seniors take complex drugs \nwith multiple dangerous side effects, often much more serious than \nthose from antibiotics. They are more likely to suffer injuries and \nhospitalizations as a result. As many as 60 percent of the elderly have \nthese problems about understanding and following the directions. This \nis a very critical statistic. Twenty-three percent of nursing home \nadmissions in our country result from the inability of older Americans \nto manage their medication at home.\n  That is why I am offering this amendment to ensure that the Secretary \nof HHS works to ensure the use of health literacy standards and \ninformation that will minimize adverse drug events, to ensure that we \ndevelop drug informational materials for non-English-speaking people \nand the functionally illiterate patients that can be made available to \npharmacists who can access them electronically for easy use.\n  So, Mr. President, these amendments can be summed up in a very few \nwords: enhanced quality, lower cost.\n  If we enhance quality, we avoid a lot of the problems that exist in \nour system today. We learn more about quality. We empower patients, as \nwell as clinicians, with information that can better determine quality \noutcomes, and we save money. We do not have people being admitted to \nthe hospital because they mix up their drugs. We do not have people \ntrying to figure out how they can get good information about quality \nstandards in nursing homes. We have all kinds of issues that cost \nmoney, as well as put the health and well-being of our seniors at risk.\n  I ask that my colleagues favorably consider these amendments. There \nis no cost attached to these amendments, but they will do what we hope \nto achieve by this significant legislation: improve quality for our \nseniors and lower costs in the long run by making prescription drugs \nreadily available and understanding appropriately their use.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your kind attention, and I yield the \nfloor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1000\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I join my colleagues Senators Clinton and \nBingaman today to offer an amendment to S. 1 that will provide \nconsumers and practitioners with real, objective information regarding \nthe comparative effectiveness of prescription drugs.\n  Too often, prescription drug information is influenced by drug \nmanufacturers, through advertisements, and by clinical studies financed \nby those who will gain from favorable reports. Consumers are just \ninundated with information--from direct-to-consumer advertising on \ndrugs which can paint a misleading picture, to a sea of free\n\n[[Page S8423]]\n\ndrug samples from their physicians--with all this information it can be \nextremely difficult to make a sound decision which can be just \noverwhelming for average Americans.\n  But what does the data really say about differing prescription drug \noptions? Does a newer drug that costs more than an earlier version \nnecessarily do a better job for most patients? Is it possible that a \nMedicare beneficiary may get the same, or even better outcome from the \ndrug that has been on the market for a longer time? We just really \ndon't have the answers to these--questions at least from independent, \nobjective sources.\n  We are about to create a massive new program that will effect 40 \nmillion Americans and with this comes responsibility to deliver a \nprogram that ensures the availability of appropriate prescription drugs \nfor all beneficiaries. This amendment will create a reliable source for \nvalid, evidence-based information about the comparative medical \neffectiveness of medicines used by Medicare beneficiaries. It will \nprovide unbiased information on how drugs that treat particular \ndiseases and conditions compare to one another.\n  By authorizing the National Institutes of Health, in coordination \nwith the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to conduct research \non comparative effectiveness of drugs, consumers, employers, State \ngovernments and the Federal Government will finally have access to \ninformation that will enable them to choose medicines based on clinical \nresearch. This information will be made available to help them make \nbetter decisions with respect to choosing the prescription medicines to \ntake, prescribe, cover and pay for. By using the objective, scientific \nexpertise available at NIH and AHRQ, this amendment assures that the \ninformation received comes from independent and impartial sources.\n  This amendment is supported by RxHealthValue, a national coalition of \nlarge employers, consumer groups, labor unions, health plans, health \nproviders and pharmacy benefit managers that through its members \nrepresent almost one-hundred million Americans. It is also supported by \nFamilies USA and Consumers Union.\n  This amendment preserves individuals' freedom to get any medicine \nthat they want, but would encourage the use of medicines that are \nscientifically proven more effective for patients. It will not create \n``one-size-fits-all'' medicine as Republicans will try and tell you. It \ndoes nothing to prevent independent decisionmaking by practitioners and \ntheir patients, just better educated decisionmaking.\n  Our Republican colleagues believe in the strength of the free market. \nWell, a well functioning marketplace depends on the free flow of \ninformation. Denying consumers and providers, as well as other \npurchasers of prescription drugs access to comparative information \nabout effectiveness means that decisions in the marketplace are made \nwithout perfect information--which should not be the case in an open \nmarket. You are not going to buy a car without taking a look at \nConsumer Reports are you? Are you only going to base your purchase on \nthe glitzy adds in ``Car and Driver'' magazine? I think we all know the \nanswer to this is ``no'', and most certainly Medicare beneficiaries \nshould have access to similar information for drugs they put in their \nbodies as they do for the car they drive.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 985, As Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Edwards of North \nCarolina, I send a modification to the desk, and I ask unanimous \nconsent the amendment be so modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 985), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n      TITLE ____--DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER PRESCRIPTION DRUG ADVERTISING\n\n     SEC. ____01.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1011\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the bill we are moving forward today is \na prescription drug bill, a Medicare reform bill. It is not a welfare \nreform bill. Unfortunately, through the process, as it often happens \nwhen legislation moves through this body, the Finance Committee, \nwithout having hearings, faced an amendment that came up and it became \na part of the bill that is on the Senate floor today. It would provide \nbenefits not to American citizens but to non-citizens. It\n\n[[Page S8425]]\n\nwould amend the law that was passed some time ago prohibiting such \nactions.\n  So I have sent to the desk an amendment which would strike section \n605 of the bill, the section that allows Medicaid and State health \ninsurance program coverage to be given to noncitizens, and insert a \nsense of the Senate that this section should be referred back to the \nFinance Committee.\n  In 1996, with a vote of 74 to 24, this body made a principled, \npurposeful decision during reform of welfare in this country, that non-\ncitizens should not access Federal programs such as TANF and Medicaid \nfor the first 5 years they are in the United States. That is because \nthese costs are supposed to be incurred by the sponsors of those people \nwho come into the United States. That is why we make the sponsor of an \nimmigrant who comes into the United States lawfully sign an affidavit \nthat they will be responsible for that person's health care benefit. Of \nthose Senators who are still in service in this body, 45 voted for it. \nThat is quite a significant number.\n  Section 605 would lift the 5-year ban for pregnant women, and \nchildren, from fiscal year 2005 through fiscal year 2007. In other \nwords, we would allow pregnant women and children who have sponsors in \nthe United States to access the welfare system of America to pay for \ntheir health care, contrary to the fully debated and wisely established \nrule in 1996 not to do that.\n  The President is concerned about that. The administration is opposed \nto this change. They note that the administration has proposed \nsubstantial new flexibility on the part of Medicaid and SCHIP reform, \nand coverage for legal immigrants should be examined as part of this \ncontext.\n  So we will be examining Medicaid, the SCHIP program, and Medicare \nreform later this year. That is the time we should be discussing \nchanging our current policy as to what benefits are available to \nnoncitizens, not slipping it through as part of this important bill.\n  This is not a decision that we should change, not a policy that ought \nto be altered, without some significant study and debate. We are \namending the welfare reform bill as part of a prescription drug bill. \nThis is a major policy shift. It ought not to be added in this fashion. \nThis bill is for America's senior citizens, not for non-citizens. If we \nwant to make such important changes in funding eligibility and criteria \nfor these programs, we ought to be ready to have a full and open debate \non welfare policy. That is the kind of debate we had in 1996. I think \nsome good decisions were made then that helped this country \ntremendously. It helped poor families move from welfare to work and did \na lot of things for children in this country.\n  The Finance Committee, which added section 605, should have hearings \nand go about it as part of the welfare reform bill. I feel strongly \nabout that.\n  Before 1996, the cost of welfare for immigrants had skyrocketed in \nAmerica to $8 billion a year. That was in 1996. Harvard economist \nGeorge Borjas found that immigrant households were 50 percent more \nlikely to use Federal welfare programs than were citizen households. So \nthis was the untenable position and situation in 1996, and that is what \nwas ended by the legislation then.\n  In 1996, Congress dealt specifically with the issue of welfare and \nimmigration. In an overwhelming manner they passed the Personal \nResponsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 which \nwas signed by President Clinton and became law.\n\n  The 1996 welfare and immigration reforms significantly restricted \nparticipation of new immigrants in Federal means-tested poverty \nprograms and dramatically curtailed the access of permanent resident \naliens to Federal welfare programs. That was exactly our goal. The 1996 \nreform strengthened the welfare system and made more funds available \nfor citizens in need. In passing this law in 1996, this Senate \nspecifically stated certain national policy concerns related to welfare \nand immigration that should not be changed haphazardly.\n  They said self-sufficiency has been a basic principle of United \nStates immigration law since this country's earliest immigration \nstatus. Self-sufficiency is a key part of our whole concept of \nimmigration.\n\n       It continues to be the immigration policy of the United \n     States that:\n     (A) Aliens within the Nation's borders not depend on public \n     resources to meet their needs, but rather rely on their own \n     capabilities and the resources of their families, their \n     sponsors, and private organizations, and the availability of \n     public benefits not constitute an incentive for immigration \n     to the United States.\n       Despite the principle of self-sufficiency, aliens have been \n     applying for and receiving public benefits from Federal, \n     State, and local governments at increasing rates.\n       It is a compelling government interest to enact new rules \n     for eligibility and sponsorship agreements in order to assure \n     that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national \n     immigration policy.\n       It is a compelling government interest to remove the \n     incentive for illegal immigration provided by the \n     availability of public benefits.\n\n  That is what we are talking about. That sums it up. That was a \nthoughtful policy and change made in 1996. We ought not to have it slip \nthrough here on this important bill today without full hearings and \ndiscussion.\n  Section 605, which now in this bill, would repeal the general \nprohibition of nonqualified aliens being eligible for any Federal \npublic benefits, as it applies to protect women and children, even \nthough ample exceptions for certain public benefits are already \nprovided, such as emergency medical assistance. That is available now. \nShort-term disaster relief. Immunization, housing, and communities \ndevelopment assistance, and any assistance specified by the Attorney \nGeneral.\n  Section 605 waives the 5-year waiting period before immigrants are \nallowed to receive Federal benefits, thus creating a huge incentive for \nthe benefited class of citizens to rush the borders for instant care. A \nperson who has the possibility of coming to this country, has \nconsidered it and decided not to, if their child has a health problem, \nwould not they, therefore, be incentivized to try to come across this \nborder, knowing they could apply for and have public benefit of the \nUnited States?\n  And we would like to do that. Do we do that for the entire world? It \nis just not possible. It is not good public policy. A nation has to \nhave policy that is rational and defensible.\n  A wide range of Federal programs are exempted from this requirement, \nincluding emergency Medicaid, certain immunizations, short-term \ndisaster relief, school lunch programs, the WIC program, foster care, \nadoptive assistance, and Head Start. Those are available now.\n  Section 605 will dissolve the financial accountability requirement of \nthe sponsor. If section 605 passes, sponsors will no longer be held \nresponsible to the Government for the cost of the Federal means-tested \nbenefits to the aliens they sponsor.\n  The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of \n1996, coupled with the 1996 welfare reform law, purposefully altered \nthe obligations of persons whose sponsored immigrants arrived or are \nadjusting status in the United States.\n  In 1996, as part of the immigration reform, we required that \naffidavit of support be rewritten as a legally binding contract, \nenforceable against the sponsor through the time the sponsor immigrant \nbecomes a citizen or has contributed to Social Security for 10 years. \nAffidavits of support are intended to implement the provisions of the \nINA that excludes aliens who appear ``likely at any time to become a \npublic charge.'' No nation accepts people into their country who are \nlikely to be a public charge of the country. A nation accepts people \nwho are going to be contributors and will benefit that society.\n  This is consistent with the recommendation of the Commission on \nImmigration Reform. In a report to Congress the commission stated \nsponsors of immigrants should be held financially responsible for the \nimmigrants they bring into this country.\n  Under the INA code a sponsor is defined as a person who is a citizen, \nnational or lawfully admitted, of the United States, 18 years of age, \nlives in the United States and demonstrates the means to financially \nmaintain a sponsorship. They can petition the Federal Government \nthrough an affidavit of support for the admittance of an individual \nresiding outside the United States.\n\n  In other words, a sponsor has to be a person who has the means to \nfinancially maintain a sponsorship. If they\n\n[[Page S8426]]\n\ncannot sign that affidavit honestly, then the person should not be \nadmitted into the country. The sponsor requirement allows for the \nadmission of any person into the United States who is unable to take \ncare of himself or herself without becoming a charge to the taxpayers \nby assuring, via affidavit, that the sponsor will financially support \nthe person.\n  An affidavit for support may not be accepted unless the sponsor \nagrees to, one, provide financial support to maintain the sponsored \nalien; two, be legally bound to the Federal Government of any entity \nthat provides any means-tested public benefit which includes Medicaid; \nand three, submit to the jurisdiction of any Federal court.\n  If a sponsored alien received any means-tested public benefits, the \nentity which provided such benefits can request to be reimbursed by the \nsponsor, and if reimbursement is not satisfied, then the sponsor will \nface civil penalty.\n  Under this proposed legislation, the sponsors of these new immigrants \nwould be absolved from their liability under the program. Aliens will \nno longer be supported and maintained by their sponsors and would \nbecome a charge on the public once again, a problem we sought to and \ndid remedy in 1996.\n  As we finish here tonight, we have a lot of important matters \ninvolved in this legislation, involving a lot of money. CBO estimates \nthat this provision would cost half a billion over three years. It \nspends that money by changing what I think to be a good policy by \ncreating a bad policy, a policy that will incentivize people to come to \nthe United States for free health care when they may not otherwise wish \nto come or may not otherwise benefit from coming here. We really have \nnot had the kind of debate, as a comprehensive review of welfare, that \nshould be made a part of that.\n\n  The Finance Committee will be considering welfare reform. It will be \nconsidering these issues in the months to come. They have a lot on \ntheir plate.\n  This amendment simply says let's not rush this through now. Let's not \nmove it through on this important bill that is going to move through \nCongress. Let's send it back to the Finance Committee. Let's encourage \nthem to give thoughtful and serious concern to it. Let's have them come \nforward with a program that would justify us changing this important \nrule, established in 1996.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Exports of \nMexican agricultural products to the United States increased by almost \n97 percent from 1993 to 2001. At the present time, some 78 percent of \nall agricultural products exported by Mexico are sent to the United \nStates, making the United States by far the largest market for Mexico's \nagricultural exports. Clearly, the agricultural sectors of both the \nUnited States and Mexico have on the whole profited from NAFTA. For \nthis reason, I am confounded by some of the recent actions of the \nMexican government that undermine the spirit, if not the letter, of \nNAFTA.\n  Allow me to elaborate on some of these actions. Mexico has recently \nimposed, or threatened to impose, trade barriers to a wide variety of \nU.S. agricultural products. These products include pork, beef, corn, \nhigh fructose corn syrup, rice, apples, and dry beans. Apparently \nignoring that increased competition in the Mexican market has benefited \nthat country's consumers, some in Mexico have spoken of renegotiating \nthe agriculture provisions of the NAFTA. Mexico's measures against U.S. \nagricultural products have certainly caught the attention of many \nmembers of the Senate, including me.\n  Let me explain Mexico's actions that are directly impacting producers \nin my state of Iowa.\n  I'll start with high fructose corn syrup. It's true that U.S. \nproducers of agricultural products have, on the whole, benefited from \nNAFTA. And, at one point, that was the case with U.S. producers of high \nfructose corn syrup. Mexico was formerly the largest export market for \nU.S. produced high fructose corn syrup. But in January 2002, the \nMexican Congress imposed a tax of up to 20 percent on soft drinks \ncontaining high fructose corn syrup.\n  This move was undoubtedly intended to provide Mexican sugar producers \nwith an unfair advantage in the Mexican market over U.S. high fructose \ncorn syrup producers. As a result of this discriminatory tax, U.S. \nexports of high fructose corn syrup to Mexico are now at almost zero \nlevels.\n  Mexico's high fructose corn syrup tax was imposed following WTO and \nNAFTA panel rulings that found that a 1998 Mexican antidumping order on \nU.S. high fructose corn syrup did not comply with Mexico's trade \nobligations.\n  Clearly, Mexico is going out of its way to prevent the sale of high \nfructose corn syrup in its market. Mexico's high fructose corn syrup \ntax is causing great harm to U.S. corn producers and U.S. high fructose \ncorn syrup manufacturers. The U.S. corn refining industry estimates \nthat it is losing up to $620 million annually on account of Mexico's \ndiscriminatory tax. It estimates that U.S. corn farmers are losing over \n$300 million each year due to lost sales to both U.S. and Mexican high \nfructose corn syrup producers.\n  I find it especially ironic that Mexico, a country that is actively \nseeking foreign investment, is treating so poorly the U.S. high \nfructose corn syrup industry, an industry that has invested heavily in \nMexico.\n  Based upon the promises of NAFTA, U.S. high fructose corn syrup \nproducers made major investments in the United States and Mexico. \nMexico has now pulled the rug out from under them. This certainly \nsends, at best, mixed signals to foreign investors.\n  Let me give you another example of Mexico's actions against U.S. \nagricultural products, this one impacting Iowa's pork producers. In \nJanuary of this year, Mexico initiated an antidumping investigation on \nU.S.-produced pork. The petition that initiated this investigation has \nserious deficiencies. for example, the petition was filed by Mexican \nhog producers, not pork processors, so it is my understanding that the \nparty bringing the case lacks standing under the Antidumping Agreement \nof the WTO.\n  While Mexico's antidumping investigation on pork is ongoing, I \nrecognize that Mexican officials last month terminated the Mexican \nantidumping order on imports of live hogs from the United States. I am \npleased with Mexico's decision regarding the live hog order. I strongly \nhope that this decision provides an indication that Mexican officials \nwill act reasonably and not impose an antidumping order on U.S. pork.\n  But there are other problems. Large quantities of U.S.-produced pork \nhave been rejected at the Mexican borer during the past year due to \nalleged sanitary problems. But millions of Americans consume U.S.-\nproduced pork each day, and we know that this product is safe. Mexico's \nrejection of U.S. pork for non-scientific reasons violates Mexico's WTO \nobligations.\n  Iowa's beef producers are also being harmed by Mexico's actions. In \nApril 2000, Mexico imposed antidumping duties on imports of U.S. beef, \nand this trade measure remains in place. Mexico's investigation \nresulted in numerous probable violations of Mexico's commitments under \nthe WTO Agreements. On June 16, the U.S. Trade Representative announced \nthat the United States is filing a case at the WTO over Mexico's \nantidumping order. I fully support the U.S. trade Representatives's \nactions at the WTO regarding this matter.\n  Despite the ongoing Mexican antidumping order on U.S. beef, Mexican \ncattle producers earlier this year filed a safeguard petition on beef \nfrom the United States.\n  Mexican officials have neither confirmed nor denied the existence of \nthis petition. Lack of certainty with regard to this safeguard petition \nhas made it even more difficult for the U.S. cattle and beef industry \nto plan sales in Mexico.\n\n[[Page S8427]]\n\n  White corn producers in Iowa are also threatened by potential Mexican \ntrade actions. Mexican officials are hinting at initiating a safeguard \ninvestigation on imports of U.S. white corn. In addition, these \nofficials have suggested limiting import permits for white corn for \nperiods of short supply. Such a policy would not comport with Mexico's \nNAFTA obligations.\n  Mexico's actions, and threatened actions, against U.S. agricultural \nproducts such as high fructose corn syrup, pork, beef, and white corn \nare having real effects on U.S. producers. Sales in Mexico are being \nlost or threatened. Uncertainty is making it difficult for U.S. \nproducers to plan for future sales in Mexico.\n  But Mexico's actions are having a broader effect than lost sales. \nMexico's policies are indirectly threatening the entire U.S. trade \nagenda.\n  Most of U.S. agriculture was solidly behind the passage of the NAFTA. \nBut with Mexico failing to abide fully with its NAFTA commitments, many \nU.S. producers are beginning to question the worth of trade agreements.\n  If America's farmers and ranchers back away from their strong support \nfor new trade agreements, the U.S. trade agenda will lose its biggest \nproponents. And if the United States falters in its support for trade \nliberalization, the whole world will suffer.\n  Given the importance of maintaining the U.S. trade agenda, I urge the \nadministration to make the removal of Mexican barriers to U.S. \nagricultural products a top priority. The U.S. Government must not \noverlook systematic efforts by Mexico to keep U.S. farm products out of \nthe Mexican market in disregard of Mexico's international trade \ncommitments.\n  Finally, I urge Mexican officials to think twice about the effects of \ntheir decisions involving U.S. agricultural products. Mexico's actions \nare threatening that country's trade relations with its largest export \nmarket. Damaged trade relations between the United States and Mexico \nare certainly not in the best interests of either country.\n  NAFTA can, and will, continue to provide great benefits to farmers, \nranchers, and consumers on either side of the border. But this trade \nagreement will work only if all parties to it abide by their NAFTA \ncommitments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       IMMIGRATION AND DRUG COSTS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, one of the most fascinating aspects of \nthis job in the Senate is the myriad of issues that come before us in \nthe course of a day or week. If you followed over the last few moments \nthe two speakers--one from Alabama and one from Iowa--they both were \nspeaking about related issues.\n  My friend from Iowa and I share an interest in agriculture. His State \nand mine lead the Nation in the production of corn and soybeans, and \nnaturally we try to export our goods to expand our trade. And he is \nconcerned--and I share his concern--about Mexico. We both voted for the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement in the belief of opening up--and it \nhas opened up--trade substantially between these two neighboring \ncountries, the United States and Mexico. But we have run into some \nproblems here, problems related to corn, as my colleague from Iowa \nnoted, whether we can export white corn to Mexico, which, of course, is \na major staple of their diet, being the basis for tortillas, part of \nthe Mexican cuisine, and also whether we can export a product made from \ncorn called high fructose sweetener.\n  For people who may not be familiar with that term, trust me, \nvirtually every soft drink that you consume in America has high \nfructose sweetener in it rather than sugar. We want to sell it in \nMexico, and they do not want us to sell it there. Frankly, they want to \nexport more sugar to the United States.\n  So this trade battle is on. The Senator from Iowa is right, this has \nbeen going on too long, and it has to come to an end.\n  I would say to our friends in Mexico--and they are our friends and \nallies and neighbors--we have to resolve this.\n  We have to resolve it equitably and honorably, but it has to be done \nwith dispatch. So I certainly support what the Senator from Iowa said.\n  Now, before he spoke, the Senator from Alabama got up to speak about \nimmigration. And here is the story, as I see it, related to this trade \nissue.\n  If the farmers in Mexico--who are struggling to grow their crops, \nwith much less efficiency and productivity than the farmers in the \nUnited States--are unsuccessful in their farms, many of them move to \nthe city. It is very common. It happens throughout the developing \ncountries of the world. If they move to the large cities in Mexico and \nthey cannot find a way to sustain their families, there is an \nalternative: El Norte. They head north. And we have seen a dramatic \nmigration from Mexico to the United States.\n  In the last 10 years, my State of Illinois has seen a substantial \nincrease in the Mexican-American population. I know it; I see it; I \nfeel it. It is now part of our life in Illinois. The people who have \ncome here I have found overwhelmingly to be some of the finest people I \nhave ever had a chance to meet. It takes real courage to get up and \nleave your village, your family, your church, your language, your \ntradition, and to head thousands of miles north into the bitter cold, \ntrying to find a job, to make enough money to sustain yourself and \nmaybe sending back some money to your family in Mexico. Thousands have \ndone it. Many have done it undocumented and illegally, and that is \nanother issue.\n\n  I will say, it is naive for us to believe these undocumented \nimmigrants to the United States have not become an integral part of our \neconomy. They are. A leading restaurateur in Chicago said to me: If you \nremoved all of the undocumented people from the restaurants of this \ngreat city, you would have to close them down. Every time you turn \naround and see who is washing the dishes, busing the tables, doing the \nwork--some of the hardest work in my State and others--you will find a \nlot of people who are here perhaps without legal documentation.\n  A few minutes ago, the Senator from Alabama said he objected to a \nprovision in the bill we have been debating, S. 1, the prescription \ndrug bill, because this provision says that those women who are legally \nin the United States--legally in the United States--would be able to \nqualify for Medicaid coverage and their children for basic health \ninsurance coverage if a State decided to offer that coverage.\n  That is what the bill says. So if the State of Missouri or the State \nof Illinois or Iowa or Alabama says: We are not interested in offering \nMedicaid coverage to legal immigrants who have not been here 5 years--\nlegal immigrant women--then they do not have to. Twenty States have \ndecided, though, it makes good sense to go ahead and enroll these legal \nimmigrant women and their children into Medicaid at their own expense.\n  Why would a State Governor and legislature decide to pick up and \ncover these people? Well, for obvious reasons. Women who come to this \ncountry in a legal immigrant status often become pregnant and during \nthe course of that pregnancy need prenatal care. If they do not receive \nprenatal care during their pregnancy they could end up with \ncomplications in the pregnancy or some serious illness facing the \nchild.\n  Now, Governors and legislatures have said it is far better for us to \noffer prenatal care to that legal immigrant woman and her child, once \nborn, than to run the risk they are going to be unhealthy, not only for \ntheir own sakes but for the cost it would bring to society. I think \nthat is perfectly sensible.\n  The Senator from Alabama objects. He says we should not give States \nthe option to provide, with Federal assistance, that kind of medical \ncare. I think that is a mistake. I think the bill is right. The bill \nunderstands that these women, during their pregnancy, are carrying \nfuture American citizens. Those babies, once born on our soil, are \ncitizens.\n  Is it important for us to make sure--or do the best we can to make \nsure--those mothers are healthy and the babies are healthy. Well, if \nnot for the sake of humanity, certainly from an economic point of view \nit is. A sick baby is not only a family tragedy, it becomes a social \ncost. So this bill, by giving to States the option of offering Medicaid \nto legal immigrant women and health insurance to their children,\n\n[[Page S8428]]\n\nonce born, I think just makes common sense.\n  It will be interesting to watch the vote tomorrow to see how many \nSenators in this Chamber, who feel very strongly about the so-called \npro-life position, who want to make certain that we avoid abortions and \nthat we honor the children who are being born, join the Senator from \nAlabama in denying prenatal care to legal immigrant women and denying \ntheir babies, once born, health insurance.\n  I would think it is obvious, whatever your position on the issue of \nabortion, that if you believe in families, you would vote against the \namendment by the Senator from Alabama.\n  Let me just say very briefly, when I was a young student, I read a \nSherlock Holmes book that I still remember. It was entitled ``The Dog \nThat Didn't Bark.'' Sherlock Holmes solved this mystery by not hearing \nsomething but by realizing that he hadn't heard something. The \nwitnesses to this crime had not heard a dog bark. And that was an \nimportant piece of evidence for him to determine what happened that led \nup to the actual murder.\n  The reason I remembered that is I am listening carefully to this \nnational debate on the floor of the Senate about a prescription drug \nbill. I am waiting for the barking of the pharmaceutical lobby. Where \nare the drug companies? Why haven't we heard from the drug companies?\n  This is a bill that will affect some 40 million senior citizens and \nprovide assistance for them to pay their prescription drug bills, and \nthe drug companies are silent. Why? There are two reasons for it.\n  First, they believe the passage of a Federal prescription drug \nbenefit is going to reduce the likelihood that more and more States \nwill establish their own State prescription drug plans, bringing down \nthe cost of prescription drugs in each State. I commend to those who \nfollow it a ``Frontline'' program of last week on public television \nthat analyzed this.\n  As the States of Maine and Oregon and my State of Illinois and others \ndeveloped prescription drug plans, the pharmaceutical industry \nchallenged them in court, particularly in the case of Maine, and lost \nthe challenge.\n  So it was at that point that they became more intent on seeing us \npass a prescription drug benefit on a national level to try to diffuse \nthis growing public sentiment against increasing drug prices and the \ngrowing public sentiment that local and State legislatures had to act \non this because the Congress was inept, unable to do it.\n  So we have this bill before us that is one of the reasons why the \npharmaceutical lobby has been strangely silent during this debate. They \nare happy that we are considering a Federal prescription drug benefit \nprogram.\n  The second reason is even more important. This bill, S. 1, before us \nnow for consideration, is a pretty long bill. As a matter of fact, it \nis 654 pages long. You will have to search this bill line by line and \npage by page and I am afraid you will find that after that search, \nthere are few, if any, efforts in this entire bill to control the \nrunaway cost of prescription drugs. So the pharmaceutical companies see \nthis as a win/win situation. We pass a national prescription drug \nprogram that takes the heat off the States, and at the same time we do \nnothing to reduce the cost of prescription drugs to seniors and others \nacross America. So these already very successful companies have to view \nthis as the greatest windfall that has ever come their way.\n  The Federal Government will pay a percentage of the cost of \nprescription drugs, but the Federal Government will do little or \nnothing to control the cost of those drugs.\n  The senior citizens of this country understand this issue far better \nthan Members of the Senate. In fact, when they were recently asked the \nquestion: What is more important to you, to provide a prescription drug \nbenefit under Medicare to help you pay for your prescription drugs or \nto establish a policy and program that will bring down the excessive \ncosts and the increasing rise in cost of prescription drugs across the \nNation, by a margin of almost 2 to 1, they said go after the cost of \nthe drugs. Don't tell me how much you are going to give me if you are \nnot going to control the cost.\n\n  Last year, the cost of prescription drugs went up 10 percent in my \nState of Illinois. Nationally, the figures are higher. If those \nincreases continue, no matter what we pass this week in the Senate, it \nwill not be enough. The cost of drugs will go off the end of the chart, \nand private insurance companies, HMOs that are being lauded by \nconservatives, by the President, and the White House as the answer to \nour prayers, frankly, don't have the interest or the power to make a \ndifference in the cost of these prescription drugs. So the seniors will \nfind themselves at the end of the day with a very limited benefit from \nthis program.\n  But hope is on the way. Tomorrow I will be offering an amendment \nwhich is a dramatically different approach to dealing with prescription \ndrugs. We are going to make cost containment part of our prescription \ndrug program. We are going to follow the model of the Veterans' \nAdministration which said, in serving the millions of America's \nveterans, drug companies had to give a discount to the Veterans' \nAdministration on the drugs that were provided, and the drug companies \ndid--a discount of 40 to 50 percent. This isn't radical or innovative. \nIt is a fact. This is what is happening.\n  We believe using the same logic and the same Government effort to \nbring competition and lower costs under my amendment will mean that \ndrug costs will start coming down and this program will go a lot \nfurther in helping seniors. And once the drug costs start coming down, \nlet me tell you what we can do: This bill does not guarantee a monthly \npremium for prescription drug benefits. It suggests $35 a month. But I \nthink the sponsors will tell you, there is no guarantee that it won't \nbe $50 or $75 a month for this prescription drug program being offered \nby HMOs and private insurance companies under the Grassley-Baucus bill.\n  Under MediSAVE, which is my alternative plan, we mandate a $35-a-\nmonth maximum monthly premium. Second, there is a $275 deductible \nbefore anybody can get the first dollar in Government benefits under \nthe Grassley-Baucus bill. Under the amendment I will offer, there is no \ndeductible. Third, under the Grassley-Baucus bill, they will pay 50 \npercent of the cost of prescription drugs after the deductible is \napplied. Under the MediSAVE Program, which I am going to introduce, it \nis 70 percent.\n  How can I offer all this? How can I offer a program that has no gap \nin coverage so that it continues to cover you right up to a $5,000 \nannual cost in drugs and then you switch over to catastrophic coverage? \nHow can I do all this? Because I go after the price of the drugs. The \nunderlying bill doesn't touch the cost of drugs. As a result, $400 \nbillion, as large a sum as that may sound, does not go very far. When \nwe bring in cost containment, we can offer a real prescription drug \nprogram.\n  And there is one more thing. The amendment I will offer will allow \nMedicare itself to compete with the private insurance companies. I have \nlistened carefully to the debate for the last week or so. I can tell \nyou that most of my Republican friends are loathe to concede the \nobvious. There is no private insurance company that can effectively \ncompete with Medicare when it comes to offering prescription \ndrug benefits. Why? Because Medicare doesn't have a profit motive. \nMedicare has a low overhead. Medicare can bargain on behalf of millions \nof seniors to get a formulary or a list of drugs at discount prices.\n\n  These private insurance companies cannot do any of those things. They \nare out for the profit. They have high administrative costs, and they \nwon't have the power to bargain down the price of the cost of the \ndrugs. So by putting Medicare in the mix, saying every senior can \nalways turn to the Medicare prescription drug program, we have real \nchoice and real competition and a real scare for the Republicans who \nbelieve that competition only involves private insurance companies. \nThey don't want a Government agency competing with them.\n  The amendment I will offer tomorrow has been endorsed by a number of \nmy colleagues on this side of the aisle, as well as the AFL-CIO, the \nUnited Auto Workers, a variety of unions across the United States, as \nwell as senior citizens organizations. They understand this is a real \nprescription drug benefit program that tries to keep the costs\n\n[[Page S8429]]\n\nunder control and makes sure we maximize the benefits to seniors across \nthe United States.\n  It will be interesting to note the vote tomorrow. I believe there \nhave been clear indications that many people here are not going to do \nanything to ruffle the feathers of the drug companies and \npharmaceutical lobby. I hope they will keep in mind that the senior \ncitizens they represent understand full well that these drug companies \nare the most profitable companies in America.\n  They can bring down costs. They have done it in Canada and in other \ncountries. They can still make enough profit to reward shareholders for \ntheir risk and have money left to invest in research. I hope this \nMediSAVE amendment will have the positive response of my colleagues \ntomorrow when it is offered on the floor.\n  I am prepared to yield the floor at this time, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/24/senate-section/article/S8429-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8429-S8431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PRESCRIPTION DRUG AND MEDICARE IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2003--Continued\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as we bring this very busy day to a close, \nI wish to reflect on where we are with this very historic bill that \nwill provide prescription drugs and, at the same time, strengthen and \nimprove Medicare for our seniors and individuals with disabilities.\n  It is a historic week in many ways, but primarily because we will \naccomplish something that many thought would be impossible even a \ncouple of months ago that will benefit America's seniors; historic \nbecause during this week, both Houses will likely pass the first major \nreform of Medicare in the almost 40 years of that program's existence.\n  Thanks to the strong leadership of President Bush, as well as the \nbipartisan support of this body, I am optimistic that by the end of \nthis week, we will have added a $400 billion prescription drug benefit \nfor our deserving seniors for their health care security. And indeed, \nit has been a long time in coming. A lot of us have talked about it, \nhave known we should move in that direction, and now after a lot of \nparticipation we will be able to deliver on that for which we have all \nworked so hard. Both parties have promised action in the past. \nAmerica's seniors have demanded it. Indeed, America's seniors deserve \nit.\n  As part of this current legislation, not a lot has been said on this \nparticular aspect of it, so I do want to mention it. Within 8 months or \n9 months after the President signs the final product of our \ndiscussions, when he signs this bill, seniors will have access to a \nprescription drug card that will provide immediate savings for them. \nThis is an important interim move that allows us to say to seniors: \nHelp is, indeed, on the way.\n  During this period of time of a year and a half or a couple years \nwhile they have that prescription drug card, we will be constructing \nthe appropriate infrastructure to provide that prescription drug \nbenefit for that population that wishes to stay in traditional Medicare \nor that population that wishes to take advantage of a new, transformed \ntype of Medicare that will allow continuous, ongoing quality care in a \nmore seamless fashion, a fashion that will involve preventive medicine \nand chronic disease management, as well as prescription drugs.\n  The great aspect about what we are doing, at the same time we are \noffering this new benefit of prescription drugs, which our seniors \ndeserve, is that we are modernizing the Medicare Program, strengthening \nit, improving it in a way that can be sustained long term, and \nhopefully there will even be some cost savings in the future, but at \nthe same time I am absolutely positively sure that the quality of care \nwill be better. I say that because of this focus on preventive \nmedicine, chronic disease management, and overall disease management \nwhich is simply not provided in traditional Medicare.\n  I wish to list a couple of principles.\n  First, individual choice versus a one-size-fits-all system. Seniors, \nfor the first time, will be given an opportunity to choose the health \ncare coverage which will best meet their individual needs. It is very \ndifferent from the one-size-fits-all type program that is provided \ntoday.\n  Second, private sector competition versus Government price setting. \nPrivate insurers--I mention private insurers and private plans because \nwe hear a lot today from certain think tanks that not very much is new \nin this bill. There is not very much reform, there is not very much \nmodernization.\n\n  My simple response to them is, yes, there is a new entitlement in \nterms of this drug benefit, but it is going to be delivered 100 percent \nthrough the private sector, through private plans. Yes, regulated by \nGovernment, but the entities, the mechanisms of delivering these \nprescription drugs, whether it is in a freestanding plan or part of the \ntraditional Medicare+Choice or part of a new PPO system, are 100 \npercent competitively bid with market-based principles.\n  That allows us to step back and say: Yes, there is something new that \nover the long haul, if carried out well, if appropriately structured, \nwill allow seniors to have better value, a higher quality of care for \nthe same input, the same amount of money that is spent.\n  So this market-based competition is important and, I would argue, is \nvery important to the long-term sustainability of the program because \nof this huge demographic shift of the doubling of the number of \nseniors.\n  Third, innovation versus bureaucratic delays. The participation of \nprivate health plans in Medicare will help ensure up-to-date coverage. \nBecause Medicare is so rigid, it takes a long time for Medicare to \nincorporate innovation, new technology, new and better ways of doing \nthings. When you have Government bureaucrats making the decisions or \npoliticians or political figures deciding what is covered and what is \nnot, it simply takes a longer time than occurs in the more responsive \nprivate sector.\n  Four, long-term savings versus spiraling costs. There is a lot of \ndebate in this Chamber, but I would argue, consistent with what the \nMedicare actuaries tell us, that the most efficient private plans today \nhave the potential for beating Medicare costs by as much as 2.3 \npercent. Compounded over time, that can result in significant cost \nsavings to the program. Thus, for the same input of dollars, you will \nhave better output, better care delivered, and better quality of care.\n  The final point I will close with is regulatory relief versus the \nredtape of bureaucracy that is so characteristic of our Medicare system \ntoday. In this bill, there are several rulemaking and regulatory relief \nchanges for health care providers that will allow them to focus on what \nthey should be doing; that is, providing that clinical care, that \npatient care, instead of filling out paperwork or spending a lot of \ntime on redtape activity.\n  A recent study by Price Waterhouse estimated that for every hour in \nthe emergency room, there are about 30 minutes of paperwork required by \nemergency personnel. There is just no reason for that today, and this \nbill helps address that regulatory relief.\n  So a new benefit, individual choice, market-based competition, rapid \nassimilation of new technology, as well as new medicines, long-term \nsavings, relief from this red tape, health security for seniors, that \nis what this bill is all about.\n\n\n                            vote explanation\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I regret that due to a previously \nscheduled White House event celebrating Black Music History Month, I \nwas unable to cast a vote on Amendment No. 1002 offered by my friend, \nMr. Lautenberg. I would like the Record to reflect that had I been \npresent, I would have voted against the amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, as we move forward with debate on \nMedicare prescription drugs, it is important to recognize that this \nbill does very little to address the unrestrained costs of prescription \ndrugs. I find it disconcerting that as we are discussing one of the \nmost major public program expansions of all time, we have neglected to \nhave a real discussion about how to ensure that taxpayers get the\n\n[[Page S8430]]\n\nmost bang for their buck in this program, and that seniors who will \nhave significant cost sharing responsibilities have as minimal a burden \nas possible.\n  For many years, I have been a strong advocate for implementing \nreforms to reduce prescription drug costs for consumers in this \ncountry. I believe one way to do that is through increasing consumers' \naccess to approved, safe and affordable generic prescription drugs. \nLast week the Senate passed an amendment that would accomplish this \nvery goal. I was pleased to see that the Gregg-Schumer-McCain-Kennedy \namendment passed the Senate with wide bipartisan support and I want to \nthank my colleagues for their dedication and hard work on this issue. \nThis represents one encouraging step towards leveling the playing field \nand ensuring that prescription drug costs under this program are indeed \nreasonable.\n  The generics amendment, which I have cosponsored along with many of \nmy colleagues will allow generic drug companies to compete with brand-\nname manufactures by clearing the major obstacles that delay generic \ndrug approval. The act levels the playing field for generic drug makers \nto better compete against large, brand-name manufacturers, and it \nrepresents a bold step in putting consumer health and savings first. \nThe legislation seeks to bolster the Hatch-Waxman Act passed in 1984, \nwhich promoted the growth of the generic drug industry. Loopholes in \nthe patent laws, which benefited brand-name drug manufacturers, \nprohibited the bill from ever realizing its full potential.\n  Efforts to promote the value of generic drugs are competing with some \npowerful forces, such as direct-to-consumer advertising and the \nunwillingness of many doctors to prescribe generic drugs more \nregularly. However, I believe this amendment, along with greater public \neducation efforts directed at consumers and doctors about the \neffectiveness of safe and approved generic drugs, will go a long way \ntowards improving greater access and utilization of generic \nprescription drugs.\n  I will continue to fight for lower prescription drug costs and will \noppose any efforts that would deny generic drugs equal access into the \nmarket. With the enactment of this amendment, we are one major step \ncloser to achieving this goal and I hope the House will follow suit and \nmake similar provisions a part of shier Medicare prescription drug \nlegislation. Passage of the generics amendment paved the way, but we \nmust not stop here. We must continue the discussion and debate on the \ncost containment of prescription drugs under this program and I urge my \ncolleagues to support all amendments that work towards that goal.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I would like to join my distinguished \ncolleague from Iowa as a cosponsor of the ``Money Follows the Person \nAmendment'' to the Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of \n2003.\n  This amendment would authorize the 2004 ``Money Follows the Person'' \ninitiative in Medicaid, a part of the President's New Freedom \nInitiative to integrate people with disabilities into the communities \nwhere they live.\n  This amendment would create a 5-year program to help States move \npeople with disabilities out of institutional settings and into their \ncommunities. For example, under this legislation, Oregon's effort to \nhelp an individual move out of an institutional care facility and into \na community home would be 100 percent federally funded for 1 year. \nAfter that first year, the Federal Government would pay its usual rate. \nUnder the provisions of this amendment, States like Oregon can take \nadvantage of $350 million dollars of Federal assistance for 5 years for \na total of $1.75 billion.\n  This amendment is important to the disabled community for several \nreasons. First, by supporting States' efforts to help Americans who \nhave been needlessly placed in institutional settings move into \ncommunity settings, this amendment will help States increase access to \nhome and community-based support for people with disabilities.\n  Second, by assisting the movement of people who are not best served \nby an institution into a community care facility, this amendment gives \nthem the freedom to make choices. Too often, Americans with \ndisabilities are unable to take advantage of opportunities others take \nfor granted--to choose where they want to live, when to visit family \nand friends, and to be active members of their communities.\n  Finally, this amendment would help States comply with the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act. As my colleagues in the Senate are well aware, \nwe are nearing the 13th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct and of the Olmstead Supreme Court decision. That decision ruled \nthat needless institutionalization of Americans with disabilities \nconstitutes discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this \nimportant amendment and to support the freedom of choice for Americans \nwith disabilities.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 974\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last November, the Drug Competition Act \npassed the Senate by unanimous consent. This morning, I am proud to \njoin Senator Grassley, along with Senators Cantwell, Durbin, Feingold, \nKohl, and Schumer in offering our bill as an amendment to the \nPrescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003, S. 1, I hope \nthat in this Congress it is actually enacted into law as part of the \nlarger effort to improve the health care of millions of Americans. \nPrescription drug prices are rapidly increasing, and are a source of \nconsiderable concern to many Americans, especially senior citizens and \nfamilies. Generic drug prices can be as much as 80 percent lower than \nthe comparable brand-name version.\n  While the Drug Competition Act is small in terms of length, it is \nlarge in terms of impact. It will ensure that law enforcement agencies \ncan take quick and decisive action against companies that are driven \nmore by greed than by good sense. It gives the Federal Trade Commission \nand the Justice Department access to information about secret deals \nbetween drug companies that keep generic drugs off the market. This is \na practice that hurts American families, particularly senior citizens, \nby denying them access to low-cost generic drugs, and further inflating \nmedical costs.\n  Last fall, the Federal Trade Commission released a comprehensive \nreport on barriers to the entry of generic drugs into the \npharmaceutical marketplace. The FTC had two recommendations to improve \nthe current situation and to close the loopholes in the law that allow \ndrug manufacturers to manipulate the timing of generics' introduction \nto the market. One of those recommendations was simply to enact our \nbill, as the most effective solution to the problem of ``sweetheart'' \ndeals between brand name and generic drug manufacturers that keep \ngeneric drugs off the market, thus depriving consumers of the benefits \nof quality drugs at lower prices. Indeed, at a hearing just yesterday \nin the Judiciary Committee, Chairman Timothy Muris of the FTC praised \nthe Drug Competition Act in his testimony, and urged its passage. In \nshort, this bill enjoys the unqualified endorsement of the current FTC, \nwhich follows on the support by the Clinton administration's FTC during \nthe initial stages of our formulation of this bill. We can all have \nevery confidence in the common sense approach that our bill takes to \nensuring that our law enforcement agencies have the information they \nneed to take quick action, if necessary, to protect consumers from drug \ncompanies that abuse the law.\n  Under current law, the first generic manufacturer that gets \npermission to sell a generic drug before the patent on the brand-name \ndrug expires enjoys protection from competition for 180 days--a head \nstart on other generic companies. That was a good idea--but the \nunfortunate loophole exploited by a few is that secret deals can be \nmade that allow the manufacturer of the generic drug to claim the 180-\nday grace period--to block other generic drugs from entering the \nmarket--while, at the same time, getting paid by the brand-name \nmanufacturer not to sell the generic drug.\n  Our legislation closes this loophole for those who want to cheat the \npublic but keeps the system the same for companies engaged in true \ncompetition. I think it is important for Congress not to overreact and \nthrow out\n\n[[Page S8431]]\n\nthe good with the bad. Most generic companies want to take advantage of \nthis 180-day provision and deliver quality generic drugs at much lower \ncosts for consumers. We should not eliminate the incentive for them. \nInstead, we should let the FTC and Justice look at every deal that \ncould lead to abuse, so that only the deals that are consistent with \nthe intent of that law will be allowed to stand. The Drug Competition \nAct accomplishes precisely that goal, and helps ensure effective and \ntimely access to generic pharmaceuticals that can lower the cost of \nprescription drugs for seniors, for families, and for all of us.\n  The effects of this amendment will only benefit the effort to bring \nquality health care at lower costs to more of our citizens. The Drug \nCompetition Act enjoyed the unqualified support of the Senate last \nyear, and I hope my colleagues will recognize that it fits well within \nthe framework of the Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of \n2003. It will do nothing to disrupt the balance struck in the larger \nbill, while aiding the ultimate goal of that legislation. I urge all \nSenators to embrace this effort on behalf of Medicare recipients, and \nof all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/24/senate-section/article/S8431-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I rise this evening to pay tribute to one \nof Georgia's finest, one of this Nation's finest. I pay tribute to the \nlife and legacy of former mayor of Atlanta, Maynard Jackson. In a city \nknown for its great civil rights leaders, Maynard Jackson was truly one \nof the greatest. The people of Atlanta and Georgia have lost one of our \nstrongest and most articulate fighters. Indeed, the State of Georgia \ntonight is mourning the passing of one of our greatest citizens.\n  Maynard Jackson was such a positive presence in all that has happened \nin Atlanta and in Georgia over the past 30 years that I simply cannot \nimagine what our city and our State would be like if he had not come \nour way.\n  His impact stretched far beyond the red clay hills of Georgia. He \ntouched the lives of many people all around this world. For me, Maynard \nJackson was a good friend, a friend whose counsel I always sought \nbecause I knew he would give it to me straight. In Atlanta the City \nHall and the State Capitol are right across the street from each other. \nHe and I crossed that street to talk on many occasions.\n  Maynard's rise to prominence began at an early age. As a child \nprodigy he entered Morehouse College at age 14. He graduated in 1956 \nwith a bachelor's degree of political science and history. In 1964 he \ngraduated from North Carolina Central University Law School. Maynard \nthen returned to Atlanta as an attorney for the National Labor \nRelations Board followed by a time at the Emory Community Legal \nServices Center where he provided legal counsel for low-income \nAtlantans.\n  He ran for the Senate in 1968 and lost. But we all knew at that time \nthe world would come to know the voice of this very remarkable, \narticulate, and passionate young man. In 1973, at the age of 35, he \nbecame mayor of Atlanta after winning nearly 60 percent of the vote in \na runoff against incumbent mayor Sam Massell. This great-grandson of \nslaves served 12 years as mayor of the South's largest city. His tenure \nsaw the construction of what would become the world's busiest airport, \nHartsfield International.\n  He was a fierce advocate for those who thought they were forgotten. \nHe became their voice. In him, they found a great fighter.\n  The New York Times wrote of Maynard's tenure as mayor it created ``a \npolitical revolution in the heart of the South. Seemingly overnight, it \ntransformed Atlanta into a mecca for talented, aspiring blacks from all \nacross the country.''\n  The Washington Post described Maynard's impact this way:\n\n       African Americans around the country looked at Jackson's \n     win . . . and saw even greater possibilities. If they did it \n     in Atlanta in the heart of the Confederacy, they could do it \n     at home, too . . .\n\n  Vernon Jordan, himself a native of Atlanta, said his most dramatic \nawareness the South had changed and the city of Atlanta had changed was \nthe day Maynard took the oath of office as mayor of Atlanta. Vernon \nsaid it was an unforgettable moment.\n  As the angels now sing the praises of Maynard Jackson on the other \nside of that river, I join the chorus of those who yet remain in \nglorious song to this glorious individual, his life and legacy truly an \nexample for all of us. And he will not be forgotten anytime soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/24/senate-section/article/S8431-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8431-S8432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING THE STUDENTS OF EUREKA, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an outstanding \nachievement of the town of Eureka, SD. Eureka has the honor of being \nthe only South Dakota town where three students have won the National \nDiscover Card Tribute Award Scholarship.\n  The Discover Card Tribute Award Scholarship is awarded each year to 9 \noutstanding high school juniors in each state and the District of \nColumbia. These students are selected based on their leadership skills, \nspecial talents, personal obstacles, and commitment to community \nservice.\n  In South Dakota, the state winners for 2003 hail from such cities as \nAberdeen, Brookings, Eureka, Milbank, Presho, Salem, Sioux Falls, and \nSturgis. Out of these winners, the top three students are selected to \ncompete with students from across the country for 9 national-level \nscholarships, and it is in this category that the town of Eureka has \nexcelled.\n  Since the award was first created 12 years ago, only 4 South Dakotans \nhave won at the national level, beginning with Lori Heilman Leidholt of \nBowdle, South Dakota, in 1994. The other 3 come from Eureka.\n  Sarah Anderson won her scholarship in 2000. Sarah is an award-winning \nphotographer and a tireless advocate for diabetes education. Her \nrenowned kitten calendars sell throughout the state and help raise \nfunds for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation.\n  As a diabetic herself, she is able to draw from her own experiences \nas she speaks with adults and children across South Dakota about the \ndisease. In 1999, she successfully lobbied the South Dakota Legislature \nto enact legislation expanding health insurance coverage for diabetic \nsupplies and equipment.\n  Loni Schumacher was next in 2002. A member of her local chapter of \nFamily, Career and Community Leaders of America, she was selected to \nvisit Japan in 2001 on a 6-week exchange.\n  An only child, she has since adopted ``sisters'' from across the \nglobe. Experiencing a new culture broadened her view of the world, and \nshe has brought those ideals back home to Eureka where she and her \nfamily have opened their family farm to exchange students from Brazil \nand Germany.\n  Loni has also been closely involved in her school's ``Teens Against \nTobacco Use'' organization, and teaches elementary school students \nabout the hazards of tobacco use.\n  Amanda Imberi is Eureka's winner for 2003. I had the honor of meeting \nthis young woman when I visited Eureka several weeks ago. Just last \nweek, here in Washington, I presented her with the 2003 Tradition of \nCaring Jefferson Award.\n  At the age of 9, Amanda lost her mother to cancer. She had to grow up \nfaster than any child should.\n  Even with all of her schoolwork, cooking, and managing the family's \nfinances, she has still found the time to be active with the American \nCancer Society, speaking at rallies across the state on the importance \nof cancer awareness and prevention, as well as producing a variety show \nstyle fundraiser at her high school.\n  Two more Eureka students have won the scholarship at the state \nlevel--John Ostrowski in 1997 and Alisha Lutz in 1998. For a town of \napproximately 1,200 people, that is a remarkable achievement. It is not \nonly an indication of the desire to succeed shared by these students, \nit is also a testament to the quality of teachers and schools that \nproduced such outstanding young adults.\n  I don't know what they are putting in the water in Eureka but, \nwhatever it is, I hope they continue. These young\n\n[[Page S8432]]\n\npeople are an inspiration to their communities and their fellow \nstudents. They have proven there is no obstacle you cannot overcome, \nand that you should always pursue your dreams.\n  I commend them and the entire town of Eureka for their achievement, \nand hope to see even more Discover Card Tribute Award winners from \nSouth Dakota in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/24/senate-section/article/S8432-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING COURTNEY STADD\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to a moment of the Senate's \ntime to recognize someone who has served our Nation with great dignity, \nhumility and energy. For more than two decades, Mr. Courtney Stadd has \nworked tirelessly to secure America's future in technology, \naeronautics, and space. His leadership as a team builder, policymaker, \nentrepreneur, and senor administration official are evidenced around \nthis city, our Nation and in the horizons that surround the Earth.\n  In my home State of Alaska, Mr. Stadd helped guide the construction \nof Kenai and the Alaskan Spaceport Authority. As a board member, he \nplayed a critical role in enabling America's newest spaceport to serve \nthe well-being of commercial, public sector, and military interests.\n  As a member of the Reagan and Bush administrations he was an active \nvoice and proponent for creating commercial markets in geospatial \nimagery, launch services, information technology and other critical \nsectors that will advance America's economic far into the 21st century.\n  In his service to this President, Mr. Stadd led the transition team \nfor NASA and ultimately assumed the role of National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration, NASA, Chief of Staff/White House Liaison. In this \nrole, he served then administrator, Mr. Dan Goldin--working to support \nmissions and nationwide personnel through the September 11th attacks \nand anthrax threat, which struck NASA Headquarters, just blocks away \nfrom this very body. He served Administrator Goldin until the end of \nhis tenure in November 2001 and provided for a smooth and orderly \ntransition for NASA's current administrator, my friend, Mr. Sean \nO'Keefe.\n  During his transition into NASA, Administrator O'Keefe found a valued \npartner and ally to support his vision and charge for fundamental \nmanagement and financial reform within the agency. He asked Courtney to \nlead the Freedom to Manage Initiative, which focused on empowering \nNASA's extraordinary workforce to identify policies and regulations \nthat impeded performance. The administrator also took advantage of \nStadd's distinguished commercial background and asked for his \nassistance in restructuring NASA's accounting systems and management \nstrategies. Both efforts have put NASA on solid ground and will enable \nthe agency that revealed the secrets of the heavens to once again soar \nwithout abandon.\n  His service to this administrator and its workforce know no boundary \nand for that reason, Mr. O'Keefe called upon Courtney's talents and \nenergies for support during the Columbia accident and its subsequent \ninvestigation. His care for the crew, their families, and the entire \nNASA workforce truly distinguished itself during some very challenging \ndays.\n  As my words have chronicled, Courtney Stadd has been a faithful and \nvaluable colleague for Administrator O'Keefe and the NASA workforce to \ndepend upon. He has been a model to his peers and colleagues at NASA, \nthe aerospace community and throughout the administration of integrity \nand poise in service to the American public. We are blessed in a Nation \nas bountiful as this one to have people such as him who take upon the \ncloak of public service and perform so admirably.\n  In the coming days, Mr. Stadd will be departing from his position at \nNASA to return to private life. As he leaves public service, the \nMembers of this body and administration should pause to recognize him \nfor his distinguished service. He has contributed much in his \ndistinguished career to better America and I am greatful to honor him \ntoday.\n  I wish him well in all of his endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/24/senate-section/article/S8432-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8432-S8433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SUPREME COURT DECISION IN MICHIGAN\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in praise of yesterday's Supreme \nCourt decision in the Michigan case--the most important affirmative \naction case in a generation. I along with 11 of my colleagues--Senators \nDaschle, Kennedy, Clinton, Corzine, Edwards, Feingold, Kerry, Landrieu, \nLautenberg, Schumer, and Stabenow--filed an amicus brief in support of \nthe university's affirmative action programs.\n  I am disappointed that the Court struck down the undergraduate \nadmissions program, but I believe that the opinion upholding the law \nschool program represents a significant victory for affirmative action \nand for America.\n  The Court's decision reaffirms the compelling interest in racial and \nethnic diversity--universities may continue to include race as one \nfactor among many when selecting its students. Diversity programs \npromote the integration and full participation of all groups in our \nsociety. The core holding of Grutter v. Bollinger, the law school case, \nand Gratz v. Bollinger, the undergraduate case, boils down to this: \nuniversities must look at each applicant individually.\n  Michigan Law School's program was upheld because the law school \nperforms an individualized consideration of every applicant. Race is \nconsidered, but not in a mechanical manner. The University of \nMichigan's undergraduate program was struck down because the Court said \nits point system was too rigid and too mechanical. The bottom line is \nthat university affirmative action--when done right--is alive and well \nin America. Not surprisingly, the law school opinion was 5-4 and, not \nsurprisingly, Justice O'Connor was the swing vote. She has been the \ncrucial swing vote in so many important Supreme Court cases over the \npast 20 years that she is now routinely referred to as ``the most \npowerful jurist in America,'' and indeed, as ``the most powerful woman \nin America.'' Both descriptions may well be true.\n  I would like to briefly discuss what I think are the three most \nimportant aspects of yesterday's decision.\n  First, the Court set out a clear roadmap for affirmative action. The \nquestion is no longer whether race can be used to further diversity, \nbut how it can be used. The majority of universities are already \npracticing affirmative action the right way. As discussed in today's \nWashington Post, most universities currently have admissions programs \nthat are similar to Michigan Law School's. And for those that don't, a \nquick fix would be to go out and hire more admissions officers. Many \nuniversities have large endowments, so I am confident they have the \nability to hire a few more staff. As a result, they will be able to \nconduct the flexible, individualized analysis that the Court now \ndemands.\n  I personally agree with Justice Souter's dissent in the undergraduate \ncase--their point system is a far cry from the quota system that was \nstruck down in Bakke. Underrepresented minorities automatically get 20 \npoints out of a possible 150, but so do athletes, low-income \napplicants, and those who attended disadvantaged high schools. To me, \nthis type of point system does not seem unconstitutional.\n  But in any event, universities now have clear guidance. I think \nJustice Scalia will be proven wrong in his dire prediction that the \nMichigan decisions will lead to an avalanche of new affirmative action \nlitigation.\n  Another important aspect of yesterday's decision is that it \nrecognizes the value of diversity not only on campus, but for other \ncritical areas of our society as well. Eliminating affirmative action \nin universities would have harmful ripple effects for the nation.\n  For universities, the Court noted that ``classroom discussion is \nlivelier, more spirited, and simply more enlightening and interesting'' \nwhen the students have ``the greatest possible variety of \nbackgrounds.''\n  For society at large, diversity has even more tangible benefits. \nCiting to an amicus brief filed by a large number of Fortune 500 \ncompanies, Justice O'Connor wrote that ``American businesses have made \nclear that the skills needed in today's increasingly global marketplace \ncan only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people, \ncultures, ideas, and viewpoints.''\n\n[[Page S8433]]\n\n  Referencing an amicus brief filed by dozens of retired U.S. military \nleaders--including Generals Norman Schwarzkopf, John Shalikashvili, \nHugh Shelton, Anthony Zinni, and Wesley Clark--the Court wrote that \n``high-ranking retired officers and civilian leaders of the United \nStates military assert that, `based on their decades of experience,' a \n`highly qualified, racially diverse officer corps . . . is essential to \nthe military's ability to fulfill its principle mission to provide \nnational security' ''.\n  In addition, the Court brought the issue of diversity close to home. \nNoting that law schools represent ``the training ground or a large \nnumber of our Nation's leaders,'' the Court observed that individuals \nwith law degrees occupy more than half the seats in the United States \nSenate (59), a third of the seats in the House of Representatives \n(161), and roughly half the state governorships.\n  A third important aspect of yesterday's decision is the rejection of \nthe Bush Administration's position that both Michigan programs were \nunconstitutional and should be struck down. It gives you an idea of how \nconservative the Bush Administration is. Even this Supreme Court--in \nwhich 7 of 9 members were appointed by Republican Presidents--rejected \nits arguments.\n  Contrary to the misleading assertions of President Bush and other \nopponents of affirmative action, the Court held that Michigan Law \nSchool's policy of seeking a ``critical mass'' of minority students did \nnot as a de facto quota.\n  Between 1993 and 2000, the number of African Americans, Native \nAmericans, and Latinos in each class varied from 13% to 20%. As the \nCourt noted, diminishing stereotypes about ``minority viewpoints'' is \n``a crucial part of the Law School's mission, and one that it cannot \naccomplish with only token numbers of minority students.''\n  The Court also rejected the Bush Administration's position that you \ncould attain diversity through race-neutral means, such as the \n``percentage plans'' in Texas, Florida, and California, which guarantee \nadmission to all student about a certain class-rank threshold in every \nhigh school in the state.\n  The Court rejected this argument for two main reasons: 1, percentage \nplans don't work for graduate and professional schools, and 2, they \nare, ironically, even more mechanical and inflexible than the Michigan \nundergraduate program.\n  The Court shot down another central argument of the Bush \nAdministration--that affirmative action programs were invalid unless \nthey had a definitive end date. As Justice O'Connor observed: ``It has \nbeen 25 years since Justice Powell first approved the use of race to \nfurther an interest in student body diversity in the context of public \nhigher education. Since that time, the number of minority applicants \nwith high grades and test scores has indeed increased. We expect that \n25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be \nnecessary to further the interest approved today.''\n  I hope that Justice O'Connor is right.\n  The Michigan case is yet another reminder of the fragile balance on \nthe Supreme Court, and how high the stakes will be if a Justice \nretires.\n  If there were a switch of a single Justice in yesterday's case, \nthings would be dramatically different today. If there had been a fifth \nvote to end race-conscious affirmative action in America's \nuniversities, we would face a sudden reduction in minority students on \nour Nation's college campuses, especially at the elite ones.\n  The dean of Georgetown Law School--my alma mater--speculated \nyesterday that if the decision had gone the other way, Georgetown's \nminority enrollment would have been cut in half.\n  America cannot afford to turn back the clock on opportunity for all \nof our citzens and--by a 5-4 margin--the Supreme Court agrees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/24/senate-section/article/S8433-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred on October 8, \n2001. In Hyannis, MA, a 31-year-old man attacked two convenience store \nclerks from Pakistan. The suspect walked into the store, approached the \ntwo clerks and asked them if they were from Pakistan. The two men \nresponded affirmatively, which further enraged the suspect. The \nperpetrator began cursing and accusing the pair for ``almost killing'' \nhis family and attacking the United States. One of the clerks attempted \nto calm the man down and led him outside. Once outside, the man punched \nthe clerk, sending him to the ground. The attacker proceeded to kick \nhim until the second clerk rushed outside to halt the attack.

Mr. President, I rise to speak today to mark several \nimportant developments in our Nation's fight to end domestic violence, \nsexual assault, and stalking. First, I recently had the honor of \naddressing domestic violence advocates from across the country who have \nconvened in Washington, DC, to attend the annual meeting of the \nNational Network to End Domestic Violence. These are the women and men \non the front lines, transforming the Violence Against Women Act from \nwords on a piece of paper into real solutions for battered women and \nchildren.\n  These advocates witness the terrible toll of family violence. They, \nin essence, know the statistics by heart. Statistics like 20 percent of \nall nonfatal violence against females over 12 years of age were \ncommitted by intimate partners, according to government statistics \nreleased in February 2003. Or the statistics that tell us that in 2000 \nalone, 1,247 women were killed by an intimate partner. These advocates \nexperience what the studies confirm; that is, in almost half of the \nhouseholds with domestic violence, there are children under the age of \n12.\n  In the face of such daunting numbers, I was pleased to tell these \nadvocates that our fight for an independent and separate Violence \nAgainst Women Office is over. I have been assured by Attorney General \nAshcroft that his department will comply with the directive for an \nindependent office that was in the law passed by the Congress last \nsession. I want to make clear that my Violence Against Women Office Act \nand subsequent push to ensure compliance was not a fight about office \nspace or bureaucratic in-fighting. I introduced this legislation \nbecause I know that a separate office means that the office's \nleadership and agenda cannot be marginalized or pushed to a back \noffice. A separate office means that violence against women issues stay \nat the forefront and that its director appointed by the President and \nconfirmed by the Senate will have an office with the stature and status \nto use it as the bully pulpit on domestic violence issues that I \nintended when I authored the Violence Against Women Act.\n  Nor is the independent office simply a Joe Biden issue. The Violence \nAgainst Women Office Act was voted on favorably--with no objections--in \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee. The act passed unanimously in the \nSenate and passed overwhelmingly in the House. The mandate for \nfreestanding Violence Against Women Office is Congress' law, not a \nwhim.\n  Despite the law's clear language and intent, the Department of \nJustice formally announced in February 2003 that it ``interpreted'' the \nnew law to permit the office to remain as a part of the Office of \nJustice Program, the arm of the Justice Department which handles grant \nmaking, rather than implementing significant policy decisions. I \nvigorously protested this ``interpretation,'' informing the Justice \nDepartment that it was inconsistent with both the plain letter of the \nlaw, as well as congressional intent. In fact, I personally called \nAttorney General\n\n[[Page S8434]]\n\nAshcroft on February 13 to discuss this issue and to urge him to \nreconsider the Department's position.\n  On March 24, the Attorney General called to inform me that he had \npersonally reviewed this issue and that he was reversing the \nDepartment's February decision. More specifically, he pledged to me \nthat the Office would be moved outside of the Office of Justice \nPrograms to become an independent and distinct office, as called for by \nthe law. He also pledged that the Director of the Office would have a \ndirect line of report to him, and not be required to report through the \nAssistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs, as the \nDepartment had previously required. I am grateful that Attorney General \nAshcroft took the time to turn his full attention to this matter, to \nexamine the law and legislative history, and to ensure that his \nDepartment correctly implemented the act. I commend the Attorney \nGeneral for doing ``the right thing'' with respect to the office.\n  The strength and stature of the Violence Against Women Office will be \nmatched by the strength and stature of its director, Diane Stuart. \nPursuant to the new law that requires Senate confirmation, Ms. Stuart \ntestified before the Judiciary Committee earlier this month, and the \ncommittee will vote on her nomination on Thursday. Ms. Stuart has been \nacting director of the office for almost 2 years, and during that time \nhas done terrific work. I am particularly impressed with the \nextraordinary outreach Ms. Stuart has done thus far, meeting with law \nenforcement, prosecutors, and service providers from Montgomery County, \nMD, to Portland, OR. She is truly an expert in the areas of domestic \nviolence, sexual assault, and stalking, and I look forward to working \nwith her as we fight to end family violence in our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/24/senate-section/article/S8434-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             REACH-BACK TAX\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am concerned about an unfair tax on \ncoal companies and other businesses which is sometimes referred to as \nthe ``reach-back tax.'' It was enacted as part of the Coal Act in the \n1992 Energy bill. The Coal Act requires companies to pay a tax on the \nretirement benefits of miners. The tax applies not only to companies \nactive in the coal mining business but also to companies that are no \nlonger in the coal mining business.\n  There is one company in the State of Washington that has not employed \nany miners since the 1950s and is still obligated to pay. Another \ncompany that is subject to the tax is the Mississippi Lignite Mining \nCompany, which operates a powerplant at Red Hills near Ackerman, MS. It \nis time for the Congress to repeal this unfair tax.\n  If we do not act soon, the combined benefit fund, which provides the \nmoney for the retirement benefits, will be bankrupt. I understand that \nthe distinguished chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. \nGrassley, and the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith, have asked the House \nWays and Means Committee to send a bill to the Senate to resolve this \nissue. I join them in this request and hope the Finance Committee will \nact with favor on such a bill when it comes over from the House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/24/senate-section/article/S8434-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support S. 1157, the National \nMuseum of African American History and Culture Act. The story of \nAfrican Americans is a major part of the story of the United States. \nFrom the dark times of slavery, civil war, and reconstruction, to the \nextraordinary accomplishments of the civil rights movement of the past \nhalf century, it is essential for all Americans to know and understand \nthat story in all its aspects, and this new museum in the Nation's \nCapital will be an especially valuable resource in achieving that goal. \nIt will be a valuable cultural and educational experience for every \nvisitor to Washington and for every student of American history in \ncommunities across the country.\n  Our Nation was founded on a promise of equality and opportunity for \nall, and for more than two centuries, we have struggled to fulfill that \ngreat promise. The struggle goes on today, on critical issues, such as \nguaranteeing that all our citizens are free from hate crimes and racial \nprofiling, and are free to go to the polls and vote without \nintimidation or attempts to suppress their votes.\n  We know that civil rights is still the great unfinished business of \nAmerica. As Robert Kennedy told the students at the University of Cape \nTown, at a time when the specter of apartheid hung heavily over South \nAfrica:\n\n       We must recognize the full human equality of all our \n     people--before God, before the law, and in the councils of \n     governments. We must do this, not because it is economically \n     advantageous--although it is; not because the laws of God and \n     man command it--although they do command it; not because \n     people in other lands wish it to. We must do it for the \n     single and fundamental reason that it is the right thing to \n     do.\n\n  It is especially appropriate that this new museum dedicated to \nAfrican-American history and culture will be part of the Smithsonian \nInstitution in Washington. It is long overdue, and this legislation \nwill help advance the cause.\n  This museum will be renowned as a source of African-American history \nthroughout the United States. In cooperation with other museums, with \nhistorically black colleges, and with many other historical, cultural, \nand educational institutions, it will make this part of the Nation's \nhistory as widely available as possible. And millions of visitors who \ncome here from throughout the world will be inspired by what they see \nand learn.\n  It is an honor to be a sponsor of this legislation, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/24/senate-section/article/S8434-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8434-S8435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                In Memory of Staff Sergeant Aaron White\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of a \nremarkable man. SSG Aaron Dean White was an Oklahoman through and \nthrough. People say he was a hard worker, dedicated, friendly, and that \nhe loved his family and country. Those who knew him best remembered him \nas being always willing to help others. He even served alongside his \nfather as a volunteer firefighter for the town of Sasakwa, OK. A former \nresident of both Sasakwa and Shawnee, OK, he graduated from Shawnee \nHigh School in 1994. He entered the U.S. Marine Corps shortly \nthereafter, gladly serving his Nation for 9 years, and eventually \nmoving up to the position of crew chief on a CH-46 Sea Knight \nHelicopter.\n  Staff Sergeant White was passionate about his job--excited to serve--\nproud to be a marine. After being deployed to Iraq in January of 2003, \nhe was upset because he was not as close to the action as he had hoped. \nA passionate lover of flying who had earned his pilot's license, he \nvolunteered to be a gunner on a helicopter, just so he would have the \nopportunity to fly more often.\n  On Monday, May 19, Staff Sergeant White was one of four individuals \non board a helicopter on a resupply mission when the chopper went down \ninto the Shat Ahilala River in Iraq. Tragically he, along with four \nother marines, did not survive the incident. This courageous man who \nwas living out his dreams lost his life while defending his country.\n  Staff Sergeant White's remarkable life of helping others was \ncommemorated at his funeral ceremony in Wewoka, OK, at which friends \nand family filled the chapel. His many loved ones grieved, including \nhis parents, Shawnee, OK, residents Darrell and Karen White; his wife \nMichele; his daughter Brianna Nicole; and his sister, Sergeant Patricia \nLaBar, who was serving with the U.S. Army in Germany when her brother \npassed into the next life. However, I know they are incredibly proud of \nthis man--son, husband, father, and brother--lover of life and soldier \nof freedom. He is a man who has set a higher standard for all of us to \nfollow. We will never forget him, SSG Aaron Dean White.\n\n\n                  In Memory of Petty Officer Bollinger\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, no one can truly put into words the \nmagnitude of respect and admiration we feel for those who sacrifice \ntheir lives so that we might continue to live in freedom. However, I am \nhonored today to try, since the young man whom I pay tribute to was a \nproud son of my home State the great State of Oklahoma.\n\n[[Page S8435]]\n\n  Petty Officer 3rd Class Doyle Wayne Bollinger grew up in the \ncommunity of Poteau, OK. A member of the Poteau Valley Baptist Church, \nhe was remembered by those who knew him best as one with a generous \nheart--never thinking of himself, but devoting his time to the service \nof others.\n  Upon graduating from Poteau High School, Petty Officer Bollinger \nheard the call to serve his country. He joined the United States Navy, \nbecoming a member of the Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 133, based \nin Gulfport, MS. In January of 2003, he and his fellow patriots were \nsent to Iraq, and possibly into harm's way.\n  On Friday, June 6, 2003 Petty Officer Bollinger was with his \nbattalion, repairing a bridge across the Tigris River in Iraq. He was \ntragically killed when unexploded ordnance accidentally detonated \nnearby. At the age of 21 this man lost his life so that we might stand \nhere today, without fear, and in freedom.\n  I cannot fully describe to you the pain in the hearts of his loved \nones as they sat at his funeral on the grounds of Poteau High School, \nwhere they had watched him graduate only a few years earlier. Our \nthoughts and prayers are with them now. And though we are all grieved \nat the loss of this man, we shall never cease to be proud of him--\nOklahoma's son--Petty Officer 3rd Class Doyle Wayne Bollinger.\n\n\n            In Memory of Private First Class Jerod R. Dennis\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of a man \nwho, at such a young age, displayed the courage and valor of a true \nAmerican hero. Private First Class Jerod R. Dennis was a proud son of \nthe great State of Oklahoma, growing up in the community of Antlers. \nRemembered as being energetic, outgoing, and humorous, he graduated in \n2002 from Antlers High School, where he was a standout tennis player, \ntwice making it to the State championships.\n  Even before the attacks on America on 9/11, PVT Dennis knew that he \nwanted to dedicate himself to service in the United States Army. He \nenlisted prior to his graduation from high school, and arrived in boot \ncamp merely 3 weeks after receiving his diploma. His parents, Jerry and \nJane Dennis of Antlers, realized that their son was proud to be \nanswering the call to serve his country. Despite their worry for his \nsafety, they sent with him their support and love as he was assigned to \nthe 3rd Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment based out of Fort \nBragg, NC.\n  As a part of the U.S. effort to stamp out the threat of terrorism, \nPVT Dennis, now an Army sharpshooter, along with the rest of his \nregiment, was sent to fight in Afghanistan. On April 25, 2003, PVT \nDennis was on patrol in eastern Afghanistan with other soldiers when \nthey drove into an ambush. A firefight with rebel fighters quickly \nfollowed. When his sergeant was shot, PVT Dennis made his way to a \nfoxhole and provided cover fire as his comrades took the sergeant to \nsafety. Tragically, PVT Dennis was mortally injured in the process.\n  At just 19 years of age, PVT Dennis lay dying from his wounds, \nworrying more about the physical condition of his fellow soldiers than \nhis own health and well being. PVT Dennis passed on to the next life \nthat day, but no one could deny the bravery displayed by this young man \nfrom a small town in far southeastern Oklahoma.\n  Hundreds gathered at the funeral for PVT Dennis, held at the First \nBaptist Church in Antlers. They will never forget this incredible young \nman who displayed such great love for his country. As Army Brigadier \nGeneral Abe Turner stated so eloquently at the funeral ceremony, ``We \nwill remember you. We will honor you, and you will always be a hero.'' \nHe is Oklahoma's hero--Private First Class Jerod R. Dennis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/24/senate-section/article/S8435-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      TRIBUTE TO LINCOLN COUNTY AND MESCALERO APACHE INDIAN HEROES\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

This list includes the names of all those from this \nmountainous southern New Mexico region who gave their lives defending \nthe United States in World War I, World War II, the Korean war, and \nVietnam.\n  As families and communities rally on July 4th to celebrate the 227th \nbirthday of our Nation, the honor list organizers understand that our \ncelebrations are made possible by the servicemen who came from their \nvery own small communities and ranches to take up arms in the name of \nliberty and freedom.\n  The honor list serves to unify this region of New Mexico, equally \npaying tribute to those who made the ultimate sacrifice. The list reads \nlike the history of New Mexico itself, including warriors of American \nIndian, Hispanic, Anglo and other descents.\n  The collection has been a joint effort of a great many, from tribal \nand county citizens and officials, to the Department of Defense. My \ndistinguished colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, Secretary of \nState Colin Powell, General Norman Schwarzkopf, and former New Mexico \nGovernor Gary Johnson have all issued citations to the list. I want to \ntake this opportunity to thank Mr. Limacher for his dedication and \ntireless work.\n  I, too, take pride in honoring these servicemen. They are all \nspecially honored in this record.\n  The Lincoln County and the Mescalero Apache Indian Tribe Honor List \nwill be presented to surviving family members of those who served, and \nplaced in libraries located throughout south central New Mexico so all \ncan remember these great men. The stories of these brave servicemen \nfrom Lincoln County and the Mescalero Apache Indian Reservation are \nforever unfinished because of the circumstance of their deeds, but \ntheir sacrifices do not go unnoticed. The honor list will create a \nunique bond between future generations and the past fallen heroes.\n  They are all heroes who fought for their country and gave their lives \nfor our freedom, liberty, and independence. Because of their courage we \nare what we are. To them and their families, and to all our men and \nwomen of our armed services past and present, I salute you this \nIndependence holiday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/24/senate-section/article/S8435-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              AL BRAIMAN: DEPAUL UNIVERSITY CLASS OF 2003\n\n Depaul University's Class of 2003.

Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Nashua, \nNH, the Gate City of New Hampshire. As the United States prepares to \nobserve the 227th anniversary of our independence, the citizens of \nNashua will be celebrating the city's sesquicentennial. It is therefore \ntimely and appropriate that we recognize this great American community \n.\n  With its rich heritage and the continuing role it plays in New \nHampshire's economic and cultural vitality, I am proud to be a native \nof Nashua. We cannot accurately talk about this city without praising \nits most distinctive asset: the people of Nashua. From its founding as \nthe Township of Dunstable in 1673 to its incorporation as the City of \nNashua in 1853 through today, they have shown a unique entrepreneurial \nflair, a dedication to their neighbors and the courage to often times \nplace their own lives at risk for the well-being of our country. Their \ninvolvement in the American Revolution is one of many episodes which \nvividly illustrate these characteristics. The residents in what was \nthen called Dunstable, upon hearing of the fight at Lexington, rushed \nto take up arms. According to historical accounts, nearly one-half of \nthe able-bodied men in Dunstable enlisted in the Army by the time of \nthe Battle of Bunker Hill. CAPT William Walker organized a company of \n66 of these men for this battle. They were placed at the high point of \nthe British attack. To be stationed here was actually a great honor as \nit reflected their fighting expertise and commitment to the cause of \nindependence.\n  Since then, Nashuans have continued to serve and defend their country \nwhen our freedoms were at risk: 1,348 men served in the Civil War; \n4,160 in World War Two. Nashua's airport is named after Paul Boire, a \nyoung navy pilot who died in March, 1943. Women, too, have greatly \ncontributed to these causes, oftentimes on the front lines. Mrs. \nAdelaide Johnson Stevens was a volunteer nurse during the Civil War and \nwas wounded during the assault on Fort Harrison.\n  In the early part of the 1800s, the community was quickly becoming a \ncenter for commerce and industry. Daniel Abbott was the man perhaps \nmost responsible for this reputation. He, along with partners Joseph \nGreeley and Moses Tyler, founded the Nashua Manufacturing Company which \nbecame one of the world's preeminent manufacturers of cotton, woolen, \nand iron goods. Throughout the 19th century, Nashua was well known as a \ncenter for innovation. For example, the Nashua Iron and Steel Works \nmade the stoppers for the ports in the turrets of the S.S. Monitor. The \nRollins Engine Company made the famous steam engine which help power \nthe economic expansion not only in New Hampshire but throughout our \ncountry. As Nashua grew, so did its reputation as a home for \nentrepreneurs. Royden Sanders turned Sanders Associates into one of the \ntop defense contractors in our country. In an interesting sidenote, \nRalph Baer, who worked as a manager for Sanders in the 1960s, developed \nthe first television video game and is often called the Tom Edison of \nvideo games. Sanders is now owned by BAE Systems but continues to be a \npioneer in the design, development, and manufacture of electronic \nsystems for both military and commercial use.\n  What is perhaps the most distinguishing characteristic of the city's \npeople has always been their commitment to helping their neighbors and \nto constantly improving the quality of life here. Nashua's history is \nfull of stories which illustrate their dedication. On April 20, 1861, \nthe city passed soldiers aid resolution providing one dollar per week \nfor the wife of an enlistee and one dollar per week for each dependent \nchild. Today, Nashua has organizations like Marguerite's Place which \nhas done so much to turn around the lives of women and their children \nwho have been victims of domestic violence. The city's current mayor, \nBernie Streeter, has long served the public and is continuing in the \nhonorable tradition started by Nashua's first mayor, Josephus Baldwin. \nMy father, Hugh Gregg, has also served as mayor of Nashua and Governor \nof New Hampshire. It was in large part through his work that the city's \neconomic vitality was restored after the mills moved and closed in the \nearly 1950s.\n  All of these people, and their stories, demonstrate how Nashua has \nmaintained its vitality, adapted to changing times, and continues to be \na leader in so many areas. It is no wonder that the city has twice been \nnamed as the best place to live in the United States. I do not think \nany other community in the country can make that claim. With that, I am \nproud to honor and salute them as they celebrate the sesquicentennial \nof Nashua, NH.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/24/senate-section/article/S8436-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO JUDGE LEE AND HARRY FIRST\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, a great thinker once said that \nthere is no more lovely, friendly, and charming relationship, \ncommunion, or company than a good marriage.

Mr. President, I'm pleased to join Senator Brownback and \na number of our colleagues today in re-introducing the Conservation \nReserve Program Tax Fairness Act. This legislation is virtually \nidentical to the bill we introduced in the 107th Congress, which \ngarnered nearly twenty Senate cosponsors. It clarifies that \nConservation Reserve Program, CRP, payments received by farmers are \ntreated for Federal tax purposes as rental payments from real estate, \nnot self-employment income subject to self-employment taxes.\n  Despite past strong bipartisan support for this legislation, the \nCongress did not make this long overdue tax law clarification in the \nmajor tax reduction bill that was recently signed into law. This is \nregrettable and I hope that the Congress will move expeditiously to \nreverse the IRS's wrong-headed position on this matter.\n  Let me take a moment to describe this problem. For many years, the \nIRS has been taking the erroneous position that CRP payments received \nby farmers are income from self-employment and therefore are subject to \nself-employment taxes. This position imposes a significant financial \nhardship on family farmers farmers who have voluntarily agreed to take \nenvironmentally-sensitive lands out of farm production and place them \nin the Conservation Reserve Program in return for an annual rental \npayment from the Commodity Credit Corporation of the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture.\n  In our judgment, the IRS's tax treatment of CRP payments is not what \nCongress intended, nor is it supportable in law. The U.S. Tax Court \nshares our view that the IRS position is improper. In fact, the U.S. \nTax Court ruled in 1998 that CRP payments are properly treated by \nfarmers as rental payments and, thus, not subject to self-employment \ntaxes. Unfortunately, the IRS challenged the Tax Court decision and the \nTax Court was later reversed by a federal appellate court.\n  Today, North Dakota has some 3.3 million acres with $110 million in \nrental payments in the CRP program. Left unchanged, the IRS's \ninterpretation means that farmers in North Dakota will owe an \nadditional $16 million in federal taxes this year. A typical North \nDakota farmer with 160 acres in CRP would have a CRP payment of $5,280 \nand would owe nearly $800 in self-employment taxes because of the IRS's \nill-advised position. If the IRS also decides to pursue back taxes on \nreturns filed by farmers in past years, the amount of taxes owed by \nindividuals farmers for CRP payments could amount to thousands of \ndollars.\n  I believe that it is absolutely wrong for the IRS to load up farmers \nwith an added tax burden, especially when most of our Nation's family \nfarmers are still struggling from day to day to make ends meet. With \nthe legislation we are introducing today, Congress can tell the IRS \nthat its effort to treat CRP payments as net earnings from self-\nemployment is inappropriate and will not be allowed to stand.\n  Senator Brownback and I ask our colleagues to support this much-\nneeded tax relief for family farmers by cosponsoring the Conservation \nReserve Program Tax Fairness Act. And we hope you will work with us to \nget this legislation enacted into law at the first available \nopportunity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Biden, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1317.

A bill to modify the project for navigation, Union River, \nMaine; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce three bills for \nharbors in Maine, two of them that will deauthorize the Federal \nNavigation Projects in Tenants Harbor and Northeast Harbor in Mt. \nDesert, and the third will redesignate the Upper Basin of the Union \nRiver Federal Navigational Channel in Ellsworth as an anchorage. The \nbills will help strengthen the economic viability of these three \npopular Maine harbors.\n  My first bill, S. 1318, pertains to Tenants Harbor, ME. Officials of \nthe Town of Tenants Harbor have requested that the harbor be \ndeauthorized. The original project was authorized in 1919, and was \ndredged that same year so that steamboats could access the Harbor. The \nchannel has a width of 375 feet and extended out to 1,100 feet from \nSteamboat Wharf. Times have certainly changed as no steamboat has \nlanded in the Harbor for 75 years. Over the years there have been \nmounting problems with the Army Corps of Engineers' mooring permit \nprocess as people seeking permits for moorings that have existed for 30 \nyears continue to be notified that the mooring locations are prohibited \nbecause they fall within the Federal navigational channel. \nDeauthorizing the FNC would be of great help to the town in \nappropriately managing the Harbor to maximize mooring areas.\n  My second bill S. 1319 concerns Northeast Harbor in Mt. Desert, ME. \nThe Town of Mount Desert has requested that Northeast Harbor be \nwithdrawn from the Federal Navigation Project because of changing \nharbor usage over the last 45 years. This removal will allow the town \nto adapt to the high demand for moorings and will allow residents to \nobtain moorings in a more timely manner. The Harbor has now reached \ncapacity for both moorings and shoreside facilities and has a waiting \nlist of over sixty people, along with commercial operators who have \nbeen waiting for years to obtain a mooring for their commercial \nvessels.\n  The Harbor was authorized in 1945 and constructed in 1954 as a mixed-\nuse commercial fishing/recreational boating harbor--and it still is \ntoday. It was dredged in the early 1950s to provide more space for \nrecreational boating and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has informed \nthe town that Northeast Harbor would be very low on its dredging \npriority list as it has become primarily a recreational harbor. The \ntown says it realizes that, once it is no longer part of the Federal \nNavigational Project, any further dredging within the harbor would be \ncarried out at town expense.\n  The language will not only allow for more recreational moorages and \ncommercial activities, it will also be an economic boost to Northeast \nHarbor, which is surrounded by Acadia National Park, one of the \nnation's most visited parks--both by land and by water.\n  My third bill, S. 1320, addresses the Union River in Ellsworth, ME. \nThe bill supports the City of Ellsworth's efforts to revitalize the \nUnion River navigation channel, harbor, and shoreline. The modification \ncalled for in my legislation will redesignate a portion of the Union \nRiver as an anchorage area. This redesignation will allow for a greater \nnumber of moorings in the harbor without interfering with navigation \nand will further improve the city's revitalization efforts for the \nharbor area.\n  I have worked with the New England Division of the Corps to draft \nthese bills and the language has been approved by Army Corps \nHeadquarters in Washington. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues for their passage, either as stand alone bills or as \nseparate provisions in the Corps reauthorization bill, the Water \nResources Development Act of 2003, that Congress is currently drafting.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 1323. A bill to extend the period for which chapter 12 of title \n11, United States Code, is reenacted by 6 months; read the first time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nextend Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code until January 1, 2004. This \nmeasure will provide our family farmers with the necessary bankruptcy \nprotections during hard times. However, I remain hopeful that the \nSenate will take up and pass the comprehensive bankruptcy legislation \nthat the House passed not long ago. That bill makes Chapter 12 of the \nBankruptcy Code permanent, so family farms are guaranteed the ability \nto reorganize. The bill also makes significant improvements to Chapter \n12 so that it will be more accessible and helpful to farmers. So while \nI urge quick passage of this temporary Chapter 12 measure, I would like \nto see the comprehensive bankruptcy Reform bill and permanent Chapter \n12 enacted into law as soon as possible. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1323\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Trade Act of 1974 to establish \nprocedures for identifying countries that deny market access for \nagricultural products of the United States, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I'm pleased to introduce today the \nUnited States Agricultural Products Market Access Act of 2003. This \nbill will be yet one more tool for the United States to use to expand \nits exports of agricultural products.\n  Agricultural exports are key to the economic health of rural America. \nJust last year, $53.1 billion worth of U.S.-produced agricultural \nproducts were exported. About one-third of America's farm products are \nsold outside of our borders. These sales in foreign markets translate \nto improved incomes for our country's farmers. Today, approximately \none-fourth of gross farm income for U.S. producers comes from exports.\n  Agricultural exports are particularly important to farmers in my \nState of Iowa. In 2001, some $3.3 billion worth of Iowa's agricultural \nproduction was exported. This makes Iowa the second largest \nagricultural exporting State in the country. Iowa's largest \ncommodities--corn, soybeans, pork, and beef--greatly benefit from sales \nabroad. Approximately one-half of U.S. soybean production, and 20 \npercent of our country's corn production, is exported. Last year U.S. \npork exports set record levels. Since the implementation of the NAFTA, \nexports of U.S. beef and beef\n\n[[Page S8443]]\n\nvariety meats to Mexico have increased five-fold. Iowa's producers \nclearly benefit from exports.\n  While Iowa's agricultural exports are already high, they have the \npotential to grow even more in coming years. Demand in the U.S. market \nfor agricultural products is relatively stable. But populations, as \nwell as disposable incomes, are increasing rapidly in foreign \ncountries. With the hardest-working farmers and ranchers in the world, \nand with productivity increasing through improved technologies, the \nUnited States clearly has the ability to continue feeding a growing \nworld.\n  But trade barriers imposed by foreign governments often cloud this \nbright spot for U.S. agriculture. Too frequently, misguided foreign \ngovernments overlook the wants and needs of their consumers and take \nmeasures to restrict, or prevent, imports of U.S. farm products. These \npolicies hurt U.S. farmers. They also hurt foreign consumers.\n  In fact, due in part to foreign trade barriers, U.S. agricultural \nexports declined from $60.4 billion in 1996 to $53.1 billion in 2002.\n  Unfortunately, even countries that should be our closest trade allies \nare proving adept at imposing measures that block imports of U.S. farm \nproducts. As an example, our NAFTA-partner Mexico is imposing, or \nthreatening to impose, barriers to imports of a wide variety of U.S. \nagricultural products. These products include corn, high fructose corn \nsyrup, pork, beef, rice, apples, and dry beans. Iowa is a major \nproducer of four of these products--corn, high fructose corn syrup, \npork, and beef.\n\n  Not surprisingly, much of U.S. agriculture is upset with Mexico and \nother of our trading partners at this time. U.S. agricultural producers \nhave traditionally been the strongest supporters of new trade deals. \nBut due to foreign trade barriers, some in U.S. agriculture are \nbeginning to question their support for new trade agreements.\n  The U.S. Trade Representative, in conjunction with Congress, is \nworking hard to remove trade barriers imposed by Mexico and other \ncountries. But the current tools available to the USTR, including \nnegotiations, NAFTA challenges, and WTO challenges, don't always \naccomplish the job.\n  Let me give you an example. For several years now, Mexico has gone to \ngreat lengths to block imports of U.S.-produced high fructose corn \nsyrup. In 1998, Mexico imposed antidumping duties on imports of this \nproduct from the United States. The United States challenged this \nantidumping order under the NAFTA. Mexico lost at the NAFTA. The United \nStates challenged this order at the WTO. Mexico lost at the WTO. \nFollowing its defeats at the NAFTA and the WTO, Mexico revoked this \nantidumping order.\n  But, no, that wasn't the end of the story. Mexico turned around and \nimposed a 20 percent tax on sales of soft drinks containing high \nfructose corn syrup. This discriminatory tax was designed to boost \nsales of Mexican sugar at the expense of U.S.-produced high fructose \ncorn syrup.\n  Mexico's tax in effect shut down the Mexican market for this product. \nIowa's high fructose corn syrup producers are now being locked out of \nwhat was at one time their largest export market. This discriminatory \ntax is hurting Iowa's high fructose corn syrup producers. It's hurting \nIowa's corn farmers.\n  This example clearly demonstrates that existing tools aren't always \nenough to remove entrenched trade barriers. Despite losing at the \nNAFTA, despite losing at the WTO, and despite lengthy negotiations, \nMexico is still blocking imports of U.S. high fructose corn syrup.\n  It's time to add yet another tool to our arsenal.\n  That's why I'm introducing the United States Agricultural Products \nMarket Access Act of 2003. This bill creates a new mechanism with which \nto confront foreign trade barriers. The new mechanism operates in a \nsimilar fashion to the existing special 301 provision for intellectual \nproperty. The bill requires USTR to identify and report on those \nforeign countries that deny fair and equitable market access for U.S. \nagricultural exports, or countries that apply to U.S. agricultural \nproducts sanitary or phytosanitary measures that are not based on sound \nscience. USTR would annually issue a report on its findings.\n  Out of the countries identified in USTR's report, USTR would identify \nwhich ones have the most egregious practices impacting U.S. \nagricultural exports and, further, are not entering into good faith \nnegotiations with the United States to end these practices.\n  This legislation also authorizes additional staffing for USTR to \nfocus on these agricultural enforcement issues.\n  This bill will further strengthen the ability of the United States to \nenforce its existing market access rights for agricultural exports. \nPerhaps just as important, it will help Congress and the Administration \nprioritize barriers imposed by our trading partners. Through such \nprioritization, U.S. negotiators will be better able to focus upon \nremoving the most egregious of these barriers.\n  The United States Agricultural Products Market Access Act will not \nsolve all of our agricultural market access problems. We need to move \nahead vigorously in bilateral and multilateral negotiations to tear \ndown barriers to our exports. At the top of this list is successful \ncompletion of agricultural negotiations in the WTO. However, the United \nStates Agricultural Products Market Access Act of 2003 will help us \nidentify the most egregious problems, so we can focus our energy on \nfixing them.

FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The export of agricultural products is of vital \n     importance to the economy of the United States.\n       (2) In 2002, agriculture was a large positive contributor \n     to the United States merchandise trade balance with a trade \n     surplus of $12,300,000,000.\n       (3) The growth of United States agricultural exports should \n     continue to be an important factor in improving the United \n     States merchandise trade balance.\n       (4) Increasing the volume of agricultural exports will \n     increase farm income in the United States, thereby protecting \n     family farms and contributing to the economic well-being of \n     rural communities in the United States.\n       (5) Although the United States efficiently produces high-\n     quality agricultural products, United States producers cannot \n     realize their full export potential because many foreign \n     countries deny fair and equitable market access to United \n     States agricultural products.\n       (6) The Foreign Agricultural Service estimates that United \n     States agricultural exports are reduced by $4,700,000,000 \n     annually due to unjustifiable imposition of sanitary and \n     phytosanitary measures that deny or limit market access to \n     United States products.\n       (7) The denial of fair and equitable market access for \n     United States agricultural products impedes the ability of \n     United States farmers to export their products, thereby \n     harming the economic interests of the United States.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to reduce or eliminate foreign unfair trade practices \n     and to remove constraints on fair and open trade in \n     agricultural products;\n       (2) to ensure fair and equitable market access for exports \n     of United States agricultural products; and\n       (3) to promote free and fair trade in agricultural \n     products.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the National Highway System Designation Act \nof 1995 to modify the applicability of requirements concerning hours of \nservice to operators of commercial motor vehicles transporting \nagricultural commodities and farm supplies; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill protect an existing exemption for farmers and agribusinesses from \nthe Department of Transportation's, DOT, limitations on maximum driving \ntime in transporting agricultural commodities or farm supplies during \npeak planting and growing seasons.\n  In 1995, Public Law 104-59 passed by Congress granted farmers and \nretail farm suppliers a limited exemption from DOT limitations on \nmaximum driving time in transporting agricultural commodies or farm \nsupplies within a 100-mile radius of a final distribution point. This \nlegislation recognized the special needs of rural America, \nunderstanding that drivers employed by farm retailers generally operate \nin local areas to farmers' fields delivering and applying crop inputs. \nMuch of their time is spent waiting at the field or the farm store \nloading and unloading their trucks. In short, farm retail drivers stay \nin a local area and return to their homes each night to sleep. The work \nof these crop input suppliers is essential to the Nation's farmers, who \noften have short windows of time to plant and harvest their crop around \nchanging weather patterns.\n  The agricultural exemption is seasonal, applying only during \ndesignated months throughout the year as determined by each State. \nEvery State has now taken this action, and to my knowledge this \nexemption has not had any impact on public safety.\n  It is important to note that under my clarifying legislation, the \nfarm supply/farm commodity exemption would remain limited in scope.\n  My legislation reiterates original Congressional support for the \nagricultural exemption. The DOT has no expertise in this area nor, in \nmy opinion, does the definition of agricultural commodity come under \nthe jurisdiction of this agency. In addition, the term ``agricultural \ncommodity'' is already defined by Section 102 of the Agricultural Trade \nAct of 1978 (7 U.S.C. 5602). Therefore, in my legislation, Section 345 \n(e) of the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 is amended \nto reflect the definition in the Agricultural Trade Act.\n  A bipartisan group of House Members are also seeking clarifying \nlegislation in this regard with Representative Bereuter of Nebraska \ntaking the lead.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join me in passing this legislation to \nprotect the agricultural exemption to hours of service rules and \nprevent DOT from diminishing or revoking the exemption.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/24/senate-section/article/S8445-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8445]]\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 181--CONGRATULATING ALL NEW YORKERS ON THE OCCASION \n  OF THEIR FIRST KENTUCKY DERBY VICTORY AND THE SUBSEQUENT PREAKNESS \n         STAKES VICTORY WITH NEW YORK-BRED GELDING, FUNNY CIDE\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER (for himself and Mrs. Clinton) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Res. 182\n\n       Whereas access to dental care for children is a vital \n     element of overall health care and development;\n       Whereas dental caries--more commonly known as tooth decay--\n     is the most common chronic childhood disease;\n       Whereas untreated tooth decay in children results in \n     thousands of children experiencing poor eating and sleeping \n     patterns, suffering decreased attention spans at school, and \n     being unable to smile;\n       Whereas, due to a confluence of factors, children eligible \n     for Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance \n     Program are 3 to 5 times more likely than other children to \n     have untreated tooth decay;\n       Whereas dentists provide an estimated $1,700,000,000 \n     annually in nonreimbursed dental care;\n       Whereas dentists participating in the American Dental \n     Association established the ``Give Kids a Smile'' program to \n     serve as a reminder to the Nation about the need to end \n     untreated childhood dental disease; and\n       Whereas the ``Give Kids a Smile'' program treated an \n     estimated 1,000,000 children on February 21, 2003, at \n     approximately 5,000 locations in all 50 States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the American Dental Association for \n     establishing the ``Give Kids a Smile'' program;\n       (2) emphasizes the need to improve access to dental care \n     for children; and\n       (3) thanks the thousands of dentists who volunteered their \n     time and brought a smile to faces of an estimated 1,000,000 \n     children on February 21, 2003.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, someone once said, ``A smile costs \nnothing, but gives much. It enriches those who receive, without making \npoorer those that give.'' I rise today to offer a resolution to \ncongratulate the American Dental Association for establishing the \n``Give Kids a Smile'' program.\n  This program emphasizes the need to improve dental care access for \nchildren. Tooth decay is the most common chronic childhood disease. \nTooth decay can cause poor eating and sleeping patterns, decreased \nattention spans at school, and sadly, prevents children from showing \ntheir smiles.\n  Low income children are much more likely to suffer from tooth decay. \nChildren who are eligible for Medicaid and State Children's Health \nInsurance Program, SCHIP, are 3 to 5 times more likely than other \nchildren to have untreated tooth decay. The ``Give Kids a Smile'' \nprogram is helping these children.\n  Along with helping children get the dental care that they need, this \nprogram brings attention to the fact that this is a serious issue that \nchildren in our nation are facing. This program provides for and \npromotes education on dental care, good dental hygiene, dental \nscreenings, exams and radiographs, and even gives sealants and \nfillings.\n  On February 21st, my State, Michigan, brought healthier teeth and \nbrighter smiles to 12,800 low-income and disadvantage children. Nearly \n1 million children were treated nationwide.\n  Dentists, such as Dr. John Buchheister, Dr. Sara Wassenaar, Dr. Dale \nNester, Dr. Martha Bamfield, and Dr. Gary Schluckebier in Michigan, \nvolunteered their time, resources, and services to give children dental \nscreenings, exams, sealants, and fillings.\n  Nearly 8,300 children in Michigan also listened to dental education \npresentations by dental professionals.\n  I am pleased to stand here today and congratulate the American Dental \nAssociation for their leadership on this important children's health \nissue and for establishing the ``Give Kids a Smile'' program.\n  I also want to thank the Michigan Dental Association for \nparticipating in this program and I want to thank all of the dentists \nin Michigan and across the Nation that took the time to make the \ninaugural ``Give Kids a Smile'' day a great success. After all, ``A \nsmile can open a heart faster than a key can open a door.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/24/senate-section/article/S8445-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8445-S8446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1001.

Mr. SESSIONS proposed an amendment to the bill S. 1, to \namend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to make improvements in \nthe medicare program, to provide prescription drug coverage under the \nmedicare program, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike section 605 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 605. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING HEALTH INSURANCE \n                   COVERAGE OF LEGAL IMMIGRANTS UNDER MEDICAID AND \n                   SCHIP.\n\n       Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 1996, in the Personal Responsibility and Work \n     Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193; \n     110 Stat. 2105)(commonly referred to as the ``welfare\n\n[[Page S8451]]\n\n     reform Act''), Congress deliberately limited the Federal \n     public benefits available to legal immigrants.\n       (2) The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \n     Reconciliation Act of 1996 allows a State the option of \n     electing to offer permanent resident legal aliens that have \n     been living in the United States for at least 5 years the \n     same benefits that their State citizens receive under the \n     temporary assistance for needy families program (commonly \n     referred to as ``TANF'') and the medicaid program.\n       (3) As of the date of enactment of this Act, 22 States have \n     elected to give the permanent resident legal aliens who \n     reside in their States the same TANF and medicaid benefits as \n     the States provide to the citizens of their States.\n       (4) This Act, the Prescription Drug and Medicare \n     Improvement Act of 2003, is not a welfare or medicaid reform \n     bill, but rather is a package of improvements for the \n     medicare program that is designed to provide greater access \n     to health care for America's seniors.\n       (5) The section heading for 605 of this Act as reported out \n     of the Committee on Finance, was titled ``Assistance with \n     Coverage of Legal Immigrants under the medicaid program and \n     SCHIP,'' and, as reported, related directly to the provision \n     of benefits under the medicaid and State children's health \n     insurance programs, not to benefits provided under the \n     medicare program.\n       (6) The reported version of section 605 would have directly \n     overturned the reforms made in the 1996 welfare reform Act.\n       (7) The reported version of section 605 would have greatly \n     expanded the number of individuals who could receive benefits \n     under medicaid and SCHIP.\n       (8) No hearings have been held in the Committee on Finance \n     of the Senate concerning why the 5-year residency requirement \n     for legal aliens to obtain a Federal public benefit \n     established in the welfare reform Act needs to be overturned \n     or why the reported version of section 605 should be included \n     in a medicare reform package.\n       (9) Congress must reauthorize the temporary assistance for \n     needy families program later this year and should hold \n     hearings regarding whether the 5-year residency requirement \n     for legal aliens to obtain a Federal public benefit should be \n     overturned as part of the reauthorization of that program.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Committee on Finance of the Senate should hold \n     hearings in connection with the reauthorization of the \n     temporary assistance for needy families program, or in \n     connection with reform of the medicaid program, regarding \n     whether the 5-year residency requirement for legal aliens to \n     obtain a Federal public benefit that was established in the \n     1996 welfare reform Act should be overturned for purposes of \n     the medicaid and State children's health insurance programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1012.

For the purposes of this section, ``chemotherapy \n     support services'' are services furnished by the staff of \n     physicians to patients undergoing treatment for cancer \n     that were not included in the computation of clinical \n     staff costs under section 3(b). Such services include \n     social worker services, nutrition counseling, psychosocial \n     services, and similar services.\n       (b) Direct Costs.--The Secretary shall estimate the cost of \n     the salary and benefits of staff furnishing chemotherapy \n     support services as they are provided in oncology practices \n     that furnish these services to cancer patients in a manner \n     that is considered to be high quality care. The estimate \n     shall be based on the weekly cost of such services per \n     patient receiving chemotherapy.\n       (c) Total Costs.--The Secretary shall estimate the total \n     practice expenses of chemotherapy support services by \n     assuming that the direct costs for the service determined \n     under subsection (b) are 33.2 percent of such total practice \n     expenses.\n       (d) Conversion to Relative Value Units.--The Secretary \n     shall convert the total practice expenses determined under \n     subsection (c) to practice expense relative value units for \n     chemotherapy support services by dividing such expenses by \n     the conversion factor that will be in effect for the \n     physician fee schedule for 2005. The relative value units as \n     so determined shall be used in determining the fee schedule \n     amounts paid for chemotherapy support services under such \n     section 1848.\n       (e) Updates.--For the years after 2005, the relative values \n     determined under subsection (d) shall continue in effect \n     except that the Secretary shall revise them as necessary to \n     maintain their accuracy, provided that such revisions are \n     consistent with the methodology set forth in this section.\n\n     SEC.   .

Such methodology shall result in payment \n     amounts that fully cover the costs of furnishing such \n     services. Until such time as the methodology for such \n     services is revised and implemented, all such services shall \n     be protected from further payment cuts due to factors such as \n     shifts in utilization or removal of any one specialty's \n     services that are paid under the fee schedule established by \n     such section 1848 and that do not have physician work \n     relative value units.\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, today we made great progress toward \nfinishing the prescription drug/Medicare reform legislation. We debated \nmany amendments. We had nine rollcall votes in relation to the pending \namendments during today's consideration of this bill.\n  Tomorrow morning, we will resume consideration of S. 1. I would \nanticipate another busy day on this bill as well tomorrow. On \nWednesday, the first rollcall vote was anticipated to be at 10 a.m. \nHowever, at this time the final legislative draft is not ready. We will \ncontinue to work on that draft over the course of the evening and into \nthe morning, but at this juncture I will likely have to notify our \nMembers as early as possible tomorrow morning as to whether we will \nactually call that rollcall vote at 10 a.m. I am hopeful that we can. \nIf the legislative language is not ready, we will not have that vote at \n10 a.m., but I hope to be able to announce that at 9:30 in the morning.\n  I do want to remind my colleagues that at this juncture we have \napproximately 42 amendments still pending to the bill. These amendments \nwill have to be addressed by the Senate in some fashion, although I am \nvery hopeful that many of these amendments can be disposed of without a \nrollcall vote. In any event, we have a lot of work to do before we have \npassage of this bill.\n  I, once again, will state that it is my intention that we will finish \nconsideration of the prescription drug/Medicare reform bill prior to \nthe July 4 recess--many hours, a lot of hard work, but we are on course \nto accomplish that, and I expect that we will do so.\n  I look forward to another productive day tomorrow as we begin the \nfinal consideration of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/24/senate-section/article/S8478-5", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
