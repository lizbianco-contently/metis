Mr. President, this morning after a 1-hour period of \nmorning business, we will resume consideration of the intelligence \nreform bill. In addition to a large number of pending amendments, we \nanticipate that more amendments will be offered today. As a reminder, \nthe consent reached on Friday did set up a series of stacked votes \nbeginning at 4:15 today. There are currently six votes in order. \nHowever, I anticipate other votes will be added to that series as \ndebate continues. In addition, we well may have votes into the evening \nin order to make progress on the bill.\n  I remind my colleagues that a cloture motion was filed on the bill on \nFriday and that cloture vote will occur tomorrow morning. It is my hope \nand expectation cloture will be invoked and that we will be able to \nfinish the bill either tomorrow afternoon, tomorrow evening, or \nWednesday.\n  I say this because, as we all know, this is our last week in session. \nWe will adjourn if we complete both of our intelligence reform efforts \non this Friday, October 8. Our goal is to adjourn on Friday, October 8. \nBefore that time, we do need to complete action on both arms of \nintelligence reform, including that relating to the Senate role on \nintelligence matters. We have a lot of work before us this week. We all \nneed to prepare for busy sessions.\n  There are a lot of other events that are scheduled over the course of \nthe week. Our focus must be on the business that is before us. Thus, I \nknow everybody will be shifting things around. We need to put a major \npriority on what goes on here on the floor as well as on several \nconference reports.\n  In addition to what people will be seeing on the floor, we have the \nFSC/ETI manufacturing jobs bill that is currently in conference. There \nwill be a lot of activity this afternoon, tonight, and tomorrow in that \nconference. I am hopeful we will be able to address that conference \nreport sometime this week.\n  Homeland Security appropriations is also in conference and progress \nis being made there. That was the first bill we did when we came back 4 \nweeks ago. It is important that we complete it, especially since our \ngoal is the safety and security of the American people. That bill \ndirects the spending aspects of homeland security.\n  The underlying bill we have been on now for a week and a half, and we \nhave been studying the issue aggressively in response to the 9/11 \nCommission report. We have made huge progress, and all of our \ncolleagues have worked together, on both sides of the aisle, on this \nvery nonpartisan issue. I thank all of our colleagues for participating \nand working with such focus in an expeditious and a bipartisan manner. \nThe American people thank you. I thank you. The leadership on both \nsides of the aisle thanks you.\n  We have no greater duty in this body than protecting our Nation and \nin strengthening our intelligence system. We are meeting that \nresponsibility. As we have said at the outset, when the Democratic \nleader and I set out this path, it was because, when we leave on\n\n[[Page S10290]]\n\nOctober 8, although we will have in all likelihood a little bit of \nbusiness to take care of, in truth October 8 really brings to a close \nmost of the activity, almost all of the activity, it would be \ninexcusable not to deal with these important issues on intelligence \nwhich affect the safety and security of the American people. If we were \nunable to finish that, because it means we would not be able to address \nit until next year, that would be unpardonable.\n  To date, the Senate, in this bill, has addressed 35 of the 39 \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission. Those are the 39 \nrecommendations that deal with executive branch reorganization. The \nremaining recommendations will be addressed this week.\n  The Senate has covered a full range of issues: establishing a \nnational intelligence director to manage the Nation's intelligence \ncommunity, to advise the President; creating a national \ncounterterrorism center to maximize our intelligence-gathering \ncapabilities and maximizing our counterterrorism activities; redefining \nthe national foreign intelligence program to better coordinate and \nunify the functions of our intelligence agencies; strengthening and \nreforming the CIA, the FBI, and other intelligence-related agencies; \nand ensuring that winning the war on terrorism is our top priority.\n  There were two additional reforms suggested by the Commission \nconcerning Senate oversight of intelligence and homeland security and, \nas I mentioned, the Senate will be considering these two remaining \nrecommendations this week.\n  It is going to be a very full week, but the Democratic leader and I \nagree that getting this done now must be our top priority. We are \nmaking real progress on the Senate floor. We are on the home stretch. \nWe have another 5 days, beginning early today, and I am sure we will \nuse all 5 days to the fullest sense. We have to have these major \nreforms completed this week.\n  I thank my colleagues for staying on task. I thank the managers of \nthe bill in particular, Senators Collins and Lieberman. They and the \nParliamentarian and staff have been working solidly through the \nweekend. The managers have shown real leadership. These reforms clearly \nwill protect America and make a safer and really more prosperous \nAmerica because of the increased security that people can feel with a \nmaximally performing intelligence system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/04/senate-section/article/S10290-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNITION OF THE ASSISTANT MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last week we all did tremendously important \nwork, including the work that was done by Senators Collins and \nLieberman on homeland security. We extended the highway bill until next \nMay. The welfare bill, TANF, was extended. We passed a continuing \nresolution. These are things that did not take a lot of time, but a lot \nof work was entered into with many different groups and people to get \nto where we could complete those three items.\n  Mr. President, I would say through you to the distinguished majority \nleader, this week is going to be tough. We are going to have to have \nthe cooperation of all Members because we not only have just a few days \nleft, but those days are days that are involved with the Vice \nPresidential debate tomorrow and the Presidential debate on Friday. So \nwe really have a lot of work to do. We are going to have to have the \ncooperation of all Members.\n  I think we have had good bipartisan support to move down the road on \nthe homeland security bill. But I think people are going to have to \ntake a look at the amendments they have filed. If an amendment in a \nsubject area has been decided by an overwhelming vote, I think Senators \nshould reconsider whether or not to propose those amendments. Some \nSenators are going to have filed amendments that are germane and they \nare going to have to decide whether or not they want to take the \nSenate's time. It would appear to me a number of these are not going to \npass.\n  So we have a lot of work to do, a very short period of time to do it, \nand I think that with the spirit of getting toward the end of the \nsession, which usually becomes a time for Members to cause problems, we \nhaven't had that in the past several weeks and that has worked out very \nwell. So I hope we can move forward as we have the past 3 weeks. It has \nbeen very rewarding to the Senate and to the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/04/senate-section/article/S10290-3", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last week the Russian Federation began \nthe process of ratifying the Kyoto Protocol on global warming. Russia's \nratification is the crucial step that will bring the Kyoto Protocol \ninto force as an international agreement.\n  In the initial stages of the negotiations, the Senate made clear that \nwe would not be willing to sign any agreement on global warming that \ndid not include scheduled commitments for the developing world in \naddition to the commitments that were being asked of ourselves. This \nwas not a refusal to participate in the Kyoto negotiations, but it was \na guide for what we would find acceptable if we were to actually enter \ninto a treaty.\n\n  The Bush administration misrepresented that guide and decided to \ncompletely walk away from international negotiations on the issue. Now \nit looks as though a majority of the world will begin to move forward \non the issue of global climate change without U.S. participation.\n  President Bush's decision was a profound and strategic mistake for \nour country. The protocol is moving forward now and the United States \nhas very little to say about the direction that it will take. The \nadministration has compounded the error of dropping out of the world \nclimate discussion by failing to come up with a viable climate change \npolicy of its own.\n  Relying solely on voluntary measures as the basis for our climate \nchange strategy has proven to be ineffective in slowing the growth of \nour own greenhouse gas emissions. These voluntary actions have been in \nplace since the previous Bush administration, the administration of \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush. And now they have been repackaged by the \ncurrent Bush administration. The current administration and Republican \nleadership in the House have been so stalwart on this issue that they \nhave opposed efforts in the Senate to even develop modest measures on \nclimate protection, such as a national registry on greenhouse gas \nemissions and a national registry on climate change.\n  The science of climate change is clear. The potential losses to our \neconomy through climate-related disruptions such as the increased \nfrequency of hurricanes and other severe storms is starkly apparent. We \nare putting our own economic security and our competitive edge at risk \nevery day that we delay addressing this issue. The fact that the Kyoto \nProtocol will officially be entered into force is a signal that the \nrest of the world is headed toward a marketplace for more efficient and \ncleaner ways to produce and use energy. But because we in the United \nStates have absented ourselves from\n\n[[Page S10291]]\n\nthe international discussions, we will have a limited role in setting \nthe terms for the development of that marketplace.\n  The costs to our economic competitiveness could be substantial. A \n1999 report by the President's committee of advisers on science and \ntechnology shows that between now and 2050 investments in new energy \ntechnologies in developing nations will likely be between $15 and $20 \ntrillion, accounting for more than half of the global investments in \nenergy supply.\n  Let me restate that. Between $15 and $20 trillion, 90 percent of the \nmarkets for coal and nuclear and renewable energy technologies that are \nexpected to be developed, 90 percent of those markets are outside the \nUnited States. And the question arises: Who will supply those \ntechnologies? Given the right incentives, the United States has the \ntechnical capability and the human resources to lead in this area.\n  A recent edition of Newsweek demonstrated that a large number of U.S. \ncompanies, maybe even a majority, are ready to move forward. These \ncompanies want to take climate change seriously because they are \nfearful of losing a huge part of the growing market for clean energy \ntechnology. Clean energy technology is the future cornerstone of a \nworld market, and we should be vying to capture that market. Instead, \nwe are on a track for a future where we will be buying the technology \nfrom overseas rather than selling the technology to others.\n\n  In contrast to our weak policy on climate change, the Europeans and \nthe Japanese have already made serious commitments to reducing \nemissions with or without Kyoto. They are poised to corner the market \nin the developing world while our discussions on climate are being held \nhostage by those who would like to avoid an honest discussion of the \nissue. The longer we play politics, the wider this gap will grow as the \nEuropeans and the Japanese and others develop more efficient vehicles \nand cleaner and superior ways to produce energy.\n  Mr. President, I recently visited China, and the Chinese are \ndeveloping at a rapid pace. My impression from that visit was of the \nenormous number of coal-fired powerplants that are scheduled to be \nbuilt in that country over the next two decades.\n  This development illustrates why it is important to engage the \ndeveloping world in climate negotiations. But by walking away from the \ntable over 3 years ago, the administration did not improve its ability \nto cause that engagement to occur. Our misguided refusal to engage in \nthe issue lets everyone else off the hook.\n  The news of Russia's willingness to go forward with the Kyoto \nProtocol should be a wake-up call to this administration. We should \nseize it as an opportunity for the United States to start showing \nleadership on the issue. Only then can we credibly engage China and the \ndeveloping world. One way of taking that leadership is for the United \nStates to propel itself forward in the development of cleaner and more \nefficient technology. If we do not and if Kyoto goes into force, then \nthe United States will run the risk of falling behind in participating \nin important new markets for energy technology.\n  There are flexibility mechanisms within the Kyoto structure to allow \nthe United States to participate in a global regime, but we need to \ntake our own first steps.\n  Two credible first steps could be, first, for us to strengthen our \nown capabilities for energy technology R, and, second, for us to \ndevelop a robust and verified national registry for greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  With respect to the registry, if the United States is to develop a \nstrategy for helping to achieve a stable climate in the future, knowing \nwhere our emissions are coming from is a necessary first step. The \nSenate has gone on record in favor of such a registry in the last \nCongress and again in this Congress.\n  With time so short in this Congress, frankly, I am not optimistic \nthat we will be able to revisit the issue, but I hope the developments \nin Russia will drive home the need to start a real debate on a \nproactive climate policy, and we need to start taking even modest steps \nto address this extremely important issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/04/senate-section/article/S10291-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10291-S10292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AFTERMATH OF FLORIDA HURRICANES\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to give a report to the \nSenate on the aftermath of our State having been hit by four hurricanes \nand the recovery efforts that are coming along, and, since the Senate \nis planning to recess at the end of this week for some number of weeks \nuntil after the election, when we will come back in a lameduck session, \nit is all the more important that we get appropriated the $10.2 billion \nthat has been requested by the White House for emergency hurricane \nrelief so that all of this emergency relief that is going on can \ncontinue.\n  That is what I want to report to the Senate, having been in Florida \nthis weekend, having been with the volunteers, with FEMA, with the \nState people, and with the local governments. It is amazing how \neverybody is pitching in and working together. Yet the hard reality of \nsome parts of our State having been hit by three hurricanes, and \nespecially along the Middle Eastern coast, what is called the treasure \ncoast of Florida, having been hit at almost identically the same place \nby two major hurricanes, having winds sustained at 120 miles per hour \nwhen it hit the coast, with gusts up to 135 miles an hour, naturally \npeople are reeling, they are tired and, in some cases, their patience \nis running out.\n  For example, in several mobile home parks I visited this weekend, \nthere are people who cannot inhabit their home. The home is literally \ndestroyed. So where are they staying? Some people are literally staying \nin tents in their front yards because the temporary housing that is \nsupplied by FEMA is being delayed in the delivery. Once the temporary \nhouse is delivered, and it is usually in the form of a small trailer, \nit is set up usually in the driveway of the home so the homeowner can \noversee the complete dismantling of the destroyed home and its removal, \nor the rebuilding and repair of the home if it is salvageable. In many \nother cases, people are staying with friends or with family, but they \nare being delayed in the process of rebuilding their lives until FEMA \ngets in the trailers.\n  I was told in one place that was hard hit--it is in south Brevard \nCounty, right at the Brevard County-Indian County river line, near the \nSebastian River. It is a huge mobile home park called Barefoot Bay. \nBrevard County is my home county. One can image what 120-mile-an-hour \nwinds do to a bunch of mobile homes. Let me tell you what it did. One \ncould surely see the difference between the mobile homes constructed \nafter the new standards imposed after the monster hurricane, Hurricane \nAndrew, hit Florida 12 years ago, and one can see what 120-mile-an-hour \nwinds do to a mobile home that was not built according to those \nstandards.\n  The little pieces of wood that form the ceiling of a mobile home are \nnot very thick or wide. Does anyone think those old construction \nstandards for mobile homes, with a little piece of wood that is a truss \nfor a roof, is going to withstand 120-mile-an-hour winds whipping \naround when the ceiling is not very thick or very wide? It did exactly \nwhat one would expect--it absolutely ripped them up.\n  Another one of the lessons we are learning is that the new building \ncodes are working. As I flew in helicopters across the barrier islands, \nwhen that wall of water came, as well as the 145-mile-an-hour winds on \nthe first hurricane, Hurricane Charley, from that Army National Guard \nhelicopter looking down at the barrier islands, one could clearly see \nwhat was constructed according to the new building codes because it was \nstanding and relatively intact and what was old construction because it \nwas history.\n\n  That scene was replicated after the third hurricane, Hurricane Ivan, \nthat hit the barrier island up in Pensacola beach. It was the same \nscene out of the window of an Army National Guard helicopter: The new \nbuilding codes are working.\n  My message to the Senate, my plea, my begging is that by the end of \nthis week when we leave Washington, we have to have passed at the bare \nminimum the $10.2 billion request which is\n\n[[Page S10292]]\n\nnot only for FEMA and all of the personal loans and grants, the Small \nBusiness Administration low-interest loans so people can rebuild their \nlives as well as their businesses, but also the money that will go to \nour military bases to repair the devastation that has occurred at the \nKennedy Space Center with NASA. All of that is in this money, and we \nhave to be able to rebuild our lives in Florida for the sake of people \nand for the sake of this country.\n  There is something FEMA can do, in addition to getting the temporary \nhousing people are impatiently waiting for. FEMA can also address a \nchronic problem that does not happen just after one hurricane but gets \nmagnified after multiple hurricanes within a 6-week period, and that is \nthe accumulation of debris.\n  As I traveled through the mobile home park of Bombay Estates, it was \nbecause people from the Mormon Church came there over the weekend to \nclean up that debris and stack it in areas so those people could get \nback to their lives. The Red Cross, the Salvation Army--all of these \nprivate organizations are doing such a tremendous job, and yet FEMA is \ntaking the position that it will not reimburse local governments for \npicking up debris unless the debris is on public right of way. That \ndefies reality in Florida.\n  In Florida, we have many huge senior citizen complexes where the \nroads in them are private roads, and yet they are still citizens, they \nare still part of the community, and the debris is accumulating, and \nFEMA says it will not pay for the pickup of that debris.\n  Who is going to pay for it? That is part of what FEMA's disaster \nrelief is for. Is the local government to pay for it? The little cities \nand towns cannot afford all of that expense. So what are they going to \ndo? Assess a fee on all of the senior citizens in this huge senior \ncitizen residential complex?\n  On fixed incomes, the senior citizens cannot afford it. Yet FEMA is \ntaking the position that they will not pay for the pickup of the \ndebris, but it is not a legitimate position.\n  Listen to what section 206.224 of the Code of Federal Regulations \nstates. It states that FEMA may provide assistance to remove debris \nfrom privately owned lands and waters when it is in the public \ninterest.\n  What is in the public interest? It is in the public interest to \neliminate a threat to public health and safety.\n  How many canals and water reservoirs did I see littered with debris? \nIf that debris is not picked up, it becomes a hazard for all kinds of \npestilence, not even to speak of the danger. As I went through some of \nthat debris yesterday, a lot of those carports in the mobile home parks \nwere just twisted and flung by 120-mile-an-hour winds. They have sharp \nedges by which people can get really hurt.\n  So I hope we do not have to direct FEMA to do this by putting \nlanguage in the Department of Homeland Security funding bill on FEMA's \nparticular funding. We should not have to do that. FEMA has the \nauthority already. It is just an interpretation of the law, and I think \nthis is clearly a case, in the interest of the public safety and \nwelfare, that FEMA should recognize this is not one hurricane but this \nis four hurricanes within 6 weeks in one State. That is my plea to the \nSenate, to the House of Representatives, and especially to FEMA.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I flew to Las Vegas Friday, and on the way \nout there I read the anniversary edition of Sports Illustrated. It had \nin it what has transpired in the world of athletics during the last 50 \nyears. The thing that struck my eye was Sports Illustrated said the \nmost definitive role model during these past 50 years is not the name \nthat one would think, but it is Lance Armstrong, the cyclist. Out of \nall the athletes, they said Lance Armstrong was the most positive role \nmodel of all the athletes in some 50 years. The reason that was \nimportant to me is I was going to Las Vegas Friday for an event with \nLance Armstrong.\n  This man has done some tremendous things, and not only athletically. \nJust a few years ago, he was dying of cancer. Many of his sponsors, \nwhen he was sick--in fact, most of them--no longer would support him. \nThey pulled their support and left him for dead because of his advanced \ncancer.\n  We all know that Lance Armstrong is in a class by himself as \na cyclist, but he represents a growing population of cancer survivors.\n\n  In June, the Centers for Disease Control found that the number of \ncancer survivors in the United States had tripled over the past 30 \nyears, a 300-percent increase. Unfortunately, people in my State have \nlower rates of cancer survivorship than our neighboring States.\n  Nevada is home to world-class physicians, but we have lacked a \nresearch institution that can provide cutting edge treatments for \npatients who have been helped by traditional therapies. As a result, \nmany Nevadans have been forced to travel out of State for cancer care \nor to simply forego nontraditional treatments.\n  Just over 2 years ago, a young couple, Jim and Heather Murren, came \nto Las Vegas. Jim Murren came to work for MGM as one of its top \nexecutives, and he was accompanied by his wife, or vice versa, however \none wants to state it. Heather Murren was a financial specialist in New \nYork who worked for a large firm on Wall Street and was an important \nperson in her own right. She came to Las Vegas, and discovered there \nwas a need for a world-class cancer research institute in Las Vegas.\n  It was a vision she had. The Nevada Cancer Institute has taken shape \nat a breathtaking pace. The institute, which is set to open its doors \nnext year, has already assembled a team of world-class scientists. They \nhave recruited Dr. Nicholas Vogelzang, who had been the director of the \nUniversity of Chicago's cancer research center, to direct the new \nNevada Cancer Institute.\n  The Nevada Cancer Institute is offering hope to Nevadans and hope \nthat more Nevadans will beat this dread disease and become like Lance \nArmstrong, a cancer survivor.\n  I mention this today because Friday evening, Nevadans celebrated the \nhope of greater cancer survivorship when Lance and the Tour of Hope \ncyclists rode down the Las Vegas strip. It is not often the Las Vegas \nstrip is closed, but it was closed Friday for a short period of time.\n\n  The Tour of Hope is a week-long journey across America by a team of \n20 cyclists who have been touched by cancer. Some are survivors. Others \nare research scientists, advocates and healers.\n  At the rally in Las Vegas on Friday, the Tour of Hope team members \nshared their inspiring stories. Lance Armstrong spoke about his \nexperience and his passion for cancer research. He has done tremendous \nworks on behalf of cancer patients. He founded the Lance Armstrong \nFoundation, which helps individuals living with, through, and beyond \ncancer. His historic six consecutive Tour de France victories inspired \nmillions of Americans touched by cancer and the Tour of Hope is \ncarrying his message across the country. Every American can help by \nsigning the Cancer Promise, which is a pledge to support the search for \na cure by learning about cancer prevention and research.\n  This weekend I had the opportunity to collect these promises from my \nfellow Nevadans and send them across the country with the Tour of Hope \ncyclists. In addition to signing these promises, many people showed \ntheir support by wearing these simple, little yellow plastic wristbands \nLance had 5 million of these made. They were gone within a couple of \nweeks. Now over 12 million have been sold and millions more are being \nmanufactured: ``Live strong,'' it says. These are to be worn all of the \ntime.\n\n[[Page S10293]]\n\n  Someone who closely watched the debate Thursday night between the \nPresident and Senator Kerry noted Senator Kerry had one of these on \nduring the debate. These bands give hope--hope that lives can be saved \nand this dread disease can be beaten.\n  I am proud of the progress Nevada is making in this fight against \ncancer, but it is still unfortunate that too many Nevadans don't have \naccess to quality health care. More than one in five working adults in \nNevada have no access to health insurance, perhaps the highest rate in \nthe country. Nationally, we know almost 45 million Americans don't have \nhealth insurance, an increase of more than 5 million in just the last 4 \nyears alone.\n  One reason so many Americans are losing their insurance is because \nhealth care costs are spiraling. Employers that do not provide \ninsurance for their employees don't do it because they are cheap or \nthey are mean; they do it because they can't afford it. They know if \nthey have employees with health insurance, they are happier employees.\n  Health insurance premiums have risen by double digits in the last 4 \nyears. Premiums for a family now have reached about $10,000. Rising \npremiums have hit businesses and families, also. An average working \nfamily now pays nearly $2,700 out of their own pockets for premiums, in \naddition to paying deductibles and copayments.\n  It is not just premiums that are going up. The American Association \nof Retired Persons recently reported that, during the first part of \nthis year, prescription drug prices rose more than 3.5 times the rate \nof inflation. The typical senior citizen will pay $191 more for \nprescription drugs this year than last year, and seniors are about to \nget hit with the largest Medicare premium increase in the history of \nthe program. Monthly Medicare premiums will increase by $11.60 next \nyear.\n  Today I am hopeful about the gains we are making in the fight against \ncancer, but I also know we must do more to get health care costs under \ncontrol. Unfortunately, the President's Medicare bill that passed last \nyear was a huge giveaway to big insurance companies and drug companies. \nI happen to think the drug companies and the big insurance companies \ncan take care of themselves. We need to look out for working families \nwho have lost their health insurance, families who are struggling with \nrising premiums and copayments, and senior citizens who are being \npounded by the rising costs for prescription drugs.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, many Americans watched the debate between \nthe President and Senator Kerry last week. It was a huge audience, and \nI think that is encouraging because this is a very important election. \nVery important decisions will have to be made by the American voters. \nAs always, the issues they were debating are very critical--foreign \npolicy issues, the war on terrorism, the situation in Iraq.\n  My thoughts now, as I have thought all year, are that this is a time \nfor America to have a sure and steady hand at the tiller. There are a \nlot of difficult situations around the world. There are a lot of \nimportant decisions that must be made and commitments have been made \nthat must be honored. Of course, one of the greatest commitments of all \nis the commitment we made to the men and women in uniform--men and \nwomen serving all over the world, including Afghanistan and Iraq. We \ndon't need an uncertain trumpet at a time such as this. We don't need \nto be undermining or questioning the job they are doing.\n  Let me emphasize that I don't question anybody's integrity on that, \nand I know everybody supports our troops. But what we say has \nconsequences. We need to be particularly careful when it comes to \nforeign policy.\n  There were a few times last week when I wanted the President to jump \nin and make a challenge or a strong statement. But I know he didn't \nbecause the President of the United States has to think about what it \nwould mean if he was critical in a debate like that about the United \nNations or of a particular country such as, say, France. He withheld \nthe criticism.\n  But we do need consistency and credibility as we go forward with the \nwar on terrorism, as we deal with the situation in Afghanistan, and as \nwe move toward elections in Iraq. I believe we are doing the right \nthing now by going in and taking out some of the insurgents and \nstrongholds in Samarra, and I presume we are going to take some similar \nactions in other parts of Iraq so the people of Iraq can exercise that \ngreat right of freedom, the right to vote.\n  But the areas where I thought more should have been said are three. \nFirst, with regard to North Korea and other parts of the world, Senator \nKerry says we need to have the broadest possible coalition; that we \nshould have a summit; we should have done more at the United Nations; \nwe should have done that, this, or the other. But when it comes to \nNorth Korea, we should have bilateral negotiations between the United \nStates and North Korea. That was tried in the last administration. I \nthought they deserved credit for making a valiant effort. I met with \nformer Secretary of Defense Perry, who negotiated with the North \nKoreans a couple of times. He talked about what they were trying to do. \nBut the fact is, it didn't work; they were cheating.\n  Now, the President has been saying let us exercise patience. Let us \nbring in the Chinese, the South Koreans, the Russians, the Japanese, a \ncoalition, a discussion group of six. That makes sense to me.\n\n  Why a broad coalition in other parts of the world, but when it comes \nto North Korea and a very dangerous situation, we want it to be just \nbetween the United States and North Korea, bilateral? Why don't we take \nadvantage of the interests of our friends and neighbors in that region \nand the Chinese, who certainly have a vested interest in what happens \nin North Korea? Nobody wants North Korea to have nuclear weapons and \nthe ability to deliver them--certainly not the Chinese, the Japanese, \nor the South Koreans. They are right there.\n  I think the President is pursuing the right course when it comes to \nNorth Korea.\n  Another area I have taken an interest in--and I know the Senator in \nthe Chair, the Senator from Nebraska, has looked at this and worked on \nit and worried about it--and that is this question of nuclear \nproliferation and what we do about the nuclear weapons and the nuclear \nmateriels the Russians have.\n  There is a program called Nunn-Lugar that is working to try to deal \nwith that problem. Senator Kerry says we are not doing it fast enough; \nthat what we are doing would take 13 years, and he could condense it to \n4 years. Well, that may be easy to hope for or to say, but you have to \nmake it happen. There is another party in this deal, and they are \ncalled the Russians. They have something to say about proliferation.\n  Would I like to see us do it faster? Should we perhaps put more money \nin this area? Yes. But the administration has been working in this \narea. The funding has gone up, and I think it is very important that we \ndo it in such a way that we can make sure the money is going for what \nit is supposed to; that the money is not siphoned off into corporations \nthat do not do the job and enrich themselves.\n  You can only do so much credibly in a specified period of time. You \nneed to think about that. You need to work with the Russians.\n\n[[Page S10294]]\n\n  That is why a delegation of us went to Russia earlier this year. That \nis why we have a delegation coming from Russia early next year \ncontinuing the dialog between the Senate and the Russian Federation \nCouncil.\n  One of the areas we talked about most with the Russians is this \nparticular area. I know Senator Lugar has worked hard on this issue. \nSenator Lugar goes to the sites. He doesn't just talk to the officials; \nhe looks at the sites to see what has happened.\n  Again, I think there was a problem with what Senator Kerry was saying \nthat was not sufficiently challenged. I am sure it will be challenged \nover a period of time. But the area that really stood out the most to \nme was this question of globalization of the war on terrorism. The \nPresident raised the question: What does that mean? Are you talking \nabout the United Nations? Are you talking about an organization that \nfor 12 years and 13 resolutions talked tough and didn't do anything? \nAre you talking about an organization that was supposed to be watching \nover the Oil for Food Program for the Iraqis that wound up enriching \npeople all over the place and some of our so-called allies being \ninvolved, or corporations in those countries being involved in that \nprogram in a fraudulent way?\n  Is that what he was talking about? Or was he talking about the \nGermans and French?\n  That is where the President exercised discretion in his comments. But \nI have to be more specific. Remember the French? They were the ones who \nhad their Foreign Minister aggressively fighting what we were trying to \ndo at the United Nations by flying all over the world, including to \nAfrica, to specifically try to get people, or nations on the Security \nCouncil at the United Nations, not to be supportive of the broadest \npossible coalition.\n\n  So when he talked about a broader coalition, again, you need to ask \nyourself who is he talking about? Is he talking about just the Germans \nand the French?\n  I also believe there was a problem with diminishing the coalition \nwhich has been helpful--the Brits, the Italians, and the Spanish--until \nthere was a change in administrations--and the Australians. How could \nyou leave out the Australians and the Dutch? And the list goes on and \non.\n  They may not have hundreds of thousands, but they do have hundreds \nand in some cases thousands. They are doing the job, they are part of \nthe coalition, and we should not diminish the sacrifice they are making \nwith their presence but, more importantly, with their men and women. So \nI think when we talk about globalization, we need to be very careful.\n  The President's primary responsibility has to be to the American \npeople. Can we work with other nations? Can we work to have the \nbroadest possible coalition? Can we work with all the international \norganizations? Yes. The President cannot ever cede the responsibility \nfor making the decisions and making decisions for the American people \nto some other entity or to some other country.\n  I think the debate last week was telling. It was of concern to me \nbecause of some of the approaches that were suggested by Senator Kerry.\n  I hope the American people will look at this very carefully. This is \na time for a sure and steady hand, a time for consistency and \ncredibility. President Bush has exhibited all of those traits.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/04/senate-section/article/S10294-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10294-S10295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SENATOR KERRY'S GLOBAL TEST\n\n  Mr. McConnell. Mr. President, during last week's Presidential debate, \nthe junior Senator from Massachusetts claimed that he would only use \npreemptive force to protect the American people if that use of force \npassed something he called a ``global test``.\n  Let me repeat exactly what he said, because it is significant and I \nthink the American people need to hear it again. When asked by \nmoderator James Lehrer if he would use preemptive force, Senator Kerry \nsaid:\n\n       If and when you do it, Jim, you have to do it in a way that \n     passes the test, that passes the global test where your \n     countrymen, your people understand fully why you're doing \n     what you're doing and you can prove to the world that you did \n     it for legitimate reasons.\n\n  I have another test for Senator Kerry. It is called the ``defense of \nAmerica'' test. It is very simple. There is only one question on the \nfinal exam: Would you, as President of the United States, do whatever \nit takes to defend the American people from another terrorist attack?\n  If a President fails this test, Americans could die. Let me repeat \nthat, because this is a very serious matter.\n  If a President fails this all-important test, Americans could die.\n  Let's look at Senator Kerry's record and see how he scores.\n  By insisting that any preemptive strike America might take must pass \na ``global test,'' Senator Kerry would give France, Germany, or the \nU.N. a veto over America's right to self-defense. The final decision to \nprotect America would be made not in the Oval Office but in foreign \ncapitals. The final decision to protect America would be made not by an \nelected American President but by an unelected U.N. diplomats.\n  If America must submit to a ``global test'' before acting to defend \nherself, we may lose the best opportunity to take preemptive action \nwhile our ``global test graders'' dither and delay. Our enemies might \nattack while we await our ``global test grade.'' Terrorists who cut \ninnocents' heads off--gleefully--on camera--won't hesitate to unleash a \nhorrific attack while America waits for its ``global test results.''\n  To cover for his global test, last week Senator Kerry claimed he \nwould do a better job defending the homeland than President Bush. This \ndespite the President's tripling of homeland security funding, creation \nof the Department of Homeland Security, and implementation of the USA \nPATRIOT Act.\n  I am more of a football fan than a hockey fan, but let me make this \nanalogy. Of course we want as strong a homeland defense as possible. \nBut ultimately, homeland defense is like the goalie on a hockey team: a \nlast chance to stop the enemy. The only way to win is to go on offense, \nand by subordinating America's right of preemption, Senator Kerry has \nput his team in the penalty box.\n  Now, let's suppose Senator Kerry passes his ``global test'' and \ndecides to use military force. What kind of military would America \nhave, if he had had his way throughout his 20-year career in this body?\n  He opposed the B-1 bomber that dropped the bombs to destroy the al-\nQaieda training bases and Taliban strongholds in Afghanistan.\n  He opposed the B-2 bomber that drove Saddam Hussein out of his Iraqi \ncommand posts and down a spider hole.\n  He opposed the F-14D Fighter Aircraft that sent missiles into Tora \nBora in the hunt for Osama bin Laden, who Senator Kerry claims to want \nto find.\n  He opposed the Apache helicopter that destroyed the Iraqi Republican \nGuard tanks in Kuwait during the first Persian Gulf war.\n  He opposed the Patriot Missiles that America sent our NATO allies to \nblock the spreading of the Iron Curtain.\n  He has opposed for 20 years a missile defense system, which could be \nthe last line of defense were a rogue nation like North Korea ever to \nlaunch a nuclear weapon.\n  In the debate last week, he opposed the bunker-buster weapons that \ncan knock loose the terrorists who hide in caves deep under the Afghan \ndesert.\n  In 1994, after the first attack on the World Trade Center, he \nproposed cutting intelligence funding by a whopping $5 billion, and \ndefended his proposal on this very floor by saying, ``the madness must \nend.'' Most Senators from his own party, including Senator Kennedy, \nopposed his proposal.\n  He has repeatedly voted against pay raises for the troops now in \nIraq, choosing instead to boost their morale by telling them they are \nfighting the ``wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time.''\n  He voted against the $87 billion for our troops in Iraq, even though \nit included body armor for our soldiers. He then claimed this was a \n``protest'' vote. Let me suggest we should never use our troops as \npawns for protest.\n  Now it is time to grade this test. Again, there is only one question. \nWould you, as President of the United States, do whatever it takes to \ndefend the American people from another terrorist attack?\n  Judging from the best evidence--the only evidence--we have, Senator\n\n[[Page S10295]]\n\nKerry's votes as recorded in the Congressional Record, it is clear he \nis not ready for the final exam.\n  A generation ago, Senator Kerry vigorously attacked America for its \nrole in another war. He claims to have moderated his views since then. \nBut this ``global test'' is strikingly similar to what he said in 1970: \n``I'd like to see our troops dispersed through the world only at the \ndirective of the United Nations.'' He hasn't changed. He wants to turn \nour troops into blue-helmeted human shields.\n  President Bush is playing offense by taking the fight to the \nterrorists, where they live, and he supports giving our military and \nintelligence forces every last tool they need to win the war on \nterrorism. That is the only way to protect America. Only America has \nthe will and the means to protect America from attack, and only this \nAmerican Government has the authority to decide how and when. President \nBush gets that. Senator Kerry does not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner).

Mr. President, I appreciate the comments made by my \nfriend from Kentucky. Certainly those are the discussions going on \ntoday.\n  I take a minute or two to talk about the war on terrorism. We are in \na war on terrorism. We need to conduct that war and take it to the \nterrorists, not here at home. We do have a plan. In war, obviously, the \nplan does not always turn out the way one hopes and we have to change \nfrom time to time.\n  We need to be together on the goals. Our goal is to win. We must do \nwhatever is necessary to win. We should not have all of our \nconversations about this war based on politics. Hopefully that will be \nover soon. We ought to talk about the challenges before the country. We \nneed to support our troops and goal--and that is to win.\n  We are not alone in our effort, although that is talked about \nsometimes. Some 80 nations are working together with us to ensure the \nworld is a safer and a more secure place. The coalition is removing the \nthreat of terrorism and building a foundation to enhance national and \ninternational security.\n  The war being fought in Afghanistan and Iraq is bringing about a \nfundamental change to the environment that has given rise and power to \nthe extremists who export terrorism.\n  Contrary to what those who focus only on the negative would have you \nbelieve, we have some good things to talk about that move us toward \nthis goal of winning over there. Coalition forces have not lost an \nengagement at the platoon level or above in 3 years of war.\n  This terrorist enemy knows we cannot be defeated by him, but he is \nfocused on winning the battle of perception by attacking civilians to \nspread fear among local populations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The \nterrorists' goal is to win the perception battle and to force us to \nlose our will to win.\n  Unfortunately, by trying to exploit the negative aspects of the war, \nsome in our country have fallen into the trap and are unwittingly \nadvancing this cause. This is unfortunate and, quite frankly, very \ncounterproductive to our goal of winning.\n  We have been successful in Iraq and Afghanistan in many ways. Of \ncourse, the situation is still violent. It is still volatile. It is not \nthe way we would like it to be, and much more remains to be done. But, \nagain, we will succeed by focusing on success and by moving toward our \ngoals.\n  Today, in Afghanistan, coalition and Afghan forces are setting the \nconditions for a stable and safe environment for a successful \npresidential election in October, followed by parliamentary elections \nin the spring.\n  The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan reports that \nover 10 million voters are registered as of August 29 for the October 9 \npresidential election. More than 41 percent of registered voters are \nwomen. This is an unusual kind of change for Afghanistan.\n  Today, more than 18,000 coalition forces, together with the Afghan \nNational Army and Afghan National Police, are increasing their security \noperations in towns and villages. These are tremendous accomplishments \nby any standard. Although several months ago, when I had the privilege \nof attending there, you could tell--you could tell from the kids in \nschool, you could tell from the people on the street--this movement was \ntaking place. Unfortunately, of course, it is being slowed down by the \nterrorist attacks in Iraq.\n  Despite the negativity coming from the President's opponents, the \nUnited States remains fully committed to assisting the Iraqis in \nrestoring security and rebuilding their nation. The Iraqi National \nConference met and has selected the Interim National Council. This \nInterim Council for the Iraqi Government is now planning for elections, \nof course, in January. Some say: Well, can that happen? It will not be \nsmooth. Of course it will not be smooth. To make a transition of this \nkind is not a smooth operation. But the fact is, violence will continue \nto exist and these things will continue to happen. But this movement \ntoward a change in government to self-government will persist.\n  The enemy obviously is unscrupulous and will do anything, including, \nof course, the killing of innocent children, to stop this movement \ntoward freedom from taking seed.\n  Overwhelmingly, however, the people of Iraq want to rebuild their \ncountry and to defend it from fringe groups that wish to tear it apart. \nThe largest single contributor to Iraq's security is that effort of \nIraqi people who continue to step forward to join the various Iraqi \nsecurity forces. More than 230,000 Iraqis serve as part of \ntheir country's security force, with another 20,000 in training. Again, \nI had the opportunity to visit some of these training facilities, and \nthey were new at that time, they were still becoming efficient at that \ntime. You could sense this was happening, and there was a commitment on \nthe part of Iraqis to do some things that were much different than they \nhad been accustomed to.\n\n  They have been trained and are on duty in areas including police \nservice, national guard, border enforcement, the Iraq Army, and the \nIraqi intervention force.\n  Now, there are those who may say: I know, but they are not doing very \nwell on the borders. Of course not. It takes time to do these things. \nThis an extreme change from what they were doing in the past. We also \nknow in our own country how difficult it is for border protections.\n  So while performance varies in regions, Iraqi security forces \ncontinue to improve. And they are recruiting additional persons to \nstrengthen their efforts to be very successful.\n  I think it is clear that the Iraqi people have much at stake in \ndefeating the terrorist insurgency, and they are indeed taking on this \nburden which, of course, is exactly what has to be done in order to \ntransfer the governance and the security of Iraq to the Iraqi people--\nour goal.\n  They need our unequivocal support, not talk of cutting and running, \nbecause the mission is difficult. All of us knew it was going to be \ndifficult. Again, we have to go back to the basis of terrorism; we have \nto go back to 11 September; we have to go back to the previous gulf war \nwhere the agreements made by Saddam Hussein were never put in place.\n  So all those things go in to where we are. Where we are now, you can \nargue about, but that is where we are. We need to win. We need to be \npositive. We need to be supportive of our troops and of our commitment. \nOur goals are lofty, and the road, of course, has not been easy and \nwill not be easy in the future. There will be tough times before we are \nthrough. But we must remain resolute and be sure the job is completed \nand that we win. Because only by fostering freedom and democracy and \nhope in these oppressed regions of the world can we truly root out and \ndefeat the terrorist threat we have faced and continue to face today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President. The bill is now officially \nbefore the Senate. It is open for amendment. We have great deal of work \nto do on this legislation, as the Presiding Officer is well aware. I do \nanticipate many votes later today, starting at 4:15. I do anticipate a \nlate session tonight in order to make considerable progress on the \nbill.\n  In addition, I want to alert my colleagues to the fact that the \nmajority leader, with the consent of the Democratic leader, did file a \ncloture motion last week that will ripen tomorrow morning. So we are \ndetermined to make good progress on this bill. We made a great deal of \nprogress last week. Negotiations continued over the weekend. But we \nhave to finish this highly significant bill. That is the leader's \nintention. It is the floor managers' intention. And we will be working \nlong and hard to do so both tonight and tomorrow night.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S10297]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair, in a helpful way, wishes to inform \nthe Senate that under the previous order, at the hour of 4:15 today, \nthe Senate will proceed to a series of votes on the pending amendments \nwith 2 minutes equally divided for debate prior to each vote.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, first, I congratulate Senator Collins and \nSenator Lieberman for their very fine work on this bill. Anyone who has \nwatched this debate has to be very impressed by the work they have done \nin, frankly, a relatively short period of time. They have held a number \nof hearings. They have diligently worked on this bill and brought the \nbill to the floor.\n  I came to the floor last week and asked my colleague from Maine some \nquestions. I thought she had some very good answers. As I expressed at \nthat time--and I have made no secret of this--I have always been \nconcerned that any bill we produce, in fact, give the head of our \nintelligence enough authority, enough power to actually get the job \ndone. And that was my concern. Frankly, that was the nature of my \nquestions to my colleague from Maine last week.\n  I come to the floor this morning to express my concerns about the \nByrd amendment. My reading of the Byrd amendment is, frankly, that it \nwould strike at the heart of the Collins-Lieberman bill. I believe if \nthe Byrd amendment were to be adopted, all my worst fears would be \nrealized, and we would end up with a bill that would look like it was \ngiving power to this new head of intelligence in this country, but, in \nfact, that person would not really have the requisite power they \nneeded.\n  I wonder if I may ask my friend and colleague from Maine several \nquestions about her interpretation of the Byrd amendment.\n  My understanding is that the Byrd amendment begins, on the copy I \nhave, on page 27 of the bill and strikes the title ``Transfer or \nReprogramming of Funds and Transfer of Personnel within NIP.''\n  I wonder if my colleague shares my concerns about the danger of this \namendment. I think, frankly, this is a gutting amendment. I wonder what \nher reaction to that is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, if the Senator from Ohio will yield, I \nwill be happy to respond to his question. The Senator from Ohio is \nexactly right. The amendment offered by the Senator from West Virginia \nwould greatly weaken the authority of the national intelligence \ndirector to move funding and people. That is one of the most important \nreforms made by this legislation. That is one reason I am strongly \nopposed to the amendment offered by the Senator from West Virginia.\n  I believe the Senator from Ohio is exactly right, that were the \namendment to pass, it would severely undermine the reforms called for \nby the 9/11 Commission to create a NID with real authority. That means \nthe authority over the budget, over the people in the national \nintelligence program, the authority to set priorities, and certainly \nthe Byrd amendment would greatly weaken that authority.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I appreciate very much my colleague's response. That is \nthe way I read this. As I expressed when I was on the floor last week, \nreally what we need to do is to empower this person, this new position \nwith the authority to get the job done. Never again do we want to be in \na position where the head of intelligence of this country can come \nbefore the committee and say: I do not have enough power; I do not have \nthe authority to get the job done; I could not move people around; I \ndid not have the budget authority.\n  That, I think, is what my two colleagues who are on the floor right \nnow have tried to craft with this bill. If you look at this particular \nsection, it talks about the transfer of people and the transfer of \nmoney, and the ability of that person to be able to do that and to be \nthe prime mover, the prime person who could do that.\n  Never again should the head of intelligence in this country really be \nsubservient to anybody else. Yes, they should consult. Yes, they should \ninvolve other people. But they certainly should be the prime person.\n  I wonder if I may ask my colleague--I see Senator Lieberman on the \nfloor--I know some people do have concerns with the way the Senator has \nwritten the bill, that other agencies would not be consulted. With the \nway the Senator has written the bill, would the new head of \nintelligence consult other agencies and be involved with other agencies \nwith regard to these very essential decisions?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, through you, I am pleased to respond to \nthe Senator from Ohio. I thank him for his questions. The direct answer \nis that in the proposal Senator Collins and I have put down, the \nnational intelligence director, in formulating the national \nintelligence budget, as distinguished from the military tactical \nintelligence joint budget, would be required to consult with the heads \nof the relevant intelligence agencies in formulating his budget, but we \nmake very clear that the budget authority for the national intelligence \nbudget ought to go to the national intelligence director, both in terms \nof final recommendations to the Office of Management and Budget and the \nPresident, but then that the money must come to the national \nintelligence director before it goes to those constituent agencies. \nThat is a critical element of the authority that we want to establish \nin the national intelligence director where there is none.\n  We had repeated testimony before our committee from Secretary Powell, \nfrom former Directors of Central Intelligence that without budget \nauthority, they are ineffective, they have no clout.\n  In addition to constricting, as the Senator from Ohio has made clear, \nthe authority of the national intelligence director under the Collins-\nLieberman proposal to transfer both personnel and funds, the Byrd \namendment does dramatically undercut that budget authority by, if I can \nstate this to the best of my ability in lay people's language, removing \nthe authority of the new national intelligence director to have budget \naccounts at the Treasury Department, which would mean that the only way \nTreasury could transfer money to the national intelligence director was \nback through the Department of Defense. That is exactly what we are \ntrying to change.\n  Mr. DeWINE. If I may ask an additional question for Senators who are \nwatching today, maybe the answer is obvious, but what is the importance \nof that distinction, the inability to do that, having that money go \nthrough the Defense Department as opposed to the national intelligence \ndirector?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. It is just such a strange circumstance with which I \nbelieve many members of our committee were surprised to find, that the \nintelligence budget, including the CIA budget, the Central Intelligence \nAgency right now, goes through the Department of Defense before it gets \nthere. Obviously, the Defense Department is an important user of \nintelligence, perhaps the most important, so is the State Department, \nthe President, and the Homeland Security Department.\n\n  The current situation is a little bit--let me see if I can think of \nan analogy, and I know this is farfetched--where the budget of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission went through the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. It may be a little farfetched. Maybe it went \nthrough one of the other Departments that is slightly more related. It \nmakes no sense.\n  Again, we are trying to create authority here, and authority in this \ntown, as we kept hearing over and over, is built on money, budget \nauthority, and this amendment would remove that authority from the \nnational intelligence director and, therefore, weaken that position. I \nfear it would get us back to where we are now, where we do not have \nthat authority with anyone in the intelligence community and no one is \nin charge.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I wonder if I may ask my colleague another question. As \none looks at the language throughout the bill that Senator Collins and \nSenator Lieberman have crafted, they have made a distinction between \nthe national intelligence programs and the nonnational intelligence \nprograms, given certainly the authority over the national intelligence \nprograms and what they described as far as the budget authority, \nexecution authority over\n\n[[Page S10298]]\n\nthose to the national intelligence director.\n  The other programs that are not national intelligence programs \ncontinue to remain, then, with other departments--for example, the \nDefense Department--is that correct?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I am sorry? I missed the question.\n  Mr. DeWINE. The other programs that are not national intelligence \nprograms would not come under, then, the national intelligence \ndirector?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. That is correct. We tried to draw some lines. They are \nnot always clear because there are a lot of programs that overlap, but \nto say that anything in the national intelligence budget should go to \nthe national intelligence director, that is his or her job. There are \nother programs that are uniquely the work of the Defense Department--I \nam going to put it another way: that are totally used by the Defense \nDepartment for tactical intelligence to support the work of one service \nof the military or a joint military action. But those assets are not \nused for anything else in our intelligence community nonmilitary and, \nof course, they should go for budget control to the Secretary of \nDefense.\n  Mr. DeWINE. That is the way the Senator's bill is written?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Absolutely. We preserve that. There are one or two \namendments that are seeking still to clarify that break that we will \ndebate and vote on I would guess before this bill is finally \nconsidered, but that is exactly what we have done in the underlying \nbill.\n  Mr. DeWINE. When I came to the Senate floor last week, I was asking \nquestions of both the Senator from Connecticut and my colleague from \nMaine, and I was happy to hear some of the answers about the Senator's \nunderstanding of this bill that has been drafted, but I am concerned \nthat under the amendment from our colleague from West Virginia, these \npowers would be gone. For example, I asked about the ability to move \npersonnel around, and the Senator assured me under his bill the \nnational intelligence director would be able to move personnel around \nfrom one department to another as long as it was a national \nintelligence program. Is it the Senator's understanding under the \namendment from our colleague from West Virginia that power would be \ngone?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I say through the Chair, that power would be seriously \nlimited, which is to say the personnel transfers under the amendment \nwould have to be done in accordance with procedures to be developed by \nthe national intelligence director with the concerned department head \nand only for periods up to 1 year, and that is a constriction that says \nto the national intelligence director: You do not have the latitude to \ndo what you think is necessary to protect the national security \ninterests. This is a little bit like saying to a general: You can only \nmake a decision for a short period of time in moving your troops around \nto better confront the enemy and achieve victory. It makes no sense. It \nis a critical part of the overall proposal of our bill and the 9/11 \nCommission.\n  If the Senator from Ohio would give me a moment, this morning, the \nFamily Steering Committee composed of families of victims of 9/11 sent \na letter to every Senator commenting on some of these amendments. With \nregard to this amendment introduced by the Senator from West Virginia, \nNo. 3845, they say that the 9/11 Commission has stated repeatedly that \nthe power of the purse is critical for the national intelligence \ndirector position. S. 2845, the underlying bill, provides for the \nnational intelligence director to be empowered with budget execution \nand transfer authorities. The NID also needs to be able to transfer \npersonnel in response to threats, which is what the Senator's question \ngoes to. So the families conclude: In summary, we oppose amendment No. \n3845 introduced by the Senator from West Virginia and others because it \nreduces the authority of the national intelligence director.\n\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, if the Senator from Ohio would yield on \nthat point.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I sure will.\n  Ms. COLLINS. The amendment offered by our colleague from West \nVirginia would actually give the national intelligence director less \nauthority than the DCI has under current law to move people and money \naround to address urgent needs. It not only would undo the reforms in \nour bill, it is a step back from current law.\n  Under the Byrd amendment, aggregate transfers from a department or \nagency would be limited to $100 million or 5 percent of the funds \navailable to the department or the agency. There is no such limitation \nin current law. The amendment offered by the Senator from West Virginia \nnot only undermines the reforms in this bill and significantly would \nweaken the authority of the NID to move people and money to meet urgent \ncompelling needs, but it actually is weaker than the authority that the \nDirector of the CIA now has. I just wanted to make that point. I know \nthe Senator from Ohio is aware of that as well.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague for her answer, and that is \nsomething that should alarm all the Members of the Senate. I believe \nthere is a general consensus--certainly there is in the intelligence \ncommunity, a general consensus at least, and I think there is among \nMembers of the Senate--that the power of the DCI today is not enough, \nand to think that we would be thinking about passing a bill that would \npass with this amendment possibly that would weaken the head of our \nintelligence agencies and give that person less power to me is a \nshocking thought.\n  I believe our whole goal should, in a very responsible, rational way, \ncreate a new system, which this bill has done, to empower one person to \nhave the authority to run the intelligence in this country. I am \nafraid, as this discussion has pointed out between my colleagues and \nmyself, that the Byrd amendment will take us actually in the wrong \ndirection. It is a weakening amendment. At least for this Member, it is \na gutting amendment. It, frankly, would make it impossible for me to \nvote for this bill. It would destroy the power of the head of \nintelligence, this new position, and it would be the wrong thing to do. \nIt is very well intended, but it would be a very serious mistake. This \ndiscussion we just had certainly brings that out.\n  Again, I want to congratulate my colleagues. They have done a very \ngood job in trying to deal with all of the diverse needs we have in the \nintelligence community, the Defense Department, and all the other \nagencies. It has been a very tough job, and I congratulate them for \ntheir work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to thank our friend and \ncolleague from Ohio for both his thoughtful consideration of this \nlegislation and his very relevant questions this morning, which I do \nbelieve help to illuminate the consequences on one of the amendments we \nare going to vote on today.\n  Last week, the Senator was here in a less friendly posture. It is \nalways better to have him on our side, and I thank him very much for \ncaring enough about this critically important legislation to come over \nand be part of this debate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3845\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in a few hours the Senate will vote on the \nByrd-Stevens-Inouye-Warner amendment. That amendment's purpose is to \nensure that the new national intelligence authority is held accountable \nto the people's representatives in the Congress. Let me say again, the \namendment which I have offered on behalf of myself and Mr. Stevens, Mr. \nInouye, and Mr. Warner has a purpose, that purpose being to ensure that \nthe new national intelligence authority, the NID, is held accountable \nto the people's representatives in the Congress.\n  Last Friday, I spoke about the Englishmen who spilled their blood to \nwrest the power of the purse away from\n\n[[Page S10299]]\n\nmonarchs, over many centuries, in England. Their struggle was enshrined \nin Article I, section 9 of the U.S. Constitution, which I hold in my \nhand, the Constitution of the United States--the struggle of Englishmen \nacross many centuries, even prior to 1215 when the barons yielded, the \ngreat Magna Carta was agreed to by King John, a mighty monarch. And \nwhat does that section 9 of Article I say?\n\n       No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in \n     Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular \n     Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all \n     public Money shall be published from time to time.\n\n  Not just some of the moneys, all of the moneys. How then, I ask \nSenators, can a regular account of public money be kept if the Congress \nempowers a new intelligence director to spend money without regard to \nappropriations law and without regard to this Constitution?\n  This is a debate about power. Make no mistake about it. It is a \ndebate about power and who should wield it--the elected representatives \nof the people or an unelected, unaccountable bureaucrat nestled deep \ninside our Nation's intelligence agencies.\n  It goes to the heart of the balance of power between the executive \nand the legislative branches of Government. I took an oath to support \nand defend that Constitution, and I have tried to do that now, I will \nsoon be in my 59th year in government, in politics, in the legislative \nbranches of Government--at the State level and at the national level.\n  Under the pending bill, the Treasury Secretary is authorized to \ncreate appropriations accounts to which the national intelligence \ndirector can transfer funds. Get that. We are talking about an \nunelected bureaucrat who will be able to transfer funds. The Collins-\nLieberman bill includes no limits on how those funds can be used.\n  Let me say, I don't see either of the two managers on the floor but \nthey are listening. I saw Senator Lieberman just a few minutes ago. I \nam sure he is in the premises here. One of the distinguished persons \nwho is aiding the Governmental Affairs Committee in this connection has \nnodded in the affirmative. So I am not talking behind Senator \nLieberman's back. He is here. He knows very well what I am saying, and \nI am sure he will be very ready to counter my arguments. I respect him \nfor that.\n  Let me say again, under the pending bill, the Treasury Secretary is \nauthorized to create appropriations accounts to which the national \nintelligence director can transfer funds. The Collins-Lieberman bill \nincludes no limits on how those funds can be used once they are \ntransferred. Under current law, the intelligence director would be \nauthorized to transfer up to $3.5 billion from the defense budget, \ngiving this director enormous transfer authority never contemplated by \nthe Congress.\n  That places the Congress on the defensive. The Congress would have to \nact retroactively to transfers made by the national intelligence \ndirector, allowing the intelligence director to spend funds without \nadequate oversight by the Congress.\n  I remind Senators that in 1996, the National Reconnaissance Office--\nthe Government's spy satellite agency--was discovered to have stashed \naway billions of dollars into a reserve that was not reported to the \nCongress. While the proponents of the bill before the Senate argue that \nthe national intelligence director needs strong budget authority to \nfight the war on terror, Senators should understand that the \nintelligence director can use that authority for activities that have \nnothing to do with the war on terror. The intelligence director could \nuse this sweeping transfer authority to circumvent the limitations \nimposed by the Congress, the elected representatives of the American \npeople. It has happened before, and it will happen again. It can happen \nagain and very likely it will happen again.\n  Senators Collins and Lieberman have argued that our mandate here \ntoday is to implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations and that \nthose recommendations include an intelligence director with strong \nbudget authority. I respectfully submit that our mandate as Senators--\nmy mandate, at least, as a Senator--first and foremost is to protect \nand defend the Constitution of the United States.\n  We took an oath to do so, and that mandate supersedes any \nrecommendations put forward by any commission, including the 9/11 \nCommission. To provide virtually unchecked flexibility to an \nintelligence director to transfer funds from one account to another \nwould nullify and make meaningless the legislative process of reviewing \nbudget requests from the intelligence agencies. It would nullify and \nmake meaningless congressional decisions about how funds are allocated.\n  Congressional judgment by elected lawmakers--I am elected; I am one \nof the elected lawmakers. From time to time I have to go back before \nthe people and see if they want me to continue in this work. \nCongressional judgment by elected lawmakers would be made subordinate \nto executive judgments by unelected bureaucrats.\n  The power of the purse for which our English ancestors spilled their \nblood and which has protected our democratic institutions and \nindividual rights for centuries would, in a very large measure, pass to \nthe executive branch.\n  I am saying, in essence, that we need more time to discuss this \namendment and to discuss this bill. I don't know what is in the bill. I \nhave read parts of the bill, but I have many other duties to perform, \nand I think we need more time. This is a major bill. This is the very \nsame thing we ran into when we created the Department of Homeland \nSecurity--the very same thing. We are backed up against the wall. The \nidea is you have to pass this. You have to do it. You have to get \nbehind it. And we find we have a lot of problems with that.\n  I sought to have the leadership take a little more time on that bill, \ndiscuss it, debate it, but the leadership didn't choose to take more \ntime.\n  It was the very same way with the nefarious resolution that was \npassed by this Senate on October 11 of 2002 to shift the constitutional \npower to declare war to a single individual; namely, the President of \nthe United States. I pleaded that we have more time. I pleaded on that \nsame occasion--I think it was with Mr. Lieberman and with the other \nmanagers on both sides--please take more time.\n  Here we are shifting the power. Congress says in article I, section \n8, that the Congress shall have the power to declare war. So the \nFramers of the Constitution did not intend for one man to be able to \ndeclare war. The Framers of the Constitution did not intend for one \nbody to put this Nation into a war. It required both bodies. The \nConstitution says Congress--not just the Senate, not just the House--\nCongress, which is a combination of both, Congress shall have power to \ndeclare war. So the Framers meant for that very great question to be \ndecided by a huge body of men. It was men in those days, only men in \nthe Congress of the United States; but, of course, we know what \n``Congress'' meant--for anybody who serves. It is Congress made up of \nthe elected representatives of the American people. So I have a mandate \nto listen to the American people. I have a mandate to exercise whatever \njudgment I have and can bring to bear in my own way to look at these \nthings and to ask questions.\n  So there we were. We passed it in a big hurry. The leadership on both \nsides said: Let's get this behind us. I am talking about the resolution \nthat was passed by the U.S. Senate on October 11, 2002, shifting the \npower, shifting the decision to put this country at war, shifting that \ndecision away from the Congress and handing it over lock, stock, and \nbarrel to one man--the President of the United States. It does not make \nany difference if he is a Democrat or a Republican, that power is his \nand will be in the next President's hand. He will have that power, and \nthe next one, if he or she decides to use it. It will be there for them \nbecause there is no sunset provision in that resolution terminating \nthat power.\n  I sought even to have the Congress adopt an amendment which would \nhave provided for a sunset provision in that power so that within a \nyear or at most 2 years--and the circumstances were set forth in my \namendment calling for a sunset provision, a termination of handing this \npower over to any President, Republican or Democrat. Do you know how \nmany votes I got? Well, I got 31 votes, including my own.\n\n[[Page S10300]]\n\n  I yet am astonished to this very day as to why the Members of the \nSenate of the United States sought not only to give that power to a \nPresident, one man--whether he is Democrat or Republican, that is not \nthe point--shift that power to a President. I said: If we are going to \nbe foolish enough to do that, let's at least have a sunset provision so \nwe can terminate that power. But no, I got 31 votes, including my own--\n31 votes. What a shame that this Senate and the House would give that \npower to an individual and say: It's yours, take it, keep it until we \nin the Congress decide to repeal that provision and take it back. How \nabout that. So the sunset provision was turned down.\n  I asked for more time. Oh, the leadership said: Let's get this behind \nus. The President said: Get it behind you; we have an election coming. \nThat was the manipulation that was wrought to have that key vote occur \njust a few days before the national elections in the year 2002.\n  Why, those Members who were up for reelection, as they voted on that \nresolution, they certainly thought: If I vote against this, what is it \ngoing to do to me and my reelection? People might think I am \nunpatriotic; I better vote for this; man, I have to be reelected; I \nhave to be reelected; I am going to vote for it; I have some questions \nabout it, but I am going to put all questions aside because we have an \nelection coming here. The leadership said: Put it behind us; let's vote \non it, get it behind us.\n\n  I said at the time: You will not get this behind you because this \nPresident is not going to let you get it behind you. It is in his favor \nto make you vote before the election. You might vote differently after \nthe election. No, you have to vote before the election. There we were. \nWe did not have time. I pleaded for time, time, wait until after the \nelection, let's wait to hear what the people have to say.\n  Here again, we are pressed for time. We are going to go out on I \nbelieve it is October 8 presumably for the elections, at least until \nthey are over, so we are in a hurry. Let's not wait until after the \nelection; no, let's get this behind us. We have to do what the \nCommission says. What about the Constitution? We are legislating in a \ntremendous hurry, and that is not good.\n  Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in his appearance before \nthe Appropriations Committee said that ought to be put off. You need, I \nbelieve he said, 6 or 8 months. I am not sure I am quoting him \nprecisely. In essence, that was his message: Put it off; don't do it in \na time before an election; don't do it under the heat that is \ngenerated; take your time; this is a measured, measured decision, don't \nrush it through. Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger showed the \ncommittee the names of several other very important dignitaries who, by \ntheir experience, see the reasoning all joined in the suggestion that \nwe take our time. But no, we are brushing that aside, and that was the \ndecision on the part of former Secretaries of Defense--for example, Mr. \nCohen. It included both Republicans and Democrats urging that we take \nmore time. I think we should take more time here because we are doing \nsome dangerous things in this bill.\n  My amendment will keep the power of the purse where it belongs, not \nin the hands of the intelligence community but here in the hands of the \npeople's elected representatives in the Congress. My amendment retains \nfor the Congress the responsibility for deciding how budget accounts \nfor the intelligence director should be structured while allowing the \nflexibility the Governmental Affairs Committee seeks for the transfer \nof personnel and funding within the intelligence community. My \namendment is an oversight amendment. It guarantees better oversight \nover the way these funds are going to be spent.\n  Normally, when we pass an appropriation, we say to Mr. A, who is head \nof one agency: Here, you take this and you do this, and you do this, \nand you do this, and you do this, and then come back in a year and tell \nus what you did; come back in here tell us what you did with our \nlimitations to do this, do this, but don't do this, don't do this. \nUnder those limitations the agency assures Congress he will live up to \nthe mandate, he will do this, he will do this, and he will not do this \nthat Congress said don't do.\n  Well, that is not going to be the case. This national intelligence \ndirector will do whatever he wants to do, and then there will not be \nthose limitations, either, on him or her. He is not going to be \nelected. He is going to be another bureaucrat--and I do not mean to \nspeak in any derogatory manner concerning bureaucrats because we have \nto have them--but they are not elected by the people.\n  All these seats--these chairs, as I call them--were here many years \nbefore I came, and they are filled with Members who are elected by the \npeople of their respective States. We have to answer to those people.\n  This amendment limits the transfer of funds to $100 million or to 5 \npercent of the Department or Agency budget, whichever is the lesser. \nSenators should realize that even with the limitations included in this \namendment, the intelligence director is granted significant authority \nto transfer funds. He would still have significant authority. Given the \nhistory, though, of abuses of power and the violation of civil \nliberties that have taken place within our intelligence community, I \ncannot imagine Senators condoning such sweeping budget transfer \nauthority.\n  Hear me, Senators. We should take time. We are talking about rushing \nthrough a massive change, one which will have some bearing upon this \nConstitution which we are sworn to support and defend, and yet we are \ngoing to do it with our ears closed, our eyes closed, and our voices \nunheard.\n  We are being pressured to act fast before we go home on October 8. I \ncannot imagine Senators condoning such sweeping budget transfer \nauthority. Common sense and history suggest that if one man is given \ncontrol of our intelligence agencies and one man is given control over \nfunds appropriated to those agencies, abuses can occur, may occur, and \nin all probability will occur at some point in time. Those abuses may \nmanifest themselves in the violations of civil liberties, your \nliberties. They may manifest themselves in scandals such as those at \nAbu Ghraib prison, or they may manifest themselves as they did in the \nlead-up to the war in Iraq through politicized intelligence. Therein \nlies a great danger.\n  The New York Times, on Sunday, wrote a very lengthy article--read \nit--entitled, ``How the White House Embraced Disputed Arms \nIntelligence.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from the New York Times be \nreprinted in the Record at the close of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cochran). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the article explores how senior \nadministration officials, including President Bush and Vice President \nCheney, ``repeatedly failed to fully disclose the contrary views of \nAmerica's leading nuclear scientists'' when asserting in 2002 that \nSaddam Hussein was rebuilding his nuclear weapons program. The article \nreads:\n\n       They sometimes overstated even the most dire intelligence \n     assessments . . .\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n     yet minimized or rejected strong doubts of nuclear experts.\n\n  The article goes on:\n\n       Today, 18 months after the invasion of Iraq, investigators \n     there have found no evidence of . . . a revived nuclear \n     weapons program.\n\n  Secretary of State Colin Powell said last Friday he regretted the \nadministration's claims that Iraq had stockpiles of weapons of mass \ndestruction in making its case for war.\n  So the gut-wrenching question for the Senator from Maine is--hear \nme--if we do this intelligence reorganization hurriedly, are we willing \nto launch our next preemptive war based on the presumption that our \nhandiwork has corrected our intelligence problems? That is a very \nserious question.\n  I will say it again: The gut-wrenching question for you, Robert C. \nByrd, and for every other Member of the Senate, remains: if we do this \nintelligence reorganization hurriedly, as we are doing, are we willing \nto launch our next preemptive war based on the presumption that our \nhandiwork has corrected our intelligence problems?\n  Think about it. That should sober one up. The question remains, and \nwe\n\n[[Page S10301]]\n\nare going to be held to it by the American people and by that \nConstitution: If we do this intelligence reorganization hurriedly, are \nwe willing to launch our next preemptive war based on the presumption \nthat our handiwork has corrected our intelligence problems?\n  I say to Senators, again, preemptive attack is the official policy of \nthis Government. Preemptive attack today, under the Bush \nadministration, is the official policy of this Government.\n  Remember also that preemption is totally antithetical to the U.S. \nConstitution because it clearly cuts the Congress out of decisions to \ngo to war. Preemption by its very nature precludes congressional \ndebates or approval of resolutions before commencing to shed the blood \nof our sons and our daughters. Preemption stands on its face \nantithetical, opposite, 180 degrees, to this Constitution, which says \nthat the Congress shall have power to declare war; the Congress, \nmeaning a group of people, two bodies, made up of men and women \nrepresenting all of the States of this Union. Congress shall declare \nwar, not one man. But the doctrine of preemption tells us the \nPresident--the President, not the Congress--the President shall have \npower to declare war. That is the preemptive doctrine. That great power \nmay send your son, your daughter, your grandson, your granddaughter to \nwar. Who says so? One man, the President of the United States.\n\n  So on its face it is unconstitutional. How can a President declare \nwar without doing it clandestinely, secretly? If he wants to bomb a \ncertain country, he is not going to take it up with the Congress. He \nwants to be secret about this because that strike has to be preemptive. \nHow can it be preemptive if it is going to be debated by the Members of \nthe United States Senate? It can't be preemptive.\n  Let us remember that intelligence--remember, this is not just Robert \nByrd saying this--let us remember that the intelligence was manipulated \nto get us into the Iraq war. Will it not be more easily manipulated in \nthe hands of one intelligence chief, a partisan chief more free than \never to tweak intelligence to please a President? It may be a \nDemocratic President. Does that make it any better? No. That makes no \ndifference.\n  It is comforting to believe that our intelligence agencies will not \nbe manipulated for political gain, but it is also naive to believe \nthat. To turn over to a greater degree the power of the purse to \nshadowy figures in the intelligence community is to invite abuses like \nthose that lead to scandal and to the disgrace of the United States in \nthe eyes of the international community.\n  Think of what we are doing here. It is just like it was when we had \nthat resolution before the Senate on which the Senate voted on October \n11, 2002. There is not another Senator on this floor, except the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, who is presently \npresiding over this body, and myself, two Senators. A major question is \nbefore the Senate. We are talking about your oversight duties as a \nMember of the Senate, as you chair or as you serve on a committee--your \noversight; the oversight powers of the Congress, provided for in the \nConstitution of the United States. Yet we are saying, Well, forget it.\n  The Congress must preserve its power to rein in--not just because it \ncan but because the people expect it of the Congress--our Nation's \nintelligence agencies and to rein in the executive branch when abuses \nlike these occur.\n  Further, we must do all we can to ensure that the new intelligence \npositions created by the Collins-Lieberman bill are held accountable to \nthe Congress; in other words, to the people. This Constitution, in its \nfirst three words, says, ``We the people . . . .'' So we have a \nresponsibility. We have a duty to the people we represent to see that \nthese people are held accountable to the Congress.\n  On page 47, the pending bill creates four deputy national \nintelligence director positions as executive level 2 appointments, the \nequivalent of a Deputy Secretary of Defense or State. Yet none of these \nnew positions is subject to Senate confirmation. How about that? The \nCongressional Research Service informs me that these deputy \nintelligence directors would be--listen to this--the only executive \nlevel 2 appointments in our Government not subject to confirmation by \nthe Senate. There you have it. These people are going to have \ntremendous responsibilities, but I am informed that these deputy \nintelligence directors would be the only executive level 2 appointments \nin our Government not subject to Senate confirmation.\n\n  So it is clear that more needs to be done to ensure accountability to \nthe Congress. How much thought was given to this in the distinguished \ncommittee? How much thought was given to this in the Commission that \nrecommends to the Congress these reforms? These clearly mean that more \nneeds to be done to ensure accountability to the Congress. The \nintelligence failures of 9/11 and the intelligence failures in Iraq are \nin part a testament to the dire consequences of the Congress abdicating \nits constitutional duties. The Congress was rushed, as it oftentimes \nis--rushed, pressured--could be pressured by circumstances only, but \nthat is not quite the case. Congress was rushed into creating a \nhomeland security department, and, in the process, it ceded authorities \nto the executive branch over organization and personnel matters. The \nresult has been an underfunded homeland security agency whose \neffectiveness has been compromised, to some extent, by turf wars and \nbureaucratic resistance.\n  So we rushed consideration of the war resolution with Iraq, and in \nthe process ceded the constitutional authority to declare war to the \nWhite House. The result has been a rush to war marked by foreign policy \nfailures and scandals, with the death toll rising daily and with no end \nin sight to the chaos in Iraq.\n  What a pickle. What a pickle we have put ourselves in. Now the \nCongress is confronted with an intelligence reform bill, proposing to \ncreate a national intelligence director who will command 15 \nintelligence agencies and a $40 billion budget. Rather than learn from \nour mistakes, rather than take the time to thoughtfully consider this \nmatter outside of Presidential politics, we are being pushed to finish \nthis bill within a handful of days, finish this bill within a shirt-\ntail full of days, and to cede control over the allocation of the \nresources to the intelligence community.\n  Think about it. Think what you are doing. Think what you are about to \ndo, Senators. National security experts are pleading with the Congress \nto stop for a minute. Hold on, here. Hold on, they say. Stop for a \nminute to think about what it is doing.\n  The Appropriations Committee heard from a bipartisan array of \nwitnesses urging the Congress to slow down.\n  What is the hurry? What is the hurry?\n  The list is impressive. These men are not Members of the Congress. \nListen to them, though. They are saying, slow down. David Boren, former \nSenator from the State of Oklahoma, former chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee in the Senate.\n  Here is another former Senator, Bill Bradley, saying let's slow down \nhere. Slow down. Where is the hurry? Frank Carlucci, former Secretary \nof Defense under President Reagan. Here is a more recent Secretary of \nDefense, former Member of this body, a Republican, William Cohen. \nRobert Gates, Gary Hart, former U.S. Senator; Henry Kissinger, former \nSecretary of State; John Hamre.\n  In the case of some of these, their titles have momentarily escaped \nme.\n  Sam Nunn, former Senator from the State of Georgia and chairman of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee;\n  Warren Rudman, Republican, former Senator from New Hampshire; George \nShultz, former Secretary of State, Republican--there you have it, an \nimpressive roster of Republicans and Democrats who rendered great \nservice to this country in one form or another. They are saying slow \ndown. What is the hurry? What is the hurry? They are former Senators, \nformer Department of Defense Secretaries, former Secretaries of State, \nRepublicans and Democrats, all making the same plea: ``Racing to \nimplement reforms on an election timetable is precisely the wrong thing \nto do.''\n  That is not Robert Byrd saying that. Robert Byrd is quoting these \nluminaries, and Robert Byrd feels the same way they do.\n  ``Racing to implement reforms on an election timetable is precisely \nthe wrong thing to do. Intelligence reform\n\n[[Page S10302]]\n\nis too complex and too important to undertake at a campaign breakneck \nspeed.''\n  They are saying this subject matter deserves a thoughtful, \ncomprehensive approach. Why in Heaven's name are we in all of this big \nhurry? Why is there all of this hurry? I am not saying there shouldn't \nbe reform. I am not saying that at all. I am saying this is a major \nundertaking and we ought to have the time and we ought to take time to \ndebate and ask questions and to try to remove the gremlins that may \ncome to light if we take more time.\n  The Wall Street Journal concluded in August that:\n\n       The larger point here is that there is no need to rush to \n     any quick political fix.\n\n  We may have a different President after the election. He may \nappoint--and probably would--a national intelligence director who will \nbe a different person from that whom the current President may appoint, \nshould he be reelected. We ought not to do this in such a big hurry.\n  The Wall Street Journal continues:\n\n       We are contemplating the biggest change to our intelligence \n     services since 1947, while we are fighting a war against a \n     lethal enemy . . .\n\na war that in large measure has resulted from faulty intelligence.\n  Are we fixing that fault in this bill? Are we dealing with 9/11 in \nthis bill without casting a watchful eye to the future, to Iraq? How \nabout it?\n\n       That work should take some time--and beltway forbid, maybe \n     even a little thought.\n\n  That is a quotation from the Wall Street Journal of the month of \nAugust.\n  The case for stopping and thinking for a moment grows even stronger \nwhen one reads U.S. Circuit Court Judge Richard Posner's critique of \nthe 9/11 Commission's report in the New York Times Book Review. Judge \nPosner writes:\n\n       The enormous public relations effort that the commission \n     orchestrated to win support for the report before it could be \n     digested . . . invites criticism . . . [as does] the \n     commissioners' misplaced, though successful, quest for \n     unanimity. . . . The Commission's contention that our \n     intelligence structure is unsound predisposed it to blame the \n     structure for the failure of the 9/11 attacks, whether it did \n     or not. And pressure for unanimity encourages just the kind \n     of herd thinking now being blamed for that other recent \n     intelligence failure--the belief that Saddam Hussein \n     possessed weapons of mass destruction. . . . For all one \n     knows, the price of unanimity was adopting recommendations \n     that were the second choice [or maybe even the third or \n     fourth choice] of many of the commission's members. . . .\n\n  The larger concern is not only that the Congress, in its rush to act, \nmay botch the implementation of the 9/11 Commission's recommendation, \nbut that those recommendations may not be as well-thought-out as the \npublic relations campaign would have us believe.\n  We are so threatened by the politics surrounding the 9/11 \nCommission's report and the release of its recommendations prior to the \nPresidential election that we stand ready--stand, salute--to abdicate \nour constitutional responsibilities rather than to question or probe \ndeeper into the potential flaws of the Commission's recommendations.\n  I say again it is the same kind of thinking that occurred prior to \nthe vote on the war resolution with Iraq, the same mentality that led \nto the much regretted passage of the PATRIOT Act with only a single \ndissenting vote in this Chamber, and that led to the creation of a \nHomeland Security Department that now struggles with its mission to \nmake Americans safer from terrorism.\n  I urge Senators, I plead with Senators, I beg Senators to consider \ncarefully their vote on this amendment.\n  I am sure there are many Senators who have regretted and will regret \nto their dying day their decision to vote for the Iraq resolution that \nwas passed by this body on October 11, 2002. I am sure many Senators \nhave lived to regret that vote because we were being pressured: Hurry, \nhurry, hurry, get this vote behind us. We don't want to talk more about \nthis. We want to talk about the economy. They will regret it. I have \nhad Senators tell me they regret it.\n  I urge Senators to consider carefully their vote on this amendment. \nAlso, consider this Constitution and the oath I have taken this many \ntimes to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. This \nConstitution provides for adequate oversight. It gives the Congress the \npower, the oversight.\n\n  This bill will, to a considerable extent, take away that power. I am \nnot seeking to undermine the intelligence reforms proposed by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. I seek only to ensure that the Congress \nretain its oversight functions in intelligence and national security \nmatters. We owe it to the people who had faith and confidence in us and \nwho sent us here.\n  We are not elected here, sent here, by any President of the United \nStates. No President tapped me on the shoulder and said, go get him, \nboy, I am going to see that you get it. No President can do that. No \nPresident can tap me on the shoulder and say: Boy, you are gone; you \nwon't be back after this election. No, no President can say that, thank \nGod. No President is king in this country. Not here, no.

Broad and Jeff Gerth)\n\n       In 2002, at a crucial juncture on the path to war, senior \n     members of the Bush administration gave a series of speeches \n     and interviews in which they asserted that Saddam Hussein was \n     rebuilding his nuclear weapons program. Speaking to a group \n     of Wyoming Republicans in September, Vice President Dick \n     Cheney said the United States now had ``irrefutable \n     evidence''--thousands of tubes made of high-strength \n     aluminum, tubes that the Bush administration said were \n     destined for clandestine Iraqi uranium centrifuges, before \n     some were seized at the behest of the United States.\n       Those tubes became a critical exhibit in the \n     administration's brief against Iraq. As the only physical \n     evidence the United States could brandish of Mr. Hussein's \n     revived nuclear ambitions, they gave credibility to the \n     apocalyptic imagery invoked by President Bush and his \n     advisers. The tubes were ``only really suited for nuclear \n     weapons programs,'' Condoleezza Rice, the president's \n     national security adviser, explained on CNN on Sept. 8, 2002. \n     ``We don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.''\n       But almost a year before, Ms. Rice's staff had been told \n     that the government's foremost nuclear experts seriously \n     doubted that\n\n[[Page S10303]]\n\n     the tubes were for nuclear weapons, according to four \n     officials at the Central Intelligence Agency and two senior \n     administration officials, all of whom spoke on condition of \n     anonymity. The experts, at the Energy Department, believed \n     the tubes were likely intended for small artillery rockets.\n       The White House, though, embraced the disputed theory that \n     the tubes were for nuclear centrifuges, an idea first \n     championed in April 2001 by a junior analyst at the C.I.A. \n     Senior nuclear scientists considered that notion implausible, \n     yet in the months after\n     9/11, as the administration built a case for confronting \n     Iraq, the centrifuge theory gained currency as it rose to the \n     top of the government.\n       Senior administration officials repeatedly failed to fully \n     disclose the contrary views of America's leading nuclear \n     scientists, an examination by The New York Times has found. \n     They sometimes overstated even the most dire intelligence \n     assessments of the tubes, yet minimized or rejected the \n     strong doubts of nuclear experts. They worried privately that \n     the nuclear case was weak, but expressed sober certitude in \n     public.\n       One result was a largely one-sided presentation to the \n     public that did not convey the depth of evidence and argument \n     against the administration's most tangible proof of a revived \n     nuclear weapons program in Iraq.\n       Today, 18 months after invasion of Iraq, investigators \n     there have found no evidence of hidden centrifuges or a \n     revived nuclear weapons program. The absence of \n     unconventional weapons in Iraq is now widely seen as evidence \n     of a profound intelligence failure, of an intelligence \n     community blinded by ``group think,'' false assumptions and \n     unreliable human sources.\n       Yet the tale of the tubes, pieced together through records \n     and interviews with senior intelligence officers, nuclear \n     experts, administration officials and Congressional \n     investigators, reveals a different failure.\n       Far from ``group think,'' American nuclear and intelligence \n     experts argued bitterly over the tubes. A ``holy war'' is how \n     one Congressional investigator described it. But if the \n     opinions of the nuclear experts were seemingly disregarded at \n     every turn, an overwhelming momentum gathered behind the \n     C.I.A. assessment. It was a momentum built on a pattern of \n     haste, secrecy, ambiguity, bureaucratic maneuver and a \n     persistent failure in the Bush administration and among both \n     Republicans and Democrats in Congress to ask hard questions.\n       Precisely how knowledge of the intelligence dispute \n     traveled through the upper reaches of the administration is \n     unclear. Ms. Rice knew about the debate before her Sept. 2002 \n     CNN appearance, but only learned of the alternative rocket \n     theory of the tubes soon afterward, according to two senior \n     administration officials. President Bush learned of the \n     debate at roughly the same time, a senior administration \n     official said.\n       Last week, when asked about the tubes, administration \n     officials said they relied on repeated assurances by George \n     J. Tenet, then the director of central intelligence, that the \n     tubes were in fact for centrifuges. They also noted that the \n     intelligence community, including the Energy Department, \n     largely agreed that Mr. Hussein has revived his nuclear \n     program.\n       ``These judgments sometimes require members of the \n     intelligence community to make tough assessments about \n     competing interpretations of facts,'' said Sean McCormack, a \n     spokesman for the president.\n       Mr. Tenet declined to be interviewed. But in a statement, \n     he said he ``made it clear'' to the White House ``that the \n     case for a possible nuclear program in Iraq was weaker than \n     that for chemical and biological weapons.'' Regarding the \n     tubes, Mr. Tenet said ``alternative views were shared'' with \n     the administration after the intelligence community drafted a \n     new National Intelligence Estimate in late September 2002.\n       The tubes episode is a case study of the intersection \n     between the politics of pre-emption and the inherent \n     ambiguity of intelligence. The tubes represented a scientific \n     puzzle and rival camps of experts clashed over the tiniest \n     technical details in secure rooms in Washington, London and \n     Vienna. The stakes were high, and they knew it.\n       So did a powerful vice president who saw in 9/11 horrifying \n     confirmation of his long-held belief that the United States \n     too often naively underestimates the cunning and ruthlessness \n     of its foes.\n       ``We have a tendency--I don't know if it's part of the \n     American character--to say, `Well sit down and we'll evaluate \n     the evidence, we'll draw a conclusion,' '' Mr. Cheney said as \n     he discussed the tubes in September 2002 on the NBC News \n     program ``Meet the Press.''\n       ``But we always think in terms that we've got all the \n     evidence,'' he said. ``Here, we don't have all the evidence. \n     We have 10 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent. We don't know how \n     much. We know we have a part of the picture. And that part of \n     the picture tells us that he is, in fact, actively and \n     aggressively seeking to acquire nuclear weapons.''\n\n\n                       joe raises the tube issue\n\n       Throughout the 1990's, United States intelligence agencies \n     were deeply preoccupied with the status of Iraq's nuclear \n     weapons program, and with good reason.\n       After the Persian Gulf war in 1991, arms inspectors \n     discovered that Iraq had been far closer to building an \n     atomic bomb than even the worst-case estimates had \n     envisioned. And no one believed that Saddam Hussein had \n     abandoned his nuclear ambitions. To the contrary, in one \n     secret assessment after another, the agencies concluded that \n     Iraq was conducting low-level theoretical research and \n     quietly plotting to resume work on nuclear weapons.\n       But at the start of the Bush administration, the \n     intelligence agencies also agreed that Iraq had not in fact \n     resumed its nuclear weapons program. Iraq's nuclear \n     infrastructure, they concluded, had been dismantled by \n     sanctions and inspections. In short, Mr. Hussein's nuclear \n     ambitions appeared to have been contained.\n       Then Iraq started shopping for tubes.\n       According to a 511-page report on flawed prewar \n     intelligence by the Senate Intelligence Committee, the \n     agencies learned in early 2001 of a plan by Iraq to buy \n     60,000 high-strength aluminum tubes from Hong Kong.\n       The tubes were made from 7075-T6 aluminum, an extremely \n     hard alloy that made them potentially suitable as rotors in a \n     uranium centrifuge. Properly designed, such tubes are strong \n     enough to spin at the terrific speeds needed to convert \n     uranium gas into enriched uranium, an essential ingredient of \n     an atomic bomb. For this reason, international rules \n     prohibited Iraq from importing certain sizes of 7075-T6 \n     aluminum tubes; it was also why a new C.I.A. analyst named \n     Joe quickly sounded the alarm.\n       At the C.I.A.'s request, The Times agreed to use only Joe's \n     first name; the agency said publishing his full name could \n     hinder his ability to operate overseas.\n       Joe graduated from the University of Kentucky in the late \n     1970's with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering, \n     then joined the Goodyear Atomic Corporation, which dispatched \n     him to Oak Ridge, Tenn., a federal complex that specializes \n     in uranium and national security research.\n       Joe went to work on a new generation of centrifuges. Many \n     European models stood no more than 10 feet tall. The American \n     centrifuges loomed 40 feet high, and Joe's job was to learn \n     how to test and operate them. But when the project was \n     canceled in 1985, Joe spent the next decade performing hazard \n     analyses for nuclear reactors, gaseous diffusion plants and \n     oil refineries.\n       In 1997, Joe transferred to a national security complex at \n     Oak Ridge known as Y-12, his entry into intelligence work. \n     His assignment was to track global sales of material used in \n     nuclear arms. He retired after two years, taking a buyout \n     with hundreds of others at Oak Ridge, and moved to the C.I.A.\n       The agency's ability to assess nuclear intelligence had \n     markedly declined after the cold war, and Joe's appointment \n     was part of an effort to regain lost expertise. He was \n     assigned to a division eventually known as Winpac, for \n     Weapons Intelligence, Nonproliferation and Arms Control. \n     Winpac had hundreds of employees, but only a dozen or so with \n     a technical background in nuclear arms and fuel production. \n     None had Joe's hands-on experience operating centrifuges.\n       Suddenly, Joe's work was ending up in classified \n     intelligence reports being read in the White House. Indeed, \n     his analysis was the primary basis for one of the agency's \n     first reports on the tubes, which went to senior members of \n     the Bush administration on April 10, 2001. The tubes, the \n     report asserted, ``have little use other than for a uranium \n     enrichment program.''\n       This alarming assessment was immediately challenged by the \n     Energy Department, which builds centrifuges and runs the \n     government's nuclear weapons complex.\n       The next day, Energy Department officials ticked off a long \n     list of reasons why the tubes did not appear well suited for \n     centrifuges. Simply put, the analysis concluded that the \n     tubes were the wrong size--too narrow, too heavy, too long--\n     to be of much practical use in a centrifuge.\n       What was more, the analysis reasoned, if the tubes were \n     part of a secret, high-risk venture to build a nuclear bomb, \n     why were the Iraqis haggling over prices with suppliers all \n     around the world? And why weren't they shopping for all the \n     other sensitive equipment needed for centrifuges?\n       All fine questions. But if the tubes were not for a \n     centrifuge, what were they for?\n       Within weeks, the Energy Department experts had an answer.\n       It turned out, they reported, that Iraq had for years used \n     high-strength aluminum tubes to make combustion chambers for \n     slim rockets fired from launcher pods. Back in 1996, \n     inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency had \n     even examined some of those tubes, also made of 7075-T6 \n     aluminum, at a military complex, the Nasser metal fabrication \n     plant in Baghdad, where the Iraqis acknowledged making \n     rockets. According to the international agency, the rocket \n     tubes, some 66,000 of them, were 900 millimeters in length, \n     with a diameter of 81 millimeters and walls 3.3 millimeters \n     thick.\n       The tubes now sought by Iraq had precisely the same \n     dimensions--a perfect match.\n       That finding was published May 9, 2001, in the Daily \n     Intelligence Highlight, a secret Energy Department newsletter \n     published on Intelink, a Web site for the intelligence \n     community and the White House.\n       Joe and his Winpac colleagues at the C.I.A. were not \n     persuaded. Yes, they conceded, the tubes could be used as \n     rocket casings. But that made no sense, they argued in a new \n     report, because Iraq wanted tubes made at tolerances that \n     ``far exceed any known conventional weapons.'' In other \n     words, Iraq was demanding a level of precision craftsmanship \n     unnecessary for ordinary mass-produced rockets.\n\n[[Page S10304]]\n\n       More to the point, those analysts had hit on a competing \n     theory; that the tubes' dimensions matched those used in an \n     early uranium centrifuge developed in the 1950's by a German \n     scientist, Gernot Zippe. Most centrifuge designs are highly \n     classified; this one, though, was readily available in \n     science reports.\n       Thus, well before Sept. 11, 2001, the debate within the \n     intelligence community was already neatly framed: Were the \n     tubes for rockets or centrifuges?\n\n\n                       Experts Attack Joe's Case\n\n       It was a simple question with enormous implications. If Mr. \n     Hussein acquired nuclear weapons, American officials feared, \n     he would wield them to menace the Middle East. So the tube \n     question was critical, yet none too easy to answer. The \n     United States had few spies in Iraq, and certainly none who \n     knew Mr. Hussein's plans for the tubes.\n       But the tubes themselves could yield many secrets. A \n     centrifuge is an intricate device. Not any old tube would do. \n     Carefully inquiry might answer the question.\n       The intelligence community embarked on an ambitious \n     international operation to intercept the tubes before they \n     could get to Iraq. The big break came in June 2001; a \n     shipment was seized in Jordan.\n       At the Energy Department, those examining the tubes \n     included scientists who had spent decades designing and \n     working on centrifuges, and intelligence officers steeped in \n     the tricky business of tracking the nuclear ambitions of \n     America's enemies. They included Dr. Jon A. Kreykes, head of \n     Oak Ridge's national security advanced technology group; Dr. \n     Duane F. Starr, an expert on nuclear proliferation threats; \n     and Dr. Edward Von Halle, a retired Oak Ridge nuclear expert, \n     Dr. Houston G. Wood III, a professor of engineering at the \n     University of Virginia who had helped design the 40-foot \n     American centrifuge, advised the team and consulted with Dr. \n     Zippe.\n       On questions about nuclear centrifuges, this was \n     unambiguously the A-Team of the intelligence community, many \n     experts say.\n       On Aug. 17, 2001, weeks before the twin towers fell, the \n     team published a secret Technical Intelligence Note, a \n     detailed analysis that laid out its doubts about the tubes' \n     suitability for centrifuges.\n       First, in size and material, the tubes were very different \n     from those Iraq had used in its centrifuge prototypes before \n     the first gulf war. Those models used tubes that were nearly \n     twice as wide and made of exotic materials that performed far \n     better than aluminum. ``Aluminum was a huge step backwards,'' \n     Dr. Wood recalled.\n       In fact, the team could find no centrifuge machines \n     ``deployed in a production environment'' that used such \n     narrow tubes. Their walls were three times too thick for \n     ``favorable use'' in a centrifuge, the team wrote. They were \n     also anodized, meaning they had a special coating to protect \n     them from weather. Anodized tubes, the team pointed out, are \n     ``not consistent'' with a uranium centrifuge because the \n     coating can produce bad reactions with uranium gas.\n       In other words, if Joe and his Winpac colleagues were \n     right, it meant that Iraq had chosen to forsake years of \n     promising centrifuge work and instead start from scratch, \n     with inferior material built to less-than-optimal dimensions.\n       The Energy Department experts did not think that made much \n     sense. They concluded that using the tubes in centrifuges \n     ``is credible but unlikely, and a rocket production is the \n     much more likely end use for these tubes.'' Similar \n     conclusions were being reached by Britain's intelligence \n     service and experts at the International Atomic Energy \n     Agency, a United Nations body.\n       Unlike Joe, experts at the international agency had worked \n     with Zippe centrifuges, and they spent hours with him \n     explaining why they believed his analysis was flawed. They \n     pointed out errors in his calculations. They noted design \n     discrepancies. They also sent reports challenging the \n     centrifuge claim to American government experts through the \n     embassy in Vienna, a senior official said.\n       Likewise, Britain's experts believe the tubes would need \n     ``substantial re-engineering'' to work in centrifuges, \n     according to Britain's review of its prewar intelligence. \n     Their experts found it ``paradoxical'' that Iraq would order \n     such finely crafted tubes only to radically rebuild each one \n     for a centrifuge. Yes, it was theoretically possible, but an \n     Energy Department analyst later told Senate investigators, it \n     was also theoretically possible to ``turn your new Yugo into \n     a Cadillac.''\n       In late 2001, intelligence analysts at the State Department \n     also took issue with Joe's work in reports prepared for \n     Secretary of State Colin Powell. Joe was ``very convinced, \n     but not very convincing,'' recalled Greg Thielmann, then \n     director of strategic, proliferation and military affairs in \n     the Bureau of Intelligence and Research.\n       By year's end, Energy Department analysts published a \n     classified report that even more firmly rejected the theory \n     that the tubes could work as rotors in a 1950's Zippe \n     centrifuge. These particular Zippe centrifuges, they noted, \n     were especially ill suited for bomb making. The machines were \n     a prototype designed for laboratory experiments and mean to \n     be operated as single units. To produce enough enriched \n     uranium to make just one bomb a year, Iraq would need up to \n     16,000 of them working in concert, a challenge for even the \n     most sophisticated centrifuge plants.\n       Iraq had never made more than dozen centrifuge prototypes. \n     Half failed when rotors broke. Of the rest, one actually \n     worked to enrich uranium, Dr. Mahdi Obeidi, who once ran \n     Iraq's centrifuge program, said in an interview last week.\n       The Energy Department team concluded it was ``unlikely that \n     anyone'' could build a centrifuge site capable of producing \n     significant amounts of enriched uranium ``based on these \n     tubes.'' One analyst summed it up this way: the tubes were so \n     poorly suited for centrifuges, he told Senate investigators, \n     that if Iraq truly wanted to use them this way, ``we should \n     just give them the tubes.''\n\n\n                              enter cheney\n\n       In the months after Sept. 11, 2001, as the Bush \n     administration devised a strategy to fight Al Qaeda, Vice \n     President Cheney immersed himself in the world of top-secret \n     threat assessments. Bob Woodward, in his book `` Plan of \n     Attack,'' described Mr. Cheney as the administration's new \n     ``self-appointed special examiner of worst-case scenarios,'' \n     and it was a role that fit.\n       Mr. Cheney had grappled with national security threats for \n     three decades, first as President Gerald R. Ford's chief of \n     staff, later as secretary of defense for the first President \n     Bush. He was on intimate terms with the intelligence \n     community, 15 spy agencies that frequently feuded over the \n     significance of raw intelligence. He knew well their record \n     of getting it wrong (the Bay of Pigs) and underestimating \n     threats (Mr. Hussein's pre-1991 nuclear program) and failing \n     to connect the dots (Sept. 11).\n       As a result, the vice president was not simply a passive \n     recipient of intelligence analysis. He was known as a man who \n     asked hard, skeptical questions, a man who paid attention to \n     detail. ``In my office I have a picture of John Adams, the \n     first vice president,'' Mr Cheney said in one of his first \n     speeches as vice president. ``Adams like to say, `The facts \n     are stubborn things.' Whatever the issue, we are going to \n     deal with facts and show a decent regard for other points of \n     view.''\n       With the Taliban routed in Afghanistan after Sept. 11, Mr. \n     Cheney and his aides began to focus on intelligence \n     assessments of Saddam Hussein. Mr. Cheney had long argued for \n     more forceful action to topple Mr. Hussein. But in January \n     2002, according to Mr. Woodward's book, the C.I.A. told Mr. \n     Cheney that Mr. Hussein could not be removed with covert \n     action alone. His ouster, the agency said, would take an \n     invasion, which would require persuading the public that Iraq \n     posted a threat to the United States.\n       The evidence for that case was buried in classified \n     intelligence files. Mr. Cheney and his aides began to meet \n     repeatedly with analysts who specialized in Iraq and \n     unconventional weapons. They wanted to know about any Iraqi \n     ties to Al Qaeda and Baghdad's ability to make unconventional \n     weapons.\n       ``There's no question they had a point of view, but there \n     was no attempt to get us to hew to a particular point of view \n     ourselves, or to come to a certain conclusion,'' the deputy \n     director of analysis at Winpac told the Senate Intelligence \n     Committee. ``It was trying to figure out, why do we come to \n     this conclusion, what was the evidence. A lot of questions \n     were asked, probing questions.''\n       Of all the worst-case possibilities, the most terrifying \n     was the idea that Mr. Hussein might slip a nuclear weapon to \n     terrorists, and Mr. Cheney and his staff zeroed in on Mr. \n     Hussein's nuclear ambitions.\n       Mr. Cheney, for example, read a Feb. 12, 2002, report from \n     the Defense Intelligence Agency about Iraq's reported \n     attempts to buy 500 tons of yellowcake, a uranium \n     concentrate, from Niger, according to the Senate Intelligence \n     Committee report. Many American intelligence analysts did not \n     put much stock in the Niger report. Mr. Cheney pressed for \n     more information.\n       At the same time, a senor intelligence official said, the \n     agency was fielding repeated requests from Mr. Cheney's \n     office for intelligence about the tubes, including updates on \n     Iraq's continuing efforts to procure thousands more after the \n     seizure in Jordan.\n       ``Remember,'' Dr. David A. Kay, the chief American arms \n     inspector after the war, said in an interview, ``the tubes \n     were the only piece of physical evidence about the Iraqi \n     weapons programs that they had.''\n       In March 2002, Mr. Cheney traveled to Europe and the Middle \n     East to build support for a confrontation with Iraq. It is \n     not known whether he mentioned Niger or the tubes in his \n     meetings. But on his return, he made it clear that he had \n     repeatedly discussed Mr. Hussein and the nuclear threat.\n       ``He is actively pursuing nuclear weapons at this time,'' \n     Mr. Cheney asserted on CNN.\n       At the time, the C.I.A. had not reached so firm a \n     conclusion. But on March 12, the day Mr. Cheney landed in the \n     Middle East, he and other senior administration officials had \n     been sent two C.I.A. reports about the tubes. Each cited the \n     tubes as evidence that ``Iraq currently may be trying to \n     reconstitute its gas centrifuge program.''\n       Neither report, however, mentioned that leading centrifuge \n     experts at the Energy Department strongly disagreed, \n     according to Congressional officials who have read the \n     reports.\n\n\n                        what white house is told\n\n       As the Senate Intelligence Committee report made clear, the \n     American intelligence community ``is not a level playing \n     field when it comes to the competition of ideas in \n     intelligence analysis.''\n\n[[Page S10305]]\n\n       The C.I.A. has a distinct edge: ``unique access to policy \n     makers and unique control of intelligence reporting,'' the \n     report found. The Presidential Daily Briefs, for example, are \n     prepared and presented by agency analysts; the agency's \n     director is the president's principal intelligence adviser. \n     This allows agency analysts to control the presentation of \n     information to policy makers ``without having to explain \n     dissenting views or defend their analysis from potential \n     challenges,'' the committee's report said.\n       This problem, the report said, was ``particularly evident'' \n     with the C.I.A.'s analysis of the tubes, when agency analysts \n     ``lost objectivity and in several cases took action that \n     improperly excluded useful expertise from the intelligence \n     debate.'' In interviews, Senate investigators said the \n     agency's written assessments did a poor job of describing the \n     debate over the intelligence.\n       From April 2001 to September 2002, the agency wrote at \n     least 15 reports on the tubes. Many were sent only to high-\n     level policy makers, including President Bush, and did not \n     circulate to other intelligence agencies. None have been \n     released, though some were described in the Senate's report.\n       Several senior C.I.A. officials insisted that those reports \n     did describe at least in general terms the intelligence \n     debate. ``You don't go into all that detail but you do try to \n     evince it when you write your current product,'' one agency \n     official said.\n       But several Congressional and intelligence officials with \n     access to the 15 assessments said not one of them informed \n     senior policy makers of the Energy Department's dissent. They \n     described a series of reports, some with ominous titles, that \n     failed to convey either the existence or the substance of the \n     intensifying debate.\n       Over and over, the reports restated Joe's main conclusions \n     for the C.I.A.--that the tubes matched the 1950's Zippe \n     centrifuge design and were built to specifications that \n     ``exceeded any known conventional weapons application.'' They \n     did not state what Energy Department experts had noted--that \n     many common industrial items, even aluminum cans, were made \n     to specifications as good or better than the tubes sought by \n     Iraq. Nor did the reports acknowledge a significant error in \n     Joe's claim--that the tubes ``matched'' those used in a Zippe \n     centrifuge.\n       The tubes sought by Iraq had a wall thickness of 3.3 \n     millimeters. When Energy Department experts checked with Dr. \n     Zippe, a step Joe did not take, they learned that the walls \n     of Zippe tubes did not exceed 1.1 millimeters, a substantial \n     difference.\n       ``They never lay out the other case,'' one Congressional \n     official said of those C.I.A. assessments.\n       The Senate report provides only a partial picture of the \n     agency's communications with the White House. In an \n     arrangement endorsed by both parties, the Intelligence \n     Committee agreed to delay an examination of whether White \n     House descriptions of Iraq's military capabilities were \n     ``substantiated by intelligence information.'' As a result, \n     Senate investigators were not permitted to interview White \n     House officials about what they knew of the tubes debate and \n     when they knew it.\n       But in interviews, C.I.A. and administration officials \n     disclosed that the dissenting views were repeatedly discussed \n     in meetings and telephone calls.\n       One senior official at the agency said its ``fundamental \n     approach'' was to tell policy makers about dissenting views. \n     Another senior official acknowledged that some of their \n     agency's reports ``weren't as well caveated as, in \n     retrospect, they should have been.'' But he added, ``There \n     was certainly nothing that was hidden.''\n       Four agency officials insisted that Winpac analysts \n     repeatedly explained the contrasting assessments during \n     briefings with senior National Security Council officials who \n     dealt with nuclear proliferation issues. ``We think we were \n     reasonably clear about this,'' a senior C.I.A. official said.\n       A senior administration official confirmed that Winpac was \n     indeed candid about the differing views. The official, who \n     recalled at least a half dozen C.I.A. briefings on tubes, \n     said he knew by late 2001 that there were differing views on \n     the tubes. ``To the best of my knowledge, he never hid \n     anything from me,'' the official said of his counterpart at \n     Winpac.\n       This official said he also spoke to senior officials at the \n     Department of Energy about the tubes, and a spokeswoman for \n     the department said in a written statement that the agency \n     ``strongly conveyed its viewpoint to senior policy \n     makers.''\n       But if senior White House officials understood the \n     department's main arguments against the tubes, they also took \n     into account its caveats. ``As for as I know,'' the senior \n     administration official said, ``D.O.E. never concluded that \n     these tubes could not be used for centrifuges.''\n\n\n                          a referee is ignored\n\n       Over the summer of 2002, the White House secretly refined \n     plans to invade Iraq and debated whether to seek more United \n     Nations inspections. At the same time, in response to a White \n     House request in May, C.I.A. officials were quietly working \n     on a report that would lay out for the public declassified \n     evidence of Iraq's reported unconventional weapons and ties \n     to terror groups.\n       That same summer the tubes debate continued to rage. The \n     primary antagonists were the C.I.A. and the Energy \n     Department, with other intelligence agencies drawn in on \n     either side.\n       Much of the strife centered on Joe. At first glance, he \n     seem an unlikely target. He held a relatively junior \n     position, and according to the C.I.A. he did not write the \n     vast majority of the agency's reports on the tubes. He has \n     never met Mr. Cheney. His one trip to the White House was to \n     take his family on the public tour.\n       But he was, as one staff member on the Senate Intelligence \n     Committee put it, ``the ringleader'' of a small group of \n     Winpac analysts who were convinced that the tubes were \n     destined for centrifuges. His views carried special force \n     within the agency because he was the only Winpac analyst with \n     experience operating uranium centrifuges. In meetings with \n     other intelligence agencies, he often took the lead in \n     arguing the technical basis for the agency's conclusions.\n       ``Very few people have the technical knowledge to \n     independently arrive at the conclusion he did,'' said Dr. \n     Kay, the weapons inspector, when asked to explain Joe's \n     influence.\n       Without identifying him, the Senate Intelligence \n     Committee's report repeatedly questioned Joe's competence and \n     integrity. It portrayed him so determined to prove his theory \n     that he twisted test results, ignored factual discrepancies \n     and excluded dissenting views.\n       The Senate report, for example, challenged his decision not \n     to consult the Energy Department on tests designed to see if \n     the tubes were strong enough for centrifuges. Asked why he \n     did not seek their help, Joe told the committee: ``Because we \n     funded it. It was our testing. We were trying to prove some \n     things that we wanted to prove with the testing.'' The Senate \n     report singled out that comment for special criticism, \n     saying, ``The committee believes that such an effort should \n     never have been intended to prove what the C.I.A. wanted to \n     prove.''\n       Joe's superiors strongly defend his work and say his words \n     were taken out of context. They describe him as diligent and \n     professional, an open-minded analyst willing to go the extra \n     mile to test his theories. ``Part of the job of being an \n     analyst is to evaluate alternative hypotheses and \n     possibilities, to build a case, think of alternatives,'' a \n     senior agency official said. ``That's what Joe did in this \n     case. If he turned out to be wrong, that's not an offense. He \n     was expected to be wrong occasionally.''\n       Still, the bureaucratic infighting was by then so widely \n     known that even the Australian government was aware of it. \n     ``U.S. agencies differ on whether aluminum tubes, a dual-use \n     item sought by Iraq, were meant for gas centrifuges,'' \n     Australia's intelligence services wrote in a July 2002 \n     assessment. The same report said the tubes evidence was \n     ``patchy and inconclusive.''\n       There was a mechanism, however, to resolve the dispute. It \n     was called the Joint Atomic Energy Intelligence Committee, a \n     secret body of experts drawn from across the federal \n     government. For a half century, Jaeic (pronounced jake) has \n     been called on to resolve disputes and give authoritative \n     assessments about nuclear intelligence. The committee had \n     specifically assessed the Iraqi nuclear threat in 1989, 1997 \n     and 1999. An Energy Department expert was the committee's \n     chairman in 2002, and some department officials say the \n     C.I.A. opposed calling in Jaeic to mediate the tubes fight.\n       Not so, agency officials said. In July 2002, they insist, \n     they were the first intelligence agency to seek Jaeic's \n     intervention. ``I personally was concerned about the extent \n     of the community's disagreement on this and the fact that we \n     weren't getting very far,'' a senior agency official \n     recalled.\n       The committee held a formal session in early August to \n     discuss the debate, with more than a dozen experts on both \n     sides in attendance. A second meeting was scheduled for later \n     in August but was postponed. A third meeting was set for \n     early September; it never happened either.\n       ``We were O.B.E.--overcome by events,'' an official \n     involved in the proceedings recalled.\n\n\n                        white house makes a move\n\n       ``The case of Saddam Hussein, a sworn enemy of our country, \n     requires a candid appraisal of the facts,'' Mr. Cheney said \n     on Aug. 26, 2002, at the outset of an address to the Veterans \n     of Foreign Wars national convention in Nashville.\n       Warning against ``wishful thinking or willful blindness,'' \n     Mr. Cheney used the speech to lay out a rationale for pre-\n     emptive action against Iraq. Simply resuming United Nations \n     inspections, he argued, could give ``false comfort'' that Mr. \n     Hussein was contained.\n       ``We now know Saddam has resumed his efforts to acquire \n     nuclear weapons,'' he declared, words that quickly made \n     headlines worldwide. ``Many of us are convinced that Saddam \n     will acquire nuclear weapons fairly soon. Just how soon, we \n     cannot really gauge. Intelligence is an uncertain business, \n     even in the best of circumstances.''\n       But the world, Mr. Cheney warned, could ill afford to once \n     again underestimate Iraq's progress.\n       ``Armed with an arsenal of these weapons of terror, and \n     seated atop 10 percent of the world's oil reserves, Saddam \n     Hussein could then be expected to seek domination of the \n     entire Middle East, take control of a great portion of the \n     world's energy supplies, directly threaten America's friends \n     throughout the region, and subject the United States or any \n     other nation to nuclear blackmail.''\n       A week later President Bush announced that he would ask \n     Congress for authorization\n\n[[Page S10306]]\n\n     to oust Mr. Hussein. He also met that day with senior members \n     of the House and Senate, some of whom expressed concern that \n     the administration had yet to show the American people \n     tangible evidence of an imminent threat. The fact that Mr. \n     Hussein gassed his own people in the 1980's, they argued, was \n     not sufficient evidence of a threat to the United States in \n     2002.\n       President Bush got the message. He directed Mr. Cheney to \n     give the public and Congress a more complete picture of the \n     latest intelligence on Iraq.\n       In his Nashville speech, Mr. Cheney had not mentioned the \n     aluminum tubes or any other fresh intelligence when he said, \n     ``We now know that Saddam has resumed his efforts to acquire \n     nuclear weapons.'' The one specific source he did cite was \n     Hussein Kamel al-Majid, a son-in-law of Mr. Hussein's who \n     defected in 1994 after running Iraq's chemical, biological \n     and nuclear weapons programs. But Mr. Majid told American \n     intelligence officials in 1995 that Iraq's nuclear program \n     had been dismantled. What's more, Mr. Majid could not have \n     had any insight into Mr. Hussein's current nuclear \n     activities: he was assassinated in 1996 on his return to \n     Iraq.\n       The day after President Bush announced he was seeking \n     Congressional authorization, Mr. Cheney and Mr. Tenet, the \n     director of central intelligence, traveled to Capitol Hill to \n     brief the four top Congressional leaders. After the 90-minute \n     session, J. Dennis Hastert, the House speaker, told Fox News \n     that Mr. Cheney had provided new information about \n     unconventional weapons, and Fox went on to report that one \n     source said the new intelligence described ``just how \n     dangerously close Saddam Hussein has come to developing a \n     nuclear bomb.''\n       Tom Daschle, the South Dakota Democrat and Senate majority \n     leader, was more cautious. ``What has changed over the course \n     of the last 10 years, that brings this country to the belief \n     that it has to act in a pre-emptive fashion in invading \n     Iraq?'' he asked.\n       A few days later, on Sept. 8., the lead article on Page 1 \n     of The New York Times gave the first detailed account of the \n     aluminum tubes. The article cited unidentified senior \n     administration officials who insisted that the dimensions, \n     specifications and numbers of tubes sought showed that they \n     were intended for a nuclear weapons program.\n       ``The closer he gets to a nuclear capability, the more \n     credible is his threat to use chemical and biological \n     weapons,'' a senior administration official was quoted as \n     saying. ``Nuclear weapons are his hole card.''\n       The article gave no hint of a debate over the tubes.\n       The White House did much to increase the impact of The \n     Times' article. The morning it was published, Mr. Cheney went \n     on the NBC News program ``Meet the Press'' and confirmed when \n     asked that the tubes were the most alarming evidence behind \n     the administration's view that Iraq had resumed its nuclear \n     weapons program. The tubes, he said, had ``raised our level \n     of concern.'' Ms. Rice, the national security adviser, went \n     on CNN and said the tubes ``are only really suited for \n     nuclear weapons programs.''\n       Neither official mentioned that the nation's top nuclear \n     design experts believed overwhelmingly that the tubes were \n     poorly suited for centrifuges.\n       Mr. Cheney, who has a history of criticizing officials who \n     disclose sensitive information, typically refuses to comment \n     when asked about secret intelligence. Yet on this day, with a \n     Gallup poll showing that 58 percent of Americans did not \n     believe President Bush had done enough to explain why the \n     United States should act against Iraq, Mr. Cheney spoke \n     openly about one of the closest held secrets regarding Iraq. \n     Not only did Mr. Cheney draw attention to the tubes; he did \n     so with a certitude that could not be found in even the \n     C.I.A.'s assessments. On ``Meet the Press,'' Mr. Cheney said \n     he knew ``for sure'' and ``in fact'' and ``with absolute \n     certainty'' that Mr. Hussein was buying equipment to build a \n     nuclear weapon.\n       ``He has reconstituted his nuclear program,'' Mr. Cheney \n     said flatly.\n       But in the C.I.A. reports, evidence ``suggested'' or \n     ``could mean'' or ``indicates''--a word used in a report \n     issued just weeks earlier. Little if anything was asserted \n     with absolute certainty. The intelligence community had not \n     yet concluded that Iraq had indeed reconstituted its nuclear \n     program.\n       ``The vice president's public statements have reflected the \n     evolving judgment of the intelligence community,'' Kevin \n     Kellems, Mr. Cheney's spokesman, said in a written statement.\n       The C.I.A. routinely checks presidential speeches that draw \n     on intelligence reports. This is how intelligence \n     professionals pull politicians back from factual errors. One \n     such opportunity came soon after Mr. Cheney's appearance on \n     ``Meet the Press.'' On Sept. 11, 2002, the White House asked \n     the agency to clear for possible presidential use a passage \n     on Iraq's nuclear program. The passage included this \n     sentence: ``Iraq has made several attempts to buy high-\n     strength aluminum tubes used in centrifuges to enrich uranium \n     for nuclear weapons.''\n       The agency did not ask speechwriters to make clear that \n     centrifuges were but one possible use, that intelligence \n     experts were divided and that the tubes also matched those \n     used in Iraqi rockets. In fact, according to the Senate's \n     investigation, the agency suggested no changes at all.\n       The next day President Bush used virtually identical \n     language when he cited the aluminum tubes in an address to \n     the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n\n                     dissent, but to little effect\n\n       The administration's talk of clandestine centrifuges, \n     nuclear blackmail and mushroom clouds had a powerful \n     political effect, particularly on senators who were facing \n     fall election campaigns. ``When you hear about nuclear \n     weapons, this is the national security knock-out punch,'' \n     said Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon who sits on \n     the Intelligence Committee and ultimately voted against \n     authorizing war.\n       Even so, it did not take long for questions to surface over \n     the administration's claims about Mr. Hussein's nuclear \n     capabilities. As it happened, Senator Dianne Feinstein, \n     another Democratic member of the Intelligence Committee, had \n     visited the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna in \n     August 2002. Officials there, she later recalled, told her \n     they saw no signs of a revived nuclear weapons program in \n     Iraq.\n       At that point, the tubes debate was in its 16th month. Yet \n     Mr. Tenet, of the C.I.A., the man most responsible for \n     briefing President Bush on intelligence, told the committee \n     that he was unaware until that September of the profound \n     disagreement over critical evidence that Mr. Bush was citing \n     to world leaders as justification for war.\n       Even now, committee members from both parties express \n     baffled anger at this possibility. How could he not know? ``I \n     don't even understand it,'' Olympia Snowe, a Republican \n     senator from Maine, said in an interview. ``I cannot \n     comprehend the failures in judgment or breakdowns in \n     communication.''\n       Mr. Tenet told Senate investigators that he did not expect \n     to learn of dissenting opinions ``until the issue gets \n     joined'' at the highest levels of the intelligence community. \n     But if Mr. Tenet's lack of knowledge meant the president was \n     given incomplete information about the tubes, there was still \n     plenty of time for the White House to become fully informed.\n       Yet so far, Senate investigators say, they have found \n     little evidence the White House tried to find out why so many \n     experts disputed the C.I.A. tubes theory. If anything, \n     administration officials minimized the divide.\n       On Sept. 13, The Times made the first public mention of the \n     tubes debate in the sixth paragraph of an article on Page \n     A13. In it an unidentified senior administration official \n     dismissed the debate as a ``footnote, not a split.'' Citing \n     another unidentified administration official, the story \n     reported that the ``best technical experts and nuclear \n     scientists at laboratories like Oak Ridge supported the \n     C.I.A. assessments.''\n       As a senior Oak Ridge official pointed out to the \n     Intelligence Committee, ``the vast majority of scientists and \n     nuclear experts'' in the Energy Department's laboratories in \n     fact disagreed with the agency. But on Sept. 13, the day the \n     article appeared, the Energy Department sent a directive \n     forbidding employees from discussing the subject with \n     reporters.\n       The Energy Department, in a written statement, said that it \n     was ``completely appropriate'' to remind employees of the \n     need to protect nuclear secrets and that it had made no \n     effort ``to quash dissent.''\n       It closed hearings that month, Congress began to hear \n     testimony about the debate. Several Democrats said in \n     interviews that secrecy rules had prevented them from \n     speaking out about the gap between the administration's view \n     of the tubes and the more benign explanations described in \n     classified testimony.\n       One senior C.I.A. official recalled cautioning members of \n     Congress in a closed session not to speak publicly about the \n     possibility that the tubes were for rockets. ``If people \n     start talking about that and the Iraqis see that people are \n     saying rocket bodies, that will automatically become their \n     explanation whenever anyone goes to Iraq,'' the official said \n     in an interview.\n       So while administration officials spoke freely about the \n     agency's theory, the evidence that best challenged this view \n     remained almost entirely off limits for public debate.\n       In late September, the C.I.A. sent policymakers its most \n     detailed report on the tubes. For the first time, an agency \n     report acknowledged that ``some in the intelligence \n     community'' believed rocket were ``more likely end uses'' for \n     the tubes, according to officials who have seen the report.\n       Meanwhile, at the Energy Department, scientists were \n     startled to find senior White House officials embracing a \n     view of the tubes they considered thoroughly discredited. ``I \n     was really shocked in 2002 when I saw it was still there,'' \n     Dr. Wood, the Oak Ridge adviser, said of the centrifuge \n     claim. ``I thought it had been put to bed.''\n       Members of the Energy Department team took a highly unusual \n     step: They began working quietly with a Washington arms-\n     control group, the Institute for Science and International \n     Security, to help the group inform the public about the \n     debate, said one team member and the group's president, David \n     Albright.\n       On Sept. 23, the institute issued the first in series of \n     lengthy reports that repeated some of the Energy Department's \n     arguments against the C.I.A. analysis, though no classified \n     ones. Still, after more than 16 months of secret debate, it \n     was the first public airing of facts that undermined the most \n     alarming suggestions about Iraq's nuclear threat.\n\n[[Page S10307]]\n\n       The reports got little attention, partly because reporters \n     did not realize they had been done with the cooperation of \n     top Energy Department experts. The Washington Post ran a \n     brief article about the findings on Page A18. Many major \n     newspapers, including The Times, ran nothing at all.\n\n\n                     scrambling for an ``estimate''\n\n       Soon after Mr. Cheney's appearance on ``Meet Press,'' \n     Democratic senators began pressing for a new National \n     Intelligence Estimate on Iraq, terrorism and unconventional \n     weapons. A National Intelligence Estimate is a classified \n     document that is supposed to reflect the combined judgment of \n     the entire intelligence community. The last such estimate had \n     been done in 2000.\n       Most estimates take months to complete. But this one had to \n     be done in days, in time for an October vote on a war \n     resolution. There was little time for review or reflection, \n     and no time for Jaeic, the joint committee, to reconcile deep \n     analytical differences.\n       This was a potentially thorny obstacle for those writing \n     the nuclear section: What do you do when the nation's nuclear \n     experts strongly doubt the linchpin evidence behind the \n     C.I.A.'s claims that Iraq was rebuilding its nuclear weapons \n     program?\n       The Energy Department helped solve the problem. In meetings \n     on the estimate, senior department intelligence officials \n     said that while they still did not believe the tubes were for \n     centrifuges, they nonetheless could agree that Iraq was \n     reconstituting its nuclear weapons capability.\n       Several senior scientists inside the department said they \n     were stunned by that stance; they saw no compelling evidence \n     of a revived nuclear program.\n       Some laboratory officials blamed time pressure and \n     inexperience. Thomas S. Ryder, the department's \n     representative at the meetings, had been acting director of \n     the department's intelligence unit for only five months. ``A \n     heck of a nice guy but not savvy on technical issues,'' is \n     the way one senior nuclear official described Mr. Ryder, who \n     declined comment.\n       Mr. Ryder's position was more alarming than prior \n     assessments from the Energy Department. In an August 2001 \n     intelligence paper, department analysts warned of suspicious \n     activities in Iraq that ``could be preliminary steps'' toward \n     reviving a centrifuge program. In July 2002 an Energy \n     Department report, ``Nuclear Reconstitution Efforts \n     Underway?'', noted that several developments, including \n     Iraq's suspected bid to buy yellowcake uranium from Niger, \n     suggested Baghdad was ``seeking to reconstitute'' a nuclear \n     weapons program.\n       According to intelligence officials who took part in the \n     meetings, Mr. Ryder justified his department's now firm \n     position on nuclear reconstitution in large part by citing \n     the Niger reports. Many C.I.A. analysts considered that \n     intelligence suspect, as did analysts at the State \n     Department.\n       Nevertheless, the estimate's authors seized on the Energy \n     Department's position to avoid the entire tubes debate, with \n     written dissents relegated to a 10-page annex. The estimate \n     would instead emphasize that the C.I.A. and the Energy \n     Department both agreed that Mr. Hussein was rebuilding his \n     nuclear weapons program. Only the closest reader would see \n     that each agency was basing its assessment in large measure \n     on evidence the other considered suspect.\n       On Oct. 2, nine days before the Senate vote on the war \n     resolution, the new National Intelligence Estimate was \n     delivered to the Intelligence Committee. The most significant \n     change from past estimates dealt with nuclear weapons; the \n     new one agreed with Mr. Cheney that Iraq was in aggressive \n     pursuit of the atomic bomb.\n       Asked when Mr. Cheney became aware of the disagreements \n     over the tubes, Mr. Kellems, his spokesman, said, ``The vice \n     president knew about the debate at about the time of the \n     National Intelligence Estimated.''\n       Today, the Intelligence Committee's report makes clear, \n     that 93-page estimate stands as one of the most flawed \n     documents in the history of American intelligence. The \n     committee concluded unanimously that most of the major \n     findings in the estimate were wrong, unfounded or overblown.\n       This was especially true of the nuclear section.\n       Estimates express their most important findings with high, \n     moderate or low confidence levels. This one claimed \n     ``moderate confidence'' on how fast Iraq could have a bomb, \n     but ``high confidence'' that Baghdad was rebuilding its \n     nuclear program. And the tubes were the leading and most \n     detailed evidence cited in the body of the report.\n       According to the committee, the passages on the tubes, \n     which adopted much of the C.I.A. analysis, were misleading \n     and riddled with factual errors.\n       The estimate, for example, included a chart intended to \n     show that the dimensions of the tubes closely matched a Zippe \n     centrifuge. Yet the chart omitted the dimensions of Iraq's \n     81-millimeter rocket, which precisely matched the tubes.\n       The estimate cited Iraq's alleged willingness to pay top \n     dollar for the tubes, up to $17.50 each, as evidence they \n     were for secret centrifuges. But Defense Department rocket \n     engineers told Senate investigators that 7075-T6 aluminum is \n     ``the material of choice for low-cost rocket systems.''\n       The estimate also asserted that 7075-T6 tubes were ``poor \n     choices'' for rockets. In fact, similar tubes were used in \n     rockets from several countries, including the United States, \n     and in an Italian rocket, the Medusa, which Iraq had copied.\n       Beyond tubes, the estimate cited several other ``key \n     judgments'' that supported its assessment. The committee \n     found that intelligence just as flawed.\n       The estimate, for example, pointed to Iraq's purchases of \n     magnets, balancing machines and machine tools, all of which \n     could be used in a nuclear program. But each item also had \n     legitimate non-nuclear uses, and there was no credible \n     intelligence whatsoever showing they were for a nuclear \n     program.\n       The estimate said Iraq's Atomic Energy Commission was \n     building new production facilities for nuclear weapons. The \n     Senate found that claim was based on a single operative's \n     report, which described how the commission had constructed \n     one headquarters building and planned `` a new high-level \n     polytechnic school.''\n       Finally, the estimate stated that many nuclear scientists \n     had been reassigned to the A.E.C. The Senate found nothing to \n     back that conclusion. It did, though, discover a 2001 report \n     in which a commission employee complained that Iraq's nuclear \n     program ``had been stalled since the gulf war.''\n       Such ``key judgments'' are supposed to reflect the very \n     best American intelligence. (The Niger intelligence, for \n     example, was considered too shaky to be included as a key \n     judgment.) Yet as they studied raw intelligence reports, \n     those involved in the Senate investigation came to a \n     sickening realization. ``We kept looking at the intelligence \n     and saying, `My God, there's nothing here,' '' one official \n     recalled.\n\n\n                            The Vote for War\n\n       Soon after the National Intelligence Estimate was \n     completed, Mr. Bush delivered a speech in Cincinnati in which \n     he described the ``grave threat'' that Iraq and its ``arsenal \n     of terror'' posed to the United States. He dwelled longest on \n     nuclear weapons, reviewing much of the evidence outlined in \n     the estimate. The C.I.A. had warned him away from mentioning \n     Niger.\n       ``Facing clear evidence of peril,'' the president \n     concluded, ``we cannot wait for the final proof--the smoking \n     gun--that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud.''\n       Four days later, on Oct. 11, the Senate voted 77-23 to give \n     Mr. Bush broad authority to invade Iraq. The resolution \n     stated that Iraq posed ``a continuing threat'' to the United \n     States by, among other things, ``actively seeking a nuclear \n     weapons capability.''\n       Many Senators who voted for the resolution emphasized the \n     nuclear threat.\n       ``The great danger is a nuclear one,'' Senator Feinstein, \n     the California Democrat, said on the Senate floor.\n       But Senator Bob Graham, then chairman of the Intelligence \n     Committee, said he voted against the resolution in part \n     because of doubts about the tubes. ``It reinforced in my mind \n     pre-existing questions I had about the unreliability of the \n     intelligence community, especially the C.I.A.,'' Mr. Graham, \n     a Florida Democrat, said in an interview.\n       At the Democratic convention in Boston this summer, Senator \n     John Kerry pledged that should he be elected president, ``I \n     will ask hard questions and demand hard evidence.'' But in \n     October 2002, when the Senate voted on Iraq, Mr. Kerry had \n     not read the National Intelligence Estimate, but instead had \n     relied on briefing from Mr. Tenet, a spokeswoman said. \n     ``According to the C.I.A.'s report, all U.S. intelligence \n     experts agree that Iraq is seeking nuclear weapons,'' Mr. \n     Kerry said then, explaining his vote. ``There is little \n     question that Saddam Hussein wants to develop nuclear \n     weapons.''\n       The report cited by Mr. Kerry, an unclassified white paper, \n     said nothing about the tubes debate except that ``some'' \n     analysts believed the tubes were ``probably intended'' for \n     conventional arms.\n       ``It is common knowledge that Congress does not have the \n     same access as the executive branch,'' Brooke Anderson, a \n     Kerry spokeswoman, said yesterday.\n       Mr. Kerry's running mate, Senator John Edwards, severed on \n     the Intelligence Committee, which gave him ample opportunity \n     to ask hard questions. But in voting to authorize war, Mr. \n     Edwards expressed no uncertainty about the principal evidence \n     of Mr. Hussein's alleged nuclear program.\n       ``We know that he is doing everything he can to build \n     nuclear weapons,'' Mr. Edwards said then.\n       On Dec. 7, 2002, Iraq submitted a 12,200-page declaration \n     about unconventional arms to the United Nations that made no \n     mention of the tubes. Soon after, Winpac analysts at the \n     C.I.A. assessed the declaration for President Bush. The \n     analysts criticized Iraq for failing to acknowledge or \n     explain why it sought tubes ``we believe suitable for use in \n     a gas centrifuge uranium effort.'' Nor, they said, did it \n     ``acknowledge efforts to procure uranium from Niger.''\n       Neither Energy Department nor State Department intelligence \n     experts were given a chance to review the Winpac assessment, \n     prompting complaints that dissenting views were being \n     withheld from policy makers.\n       ``It is most disturbing that Winpac is essentially \n     directing foreign policy in this matter,'' one Energy \n     Department official wrote in an e-mail message. ``There are \n     some very strong points to be made in respect to Iraq's \n     arrogant noncompliance with U.N. sanctions. However, when \n     individuals attempt to convert those `strong statements'\n\n[[Page S10308]]\n\n     into the `knock-out' punch, the administration will \n     ultimately look foolish--i.e., the tubes and Niger!''\n\n\n                       The U.N. Inspectors Return\n\n       For nearly two years Western intelligence analysts had been \n     trying to divine from afar Iraq's plans for the tubes. At the \n     end of 2002, with the resumption of United Nations arms \n     inspectors, it became possible to seek answers inside Iraq. \n     Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency \n     immediately zeroed in on the tubes.\n       The team quickly arranged a field trip to the Nasser metal \n     fabrication factory, where they found 13,000 completed \n     rockets, all produced from 7075-T6 aluminum tubes. The Iraqi \n     rocket engineers explained that they had been shopping for \n     more tubes because their supply was running low.\n       Why order tubes with such tight tolerances? An Iraqi \n     engineer said they wanted to improve the rocket's accuracy \n     without making major design changes. Design documents and \n     procurement records confirmed his account.\n       The inspectors solved another mystery. The tubes \n     intercepted in Jordan had been anodized, given a protective \n     coating. The Iraqis had a simple explanation: they wanted the \n     new tubes protected from the elements. Sure enough, the \n     inspectors found that many thousands of the older tubes, \n     which had no special coating, were corroded because they had \n     been stored outside.\n       The inspectors found no trace of a clandestine centrifuge \n     program. On Jan. 10, 2003, The Times reported that the \n     international agency was challenging ``the key piece of \n     evidence'' behind ``the primary rationale for going to war.'' \n     The article, on Page A10, also reported that officials at the \n     Energy Department and State Department had suggested the \n     tubes might be for rockets.\n       The C.I.A. theory was in trouble, and senior members of the \n     Bush administration seemed to know it.\n       Also that January, White House officials who were helping \n     to draft what would become Secretary Powell's speech to the \n     Security Council sent word to the intelligence community that \n     they believed ``the nuclear case was weak,'' the Senate \n     report said. In an interview, a senior administration \n     official said it was widely understood all along at the White \n     House that the evidence of a nuclear threat was piecemeal and \n     weaker than that for other unconventional arms.\n       But rather than withdraw the nuclear card--a step that \n     could have undermined United States credibility just as tens \n     of thousands of troops were being airlifted to the region--\n     the White House cast about for new arguments and evidence to \n     support it.\n       Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff, asked the intelligence agencies for more evidence \n     beyond the tubes to bolster the nuclear case. Winpac analysts \n     redoubled efforts to prove that Iraq was trying to acquire \n     uranium from Africa. When rocket engineers at the Defense \n     Department were approached by the C.I.A. and asked to compare \n     the Iraqi tubes with American ones, the engineers said the \n     tubes ``were perfectly usable for rockets.'' The agency \n     analysts did not appear pleased. One rocket engineer \n     complained to Senate investigators that the analysts had ``an \n     agenda'' and were trying ``to bias us'' into agreeing that \n     the Iraqi tubes were not fit for rockets. In interviews, \n     agency officials denied any such effort.\n       According to the Intelligence Committee report, the agency \n     also sought to undermine the I.A.E.A.'s work with secret \n     intelligence assessments distributed only to senior policy \n     makers. Nonetheless, on Jan. 22, in a meeting first reported \n     by The Washington Post, the ubiquitous Joe flew to Vienna in \n     a last-ditch attempt to bring the international experts \n     around to his point of view.\n       The session was a disaster.\n       ``Everybody was embarrassed when he came and made this \n     presentation, embarrassed and disgusted,'' one participant \n     said. ``We were going insane, thinking, `Where is he coming \n     from?' ''\n       On Jan. 27, the international agency rendered its judgment: \n     it told the Security Council that it had found no evidence of \n     a revived nuclear weapons program in Iraq. ``From our \n     analysis to date,'' the agency reported, ``it appears that \n     the aluminum tubes would be consistent with the purpose \n     stated by Iraq and, unless modified, would not be suitable \n     for manufacturing centrifuges.''\n\n\n                        The Powell Presentation\n\n       The next night, during his State of the Union address, \n     President Bush cited I.A.E.A. findings from years past that \n     confirmed that Mr. Hussein had had an ``advanced'' nuclear \n     weapons program in the 1990's. He did not mention the \n     agency's finding from the day before.\n       He did, though, repeat the claim that Mr. Hussein was \n     trying to buy tubes ``suitable for nuclear weapons \n     production.'' Mr. Bush also cited British intelligence that \n     Mr. Hussein had recently sought ``significant quantities'' of \n     uranium from Africa--a reference in 16 words that the White \n     House later said should have been stricken, though the \n     British government now insists the information was credible.\n       ``Saddam Hussein,'' Mr. Bush said that night, ``has not \n     credibly explained these activities. He clearly has much to \n     hide. The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.''\n       A senior administration official involved in vetting the \n     address said Mr. Bush did not cite the I.A.E.A. conclusion of \n     Jan. 27 because the White House believed the agency was \n     analyzing old Iraqi tubes, not the newer ones seized in \n     Jordan. But senior officials in Vienna and Washington said \n     the international group's analysis covered both types of \n     tubes.\n       The senior administration official also said the \n     President's words were carefully chosen to reflect the doubts \n     at the Energy Department. The crucial phrase was ``suitable \n     for nuclear weapons production.'' The phrase stopped short of \n     asserting that the tubes were actually being used in \n     centrifuges. And it was accurate in the sense that Energy \n     Department officials always left open the possibility that \n     the tubes could be modified for use in a centrifuge.\n       ``There were differences,'' the official said, ``and we had \n     to address those differences.''\n       In his address, the President announced that Mr. Powell \n     would go before the Security Council on Feb. 5 and lay out \n     the intelligence on Iraq's weapons programs. The purpose was \n     to win international backing for an invasion, and so the \n     administration spent weeks drafting and redrafting the \n     presentation, with heavy input from the C.I.A., the National \n     Security Council and I. Lewis Libby, Mr. Cheney's chief of \n     staff.\n       The Intelligence Committee said some drafts prepared for \n     Mr. Powell contained language on the tubes that was patently \n     incorrect. The C.I.A.wanted Mr. Powell to say, for example, \n     that Iraq's specifications for roundness were so exacting \n     ``that the tubes would be rejected as defective if I rolled \n     one under my hand on this table, because the mere pressure of \n     my hand would deform it.''\n       Initelligence analyst at the State Department waged a quiet \n     battle against much of the proposed language on tubes. A year \n     before, they had sent Mr. Powell a report explaining why they \n     believed the tubes were more likely for rockets. The National \n     Intelligence Estimate included their dissent--that they saw \n     no compelling evidence of a comprehensive effort to revive a \n     nuclear weapons program. Now, in the days before the Security \n     Council speech, they sent the secretary detailed memos \n     warning him away from a long list of assertions in the \n     drafts, the intelligence committee found. The language on the \n     tubes, they said, contained ``egregious errors'' and ``highly \n     misleading'' claims. Changes were made, language softened. \n     The line about ``the mere pressure of my hand'' was removed.\n       ``My colleagues,'' Mr. Powell assured the Security Council, \n     ``every statement I make today is backed up by sources, solid \n     sources. These are not assertions.''\n       He made his way to the subject of Mr. Hussein's current \n     nuclear capabilities.\n       ``By now,'' he said, ``just about everyone has heard of \n     these tubes, and we all know there are differences of \n     opinion. There is controversy about what these tubes are for. \n     Most U.S. experts think they are intended to serve as rotors \n     in centrifuges used to enrich uranium. Other experts and the \n     Iraqis themselves argue that they are really to produce the \n     rocket bodies for a conventional weapon, a multiple rocket \n     launcher.''\n       But Mr. Powell did not acknowledge that those ``other \n     experts'' included many of the nation's most authoritative \n     nuclear experts, some of whom said in interviews that they \n     were offended to find themselves now lumped in with a reviled \n     government.\n       In making the case that the tubes were for centrifuges, Mr. \n     Powell made claims that his own intelligence experts had told \n     him were not accurate. Mr. Powell, for example, asserted to \n     the Security Council that the tubes were manufactured to a \n     tolerance ``that far exceeds U.S. requirements for comparable \n     rockets.''\n       Yet in a memo written two days earlier, Mr. Powell's \n     intelligence experts had specifically cautioned him about \n     those very same words. ``In fact,'' they explained, ``the \n     most comparable U.S. system is a tactical rocket--the U.S. \n     Mark 66 air-launched 70-millimeter rocket--that uses the \n     same, high-grade (7075-T6) aluminum, and that has \n     specifications with similar tolerances,''\n       In the end, Mr. Powell put his personal prestige and \n     reputation behind the C.I.A.'s tube theory.\n       ``When we came to the aluminum tubes,'' Richard A. Boucher, \n     the State Department spokesman, said in an interview, ``the \n     secretary listened to the discussion of the various views \n     among intelligence agencies, and reflected those issues in \n     his presentation. Since his task at the U.N. was to present \n     the views of the United States, he went with the overall \n     judgment of the intelligence community as reflected by the \n     director of central intelligence.''\n       As Mr. Powell summed it up for the United Nations, ``People \n     will continue to debate this issue, but there is no doubt in \n     my mind these illicit procurement efforts show that Saddam \n     Hussein is very much focused on putting in place the key \n     missing piece from his nuclear weapons program: the ability \n     to produce fissile material.''\n       Six weeks later, the war began.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I have enormous respect for the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, for his years of experience and his dedication to \nthe Constitution and his ability to protect the rightful prerogatives \nof this body. I do, however, disagree with him, respectfully, on the \ncontents of his amendment.\n\n[[Page S10309]]\n\n  I note, as I said this morning, the limitations in Senator Byrd's \namendment would inhibit the ability of the national intelligence \ndirector to move people and money around to counter the threats facing \nour country. That is a major reform that has been recommended not only \nby the 9/11 Commission but by the witnesses before our committee and is \na major reform supported by the administration.\n  Senator Byrd argues that the transfer authorities in the underlying \nbill cede too much power to the executive branch. But, in fact, the DCI \ncurrently has transfer authorities.\n\n  This is not a novel concept. We give the NID more transfer authority \nthan the DCI currently has, but we are not taking power from Congress \nin any way because our bill does not change the existing process \nthrough which transfers must be approved by the appropriate \ncongressional committees.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say on Senator Byrd's amendment \nlater.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3950 To Amendment No. 3705\n\n  Mr. President, at this point, I would like to take the opportunity to \nclear a pending amendment, so I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I send to the desk a second-degree \namendment to the Collins-Carper-Lieberman-Coleman amendment No. 3705.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator's request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The pending amendment is set \naside.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for herself and Mr. \n     Lieberman, proposes an amendment numbered 3950 to amendment \n     No. 3705.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n            (Purpose: To make certain technical amendments)\n\n       On page 5, after line 2, insert the following:\n       (7) Grant programs under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster \n     Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121-5206).\n       On page 10, line 17, strike the semicolon and all that \n     follows through page 11, line 7, and insert a period.\n       On page 12, line 5, strike ``(5)'' and insert ``(6)''.\n       On page 12, lines 17 through 20, strike ``technical \n     assistance provided by any Federal agency to States and local \n     governments to conduct threat analyses and vulnerability \n     assessments'' and insert ``technical assistance provided by \n     any Federal agency to States and local governments regarding \n     homeland security matters''.\n       On page 18, line 9, insert ``secure'' after ``for''.\n       On page 23, line 18, insert ``on the basis of terrorist \n     threat'' after ``grant''.\n       On page 25, line 24, insert ``on the basis of terrorist \n     threat'' after ``distribute''.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this second-degree amendment addresses \nseveral relatively minor concerns raised by some of the Members of this \nbody and the Department of Homeland Security about the underlying \namendment. I know of no objection to the second-degree amendment. The \nchanges it would make do not in any way affect the funding formula of \nthe underlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of this \namendment. It builds on some extraordinary work done by the bipartisan \nmembership of the Governmental Affairs Committee on a separate bill \nbefore we were assigned responsibility for this intelligence reform \nmonths ago in which the chairman and Senator Carper played leading \nroles. I give them both great credit.\n  There is nothing more difficult than funding formulas around this \nplace, for understandable reasons. I think this amendment strikes the \nright balance in the distribution of homeland security grant funds. The \nbalance is to make certain we apply the dollars across our country in a \nway that protects us against the enemy we face, the terrorist enemy we \nface that is ruthless and unpredictable. To some extent, we think we \nunderstand them. The probabilities are they will strike more at large \ncities and visible and symbolic targets, but the reality is we cannot \nhave our focus on what this enemy will do to us or aspire to do to us, \nbe limited to the dreadful and tragic experience of September 11 in \nwhich they hit visible symbols of America's greatness because this same \nterrorist ilk has struck throughout the world at other kinds of targets \nthat are not so visible, at buses with innocents on them, and other \nmeans of transportation, at gatherings of people in Iraq adjacent to \nplaces where Iraqis are lining up to apply to become security officers.\n  So that is the balance we are trying to strike which is to give \nspecial attention to the larger cities that are more likely to be \ntargets but to understand that in a way that we have never experienced \nin our history before, all of America is potentially a target because \nthese people do not ever play by anybody's rules of warfare. They \nstrike at the most vulnerable targets. That means they could strike \nanywhere.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee spent many months working on this \ncompromise legislation. The amendment incorporates the text of that \nGovernmental Affairs legislation, unanimously approved, to help \nstreamline our funding for first responders around America. It ensures \nthat a very significant part of the homeland security funding will be \ndetermined on the basis of the risks and threats that particular \ncommunities face, which moves us substantially in the direction that \nthe 9/11 Commission recommended.\n  At the same time, this amendment will guarantee that each State, and \ntherefore the localities under the State, continues to receive a \nminimum amount of funding to build up essential capabilities to both \nprevent and respond to a potential terrorist attack.\n  So I am pleased this amendment appears to be acceptable on both \nsides. I join in urging its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as the Senator from Connecticut has \nindicated, the underlying amendment would implement the Homeland \nSecurity Grant Enhancement Act. This legislation is the product of \nthree hearings and 2 years of negotiation on the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. It was approved by a unanimous vote, and it currently has 29 \ncosponsors.\n  It is supported by Senators from big States, such as Michigan and \nOhio, and small States, such as Maine and Delaware. The widespread \nsupport in the Senate demonstrates that the amendment takes a balanced \napproach to homeland security funding. It recognizes that a threat-\nbased funding formula is a critical aspect, but it also preserves and \nrecognizes the fact that first responders in every State stand on the \nfront lines of securing the homeland.\n  I am constantly reminded that two of the hijackers on 9/11 began \ntheir journey of death and destruction from Portland, ME. So small \nStates are not immune from being used as staging grounds for terrorist \nattacks.\n  I think we have come up with a carefully balanced formula that will \nhelp make our Nation safer. Secretary Ridge frequently reminds us that \nhomeland security starts with hometown security. Our legislation \nrecognizes that as well.\n  I note that the legislation is supported by a wide variety of \norganizations, including the National Governors Association, the \nNational Council of State Legislatures, the Council of State \nGovernments, the National Association of Counties, the National League \nof Cities, Advocates for EMS, the International City/County Management \nAssociation, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the Fire Chiefs \nAssociation.\n  I know the Presiding Officer is very familiar with this issue in his \ncapacity as the distinguished chairman of the Homeland Security \nAppropriations Subcommittee, and we have enjoyed working closely with \nhim and his staff as well.\n  I want to mention one aspect of the underlying bill; that is, it \nwould provide greater flexibility in the use of homeland security funds \nso we can ensure that if a State needs to have more training as opposed \nto buying more equipment, there is more flexibility for the use of \nthose funds in a flexible manner via a waiver from the Secretary of \nHomeland Security.\n  This was a particular concern to the Senator from Missouri, Mr. \nTalent. I know having that flexibility will enable our first \nresponders, whether they live in Maine, Missouri, or Mississippi, to be \nbetter prepared.\n\n[[Page S10310]]\n\n  Mr. President, I know of no further requests for debate on the \nsecond-degree amendment nor on the underlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the second-degree amendment \nNo. 3950.\n  The amendment (No. 3950) was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today will \naccept a bipartisan amendment, No. 3705, to the National Intelligence \nReform Act of 2004, S. 2845, offered by Senator Collins, for myself and \neight other cosponsors, that will revise the formula for the allocation \nof State and local homeland security grant funding.\n  Homeland security is a national responsibility shared by all States, \nregardless of size. Each State has basic terrorism preparedness needs \nand, therefore, a minimum amount of domestic terrorism preparedness \nfunds is necessary for each State. Our first responders in each and \nevery State are on the front lines in defending against and preparing \nfor terrorist attacks. We need to ensure that they receive the funding \nthey need to prepare for and respond to such attacks.\n  Recognizing that every State and community should have helped to meet \nthose needs, I authored a minimum formula for State and local basic \nformula grants to emergency responders that are distributed to States \nby the Department of Homeland Security Office of State and Local \nGovernment Coordination and Preparedness. That formula guarantees that \neach State--regardless of size--receives at least 0.75 percent of the \nnational allotment to help meet their national domestic security needs.\n  Congress continues to recognize that every State and community--rural \nor urban, small or large--has basic domestic security needs and merits \nthe Federal help to meet those needs. Both the Senate and House \nHomeland Security appropriations bills for Fiscal Year 2005 keep the \nall-State minimum formula for first responder grants that are \ndistributed to the States.\n  Representatives and officials from urban States and cities have \nargued that Federal money to fight terrorism is sent to areas that do \nnot need it and it is ``wasted'' in small towns. However, Congress has \nshown that it recognizes these highly populated, highly threatened and \nhighly vulnerable areas have terrorism preparedness needs beyond those \nbasic needs for each State. That is why we in the Senate last month \nincluded $1.2 billion for discretionary grants to high-threat urban \nareas for the coming fiscal year. The House-passed Homeland Security \nappropriations bill included $1 billion for the Urban Areas Security \nInitiative.\n  Not all those who are leaders in urban areas believe that every cent \nof State and local homeland security funding should go solely to first \nresponders in our cities. I recall this past August, former New York \nCity Mayor Rudy Giuliani brought a warning to emergency first \nresponders in my home State of Vermont that should serve as a notice to \nall Americans. He said there was no doubt in his mind that another \nserious attack on the United States would be attempted, and he said it \ncould just as easily be small town America rather than another large \ncity.\n  ``The risk of another attack is a very great one. . . . The biggest \ncity and the smallest towns, both had to be prepared,'' he was quoted \nby The Rutland Herald. While in Vermont, Mr. Giuliani publicly lauded \nthe value of the work that first responders in small local communities \ndo day after day. I join him in that praise.\n  I remind my colleagues that the town of Shanksville, PA, where the \nfourth hijacked airliner, United flight 93, crashed on September 11, \n2001, is a tiny town of 245 residents with only one fire truck in a \nsmall fire station. On that day, Shanksville's police officers, fire \nfighters, and EMS officers who raced to the crash site of flight 93 \nwere on the front lines of terrorism response. It is a threat we cannot \nalways predict but one that we must always try to be prepared to meet.\n  Officials in the current administration hold the same view. In an \ninterview published in the 2004 edition of The Year in Homeland \nSecurity, the Director of the Office for Domestic Preparedness, Sue \nMencer, stated the following: . . . `` there should be some base level \nfunding to each state and territory regardless of size or population \ndensity. There are infrastructures everywhere, although they may not be \nso dramatic as a Brooklyn Bridge or Golden Gate. There are critical \nunderground pipelines, highways, bridges that we don't think of \nautomatically but still need to be protected.''\n  Critics of the all-State minimum seem to forget that since the \nSeptember 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, we have asked all-State and \nlocal first responders to defend us as never before on the front lines \nin the war against terrorism. Emergency responders in a rural State \nhave the same responsibilities as those in any urban State to provide \nenhanced protection, preparedness and response against terrorists.\n  Fostering divisions between States ignores the real problem: We \nshould be looking to increase the funds to our Nation's first \nresponders. The Hart-Rudman report on domestic preparedness argues that \nthe U.S. will fall approximately $98.4 billion short of meeting \ncritical emergency responder needs over the next 5 years if current \nfunding levels are maintained. Clearly, the domestic preparedness funds \navailable are still not enough to protect from, prepare for, and \nrespond to future domestic terrorist attacks anywhere on American soil.\n  I am proud to join Senator Collins and my eight colleagues in \ncosponsoring her bipartisan amendment to revise the formula for the \nallocation of State and local homeland security grant funding. This \namendment maintains the 0.75 percent minimum that each State currently \nreceives under the USA PATRIOT Act to help ensure that every State can \nrespond to its preparedness needs, but it also clarifies and recognizes \nthe fact that some States indeed have high-threat areas. I will \ncontinue to oppose any efforts to reduce adequate support and resources \nfor our police, fire, and EMS services in each State and community as \nthey continue to protect us from terrorists or respond to terrorist \nattacks, as well as carry out their other preparedness \nresponsibilities. We should adequately meet the needs of all of our \ndedicated first responders and resist efforts that would pit them \nagainst each other.\n  We must continue our efforts to ensure the readiness of our States \nand communities. Should the United States experience terrorist attacks \nlike those we endured over 3 years ago, I want to make sure that each \npolice officer, firefighter, or rescue worker who responds to those \nattacks has the best training and equipment available to get the job \ndone. I applaud all the hard work of all our State and local emergency \nfirst responders who not only continue to carry out the day-to-day \nresponsibilities they have always had, but also find themselves serving \non the front lines in the war on terrorism.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3705, As Amended\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the \nunderlying amendment, the Collins-Carper-Lieberman-Coleman amendment \nNo. 3705.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nNo. 3705, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 3705), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the motion to table \nis laid on the table.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I note the Senator from North Dakota is \non his feet. I wonder if the Senator could inform us whether he is \nseeking recognition to talk about the bill or offer an amendment or \nmorning business.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I seek recognition to speak about the bill \nand about Senator Byrd's amendment and generally about the subject the \nSenate is considering.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3845\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me say that the Senator from West \nVirginia has done a great service today by\n\n[[Page S10311]]\n\npointing out that there is a substantial difference between flexibility \nand accountability. I cosponsored the amendment offered by Senator \nByrd, not because I want less flexibility but because I demand and \nexpect that we should have accountability in terms of how money is \nspent by the Federal Government, especially in these areas.\n  I don't think there is one instance in which the administration would \nargue they have not been given the flexibility to move funding from one \naccount to another in order to accomplish their specific goals and \npurposes in defeating terrorism. The Congress has been extraordinarily \ngenerous in working with the administration in every conceivable way to \nmove money around to areas where they need that money with which to \nfight terrorism.\n  Senator Byrd, in his amendment, indicates that he thinks we should \ncontinue to have some accountability. Under the pending bill, the \nTreasury Secretary is authorized to create appropriations accounts, to \nwhich the national intelligence director then can transfer funds, and \nthere are really no limits on how those funds would be used at this \npoint.\n  Let me give a short description of some of the angst I have about \nthis when you just provide funding and say: Katey, bar the door, do \nwhat you want, and don't worry about how we feel about it.\n  This is a tiny little issue, but there is a small area down in the \nTreasury Department called the Office of Foreign Asset Control, OFAC. \nIts purpose is to track money that goes to fund and support terrorist \norganizations so we can shut down that funding. That is the purpose of \nOFAC. I found that OFAC has 21 people tracking American tourists \ntraveling to Cuba. These are American citizens who are suspected of \ntrying to take a vacation in Cuba. We have 21 people in an agency \ndesigned to try to interrupt the flow of money to terrorists who are \nnow spending their time trying to shut down travel by the American \npeople to Cuba.\n\n  I will give you an example. A young woman named Joni Scott went to \nCuba. She didn't have a license to go there. She went there to \ndistribute free Bibles on the streets of Havana and other Cuban cities. \nShe is a devoutly religious young woman. I have met with her. She went \nto Cuba to distribute free Bibles. OFAC tracked her down and slapped \nher with a $10,000 fine because she didn't have a general license to go \nto Cuba.\n  And there is Joan Slote, a 76-year-old grandmother who likes to ride \nbicycles, who signed up with a Canadian company for a bicycle tour of \nCuba. She happens to be a senior Olympian who rides bicycles in the \nSenior Olympics. They tracked her down and slapped a $10,000 fine on \nher. It was later reduced, but they decided they were going to try to \nattach her Social Security check because she did not pay her fine on \ntime. That was because she had been in Europe. She rushed back home \nwhen her son had a brain tumor and was dying, went to her son's \nbedside, and was not at home to get her mail. What was her \ntransgression? She was an American who decided to ride a bike in Cuba.\n  My point is this: This is a rather small agency, OFAC. And when Paul \nO'Neill was the Secretary of the Treasury, I asked him at a hearing, \nbecause I was the chair of the appropriations subcommittee--I said: Mr. \nSecretary, wouldn't you really prefer to use all of those assets at \nOFAC to track terrorists? He didn't answer for three or four times. \nFinally, about the fifth time, he said: Of course.\n  If I had my choice, that would be the most productive thing. We now \ndiscover that more and more of those people at OFAC are being used to \ntrack Americans who travel to Cuba. I don't understand that. But it \ngoes to the point that Senator Byrd has made. Should we have some \naccountability? When we decide to take the taxpayers' money and \nappropriate that money, should we have some accountability with respect \nto how the money is spent? This isn't about Republicans or Democrats, \nconservatives or liberals; it is about accountability.\n  My colleague from West Virginia, a unique, extraordinary Senator, \noften pulls from his pocket that well-worn and underlined copy of the \nConstitution and he asks whether the Senate is carrying out its \nresponsibility. Because after all, this is a Government with several \nbranches. We want to work together. We certainly all want to fight \nterrorism. There is no question about that. We are willing to \nappropriate the funds with which to combat terrorism, but we are not \nall willing to say: By the way, here is the check, spend it the way you \nwant. Congress needs to be involved.\n  This is not about turf. This amendment described today by Senator \nByrd is a bipartisan amendment. But it is not about turf. It is about \nRepublicans and Democrats together who have joined to take a look at \nthis issue and say: In this circumstance, we believe there ought to be \nsome fundamental accountability.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I appreciate what the Senator said. I must say that \nSenator Collins and I in crafting the underlying bill were very careful \nto make sure we did not diminish the accountability the national \nintelligence director will have to the internal executive branch budget \nprocedures or to Congress. There is a movement of authority here. The \nmovement of authority is from the Department of Defense to the national \nintelligence director. The Byrd amendment would eliminate that, would \nforce the money to go back to the Department of Defense.\n  I want to assure the Senator that internally the limits of transfer \nauthority in our bill are quite clear. The national intelligence \ndirector has to get approval from the Office of Management and Budget.\n  More to the point, on congressional oversight, our legislation \ndoesn't alter today's balance between the executive and legislative \nbranch at all. For example, on page 28, paragraph (4) of the bill:\n\n       Any transfer of funds under this subsection shall be \n     carried out in accordance with existing procedures applicable \n     to reprogramming notifications for appropriate congressional \n     committees.\n\n  Page 29, paragraph (5)(A):\n\n       The National Intelligence Director shall promptly submit to \n     appropriate committees of Congress a report on any transfer \n     of personnel . . .\n\n  And finally: ``Any transfer of funds or personnel cannot exceed \napplicable ceilings established in law for such transfer'' by that \nCongress.\n  So my question is why my friend from North Dakota thinks in any way \nthis proposal, which does move budget authority from the Defense \nDepartment to the national intelligence director, alters the authority \nof Congress to hold these people accountable?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I cosponsored the amendment not because of \nwhat I think but because of what I know. Let me describe for the \nSenator from Connecticut a circumstance that I believe means less \naccountability for the Congress and a circumstance that puts the \nCongress in a position of having to act retroactively with respect to \nan action that is already taken which dramatically changes the \nprerogatives of Congress.\n  As I understand it, under the bill, the Secretary of the Treasury is \nauthorized to create appropriations accounts to which the national \nintelligence director then can transfer funds. As I further understand \nit, the underlying bill includes no limits on how those funds can be \nused once they are transferred.\n  As I understand it, the intelligence director would be authorized to \ntransfer about $3.5 billion from the defense budget, and that gives the \ndirector a substantial amount of transfer authority never contemplated \nby Congress. The circumstance is that Congress would have to take \naction only retroactively to transfers that are made by the national \nintelligence director, which means that director begins and works to \nexpend funds by their own volition.\n  My colleague from Connecticut indicates that they must get approval \nfrom the Office of Management and Budget. I would point out, that is \njust the administration giving itself approval to do what it wants. \nThat is not a check and balance of any type.\n  My point is this: Once these transfers are made into this account and \nfrom the account, the only action that would then be available to \nCongress is some retro-action to say that is not what we intended. That \nputs Congress in a circumstance that, in my judgment, is \ndisadvantageous for the body\n\n[[Page S10312]]\n\nin this Government that has the power of the purse.\n  I go back to this point, and this is a small point, but it is one \nthat is instructive to me: If we do not tell those for whom we \nappropriate money how we want those funds to be spent, then, Katey, bar \nthe door. Then you have a circumstance of the type I just described to \nmy colleagues. I bet there is not one colleague in this Chamber who \nwould stand up and say this young woman named Joni Scott should have \nbeen fined for going to Cuba to distribute free Bibles. I bet there is \nnot one person in this Chamber who would stand up and say: I think we \nought to fine a good Christian, a young woman who goes to Cuba and \ndistributes free Bibles.\n  That is what the people in OFAC are doing. They are tracking people \ndown, such as Joni Scott. That is not the intent, in my judgment. When \nwe appropriate funding--and we are going to appropriate a lot of it--we \nare in every circumstance accommodating to the administration when it \nneeds to move money for a good purpose, to combat terrorism. When we \nappropriate that money, we demand accountability. We expect and demand \naccountability. That is what the Byrd amendment provides.\n  It is not a radical amendment. First of all, it is bipartisan, and, \nsecond, it is just the most fundamental step that, in my judgment, we \nought to take as a Congress because we, after all, are the ones who \ndecide how much the American people pay in taxes, what do they have to \nprovide for Government, and then we are the stewards of how that money \nis spent.\n  Without this amendment, we have lost control over the stream of this \nfunding. That is why I was a cosponsor of the Byrd amendment, again a \nbipartisan amendment.\n  I think it is the right thing for us to do.\n  I must say to my colleague from Connecticut, I honestly do not think \nthis amendment in any way undermines the Collins-Lieberman bill. I \nthink, frankly, it will strengthen that bill and say to every Member of \nthe House and Senate, Republicans and Democrats: We are going to do \nthis in a way that requires accountability. What better message, in my \njudgment, than that message? So I actually think it strengthens the \nunderlying bill.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, if I may respond.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Then I will be happy to yield back.\n  There is a misunderstanding, and I want to see if I can clarify it. \nThere are three parts of the amendment offered by the Senator from West \nVirginia and others. Two have to do with transfers of personnel and \nmoney and whether they can be limited in any way.\n  We believe it is not right for Congress to limit the authority--here \nI mean amounts of money or personnel of the nature of how long the \nnational intelligence director, whom I have been calling the general we \ndo not have now of our intelligence forces, can transfer personnel or \nmoney to fight the war on terrorism, to plug a gap that he sees \nexisting in his ranks, to respond to a crisis that occurs somewhere in \nthe world. That is the kind of flexibility we want to give him. That is \nsubject to oversight, but that is a limitation on the power the \nnational intelligence director has in our bill, recommended by the 9/11 \nCommission, supported by the families of those who died on 9/11.\n  That is one part. We can argue about that. But it is definitely a cut \nin the authority of the national intelligence director to help us wage \nwar on terrorism.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I can reclaim my time for a moment on \nthat point because I think this is a fruitful discussion, the authority \nin the underlying bill given to the national intelligence director is \nextraordinary and above that which we provide in most other \ncircumstances with respect to appropriations. The two Senators may well \nintend that. I expect they do intend that. Our only point is there has \nnever been a circumstance, to my knowledge, where someone has come to \nus on an urgent basis saying, We need to plug this hole, we need to \nmove funds, there has never been a circumstance in which the Congress \nsays: No, you cannot do that. We have always said: Absolutely, let us \nwork with you.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to make clear again, there is an \nalteration of authority and accountability here but not between the \nexecutive branch and Congress. The alteration of authority and \naccountability is between agencies of the executive branch, between the \nDefense Department and the national intelligence director because, as \nhas been said over and over--and talk about accountability, we are \nspending, by most estimates--and I cannot say the exact number because \nit is classified--we spend over $40 billion a year on our intelligence \nagencies, and the 9/11 Commission and Members of this Congress know it \nand tell us there is no one in charge. What kind of accountability is \nthat?\n  One of the main purposes of this bill is to put someone in charge, \nthe national intelligence director, and to hold him accountable.\n  I want to repeat, there is nothing in this bill--there may be some \nalteration of authority that comes through in the congressional \noversight reforms that are coming from Senator McConnell and Senator \nHarry Reid among different committees of the Congress, but all the \nreview and approvals that Congress has for appropriations now will \nexist when this bill passes. But the national intelligence director \nwill have more authority than the Director of Central Intelligence has \ntoday. It is true the Department of Defense, which currently, \nstrangely, receives more than 80 percent of the intelligence budget and \nthen funnels it out to the intelligence community, will lose some of \nthat authority.\n  There is nothing in this bill--if you see it, bring it to us. Senator \nCollins and I will review it and see if we can alter it. That is not \nour intention. I want to say what bothers me about the amendment, apart \nfrom the transfer, is that it strikes a section in our bill which we \nthought was process, was routine, which simply says: If we are to give \nthis national intelligence director some authority for the budget, we \nhave to give the Treasury the authority to set up accounts for that \nperson in the Treasury so he can spend it, but he has to spend it \naccording to the appropriations of Congress. He has to spend subject to \nall the oversight, notification, and accountability of Congress.\n  I remain puzzled, and I do feel very strongly that this amendment \nwill do serious damage to our proposal, unanimously adopted by the \ncommittee based on recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and strongly \nsupported by the families of the victims of 9/11.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me just say, first of all, you can \ndelegate authority, but you cannot delegate responsibility. No one can \ndelegate responsibility. We have certain responsibilities for the \ntaxpayers' money. I must say the amendment that has been offered, in my \njudgment, conforms to the Constitution's understanding of what our \nresponsibilities are.\n  We have a disagreement. I don't want that disagreement to undermine \nmy comments about the work that Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman \nhave done. They have done a lot of work on this bill, perhaps more than \nanyone else in the Congress, with hearing after hearing after hearing. \nVery few of us not on that committee understand the hours and the work \nthey put in on this product. I don't mean by cosponsoring this \namendment to denigrate or undermine their work, I mean to improve on \nthat work.\n  And let me just make this point: We have a very fundamental \ndisagreement, the Senator from Connecticut and I, because he believes \nthere is no new authority given to the national intelligence director. \nAs I understand this, what happens is, the Treasury Secretary creates \nappropriations accounts, and he creates appropriations accounts to \nwhich the national intelligence director can then transfer funding.\n  I also understand under current circumstances, several billion \ndollars would be transferred to those accounts, and then at some point \nlater, if the Congress determines the expenditures for which that sum \nof several billion dollars has been committed is not appropriate to \nwhat the Congress intended, Congress can then retroactively evaluate \nhow to deal with that. I am saying I believe it puts us in a position, \nhistorically, that we are not\n\n[[Page S10313]]\n\nin with respect to our role as appropriators.\n  I think the circumstances have always been that money is appropriated \nthrough an appropriations process, not through an authorization. The \nbill we have today is an authorization. I happen to believe this \nauthorization bill should give some additional authority to a new \nperson--in this case the national intelligence director--but I am going \nto speak for a moment, when we finish this discussion, about the \nstovepipes and my concerns about what is going on in intelligence \ngenerally and why we are in a position, I think, of some vulnerability \nbased on what is not being done.\n  So I happen to think that it is useful to put someone in charge, but \nputting someone in charge does not mean that we ought to say to them, \noh, by the way, here is a pot of money, move it around as you wish, let \nus know how you used it, and then we will take a look at it and see \nwhether we evaluate that to have been appropriate use. That is not the \nway we do things in Congress.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Of course, I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I could not disagree more with the Senator's \nunderstanding of the language in the bill. If there is any basis to the \nSenator's understanding, we ought to sit together and see if we can \nfashion a change, because the intention, as I understand it--and \nperhaps the Senator from Maine may want to speak to this section--was \nto simply make clear that as we are giving budget authority, and we are \ngiving authority to the NID, but we are holding him or her \naccountable--as we give that authority to the NID, an account has to be \ncreated in the Treasury where he can receive that money, which now goes \nto the Defense Department.\n  Our reading of this part of this amendment was that if the formation \nof these accounts for the national intelligence director at the \nTreasury is prohibited, then the money is going to go back to Defense \nagain and they are going to undercut the new national intelligence \ndirector and go back to the stovepipes.\n  We have no intention to create pots of money that the NID will do \nwhatever he wants with. Incidentally, any transfer of funds from within \nthe intelligence community--and the budget of this agency itself is not \ngoing to be large; it is going to oversee a budget for agencies that is \ngoing to be large--will have to be made according to the normal \nprocedures with notification to Congress. We have not altered that at \nall.\n  We have even said explicitly that the power--we want to create as \nmuch strength in this office as possible. The power in the \nAppropriations Committee each year to set certain ceilings on transfers \nremains untouched. We reaffirm it in our proposal.\n  So we have very different views of this part of the Byrd amendment, \nand if there is any basis for what the Senator from North Dakota is \nsaying, we ought to sit down and figure out how to correct it because \nwe just want to help this office to work. We do not want to give them \nany authority to hold billions of dollars of money without holding them \naccountable.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Why not take more time? What is all the rush? Why not take \ntime? That is all I am asking for is take time. The distinguished \nSenator has offered to sit down with the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota. Why do we not take time and try to work this out? There \nare many other questions. That is what I am asking. Let us have more \ntime. We are being forced to operate under the gun here and that does \nnot lend itself to very wise legislation. That is what I am asking: How \nabout more time? We might resolve several of these problems then.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I say to the Senator from West Virginia----\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield for a response.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator, and I will give it right back.\n  I say to the Senator from West Virginia most respectfully, we are \nhere. We have been working on this bill in our committee since the end \nof July. We have listened to a lot of people in the committee. We have \naltered parts of it. Just last week in 5 days of consideration, several \nof our colleagues introduced amendments. We thought they would do \ndamage to the bill but they had some merit. We reasoned with them. We \ncame up with clarifications. Sometimes we accepted whole amendments.\n  Perhaps there is some lack of clarity in this particular part that we \ncan resolve together, but on the overall question, I say to Senator \nByrd, we do not have time. It is 3 years plus since these terrorists \nstruck America and killed 3,000 of our innocents, men, women, children. \nEvery form of citizen and noncitizen happened to be in the wrong place \nat the wrong time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me reclaim my time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Well, I did not finish but he can take it over. I just \nwant to say, we are under threat. This Capitol----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yielded for the purpose of \nanswering questions not for a debate.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DORGAN. In my judgment, the discussion we have just had is easily \nresolved. Either the Senator is providing much greater authority and \ntherefore more flexibility at the expense of less accountability to the \nCongress or he is not. As I read this, I believe the amendment that has \nbeen offered by Senator Byrd, Senator Stevens, Senator Inouye, Senator \nWarner, myself and others, a bipartisan amendment, does not in any way \nweaken the bill that came to the Senate floor on which the Senator has \nspent a lot of time. I think it, in fact, strengthens it. It \nstrengthens the role of Congress and I think makes this a better bill.\n  So I understand the Senator believes that the way the Senator has \ncreated this underlying Collins-Lieberman bill does not provide less \naccountability for Congress. The Senator has described it as much \nbetter flexibility, and that flexibility, as I read this, comes at the \nexpense of accountability for the Congress.\n  My only point is, all of us want exactly the same thing. We want this \nto work. If there is anybody in here who does not want this to work, \nthey do not belong in this Chamber. We want this to work. Why do we \nwant it to work? Because we know people want to murder innocent \nAmericans. They want to commit acts of terror in this country and we \nneed to stop them.\n  Now, how do we stop them? With good intelligence.\n  I cannot say how profoundly disappointed I am at the poor \nintelligence we have been given as a Congress in recent years. Somebody \nneeds to answer to that. Somebody needs to be accountable for that. In \npart, that is what Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins are trying to \ndo with this legislation. That is why I commend them for their work.\n  Let me describe a continuing problem that we have with our law \nenforcement and intelligence communities in their efforts to prevent \nanother terrorist attack.\n  On September 10, 2001, the day before 9/11, two messages apparently \nrelated to the 9/11 hijackings were intercepted by our Government, by \nthe National Security Agency. The Arabic language messages said, ``The \nmatch is about to begin'' and ``tomorrow is zero hour.''\n\n  Those messages were not translated until the day after 9/11.\n  You would think that the FBI's translation capabilities would have \nbeen vastly improved in the intervening three years. Yet last week we \nlearned that the Inspector General of the Department of Justice had \nissued a report, which found that three years later, the FBI has \nneglected to translate hundreds of thousands of hours of intercepted \ncommunications among suspected terrorists.\n  This is not about politics at all. There is no partisanship in this. \nThe question is, Do the FBI, CIA, the NSA, and others do an effective \njob or do they not? Can we prevent acts of terrorism or can we not?\n  Let me read this, from the Inspector General's report: Three years \nafter September 11, more than 120,000 hours of potentially valuable \nterrorism-related recordings have not yet been translated by the \nlinguists at the FBI.\n\n[[Page S10314]]\n\n  In fact, some recordings have been deleted from audio computer files, \nand FBI officials speaking on condition of anonymity said officials \nhave had to go back to original al-Qaida recordings on some occasions \nto try to restore them, after realizing that copies had been deleted \nbecause of capacity problems.\n  The inspector general's report said the linguists might not have \nrealized that material was deleted unless a case officer simply \nhappened to notice it missing from the final transactions. The FBI had \nfailed to institute necessary controls to prevent critical audio \nmaterial from being automatically deleted.\n\n  After September 11, 2001, the FBI director said this:\n\n       The FBI needed to change from an agency primarily focused \n     on investigating crime to one whose primary focus is the \n     prevention of future terrorist attacks.\n\n  The Inspector General says:\n\n       Yet necessary system controls have not been established to \n     prevent critical audio materials from being automatically \n     deleted, such as protecting sessions of the highest priority \n     on digital collection systems, active on-line storage until \n     linguists review them.\n\n  This is the Inspector General, again. He says:\n\n       The results of our tests showed that three of our FBI \n     offices tested had al-Qaida sessions that potentially were \n     deleted by the system before linguists had a chance to review \n     them.\n\n  There is something wrong here. How can you have 120,000 hours of \nintercepted phone messages and all kinds of audio recordings--\nterrorists, al-Qaida recordings--that have never been listened to? Is \nthere a recording in that 120,000 hours that sounds like the recording \non September 10, 2001, a recording that says: ``Tomorrow is the zero \nhour,'' and no one has listened to it? I don't know.\n  The American people understand, I think, that the capability of our \nintelligence system, the CIA, the FBI, and others, will determine \nwhether we are successful in preventing another terrorist attack.\n  So it is disheartening when you see the same failures cited over and \nover, with little improvement.\n  Let's go back to August 2000, before this administration took over. \nIn that month, we had a report of the National Commission on \nTerrorism--a report authorized by this Congress, issued by a commission \nchaired by Ambassador Paul Bremer. This was the same Paul Bremer who \nlater went on to head the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq.\n  The Bremer commission, 4 years ago--this is before 9/11--had this to \nsay:\n\n       The FBI's ability to exploit the increasing volume of \n     terrorism information has been hampered by aging technology.\n       All U.S. Government agencies faced a chronic shortage of \n     linguists to translate raw data into useful information. This \n     shortage has a direct impact on our counterterrorism efforts.\n\n  Mr. Bremer said then, over 4 years ago, that what we need are \nadditional linguists, we need to interpret the raw data, we need to be \nable to understand it, determine what it means for this country's \nsafety.\n  Here we are 4 years later and we get an Inspector General's report \nthat says there are 120,000 hours of potentially valuable terrorism-\nrelated recordings not even translated.\n  Indeed, the Inspector General of the Department of Justice concluded \nthat one-third of terrorism-related audio recordings were not \ntranslated within 12 hours as mandated by the FBI rules. There are \n123,000 hours in languages primarily related to counterterrorism--\nArabic, Farsi, Urdu, Pashtun--that have not been translated; 370,000 \nhours of recordings in languages connecting to counterintelligence \nprobes had not been deciphered by that time. That is nearly one-half \nmillion hours potential leads to terrorist plots, sitting there, \nuninterpreted.\n  We can pass legislation. We can have a debate about all these issues. \nBut if agencies can't get their act together, can't do the job, don't \neven interpret the al-Qaida recordings to understand what is there, how \non Earth are we going to protect this country?\n  The 9/11 Commission, incidentally, the Commission which has prompted \nthis bill coming to the floor of the Senate, says the following:\n\n  The analysts for the 9/11 Commission\n\n       . . . had difficulty getting access to the FBI and \n     intelligence community information they were expected to \n     analyze. The poor state of the FBI's information systems \n     meant that such access depended in large part on an analyst's \n     personal relationships with the individual in the operational \n     units or squads where the information resided. For all of \n     these reasons, prior to 9/11 relatively few strategic \n     analytic reports about counterterrorism had been completed. \n     Indeed, the FBI had never completed an assessment of the \n     overall terrorist threats to the U.S. homeland.\n\n  And I continue to quote:\n\n       The FBI did not have an effective intelligence collection \n     effort. The FBI did not dedicate sufficient resources to the \n     surveillance and translation needs of counterterrorism \n     agents. It lacked sufficient translators proficient in Arabic \n     and other key languages, resulting in a significant backlog \n     of untranslated intercepts.\n\n  This from the 9/11 Commission. Following the release of this \ninformation from the 9/11 Commission, we now have the release of the \nInspector General's report, which is absolutely stunning. It is \nastonishing to receive a report that, nearly 4 years after a \nrecommendation was made by the Bremmer-Sonnenberg Commission, 3 years \nafter we were attacked on 9/11, that we have 120,000 hours of \nrecordings of intercepted information, a portion of which is from al-\nQaida, and it has not yet been interpreted or translated. This is \nunbelievable.\n  I talked for a few moments about accountability. Where is the \naccountability here? Who is accountable for that? Who is responsible \nfor that?\n  I want to make one other point, if I might. Again, I know I had a \ndiscussion with my colleague from Connecticut. My colleague from Maine \nis on the floor. I don't know whether she heard me, but I said I \nappreciated the work the two have done to bring this to the floor. Much \nof it has great merit, in my judgment. Much will be very protective of \nthis country's interests and advances our interests in combating \nterrorism. I do support the amendment because I think that amendment \nwill strengthen the bill. But let me say one other thing. The 9/11 \nreport is a roadmap and we are using that roadmap in an attempt to \nconstruct some legislation here. Other roadmaps, for example, include \nthis Inspector General's report of which we have just become aware. \nThat ought to tell us something about where we are headed here. It is \nnot good.\n  Let me mention one additional point. As we evaluate what yet needs to \nbe done to protect this country, and discuss issues of transparency, \nthere remain 28 pages of information up in the Intelligence Committee \nthat should still be released. They are classified ``top secret.'' Some \nin the Senate have read this material; all have the opportunity to read \nit. It comes from the December 2002 report of the Joint Intelligence \nCommittee of the House and Senate that was sent to the White House and \nthen was published. That report was on 9/11, what happened, and how it \nhappened. That report was published in the December 2002 with 28 pages \nmissing, and the 28 pages deal with Saudi Arabia. That is what has been \nsaid publicly, disclosed publicly, but yet they are deemed top secret \nand the American public is not able to see them. Then, the chairman of \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard Shelby, indicated that he \nthought 95 percent of it could be easily declassified. The Foreign \nMinister of Saudi Arabia thought it should be declassified. Yet it has \nbeen classified by the White House, which refuses to share this \ninformation with Congress and the American people.\n  I believe, once again, that all of us should continue to ask the \nWhite House to declassify those 28 pages. That, too, is a contribution \nto understanding what happened and what we do about it.\n  Those 28 pages, in my judgment, should be released. They cannot as \nlong as they are classified ``top secret.'' In my judgment, they should \nbe declassified. Again, Senator Shelby indicated that he thought 95 \npercent of it could easily be declassified, and, as I indicated, the \nForeign Minister of Saudi Arabia called for its declassification. \nConsidering that fifteen of the 19 terrorists who struck this country \nwere Saudis, I think our country deserves to get to the bottom of this.\n  I believe, once again, as we finish discussing these issues on \nintelligence, 9/11, and how to strengthen this country, how to prevent \nfuture acts of terrorism, that these 28 pages ought to be made \navailable to the American people.\n\n[[Page S10315]]\n\n  I came to the floor today to talk about this inspector general's \nreport and to weigh in briefly on an amendment offered by my colleague, \nSenator Byrd.\n  Let me conclude as I started by saying that I believe Senator Byrd \nhas done a great service to the Senate by once again saying there is \nmerit in many of these proposals and that he doesn't come to the floor \nto denigrate these proposals. He comes to the floor to strengthen these \nproposals. I agree with him that we have a government in which we have \nseparating powers with respect to the ability and the fight to try to \nprevent further acts of terrorism from occurring in this country.\n  All of us need to work together. But we need to work smart. Working \nhard and working smart sometimes can be two different things. I hope we \nwill work smart working together to have accountability in Congress to \nprovide the flexibility while still retaining accountability so we can \ncreate this new agency, get rid of these stovepipes, and have agencies \nthat are forward working, that will share information which will \nprotect this country from future acts of terrorism. All of us share \nthat goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I note that the Senator from North Dakota \ngave a very troubling and compelling example of the fact that the FBI \nis so far behind in translating critical messages and documents. I am \ntroubled by that, also.\n  Where we may differ is, I believe, that the authority given to the \nnational intelligence director by the bill will allow us to address \nthat problem. Now we will have one person in Government who is \naccountable and responsible and who will be able to--unless the Byrd \namendment is agreed to--transfer the people and the funds necessary to \ntackle that backlog. That can't happen because of a very cumbersome \nprocess. I see our legislation and the authority it gives the new NID \nto be critical in allowing us to address just those kinds of problems.\n  We know there is a shortage of linguists throughout the Federal \nGovernment, but we also know there are thousands of linguists. Some of \nthem are in the FBI, some of them are in the CIA, and some are in \nvarious other agencies. If we had a national intelligence director who \nwas able to marshal those resources, then we could get rid of those \nbacklogs. I think that would be very helpful.\n  I have other comments I want to make in response to the Senator's \ncomments on the Byrd amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for one point?\n  Ms. COLLINS. If I could complete my sentence, I would be happy to \nyield briefly for a question.\n  The Senator from Missouri has been waiting for some time to speak on \nthe amendment that was just cleared on homeland security grants. I will \nyield briefly for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator.\n  I only make the point that I don't think any of us disagree with the \npoint of having sufficient flexibility so the agencies will make \ndecisions to hire people to translate the tapes. Somebody must be \naccountable today--not just tomorrow--for 120,000 pages not being \ntranslated.\n  My point is, whether Senator Byrd or myself or any other Senator, we \nall want sufficient resources to be devoted to the task at hand--\nespecially the urgent task at hand. With or without the kind of \nflexibility you provide in this bill, I believe the evidence is that in \nevery circumstance in the last 3 years when the administration asked \nfor flexibility in moving funding, it has been granted by this \nCongress, and it has done so immediately. I know that because I am an \nappropriator and I see what comes to us. We move it immediately.\n  I wanted to make the point that I don't think there is any \ndisagreement at all about our interest in seeing critical issues \nfunded. We all want that to happen.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, reclaiming my right to the floor, let us \nlook at what happens under the current system when funds are \nreprogrammed. I would like to quote from the acting CIA Director John \nMcLaughlin testimony that he gave before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee which parallels conversations that Senator Lieberman and I \nhad with him privately. It goes directly to this point of the need for \na more agile system.\n  Yes, the DCI has some reprogramming authority now. But let us look at \nthe way it works. Listen to what John McLaughlin says:\n\n       Typically you require the approval of the agency that is \n     surrendering the funds. Then you require the approval of the \n     department head who overseas the agency. Usually that is the \n     Secretary of Defense. Then you require the approval of OMB. \n     Then you require the approval of six congressional \n     committees. Typically that takes 5 months.\n\n  I want to repeat that. That reprogramming takes 5 months, on average.\n  John McLaughlin goes on to say:\n\n       So you can see that is not very agile to meet the needs of \n     today. My view is that the national intelligence director \n     ought to have the authority to move those funds.\n\n  We are facing an agile enemy, and what are we putting up against him? \nA system where it takes 5 months to move funds from one category to \nanother.\n  I wish to address the issue of the accounts under the bill, which \nboth Senator Byrd and Senator Dorgan have addressed. These are simply \naccounts that allow the NID to receive the appropriations. That is all \nthey are. The accounts set up under our bill do not give the NID any \nadditional authority. These are just regular Treasury accounts.\n  Why are they needed? They are needed because the money now is \nfunneled through the Department of Defense.\n  If you are going to allow the NID to receive the appropriations from \nCongress from a mechanics standpoint, you have to have a mechanism \nwhereby the Treasury Department sets up the accounts for him. That is \nall this is. In fact, I refer to page 24, line 12, of our legislation. \nThese accounts are set up explicitly ``for the purpose of carrying out \nthe responsibilities and authorities of the director under this act.''\n  The accounts themselves do not allow or authorize the NID to transfer \nfunds. There is transfer authority. It is on page 27 of the bill. These \nauthorities include a number of important safeguards.\n  First of all, transfers will still require congressional approval \njust as they do now. We are not changing the balance of power between \nthis new position and the Congress. The transfers are subject to the \napplicable ceilings established in law to the appropriation ceilings. \nThe transfers cannot be made unilaterally by the NID. They require the \napproval of the Director of Management and Budget.\n  Finally, the NID must consult with the affected agency heads, but no \nlonger will he have to get the approval of the agency head and then the \ndepartment head and then Office of Management and Budget and then \nCongress--that whole intricate system. We would allow consultation. \nThen the NID can move the money with the approval of OMB and subject to \nthe same congressional review we have now. This is not a radical new \nconcept. It is an essential authority. We cannot afford to have a \nprocess that takes 5 months for money to be moved from one account to \nanother.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3705\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for her \ncomments. I am going to make a couple of comments about an amendment \nthe Senate adopted an hour or two ago that I am strongly supportive of \nand was pleased to cosponsor. I want a little more on the record about \nwhat that amendment does.\n  As I travel around Missouri and talk with first responders about \nhomeland security, there is a consistent theme I hear. This goes back \nseveral years ago when I was not even in the Senate and was just \ncampaigning. Over and over again, what I heard from fire chiefs, local \npublic health authorities, police chiefs, and sheriffs was this: Look, \nwe thank the Federal Government for sending money to help be prepared, \nbut do not tell us in a detailed way what to do with the money.\n  I had one fire chief from Missouri say his big fear is: They will \nsend the money and I will need the dollars to buy a better \ncommunication system so\n\n[[Page S10316]]\n\nthat in the event there is a terrorist-related disaster, I can find out \nwhere my guys and gals are and tell them where to go. My big fear is \nthey will tell me I have to buy HAZMAT suits when I don't need HAZMAT \nsuits, because we already have in Missouri a tremendous HAZMAT regional \nteam that I would call if we ever had that problem.\n  This concern resonated with me. I said to myself, that is what the \nFederal Government will do. It will send them the money but then tell \nthem what to do with it. Accountability is fine. It is fine maybe to \nhave certain standards in certain areas that are off limits--maybe you \ndo not want them to spend the money on routine personnel costs. But I \nam a big believer that our first responders are best prepared to handle \ndisaster-related emergencies when they prepare themselves better just \nto handle emergencies. The kind of problems or threats associated with \nterrorist disasters are 80 percent the same as with any other \ndisaster--fire, people being crushed or trapped in buildings. The \nbetter they are prepared to do their job on a day-to-day basis, the \nbetter they will be prepared to protect, help, cure, or get us loose \nfrom some terrorist-related disaster.\n  After I came to the Senate, I found out in large part we have, \nunfortunately, done exactly what they were afraid we were going to do, \nwhich is send them the money with so many strings attached that they do \nnot have the flexibility to use it the way they want.\n\n  We had an example of this in Missouri last year when Senator Bond and \nI were contacted by the local Jewish community in St. Louis which was \nhosting the Maccabi Games--like the international youth Olympics for \nJewish youth from around the world. Those games drew over 5,000 young \nJewish people from around the world. The Maccabi Games were an obvious \ntarget for a terrorist threat--that is just a matter of common sense--\nand there were a lot of extra costs associated with protecting the \ngames.\n  The local hosts wanted some of those costs reimbursed. We certainly \nunderstand that. We tried to get money that had already been assigned \nto the State of Missouri reprogrammed or changed so they could use it \nfor this obviously necessary purpose, and we could not. The statute was \ntoo closed to let the money be reprogrammed, despite the best efforts \nof Senator Bond and I.\n  It turned out that the Maccabi Games went on without incident, and we \nare all very grateful. But the problems remain for the discretion on \nthe part of the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of the \nOffice of State and Local Government Coordination to at least have the \nauthority to entertain a waiver application by States to reprogram \ndollars where, at least, some unexpected need arises.\n  I joined with Senator Collins in cosponsoring legislation to that \neffect. I offered a sense-of-the-Senate resolution on the Homeland \nSecurity appropriation which did get adopted by the Senate and had a \ncolloquy with Senator Cochran at the time about the need to follow up \non this issue. I was very pleased to cosponsor with Senator Collins, an \namendment that, among other things, does create that kind of waiver \nauthority for the Secretary of Homeland Security and for the Director \nto help out in instances such as that.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Maine for her interest. She has heard \nthe same things I have heard. She knows the need to do something about \nit. I am very pleased that with the adoption of that amendment, we have \ntaken a step in that direction. It is not as far as we need to go, in \nmy judgment. We can trust our first responders more than we will trust \nthem even with this amendment becoming law--and I hope it does become \nlaw--but it is a step in the right direction. I will keep working in \nthat direction. The people of Missouri and the people of the country \nwill be better off as we make progress toward that end.\n  To reiterate, as I have traveled across the State of Missouri \ndiscussing homeland security, nearly every police chief and every first \nresponder has told me the same thing: Don't tie our hands on how we are \ngoing to use money you give us. Leave us some discretion on how to use \nthose funds. At the same time, the Department of Homeland Security \nasserts it must tightly control how every dollar is spent. I appreciate \nthe need for accountability given the department's mission. I also \nappreciate that in many instances our first responders know best how to \nallocate these funds and that sometimes very legitimate concerns fall \noutside the narrow spending guidelines of the department.\n  For example, in St. Louis last year, our local Jewish community \nhosted the Maccabi Games, an international Jewish Youth Olympics, which \ndrew over 5,000 Jewish youth from around the world. Given the security \nenvironment, Missouri's Homeland Security Office threat assessment team \nstressed the need for greater security but lacked the latitude to \nreallocate even a modest sum from the monies awarded to the State. \nDespite all of our efforts here, they were unable to free up dollars to \nprovide for the necessary security.\n  Thankfully, the event ended without incident, but it still \nillustrates the need for discretion on the part of the Secretary and \nthe director of the Office for State and Local government Coordination \nto approve waiver applications on the part of the State to reprogram \nsome of their Federal grant homeland money when some new kind of \nsecurity issue arises that was unforeseen when they originally applied \nfor those grants.\n  Last year, I engaged in a colloquy on this floor with Chairman \nCochran on this issue and have been working since arriving in the \nSenate with Chairman Collins to craft language that would provide State \nand local governments with flexibility in the reallocate a portion of \nhomeland security grant funds based upon the changing threat \nenvironment. Last week I successfully offered an amendment to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security Appropriations bill that addressed this \nissue.\n  I am pleased that Senator Collins has included in her amendment \nlanguage that we worked on together over the past year to provide the \ndiscretionary authority needed by the State homeland security \nofficials.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I appreciate the leadership of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Missouri to allow greater flexibility for State and local \nofficials in spending homeland security grant funds. I agree that \ngreater flexibility is needed to use homeland security funds to meet \nspecial security needs. I am pleased to include in my amendment \nlanguage Senator Talent and I have crafted over the past 18-months \nwhich last week he made the subject of a sense of the senate resolution \ngranting authority to the Director of the Office for Domestic \nPreparedness to approve the reallocation of funds available to State \nhomeland security officials in unspent homeland security funds. I am \nconfident that this language would allow State and local officials to \nreallocate homeland security grant funds to provide greater safety for \nspecial security events like the Maccabi Games. Senator Talent has been \ntireless in his efforts to pass his measure and achieve this \nflexibility to help local first responders and I am proud that we could \ninclude it in this amendment. I look forward to continuing to work with \nthe Senator from Missouri on this important issue.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I will make a comment or two on the bill \nas a whole. I will not hold the Senate up a long time. We are trying to \nget this bill done, and I fully support that.\n  There is an area of the bill I would like to register, for the \nrecord, concern on the part of this Senator. Probably the bill's \nmanagers will recognize the legitimacy of that concern.\n  First, I want to say how much I have appreciated the work by the \nSenator from Maine and the Senator from Connecticut on this bill. I \nhave enjoyed this debate and enjoyed the part that I played in it--not \nthat it has been significant but just attending the briefings, visiting \nwith the Senators on and off the Senate floor. In my work on the Armed \nServices Committee, we have had hearings on this subject.\n  This has been handled in the way the American people like to see the \nSenate handle things. It has been bipartisan in the best sense of that \nword--not that we have tried to conceal legitimate differences of \nopinion that sometimes separate the two parties, but because we have \nunderstood that the right way to deal with those differences is to \nreconcile them where we can, to have\n\n[[Page S10317]]\n\nthem out without being personal or political about it, and understand \nwe are all working for the good of the American people and the security \nof the country.\n  We can all agree, having been here now through almost this entire \nCongress, that unfortunately, the Senate does not always operate in \nthat ideal fashion. I believe it has operated in that way on this bill, \nand the leadership of the two Senators is the reason. It is clear from \nlistening to this debate and watching it on TV in my office that both \nof these Senators have done their due diligence. They know their \nsubject. There has not been a point raised that they were unfamiliar \nwith. That has been very impressive to me and has led me to decide that \nI am going to give them the benefit of the doubt on amendments that are \noffered because clearly they have studied this. It is not a case where \nthey are refusing to consider any concern or looking down on a Senator \nwho is raising it.\n  It is important for the public to know that personal factors like \nthat can play a part in legislation. The trust and regard in which \nthese two Senators are held by the rest of the body is making a \ndifference.\n\n  I also agree with them that it is time to do something; that 3 years \nis long enough. Some people say 40 years, because there have been a \nnumber of recommendations for changing how we do intelligence over the \ndecades. I think it is time to get something done. I agree with that.\n  I also like the creation of a national intelligence director. I do \nwish we could have come up with a different name than NID. Imagine how \noften that name is going to be used and what it may come to represent \nin Washington, but it may be too late to do anything about that.\n  For some reason, I do not think people have aired on the floor--and I \nwant to; it is a practical reason--there are times in our history when \nforeign policy and national defense are bigger issues than at other \ntimes. The American people in the United States of America are a people \nwho are concerned with their day-to-day lives. That is as it should be. \nWe would rather, if we could, avoid having to engage extensively in \nthese tremendous efforts abroad and in all the foreign policy \ndiscussions and reconstructions that go with that.\n  In our elections, sometimes we elect Presidents in a context where \nforeign policy does not seem to be all that important. I think it is \nanother way of saying some Presidents are more interested than other \nPresidents in intelligence on a day-to-day basis. I do not say that to \nbe critical. I do not think there has been a President who has ever \nserved in that high office who has not cared about the security of the \ncountry. But I think people here understand what I mean.\n  Now that we are fighting this terrorist war, we all read stories \nabout intelligence. We know how important it is. We are all following \nit on a day-to-day basis. Everybody wants to serve on the Intelligence \nCommittee or the Foreign Affairs Committee, and that is fine. But in \nother times, attention and interest wanes.\n  I think by having a national intelligence director, what we will help \nensure is that even in those times when interest is waning on the part \nof other high-level political actors, maybe even the President, we will \nhave somebody in Washington whose job it is to look at all this in a \ncomprehensive way, and try to make sure the agencies under him or her \nare working together on behalf of the interests of the American people, \nin a way rather like we have done with the Federal Reserve, where we \nhave created an agency and we have vested a lot of authority in a \nChairman of the Federal Reserve. We know that person is watching \nmonetary policy and other policy.\n  Over time, what has happened is Presidents of both parties and under \nall circumstances realize that appointments to that kind of job are \nvery highly scrutinized, and you put in people who have prestige and \ngravitas and the regard of people of both parties and the regard of the \ncountry.\n  It is my hope that will happen with the national intelligence \ndirector. Presidents, whether foreign policy is the No. 1 concern for \nthem or not, will know this is an important appointment and they need \nto put somebody in this position, from administration to \nadministration, who has the regard of everybody in the country, who \nwatches and knows about foreign policy and about intelligence. That \nwill help create a stability over time and a continuity in our \nintelligence policy.\n  Now, I am not downgrading the concerns people have expressed. There \nis always a tension in this kind of thing. You cannot create and set up \na higher authority such as this without increasing the risk that if you \nget a person in there who is very autocratic, it may tend to create a \ncertain kind of group-think among the agencies even more than we now \nhave, that people could be acting in way that is designed to please \nonly this national intelligence director rather than trying to have \ntheir own opinions regarding intelligence. But there are safeguards in \nthe bill designed to deal with that. I certainly have had some concerns \nalong those lines, but I am going to exercise the benefit of the doubt \nin favor of supporting the creation of a national intelligence \ndirector.\n\n  There is an area, though--and the Senators have addressed it; I think \nperhaps they could again in response to my remarks--I am concerned \nabout the flow of intelligence to the troops in the field. Here is the \nkind of classic situation I am concerned about. We have, of course, an \nextensive satellite system in place. We get intelligence all the time \nfrom those satellites. Particularly since the first Gulf War, the \nDepartment of Defense has become pretty good at getting that \nintelligence off the set satellites and getting it out to the field in \nreal time. That means virtually instantaneously, so that it can be used \nby our special operations troops, by commanders in the field to check \nand select targets. This kind of mapping and satellite intelligence can \nbe used even to move troops around during some kind of an engagement. \nIt works pretty well. I know that for a fact.\n  I think one of the reasons it does work is these agencies--the \nNational Reconnaissance Office, the National Geospatial-Intelligence \nAgency, the National Security Agency--are in the Department of Defense \nand the customers they are serving with that intelligence are in the \nDepartment of Defense. It is very reasonable to believe that if the \nprovider of the intelligence and the customer of the intelligence are \nin the same Department, the same bureaucratic structure, they will \nshare intelligence better.\n  If that were not true, then why are we doing this bill? Because the \nwhole point of the bill is to get all these intelligence agencies under \nsome kind of joint authority so they will share better. In most cases, \nI think it is very clear how the bill is doing that, that the bill is \nbreaking down existing bureaucratic barriers.\n  But I do think we all ought to be honest enough to admit with respect \nto this particular kind of sharing, we are setting up a bureaucratic \nbarrier that does not exist now, because we are going to pull those \nagencies out of the control of the Department of Defense and put them \nunder the national intelligence director, at least partially. So there \nis at least a risk we will put up a stovepipe in the name of taking \ndown stovepipes, that we will put up a stovepipe in an area where the \nsharing is working. It would be ironic if one of the effects of the \nbill were to interrupt the sharing of the intelligence in the one area \nwhere we have confidence now that it is being shared.\n  Now, I feel a lot better about this concern than I did when I first \nheard about this bill. I know the Senator from Maine and the Senator \nfrom Connecticut have put measures in the bill designed to ensure that \nflow of intelligence continues. I am glad they have done that. I am \nglad they recognized the importance of this concern, because it is \ngoing to grow as time goes on.\n  Let me give you an example. We are trying, on the Armed Services \nCommittee--and both Senators serve on that Committee, so they know this \nas well as I--to make all the various what we call weapons platforms \nfor the Army network-centric. What this means is they will all be \nnetworked in, so that we hope in the near future intelligence from a \nsatellite will not even have to go through a middleman at the NGA or \nthe NSA, it will go directly\n\n[[Page S10318]]\n\nfrom the satellite down to the commander in the field. It is very \nimportant that we procure weapons systems and platforms and \ncommunications systems and signal intelligence systems that are all \nlinked together.\n  This bill, for example, gives procurement authority to the NID over \nthe satellite end of those systems. So we are going to have the NID \nprocuring the satellites, the platforms that are getting the \nintelligence. We are going to have the Department of Defense procuring \nits end of the platform that is going to be receiving the intelligence, \nand there is a danger we will end up with a stovepipe we do not want.\n\n  I am not saying this is a reason to oppose the bill. I am not saying \nit is a reason to change the bill. I am saying it is a concern. I guess \nwhat I would say to my friends from Connecticut and Maine is, if they \ncould give us their assurance that not only in the passage of the bill \nbut in the implementation of it, and in the months and years after \nthat, they will remain conscious of these concerns and try to ensure a \nfree flow of intelligence from these various intelligence organizations \nout to the troops in the field, even though they will no longer be in \nthe same bureaucratic organizations.\n  Maybe the Senator from Maine would yield for a question from me or \nhave a brief colloquy, if I can ask consent to do that.\n  I have been airing the point you and I have talked about privately, \nand you have addressed on the floor as well, about the importance of \nmaking sure that tactical military intelligence continues to flow from \nthe NGA and the NRO and the others out to troops in the field.\n  I was telling the Presiding Officer you all have done a lot to allay \nmy concern in that regard. What I was hopeful of, and I wanted to put \non the record, is to get assurance from you and the Senator from \nConnecticut that in implementing this bill you will continue to oversee \nthis aspect of it and try to make certain the NID understands the \nimportance of acting jointly with the DOD in ensuring that this \nintelligence continues to flow. Because no matter what protocols you \nput in the bill, this is a fruitful area for oversight to make certain \nthat this intelligence is not interrupted. Would the Senator from Maine \ncare to comment?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to give the assurances the \nSenator from Missouri is seeking. He and I, as he mentioned, along with \nmy friend from Connecticut, serve on the Armed Services Committee and \nhave a deep commitment to making sure that our men and women in the \nmilitary receive the real-time, actionable intelligence they need to be \neffective. Nothing in this bill would in any way hinder the flow of \nintelligence from NSA to the combatant commanders to the troops on the \nground in Iraq and Afghanistan--nothing.\n  In fact, as the Senator from Missouri knows, we opposed an amendment \nlast week which would have undermined the relationship between those \ndefense agencies and the Secretary of Defense by essentially moving \nthem out of the Pentagon--not physically but from an authority \nstandpoint--and having them only report to the national intelligence \ndirector. We recognized that we need a dual reporting, that these \nagencies are providing critical intelligence to our troops and to \nPentagon officials as well as to the rest of the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  I agree with the Senator that vigilant oversight is going to be \nnecessary to make sure this is implemented in the manner we intend. But \nI must say, given the clear language of the bill, given the fact that \ntactical intelligence assets are completely exempted from the NID's \ncontrol, and given the fact that any NID is going to be committed to \nproviding excellent intelligence to our troops, I can't imagine the \nbill having the negative impact that he might feel.\n  Mr. TALENT. I have been much reassured by the debate, by your \ncomments, and by my further thinking on the subject. I do think it is \nunlikely that any national intelligence director would not be sensitive \nto this. And given the congressional concern that has been expressed, \nif he or she were insensitive, we certainly could do something about \nit.\n  To give an example--and I shared this with the Senate--on \nprocurement, you know the extent to which we are trying to procure \nnetwork-centric type platforms for the Army. And since now the various \nsatellite agencies would be under the procurement authority of the NID, \nit would be important early in this process to get some kind of \nmemorandum of understanding or protocol so there would be a joint type \nprocurement process to make certain that what the Army was doing to get \nnetwork-centric receivers was compatible with whatever the NID was \nprocuring for satellite.\n  I expect there will be a number of instances in practice where it \nwill be useful for all of us to be aware on a continuing basis of this \nconcern and trying to make certain that they work together, as we did \nwith Goldwater-Nichols. There is an example of a congressional \nenactment and oversight that has increased the joint process.\n  I don't offer these remarks in hostility to the bill but to put on \nthe record again the importance of this, to make clear your intent and \nthe intent of the Senator from Connecticut in this regard. I would be \nhappy to have the Senator comment further.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Let me indicate to the Senator from Missouri that I very \nmuch appreciate his concern in this area. There is no greater advocate \nfor our troops than he. I join with him in an assurance that we are \ngoing to watch this very carefully. The language of the bill is very \ntightly and carefully drafted. The commitment to our troops is there. \nThere is nothing in this bill that would in any way hinder military \noperations, readiness, or the flow of real-time, actionable \nintelligence to our troops. That is essential. The Senator has my \ncommitment to continue to monitor this very closely.\n  Mr. TALENT. I am grateful. I don't know if the Senator from \nConnecticut wanted to say something now or later. I am not inviting you \nto admit a concern that you don't think is in the language of the bill, \nthat would suggest a weakness in the bill that you don't believe is \nthere. It is just that any change in structure like this has the \npotential, if we are not careful, to interrupt that flow. I am pleased \nabout your reassurances. I won't make you say it for the 15th time. I \nwill just reclaim my time and close briefly. It has been a pleasure to \nparticipate in this debate and to watch how my friends from Connecticut \nand Maine have handled it. I do think it is time to do something. I had \nconcerns. I had concerns about the speed with which we were acting. I \nthink we can all concede the honesty of those concerns. I do believe, \nhowever, for the reasons I have indicated, that we ought to move \nforward. I think we can, while guarding against the dangers that are \npresent whenever you have a major change like this. There is a lot \nabout our intelligence system that is working. We do want to be careful \nthat in trying to fix the parts that aren't, we don't cause problems \nfor the parts that are working.\n  The Senators from Maine and Connecticut have done a good job in \nguarding against that. I congratulate them on their work. Again, I am \npleased the Senate has adopted an amendment which finally takes a first \nstep toward allowing our first responders, our State and local \nofficials on whom we depend, to have discretion in where they are going \nto use these homeland security grants the country is giving them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, before the Senator from Missouri \nleaves the floor, I thank him for his statement. I thank him for his \nkind words about Senator Collins and me, which she certainly deserves \nand I am glad to be along with her on that ride.\n  I thank him for the specific question and assure the Senator on my \nbehalf, one, that Senator Collins and our committee were focused \nthroughout the deliberations on making sure this substantial \nreorganization of our intelligence assets not in any way diminish the \navailability of intelligence to the warfighter. In fact, in the best of \nall situations, we believe the recommendations that we have made will \nimprove intelligence to the warfighter.\n  By way of reassurance, I want to quote from GEN Michael Hayden, \nDirector of the National Security Agency, who said in testimony before \nthe other body:\n\n\n[[Page S10319]]\n\n\n       An empowered national intelligence director who would \n     direct authority over the national agencies should not be \n     viewed as diminishing our ability or willingness to fulfill \n     our responsibilities as combat support agencies.\n\n  He was speaking on behalf of the three.\n  It was quite illuminating, in talking to General Hayden and others. \nThey are in direct daily contact, particularly with the combatant \ncommanders. They have people out in the field right now with those \ncombatant commanders, particularly in the most active areas of the \nworld, such as the central command, which includes Iraq and Pakistan. \nAfter having described that close integration of national intelligence \nassets with the warfighters, General Hayden concluded:\n\n       It is inconceivable to me that any future leader of the \n     National Security Agency could or would ever act any \n     differently.\n\n  GEN James Clapper, head of the NGA, National Geospatial Agency, \nexpressed exactly the same sentiments to us.\n  I want to reassure the Senator from Missouri, more to the point of \nhis question, that to the extent we are able--and I am sure if we are \nnot, the Armed Services Committee will--we will definitely keep a close \neye as this new system is implemented to make sure our intention, which \nis that this reform improves intelligence for our warfighters, in fact \nis being realized.\n  Mr. TALENT. I can see how that would happen, and we should not accept \nsomething that is working fairly well if we think we can make it \nbetter. It may be possible by moving these agencies into the NID for \nbudgetary purposes that they will get a higher priority than they get \nnow with the DOD which does not see itself primarily as an intelligence \ndepartment. I can see potential pluses to this. I just thought it was \nvery important that the record show the concern about this is not only \ndeep with you two as the managers but also all throughout the Senate \nand the Congress, that there are many of us who are familiar with this \nand who know this current system is working, certainly working much \nbetter than it used to.\n  I hope whoever is going to be the national intelligence director--I \ncertainly will bring this up in the confirmation process, and I hope \nyou two do as well--knows we want his cooperation and will continue to \nwant this to be a priority.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I am very pleased to see the Senator \nfrom Minnesota is on the floor. Senator Coleman has been one of the \nmost diligent members of the Governmental Affairs Committee on this \nissue. He came to virtually every hearing we had throughout the August \nrecess, starting on the very first hearing on July 30. He is a \ncosponsor of the bill. He helped to write many of its provisions. I am \nvery grateful for his leadership and support, and I look forward to \nhearing his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I express my deep gratitude for the \nkind words of the Senator from Maine and my gratitude for the \nincredible work she and the Senator from Connecticut did in pulling us \ntogether in doing a series of hearings--I believe eight--with countless \nhours of testimony, a very thorough review of the recommendations of \nthe 9/11 Commission, and then an analysis of how do we take those \nrecommendations and somehow move forward in a way that improves, \nincreases the level of safety and security in this great country of \nours. That was the challenge and it certainly is a challenge.\n  I think the chairman has been challenged with drafting a bill that \nrepresents a kind of balance here between ambitious reform of our \nintelligence services and the continuity of the existing intelligence \nassets we rely upon to keep our country safe. There was discussion \nduring the hearings about the nature of change and some of the \nchallenges of concern--a concern that if we are to make changes, is \nthat going to make us more vulnerable during that period of time.\n  There was great thought that went into the balance we see in this \nbill: The balance between the creation of a powerful national \nintelligence director, on the one hand, and this concept of \ndepartmental autonomy on the other; and the right balance between \ncentralization of the information sharing and the balance of civil \nliberties we cherish as Americans. How do you provide those protections \nwithout undermining the ability to do the hard work that has to be done \nin intelligence, and that keeps up the morale of those on the front \nlines every day making us safer--folks who, in many ways, are simply \nunknown; we will never know who they are. At one of our hearings, which \nwas classified, even the name of the witness was classified. I sat \nthere as a relatively new Member of the Senate listening to the \nincredible work that is going on day to day to keep our country safe. I \nwas struck by that, and I am deeply committed to making sure as we move \nforward in reform that we keep the morale up and the appreciation up, \nthat we strike the right kind of balance.\n\n  After hours of hearings and countless study, I believe the bill \ndrafted by the chair and ranking member represents the kind of balance \nwe need. Today and tomorrow, we are going to vote on a number of \namendments that would unravel this carefully constructed balance by \nweakening the national intelligence director. I urge my colleagues to \noppose any such efforts to undermine this balance.\n  I agree with the sponsors of these amendments that it is vitally \nimportant soldiers in combat get timely, accurate information that is \nrelevant to their immediate needs. I also agree the military chain of \ncommand needs to be respected. However, I disagree on their \ninterpretation of how the Collins-Lieberman bill would affect the armed \nservices.\n  Last week, we debated and voted on an amendment that would have \neffectively removed several intelligence agencies from the Defense \nDepartment. We defeated the amendment because a strong majority of the \nbody thought, as I do, that the Department of Defense needs to retain \nits combat support relationship with such agencies as the National \nSecurity Agency and National Reconnaissance Office. I think that vote \nreflects the importance we attach to the Department's role in \nintelligence.\n  The central finding of the 9/11 Commission was that prior to 2001, \nthe safety of Americans was substantially weakened by the absence of a \nstrong entity to make sure that the use of intelligence assets \nreflected national priorities and that the intelligence gathered was \nshared with officials who needed it, even if those officials were \nlocated in different agencies. I note that the Chair, on a number of \noccasions, talked about a George Tenet memo in 1998, where he declared \nwar on al-Qaida and nobody knew about it. There were agencies \nthroughout Government that never got this declaration of war from the \nhead of the CIA. As the Commission put it, no one was in charge.\n  As I say that, I do want to say, having listened to the testimony, \ntoday we have a new level of cooperation and collaboration between \nthose involved in intelligence gathering. And because of that new level \nof cooperation and collaboration, we are moving forward and this \ncountry is safer today than it was on 9/11. But the reality of the case \nis that with no one in charge, institutional silos arose to prevent \nimportant pieces of information from being collected into an overall \nthreat assessment that might have alerted officials to the danger we \nfaced.\n  So it is clear to me, and as recommended in this bill, we need a \nstrong national intelligence director, strong enough to enforce common \npolicies throughout the intelligence community whenever and wherever \nintelligence collected by one agency might be useful to another. We do \nnot need a mere coordinator. That is what we have now; we have a \ncoordinator. We need someone who can focus resources and attention on \nthe most vital threats, national priorities. That person can only \nsucceed if we give him or her the strong powers they need over the \nbudget and personnel.\n\n  I have heard members point out that the 9/11 Commission did not point \nto any institutional policy that prevented the sharing of information. \nThe argument is, if we can do all this today, why do we have to make \ninstitutional\n\n[[Page S10320]]\n\nchange? They argue the problem is due to individuals who failed to \nperform their jobs by failing to convey information they were supposed \nto share. It is true that the commission's report discusses several \nspecific instances of this type of bureaucratic behavior, and in the \nend things that should have been done were not done, none of which seem \nto have led to disciplinary action. Nevertheless, there were policies \nsuch as the wall between domestic and foreign intelligence that \ninhibited the full sharing of information.\n  But even that is not quite the full story. It is my belief such \ninsular behavior will always exist, unless and until we have a strong \nnational intelligence director who can effectively enforce common \ninformation policies. That is what the Collins-Lieberman bill creates. \nThat is why keeping these powers is so important.\n  In the committee markup, the Senator from Michigan pointed out \ninstances where language could have been made clearer. I agree with him \nthat clearer lines of authority are important. But I fear that the \namendments being offered today are not mere clarifications but, rather, \nrepresent a fundamental tip in the balance and will result in erosion \nof the power of the NID.\n  I believe the Department of Defense will have a strong role in the \nnew intelligence constructs that the Collins-Lieberman bill creates. \nThe DOD will retain full authority over tactical intelligence. It will \nhave a seat at both the National Counterterrorism Center and the Joint \nIntelligence Community Council to argue for institutional interests and \nensure that its needs are met.\n  The bill also leaves direct, day-to-day command of the Department of \nDefense intelligence agencies with the DOD. Most of the staff of the \nintelligence agencies will remain uniformed service men and women. The \nDepartment will remain the intelligence community's largest consumer of \ninformation. The Secretary of Defense will remain one of the most \nsenior members of the Cabinet, with close communication with the \nPresident.\n  If we are going to create a NID with actual clout when it comes to \nenforcing common intelligence standards, the NID must have the ability \nto transfer funds and personnel within the intelligence community. \nWitness after witness came before us and said: With budget authority, \nthere is power. Whoever controls the purse has power. We understand \nthat in this body. He or she must be able to move assets where they are \nneeded most and ensure full compliance with communitywide requirements. \nThe chairman of the 9/11 Commission has admonished Congress, saying, \n``If you are not going to create a NID who has the powers of budget and \nappointment, don't do it.'' These powers are necessary to ensure that \nintelligence gathered by intelligence agencies reflects national \npriorities and is shared among all parts of the Government that need \nit.\n  The Collins-Lieberman bill gives the national intelligence director a \nnumber of important powers. He is supposed to develop common policies \nof personnel, budget practices, information networks, security \nclassifications, and communication systems. If we want him to succeed \nin these tasks, we must also give him or her the powers to accomplish \nthem.\n  This body voted last week to retain day-to-day control of the Defense \nintelligence services with the DOD, and I supported that sentiment. But \nsince the NID will not have direct day-to-day control, it is even more \nimportant that he have the ability to transfer money and personnel.\n  We all know that bureaucracies have a natural tendency to resist \nchange. So the question is, Will the national intelligence director be \nable to enforce his policies in the face of the inertia that normally \ncharacterizes existing agencies? Not unless everybody knows he is in \ncharge of the resources and has the power to shift them according to \nagency performance and his evaluation of needs.\n  The bill contains numerous provisions to ensure that this power is \nused responsibly. We make it clear that only the national intelligence \ndirector can make these transfers of resources and personnel. We also \nretain Congress's authority to approve transfers before they occur. \nThat way, it will be clear who is responsible for them and who will \nhave to justify them. We create the joint intelligence community \ncouncil made up of the users of intelligence, including the Secretary \nof Defense, to advise and evaluate the national intelligence director.\n  We require the NID to notify Congress, including the Committee on \nArmed Services, whenever there are transfers of personnel to or from \nthe Department of Defense. In light of these protections, it is \nextremely unlikely that the intelligence community will fail to support \nour armed services. In fact, it is stronger than that. It simply is not \ngoing to happen. We have set in place the kind of measures, the kind of \nsafeguards, the kind of oversight, the kind coordination that will \nensure the needs of the armed services are met. The intelligence needs \nof the armed services will be met.\n  Another amendment would remove the section of the bill that would \ndisclose the total funding for intelligence. I must respectfully \ndisagree with those who believe this disclosure will harm our national \nsecurity.\n  Again, this was an issue in which we had very clear testimony before \nthe committee. By the way, after all, reliable estimates of this number \nalready appear in the trade press. Moreover, the 9/11 Commission \nrecommended going further. They wanted to disclose the totals for each \nagency. But here we have a balance.\n  In our history as a nation, we have found the benefits of disclosure \nusually outweigh the costs. What we have in the way of disclosure makes \npolicymakers accountable to their actions. But again, we have struck a \nbalance.\n  I note in his testimony before the committee last month, then-acting \nCIA Director John McLaughlin agreed that declassification of the top \nline figure would make sense. He testified:\n\n       It reinforces responsibility and accountability on those \n     receiving the money, because you can see whether it's going \n     up, down, or so forth. . . . It also does the same thing for \n     Congress. . . . I don't think declassifying the top \n     line would be a major security threat.\n\n  Given all this, it is difficult for me to believe that disclosure \nwould weaken our safety in any meaningful way. It would, however, lead \nto more open debate about how much we need to spend to keep America \nsafe, and I think that is a good thing.\n  There are also proposals to exempt military personnel from the \nnational intelligence director's transfer, detail, and assignment \nauthority. I can understand the desire to maintain the military chain \nof command, but if we want the national intelligence director to \ndevelop and enforce common intelligence policies even in the face of \nagency silos, then he or she is going to need to draft his or her own \nplayers and make sure they are playing on the same team. When the \nnational intelligence director transfers a soldier out of an \nintelligence agency, that soldier returns to the Armed Forces where he \nor she will be, once again, safely in the chain of command. But as long \nas they remain in the intelligence community, they are responsible for \nmeeting the needs of the entire community, not just the Department of \nDefense, and that is why that individual must have the confidence of \nthe national intelligence director.\n  There is a second reason for keeping personnel authority in the \nnational intelligence director. We all agree on the creation of a \nNational Counter-ter-rorism Center--there has not been a lot of debate \nover that--and intelligence centers that represent other national \npriorities. We mean for these centers to contain the best people from \neach agency. Assuming, for example, that the National Count-er-ter-\nrorism Center consists of the best terrorism experts from each element \nof the intelligence community, it makes sense for it to be the forum \nfor negotiating common policies and planning joint operations. But in \norder to prevent each agency from creating its own counterterrorism \nunit and sending the NCTC only junior workers or workers sitting out \ntheir final years until retirement, the national intelligence director \nmust have the power to bring the best and the brightest to the National \nCounter-ter-rorism Center.\n  I note that the Chair talked about her visit to the current TTIC, the \nTerrorist Threat Integration Center, the forerunner of the NCTC. She \nnoticed\n\n[[Page S10321]]\n\nhow young some of the personnel there were. At this stage in time, it \nis not seen as the best place to be, but with a strong national \nintelligence director and a clear National Counterterrorism Center, we \nwant the best and the brightest, and the national intelligence director \nshould have the right to bring those people to the table to work with \nhim or her.\n  Finally, we will vote on amendments that would take one agency or \nanother out of the definition of ``national intelligence program'' and \nthereby move their budgets away from the national intelligence \ndirector's authority and back under the Defense Secretary's authority. \nThis might be wise if we make the Secretary of Defense responsible for \nenforcing common intelligence policies and meeting the intelligence \nneeds of the entire Government, but in that case we would not need a \nnational intelligence director. In that case, we ought to also transfer \nthe CIA into Defense.\n  On the other hand, if we want a strong coordinator of intelligence \nand we do not want that person to be the Secretary of Defense, then the \nnational intelligence director must have the budget power over all \nparts of the intelligence community that service common needs. It \nsimply would not make sense to break agencies, such as the NSA or NRO, \nup into pieces depending on whether this program or that fell into the \nnational intelligence program. They should either be part of a \ncoordinated approach to intelligence or they should be totally \nseparate. I submit they are too important not to be brought into the \nnational intelligence policy.\n\n  I note that even under the Collins-Lieberman bill, these agencies \nwould remain under the day-to-day control of the Department of Defense. \nMost of their personnel will still consist of uniformed military \nofficers. The relevant congressional committees will remain actively \ninvolved in ensuring the needs of the military are met, and the \nSecretary of Defense will remain a senior Cabinet member with a direct \nline to the President. With all this, it is difficult for me to believe \nthat the intelligence our combat forces receive will diminish in any \nmaterial way. It seems more probable that through better coordination \nand sharing, the Armed Forces will have access to better intelligence \nunder the Collins-Lieberman bill than they would have in a watered-down \nversion, and I think that is the key here.\n  In this post-9/11 world in which we live, where we understand the \nnature of the importance of intelligence, we must understand the \nimportance of breaking down the silos that in the past prohibited folks \nfrom working together. It is clear we all will benefit. The Department \nof Defense benefits and the intelligence agencies benefit, but most \nimportantly, the people of this great country benefit. When we have and \nwill have a strong national intelligence director, a clear sense of \nsomebody in charge with accountability and credibility, with the \nsupport and confidence of the President, we will all be able to sleep \neasier at night.\n  I urge my colleagues to resist the natural hesitation in the face of \nmajor change. Everybody likes change until it happens to them. The \nevents of 9/11 changed the world, and we must change our mindsets in \nresponse. I believe the Collins-Lieberman bill represents the right \nbalance and will make America safe.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject those amendments that would weaken the \nbalance, that would weaken the strength of the national intelligence \ndirector.\n  Let's move America forward. Let's make the change. Let's support this \nbill.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \nhis comments. As I indicated, he has been a key member in drafting this \nbill. I very much appreciate his many contributions and support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I join in thanking the Senator from \nMinnesota. Senator Coleman really hung in there with us and did the \nhard work in July, August, and September, both in attending the \nhearings and in helping to draft a bill over a 2-day markup.\n  His statement today means a lot to us personally, but I hope and \nbelieve it will mean a lot to the other Members of the Senate because \nit is a strong explanation of why this bill is urgently necessary. \nPeople asked earlier: What is the rush? People today asked: What is the \nrush? The rush is, we were attacked on September 11. It is more than 3 \nyears later, and Congress has not acted to adequately reorganize our \nintelligence assets community, which the 9/11 Commission told us, and \neverybody agrees, does not have a leader in charge.\n  Right now--what is his name?--Zawahiri, the second to bin Laden in \nal-Qaida, last week put out another tape urging Islamist terrorists \naround the world to attack America and Americans. So we are at war, and \nwe are not properly defending ourselves. That is the urgency.\n  The Senator from Minnesota has spoken very eloquently today, both for \nthe bill and against weakening amendments. That is really going to be \nthe test over the next couple of days as we move to cloture and \nadoption of the bill. The bill is in good shape now. We have listened, \nwe have negotiated with some people, accepted some amendments that we \nthought would not hurt the bill and would strengthen or clarify it. As \nthe Senator from Minnesota knows, a line has to be drawn and some of \nthese amendments take too much out of the bill and would hurt the \npurpose, which is to better protect the American people.\n  So I thank the Senator very much for what he has said, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n           Amendments Nos. 3825, 3809, as modified, and 3810\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I have a unanimous consent request, and I \nthink I am following a pattern, at least I hope so. If not, I will \nwithdraw. I ask unanimous consent that three amendments be called up \nand then be set aside so that they are in advance of cloture. I ask \nunanimous consent that amendment No. 3825 be called up and set aside. I \nalso send to the desk a modified version of amendment No. 3809, which \nhas been approved by the Democratic leader, which I understand the \nprocess is the modification and then that modified amendment will be \nset aside. Also, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 3810 be \ncalled up and set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3825\n\n   (Purpose: To permit reviews of criminal records of applicants for \n                  private security officer employment)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

I very much thank my dear friend from West Virginia, and I \nthank the managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I rise today to not offer but to \ntalk about an amendment because things are in the works. Therefore, I \ncan only talk, not offer.\n  The amendment, were it to take place, would be amendment No. 3712. Of \ncourse, it is to No. 2845, which is our basic bill. I think it is \nwidely agreed that Congress has an obligation to ensure that the \nefforts of the 9/11 Commission to improve our system of homeland \nsecurity is accurately captured by any legislation that we pass out of \nthis body.\n  Last week, Senators McCain and Hutchison offered constructive \namendments on aviation security, but I believe my talking points offer \nthe most comprehensive approach to improving aviation security, so I \nput them forward to my colleagues. I am pleased that Senator McCain was \nan original cosponsor of my Aviation Security Amendment Act, which I am \ntalking about today as if it were an amendment, which it is not, for \nthe moment anyway.\n  My idea would be to take needed steps to make certain that Commission \ntransportation security recommendations are reflected in the pending \nlegislation faithfully.\n  The recommendations of the 9/11 Commission are wide ranging. They \nbuild on the work we did in the House-Senate joint inquiry in 2002. I \nstrongly believe that we must reform our Government, our Congress, and \nour intelligence agencies to meet the threat of terrorism as has been \neloquently discussed by the two floor managers on many occasions.\n  Although the recommendations for transportation security are a small \npart of the overall report, their importance cannot be understated. \nThey are\n\n[[Page S10323]]\n\nsort of the most visible parts of security. I agree with the \nCommission's report when it states that targeting terrorists' ability \nto travel is a potent weapon against our efforts to protect against \nfuture terrorist attack.\n  In my position as chairman and now ranking member on the Senate \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation Committee's Subcommittee on \nAviation, I have worked on many of these issues that face Congress \nafter the terrorist attacks of 9/11.\n  I should point out that the Commerce Committee has looked at these \nissues and developed other recommendations in the years preceding \n9/11. I also want to note that while we need to incorporate legislation \nconsistent with the 9/11 recommendations, the report contains specific \ncriticisms of the FAA prior to 9/11 that I do not believe are \njustified.\n  For example, the report criticizes the Administrator of the FAA for \nbeing more focused on the delays than on security prior to 9/11, but we \nall were. We addressed those needs collectively with a new process to \nexpedite airport construction.\n  Unfortunately, I found it to be one area of the report that failed to \nput into context the actions of the FAA prior to 9/11 and what the \ncongressional role was during that period.\n  Additionally, after TWA 800 went down in July 1996, we all know that \nwe spent countless hours trying to develop measures for aviation \nsecurity. That was well before 9/11 by 5 years. Ultimately, we mandated \nthat more equipment and canine teams be dispatched as quickly as \npossible, but clearly the events of 9/11 have required an even more \ncomprehensive approach.\n  I have worked closely with Senators McCain, Hollings, Lott, and many \nothers over this period to take action to help ensure that the events \nof 9/11 are not repeated. Congress has passed a number of landmark \nbills to address critical needs in filling gaps in our aviation \nsecurity. While the legislation that passed in the days immediately \nfollowing the terrorist attacks was responsive to the crisis our \naviation system faced, these laws primarily addressed the immediate \nneeds we had regarding commercial passenger airline security, including \naircraft passenger and baggage screening. I believe we have a much \nimproved aviation security network because of the laws that were \nadopted. Improving aviation security is a continuous process, an \nexpensive process, and we must continue to make improvements to our \naviation security network. I think we all know much more needs to be \ndone.\n\n  Over the last 3 years, TSA, the Transportation Security \nAdministration, has had an appropriate opportunity to get up and \nrunning. It was awkward at first. They are much better at it now. I, \nalong with my colleagues on the Commerce Committee, have conducted \nnumerous oversight hearings on TSA and aviation security, a number of \nthem in closed session. Because of this oversight and our understanding \nof the transportation system, we were better able to understand where \nwe had made progress and identify what more work needed to be done \nabout aviation security.\n  To further address these needs, Senators McCain, Hollings, and myself \nintroduced S. 2393, the Aviation Security Advancement Act, which \nincluded measures to tighten air cargo security and bolster other \nexisting programs.\n  As we know, after the 9/11 Commission was established, they began a \ncomplete review of the events surrounding 9/11 and the requirements \nthat would be necessary for a comprehensive strengthening of all of our \nhomeland defense. When this report was released in July, it contained \nspecific recommendations regarding transportation security, along with \nexpress concern about cargo and general aviation security. Both cargo \nand general aviation security have been subjects considered at hearings \nbefore the Senate Commerce Committee this year, and I introduced S. \n2393 in an effort to make these issues a focus of Congress.\n  Last week, there was the amendment that I am talking about--not \noffering but talking about--which would do the following: Standardize \nthe Federal screener workforce to properly address staffing needs and \npromote more efficient and effective screening at airports; require DHS \nto consider coordinating aviation-security-related functions to improve \nefficiency and effectiveness of passenger screening; increase funding \nfor all-cargo aviation security to establish an improved security \nprogram and to promote the use of improved technology for cargo \nscreening; provides an additional $450 million to fund priority capital \nsecurity projects at airports; develops a streamlined baggage screening \nsystem by requiring a schedule for the in-line placement of explosive \ndetection systems; it bolsters the Federal Air Marshal Program; \nadvances the development of biometric technology for precise \nidentification of workers and travelers; and improves perimeter \nsecurity at airports by authorizing more than $20 million for TSA to \ndevelop biometric technology and fund a biometric center of excellence.\n\n  I believe these changes significantly improved the underlying \nlegislation and have left us with a product that speaks to many of the \nproblems that the 9/11 Commission found and which continue to exist in \nour airport transportation security network.\n  As I indicated, this is all in some flux now. It is being worked out \nwith the floor managers. I simply thank my colleagues and the Presiding \nOfficer and the two floor managers for allowing me to speak on what I \nthink would be potentially quite a helpful amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia, \nMr. Rockefeller, for talking about this amendment at this point. I know \nhe has not officially offered it yet.\n  We are talking to him about it. I think this amendment responds to \nmany of the recommendations made by the 9/11 Commission to strengthen \naviation security. I very much appreciate the provisions of this \namendment. We are trying to work out the authorization level that is \nincluded in the bill, but my overall reaction to his proposal is very \nfavorable.\n  I know it has been reported by the Commerce Committee and cleared by \nthe chairman and the ranking member of that committee. As usual, it \nreflects the Senator's thoughtful consideration of homeland security \nissues.\n  I very much have appreciated his advice throughout this debate, and I \nam hopeful that shortly we will be able to have him officially offer \nhis amendment, perhaps with a modification, and we would be able to \naccept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Senator Collins has spoken exactly for me as well. I \nlook forward to working with the Senator. It is a good amendment. There \nis one part that doesn't go to the heart of it, and we hope to look \nover it for a bit more and then I hope before along we can accept the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I rise first to congratulate the \ncommittee on the hard work they have put into this bill, in particular \nSenator Susan Collins, who I think has done a wonderful job. This was a \nvery difficult situation. She and Senator Lieberman have led the \ncommittee in an admirable way. What I have to say is just what I hope \nwill be seriously considered as the bill moves its way through to final \ncompletion by the House and Senate, ultimately to be in a form that can \nbe signed by the President.\n  I rise to discuss one aspect of the bill concerning privacy and civil \nliberties. The bill before us has many appropriate suggestions for \nreforming our intelligence activities. Part of this reform includes the \ntransformation of the Central Intelligence Agency and the enhancement \nof the human intelligence capability. We have heard over and over again \nthat we must increase our human intelligence. Almost every time we get \nin a situation where we wonder what is happening in some country--even \nsometimes when we are engaged in war--we ask, Do we know this? Do we \nknow that? The answers are we should, but we don't because we don't \nhave anyone there. We don't have anyone on the ground. That wasn't \nalways the case, but it has become a growing difficulty.\n  Actually, I think we should be getting better and better at it. What \nconcerns me is that part of this reform in this bill includes the \ntransformation of the Central Intelligence Agency and its enhancement \nof human intelligence, as\n\n[[Page S10324]]\n\nI said, but this reform in human intelligence is very critical because \nwe must get better at it. But, simultaneously, we must not inhibit it \nwith overreaching privacy and civil liberties provisions that may have \na chilling effect on such activities.\n  Simply put, I believe these provisions send a wrong message to our \nprofessional intelligence officers. Clearly, the 9/11 Commission report \nincludes recommendations highlighting the need for adequate supervision \nof executive branch powers in order to protect civil liberties. As a \nmodern democracy, we cherish individual rights and understand the \nimportance of creating institutions with a clear mandate for protecting \nthose civil rights. However, this bill establishes two officers in the \nNational Intelligence Authority to oversee compliance of privacy \npolicies and civil rights and civil liberties policies.\n  It also creates no fewer than eight similar officers for each of the \nexecutive branch departments and agencies concerned with national \nsecurity. These officers would be required to recommend privacy and \ncivil liberties policies and to:\n\n     periodically investigate and review department, agency, or \n     element actions, policies, procedures, guidelines, and \n     related laws and their implementation to ensure that [they \n     are] adequately considering privacy and civil liberties in \n     [their] actions.\n\n  These officers are created in addition to an inspector general of the \nNational Intelligence Authority. Clearly, insisting on all of these \ngoes well beyond what is necessary and may well hurt our attempt to \nimprove our human intelligence.\n  Our history of intelligence reform has many examples of sending wrong \nmessages to our intelligence officers. The restrictions and \nbureaucratic oversight instituted in the past have often hampered the \naggressiveness of operations and left our policymakers with less than a \ncomplete picture about critical intelligence matters.\n\n  The chilling effect that began with the Church hearings in the 1970s, \nwhile it did some things that were good--the chilling effect is long \nremembered. It has had a long, long effect.\n  The 1995 directive issued by former CIA Director John Deutch, which \nlimited officers from including unsavory individuals, was also \nsomething that had enormous chilling effects and caused some difficulty \nin obtaining the kind of people we needed as the human resources we \nhave been describing.\n  My concern is that excessive oversight established by this current \nbill will do the same thing, if not more. It will leave case officers \nwho do human intelligence missions concerned that they cannot do their \njobs to the best of their ability without worrying about being \ndisciplined or somebody kind of looking over their shoulder.\n  Some people have called this reluctance by operations officers, by \nthese officers, ``risk aversion.'' I don't know if that is the right \ncharacterization, but certainly we have had difficulties accomplishing \ncertain missions because we could not get enough trained people on the \nground in critical places throughout the world.\n  I am concerned that the oversight provisions of sections 126, 127, \nand 212 in this bill will continue to hurt us in this area.\n  Having said that, I believe removing these provisions would create a \nmuch better balance between the Government authority needed to protect \nAmerica and the civil liberties we hold so dear. Removing these \nsections that create too many oversight positions would remove \nredundancy while maintaining the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight \nBoard that was recommended by the national commission.\n  Once again, I believe this bill does a very good job of enhancing our \nintelligence system, but let us not undermine these positive steps \nbefore they have had a chance to work.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3903\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I rise today in opposition to \namendment No. 3903, offered by Senator Ted Stevens. This amendment \nstrikes the provision in the bill that calls for the disclosure of the \naggregate amount of funding requested, authorized, and appropriated for \nthe national intelligence program.\n  There is one of the fundamental reforms recommended by the 9/11 \nCommission and one that I have long supported.\n  The proponents of this amendment have made two central arguments. \nFirst, they suggest we are rushing into this decision without fully \nunderstanding the implications.\n  Second, they suggest that revealing the amount of overall spending \ncould somehow damage our national security.\n  Let us address the first argument, that we are rushing into this \ndecision. I must point out this is not a new debate. The Congress has \nbeen considering this particular question for at least a decade. In \n1993, the Senate adopted an amendment calling for the disclosure of the \naggregate amount of intelligence spending.\n  Let me repeat that the Senate endorsed the idea 11 years ago.\n  That effort and a subsequent attempt to make the top line public, \nwhich is what we are talking about--the total amount of the \nintelligence budget--in 1997 had the support of Senators Specter, \nBoren, and DeConcini, all of whom served as chairman of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee. We had a full and complete debate in 1993, and \nthis issue has been reviewed, debated, and discussed numerous times in \nthe intervening years. The argument that we are being rushed into this \ndecision is an excuse being used to stop this important change.\n  Regarding the second argument, that disclosing the overall budget \nwill damage our national security, I cannot cite a better source than \nthe Deputy Director of the CIA John McLaughlin who testified last month \nthat this important step would reinforce responsibility and \naccountability, not only for those receiving the money but for the \nCongress as well. In addition, Robert Gates and John Deutch, former \nDirectors of Central Intelligence, have said that releasing the number \nwould not damage national security.\n  Arguing that disclosure of the total spending for national \nintelligence would compromise our security and provide enemies with \nuseful information about our intelligence programs ignores the reality \nof the current situation. While the number is in fact classified, it is \nwidely reported in the press. It also was officially declassified for \nfiscal years 1997 and 1998 by former DCI Tenet.\n  Some have argued that the total amount is not the problem; it is the \nbudget trends that need to be protected. Again, current practice \nundermines this argument. Every year when we do the intelligence \nauthorization bill, the chairmen and vice chairmen in both Houses come \nto the floor and talk about whether we have increased or decreased the \nbudget that year. Often those statements include specific percentage \nincreases. These discussions and trends disclose nothing about the \nspecific intelligence programs being funded.\n  The idea that our enemies can somehow determine something about our \nintelligence capability by knowing the total of what we spend is simply \nnot accurate. Year-to-year changes in any specific program will not \nmove the overall total number enough to give an adversary any \nindication of how that money is being spent.\n  In other sensitive national security areas, we disclose much more \ninformation without doing damage. We currently disclose an enormous \namount of detail about our defense budget and military capabilities. \nThe amount of money we spend on personnel, acquisition, and research \nand development is unclassified. Also available are the amounts for \nspecific weapons systems, such as tanks, aircraft, and missile defense.\n\n  Even much of the spending in the defense budget for specific tactical \nintelligence programs is unclassified currently.\n  The disclosure of the total of the national intelligence budget is \nsimply not an academic debate. This step is critical to many of the \nother reforms in\n\n[[Page S10325]]\n\nthis bill which our floor managers are trying so hard to get done, and \nto some of the proposed congressional reforms we will be discussing \nlater this week. Without a separate unclassified budget number, the \nfund for the National Intelligence Program will still need to be \nincluded in the Defense Department budget. This arrangement will hinder \neffective control by the national intelligence director and will \nrestrict our ability to organize in a way to streamline congressional \noversight, which is what the 9/11 Commission and our floor managers are \nseeking in their legislation.\n  To conclude, it will be virtually impossible to have a separate \nappropriations for intelligence without the declassified intelligence \nbudget. If we do not take this step and make this number public, we are \nseriously undermining the reforms in this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Stevens amendment and support this \nkey recommendation of the 9/11 Commission.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia \nfor his very eloquent presentation.\n  As the Senator indicated, the intelligence budget's aggregate number \nhas been made public twice by the DCI. So this is not unprecedented. \nBut if the amendment offered by the Senator from Alaska were adopted, \nlet there be no mistake of what the effect would be. The effect would \nbe that the funding for the National Intelligence Program would still \nbe funded through Department of Defense.\n  The whole purpose of this bill is to create a national intelligence \ndirector with significant authority, and the first and perhaps most \nsignificant of those authorities is the control of the budget. The only \nway you can give the NID true control over the budget is if you have a \nseparate account that the NID controls. And we need to do that by \ndeclassifying the top level number.\n  We did not go as far as the 9/11 Commission recommended. The 9/11 \nCommission recommended declassifying the top lines of all the agencies' \nbudgets within the National Intelligence Program. We did not adopt that \napproach. Instead, we are only declassifying the aggregate number for \nthe entire national intelligence budget, a number I note is often \nestimated and reported in the newspapers today.\n  But the point I want to make to supplement the remarks of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia is if we do not do this, if we adopt the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Alaska, we will undermine a key reform in \nthe bill because the intelligence budget is so big that if it is not \ngoing to be declassified, it has to go through the Department of \nDefense. There is no other agency or department that is big enough to \nconceal the total amount of the budget.\n  This is going to be an important vote which is coming up this \nafternoon.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, when I delivered my short remarks in \nreference to the privacy and civil liberties provision, I failed to \nmention the other provisions in the bill that attempt to provide \nsimilar or corresponding type relationships. One is called the privacy \nand civil liberties oversight board. That is a very different thing \nwithin the purview of intelligence activities. It is almost political \nin nature. It is appointed by the President and confirmed by the \nSenate, three members of one party and two of the other.\n  It seems to me a very significant intrusion, perhaps, if one of those \ninstitutions will have a very chilling effect.\n  In addition to all of those I have mentioned, four, that is five; I \nmentioned six, that is seven; and now we have an eighth, which is an \nombudsman, which seems, at least to me, to be a bit of piling on in \nthis bill. You get one, and you think it is OK; someone has another; \nand someone has another. There is no criticism in that, but that is \nwhat it appears to me. We used to call that piling on when we went into \nconference where somebody seemed to be piling on because they have so \nmany provisions affecting the same thing. But in this case, if that is \nwhat it is, it will have serious potential for repercussions that we \ndon't want.\n  I thank you, Madam President, and the Senate for yielding me this \ntime.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I apologize for not being here earlier. \nI thank the managers of the bill, Senator Collins and Senator \nLieberman, and their staffs for the work that has been done over the \nweekend, which we will be hearing about soon, trying to meet us halfway \nin terms of some of the objections we have raised to the bill.\n  We will soon vote on amendment No. 3903, which the Senator from Maine \nhas just discussed, declassification responsibility. This is an \nenormous step to take mainly because of the absolute lobbying and \npressure from two people from the 9/11 Commission. I have talked to \nother members on the Commission who were not so keen about \ndeclassification of the entire intelligence budget other than Mr. \nHamilton and Mr. Kean.\n  Clearly, it is a massive step. From President Truman to President \nBush, every President of the United States has said do not declassify \nthe top line of our budget. We have voted in the Senate many times \nsince I have been in the Senate as Members have tried to do this, and \nwe have uniformly turned down such a proposal.\n  Now it is in a bill for the first time. We must take it out. It \nrequires 51 votes to take out. In the past, it took 51 votes to pass. \nWe are in a different position now than we were before. Very clearly, \nbecause of the scope of this bill, we are doing something even more \nexpansive than amendments that came before the Senate before.\n  Again, I call the attention of the Senators who will vote to the \nscope of the definition of national intelligence under this bill. It is \na sweeping definition.\n  I ask that page 6, beginning on line 19, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       (6) The term ``National Intelligence Program''--\n       (A)(i) refers to all national intelligence programs, \n     projects, and activities of the elements of the intelligence \n     community;\n       (ii) includes all programs, projects, and activities \n     (whether or not pertaining to national intelligence) of the \n     National Intelligence Authority, the Central Intelligence \n     Agency, the National Security Agency, the National \n     Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the National Reconnaissance \n     Office, the Office of Intelligence of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, and the Office of Information analysis of the \n     Department of Homeland Security; and\n       (ii) includes any other program, project, or activity of a \n     department, agency, or element of the United States \n     Government relating to national intelligence unless the \n     National Intelligence Director and the head of the \n     department, agency, or element concerned determine otherwise; \n     but\n       (B) except as provided in subparagraph (A)(ii), does not \n     refer to any program, project, or activity of the military \n     departments, including any program, project, or activity of \n     the Defense Intelligence Agency that is not part of the \n     National Foreign Intelligence Program as of the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, to acquire intelligence principally \n     for the planning and conduct of joint or tactical military \n     operations by the United States Armed Forces.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. My point is this: Included in intelligence are the top \nsecret plans of this country. They are the planning for future devices \nand concepts that deal with interception of information. They deal with \nthe ability to identify individuals. They deal with so many classified \nareas that I may be violating some rules by mentioning the two I \nmentioned.\n  All the money we put in this bill, hide in the intelligence bill, to \nstop anyone from knowing about it, has to be disclosed under this \ndirection, to include everything, any program, project, or activity of \nany one of these agencies.\n  I plead with Members to think about classification. This is not \nroutine classification of who is an employee of the CIA. That is bad \nenough, come to think of it. These activities are so far reaching, and \nwith so many agencies, including the defense agency that deals with \nresearch activities. It has projects it is working on, which are so far \nout that may prove to be viable. They are part of the intelligence \nbudget. They are classified. They are down in the black portion of the \nbill and are kept classified because we do not want anyone to know what \nwe are researching and what we are developing. It would be included in \nthis.\n  No amendment we ever looked at before would have done that, but \nbecause of the definition of intelligence in this bill it becomes all \ninclusive and there is no alternative.\n  Sometimes I think maybe I am just not able to communicate totally \nwhat I am thinking about this bill. It is far reaching to the point of \nhaving the ability to destroy intelligence capability to plan for the \nfuture.\n  There is no question about the right to know everything--except the \nsecrets of the country. Aren't we allowed to\n\n[[Page S10326]]\n\nhave some secrets? Do we have to disclose a number that encompasses the \nfinancing of secret activities, some so classified they are not even \ntop secret; they are code word? You have to be cleared for the word. \nYou have to be totally cleared. And there are very few people cleared \nfor these activities. I don't think there are many people in the Senate \nwho are cleared for code word activities.\n  Should we tell them what we are spending for code word activities? We \ndo not even tell them the word--but we will have to print in the Record \nnow, disclose in the top line of the intelligence budget, all of those \nactivities.\n  I will speak later about it. Again, I implore the managers of the \nbill to think twice about this precedent we would be setting, reversing \nthe votes in the Senate--reversing because now it requires 51 votes to \ntake it out. In the past, it was 51 votes to get it passed.\n  This has shifted the burden from the intelligence people who want to \nprotect the Intelligence Committee to the people who do not understand \nit, do not wish to really understand it. I am not being accusatory of \nmy two friends. They have worked hard and are trying to understand, but \nsome of us have lived a lifetime in trying to understand it. This \namendment has to pass.\n  If we want to disclose the budget to the extent that it is not \nclassified in terms of top secret or above, that is another matter. We \ncan disclose a portion of the budget that is in the secret category, \nbut when we get to top secret and above--no. If we include that, count \nme out. I cannot believe we would do that. I hope the Senator will \nlisten to us later.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. BURNS. As I looked at this amendment and thought of making \navailable the information of how much we spend on intelligence--not \nonly are there operations we have to take into consideration, lives of \npeople are on the line. We make them more vulnerable every day in their \nwork, gathering intelligence.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is absolutely right.\n  Mr. BURNS. And I ask the Senator, has anyone determined what it does \nto the human assets, the people? They are the best we have. Are they \nwilling to work for this agency to get the best intelligence we need?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The problem is, once we make available this top line \nthey wish to disclose and then start through the budget on what you can \nfind easily, pretty soon you come down to the portion of the budget \nthat is in the classified sector, and then you start to pick it \napart. You know what will happen. It will keep getting question after \nquestion after question.\n\n  But the people who risk their lives, who are foreign nationals, are \npaid from this budget. We are really going to put in there how much we \nare paying people around the world to spy for us? Are we naive enough \nto think we are not paying people? It would be in there. Unless the \nSenator disagrees with me, there is one little exception: unless \nsomeone decides otherwise. I am not sure what that means because it \nonly refers to that one section. It is related to national \nintelligence.\n  Now, national intelligence is intelligence that is covered by section \n5. It does not refer to counterintelligence or law enforcement \nactivities conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It does \nnot say it does not cover counterintelligence or activities of the CIA \nor the DIA, but it does for the FBI.\n  I think the problem is, the definitions of these programs are so \nspecific now to this bill. But this one covers the disclosure of the \ntotal amount. That is what I object to.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I have drawn the conclusion that \nbasically this destroys the network. And we wonder why we do not have \nhuman resources on the ground in some areas in the world and, yes, even \nin our own country. I will tell you, if this is disclosed, this will be \none of the main reasons that we will have.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Let me tell the Senator one thing before I quit. I \nremember one morning I woke up and the New York Times had a picture of \nthe Predator on the front page, and it disclosed that it was capable of \ncarrying the Hellfire missile. If there was anything that was totally \nclassified at that time, that was it, and there it was out there on the \nfront page. Do you know what. About a week later, we missed several \npeople in Afghanistan on whom we were trying to use the Hellfire \nmissile. They knew it was already there. They knew it was armed by that \ntime. Before that, it had not been armed and before that no one had the \ncapability to arm it. But we developed a way to arm it, and there it \nwas on the front page of the New York Times.\n  Now, this concept of leakage of the intelligence community's \nactivities starts from the top line. I do not understand why we should \nreverse the history of this Senate. The Senate has never voted to \ndisclose the intelligence budget--never.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I have great respect for the Senator \nfrom Alaska. He has always contributed to our country in so many \ndifferent ways. I have great respect for his long experience in matters \nof defense and intelligence. I assure him of this.\n  He raised the question about whether the Senator from Maine and I \nunderstand what we are doing. Let me assure him, we understand. We have \nspent a lot of time studying this issue. The 9/11 Commission has spent \na lot of time studying this issue. We disagree with the amendment of \nthe Senator from Alaska. We have a difference of conclusion about \npolicy, but we understand exactly what we are doing.\n  What we are doing is saying that the billions of dollars that are \nspent every year on intelligence is the people's money. Unless there is \na national security reason not to tell them what the bottom line is we \nare spending, they have a right to know. One of the consequences of \nthat is that there will be more accountability.\n  Acting Director of Central Intelligence John McLaughlin said to our \ncommittee:\n\n       I think it would make some sense to declassify the overall \n     number of the foreign intelligence program. It would \n     reenforce responsibility and accountability.\n\n  This is nobody who was pulled in out of nowhere to run the CIA. He \nspent his entire career, more than 30 years, in intelligence.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. No. I would like to----\n  Mr. STEVENS. But you are using foreign intelligence. This is national \nintelligence. He talked about foreign intelligence.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Excuse me, he talked about national intelligence \nbefore our committee. It is the bottom line, a gross number.\n  The colloquy between the Senator from Montana and the Senator from \nAlaska was interesting but bore no relevance whatsoever to the proposal \nin our bill. Do you think we would make this recommendation if we \nthought it would compromise the security of anybody in our intelligence \ncommunity?\n  Let me ask you this: How would it? It is the bottom line. It is not \neven the 15 constituent agencies of the intelligence community. This \ndoes not compromise anybody's security any more than the Defense \nDepartment budget compromises the security of our soldiers, or the DEA \nbudget, which is public, Drug Enforcement Agency, compromises the \nsecurity of any of our drug enforcement agents, or the FBI budget. \nPeople in DEA and FBI are involved in very dangerous work.\n  Anyway, it is only the bottom line.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 4:15 \nhaving arrived, the Senate will proceed to a series of votes on pending \namendments, with 2 minutes equally divided for debate prior to each \nvote. The first amendment is Senator Byrd's amendment, amendment No. \n3845.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I want to explain to our colleagues \nwhat is going to happen before we proceed. There will be a motion to \ntable the Byrd amendment. There will be 2 minutes equally divided and \nthen a motion to table the Byrd amendment.\n  We have been able to work out an agreement on Senator Warner's \namendment. That will be the second matter we deal with. He will send a \nmodification to the desk, and it is my hope to be able to adopt that \namendment by a voice vote and vitiate the rollcall request.\n\n[[Page S10327]]\n\n  Then there will be consideration of an amendment from Senator Stevens \nhaving to do with the effective date. Again, we have worked out a \ncompromise on that, working very hard throughout the weekend. I expect \nSenator Stevens will propose a modification to his amendment, and that \nwill allow us to clear that amendment by a voice vote.\n  We then will proceed to the Stevens amendment dealing with \nclassification, which has been debated extensively. That will require a \nrollcall vote, and I will be moving to table it.\n  We then will move to another Stevens amendment where, again, I am \npleased to report there is another compromise. It has to do with the \ninteragency counterterrorism plans. Again, an amendment will be sent to \nthe desk incorporating the compromise. I believe Senator Stevens will \nbe offering that. I anticipate being able to accept that on a voice \nvote.\n  So I want my colleagues to know that we have made considerable \nprogress in accommodating concerns expressed by the Senator from \nVirginia and the Senator from Alaska. As a result, I see the need for \ntwo rollcall votes out of the five that were ordered. I hope that is \nhow it will unfold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time with regard to the amendment?\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I say to the managers of the bill, I \nwould like to respond to the ranking member's assessment of why the \nfunds should be disclosed. I ask permission to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield time?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I am wondering if perhaps that could be \ndone in the 2 minutes on the Stevens amendment, since we have an awful \nlot of amendments to get through. I am very hesitant to cut off the \nSenator from Montana, but would that be acceptable?\n  Mr. BURNS. That will be fine. We might ask for a little more time.\n  Ms. COLLINS. OK. Madam President, we would now proceed to 2 minutes \nof debate equally divided on Senator Byrd's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, seeing the absence of Senator Byrd, I \nask the Senator, would you like to proceed to my amendment to take a \nlittle time while he comes to the floor?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I think that would be a good idea. I \nask unanimous consent that we proceed to Senator Warner's amendment \nfirst while we are waiting for Senator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I now observe the presence of the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3877, As Further Modified\n\n  Madam President, I send to the desk a modification to amendment No. \n3877.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is further \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 40, strike line 18 and all that follows through \n     page 42, line 9, and insert the following:\n       (b) NID Recommendation or Concurrence in Certain \n     Appointments.--With respect to any position as head of an \n     agency, organization, or element within the intelligence \n     community (other than the Director of the Central \n     Intelligence Agency)--\n       (1) if the appointment to such position is made by the \n     President, any recommendation to the President to nominate or \n     appoint an individual to such position shall be accompanied \n     by the recommendation of the National Intelligence Director \n     with respect to the nomination or appointment of such \n     individual to such position; and\n       (2) if the appointment to such position is made by the head \n     of the department containing such agency, organization, or \n     element, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, or \n     a subordinate official of such department or of the Central \n     Intelligence Agency, no individual may be appointed to such \n     position without the concurrence of the National Intelligence \n     Director.\n       (c) Presidential Authority.--This section, and the \n     amendments made by this section, shall apply to the fullest \n     extent consistent with the authority of the President under \n     the Constitution relating to nomination, appointment, and \n     supervision of the unitary executive branch.\n       On page 42, after line 25, add the following:\n       (e) Conforming Amendments.--(1) Section 201 of title 10, \n     United States Code, is amended--\n       (A) by striking subsection (a);\n       (B) by redesignating subsections (b) and (c) as subsections \n     (a) and (b), respectively;\n       (C) by striking ``Director of Central Intelligence'' each \n     place it appears and inserting ``National Intelligence \n     Director'';\n       (D) in subsection (a), as so redesignated--\n       (i) in paragraph (1)--\n       (I) by striking ``seek'' and inserting ``obtain''; and\n       (II) by striking the second sentence; and\n       (ii) in paragraph (2)--\n       (I) by redesignating subparagraphs (B) and (C) as \n     subparagraphs (C) and (D), respectively; and\n       (II) by inserting after subparagraph (A) the following new \n     subparagraph (B):\n       ``(B) The Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.''; \n     and\n       (E) in paragraph (2) of subsection (b), as so \n     redesignated--\n       (i) by redesignating subparagraphs (B) and (C) as \n     subparagraphs (C) and (D), respectively; and\n       (ii) by inserting after subparagraph (A) the following new \n     subparagraph (B):\n       ``(B) The Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.''.\n       (2)(A) The heading of such section is amended by striking \n     ``consultation and''.\n       (B) The table of sections at the beginning of subchapter II \n     of chapter 8 of such title is amended in the item relating to \n     section 201 by striking ``consultation and''.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. This is an amendment which strikes a balance between the \nrespective authorities of the newly to be created NID together with the \nSecretary of Defense and others as it relates to the recommendations to \nthe President for the appointment of Presidential appointees. It has \nthe support of the distinguished managers on both sides. I worked in \ncooperation with the White House staff in its preparation, and they \nhave expressed strong concurrence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee for working with Senator Lieberman and me \non the appointment authority. This is a very important issue. We have \nstruck the right balance in the modification. I urge acceptance of the \nmodification which embodies the compromise we worked on over the \nweekend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank Senator Warner for the \ninitiative and for the reasoning that we have done. We have come up \nwith a result that is a wise and solid balance. We are creating a new \nposition--national intelligence director--but we want that position to \nwork particularly closely with the Secretary of Defense. This \ncompromise says that on the critical national intelligence agencies--\nNSA, NGA, and NRO--that are now in the Defense Department, whereas the \ninitiative to head that department was previously in the national \nintelligence director, we are giving it back to the Secretary of \nDefense but asking for concurrence from the national intelligence \ndirector before it goes to the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the managers has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. In fact, this amendment broadens the involvement of \nthe national intelligence director in these important nominations.\n  I thank the Senator for his cooperation. It shows that Senator \nCollins and I are willing to hear and accept a good idea.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I note the long hours and hard work of \nthe two managers. We started on this on Thursday, when I first \nintroduced it, and we worked it again on Friday. Those were productive \ndays. Even though we did not have rollcall votes on Friday, much was \naccomplished, including the resolution of this amendment.\n  I ask now that the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3877, as further modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3877) was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3845\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on the amendment of \nthe Senator from West Virginia.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, the amendment of the Senator from West\n\n[[Page S10328]]\n\nVirginia would considerably limit the authority of the national \nintelligence director to move money and people. It would undermine a \nkey reform that is included in this bill, a reform that the 9/11 \nCommission says is absolutely necessary to empower the NID. Otherwise \nwe are just creating another layer of bureaucracy. We need to make sure \nthat the NID has the authority to marshal the resources, the people, \nand the funding to counter the biggest threats we face.\n  The Byrd amendment would actually give the new national intelligence \ndirector less authority than the DCI has under current law to move \naround money and personnel to address urgent needs. Under the Byrd \namendment, aggregate transfers from a department or an agency would be \nlimited by a dollar and a percentage amount. There is no such \nlimitation in current law. This amendment represents a step backward \nfrom current law. It would severely undermine the reforms. I am going \nto move that it be tabled. I urge my colleagues to oppose the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 1 minute.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes. I \nwould like to yield to the distinguished Senator, chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and President pro tempore of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional minute on our side, then, as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I believe this is another amendment \nthat is sort of misunderstood. The powers of the national intelligence \ndirector under this bill are much broader than the CIA Director's. \nUnder this bill he has the right to move money from any part of the \nintelligence community to another part without consent of the agency to \nwhom we appropriated money and, really, without regard to the program \nactivities or even the specifications Congress has put on that money.\n  Take, for instance, reserve funds. Reserve funds are there in the \nevent of emergencies for the specific agency involved. He can go in to \ntake the reserve funds from one agency and move them entirely to \nanother agency without any consent of the agency or the consent of the \ncommittees that appropriated the money for that reserve contingency.\n  The Senator's amendment makes a lot of sense. Those of us who are \ncosponsors are very serious about our support.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support much of what is contained in \namendment No. 3845, offered by Senator Byrd. However, I will vote \nagainst the amendment because it strikes from the underlying bill \nsection 224(b)(3), a provision included in an amendment I offered \nduring markup of the bill in the Government Affairs Committee. Section \n224 requires that the NID, the Director of the NCTC, and the Director \nof any other intelligence center make intelligence information \navailable upon the request of committees of Congress with jurisdiction \nover the subject matter to which the information relates, or upon the \nrequest of the chairman or ranking member of the House or Senate \nIntelligence Committees. Too much information and too many documents \nhave been withheld from congressional committees by the CIA. If we are \ngoing to prevent a stronger national intelligence direction from \nbecoming a stronger ``yes man'' and stronger political arm of a White \nHouse, there must be strong oversight from Congress.\n  The intention of section 224(b)(3) is to limit the amount of \nintelligence information that the executive branch can legally withhold \nfrom the Congress. The requirement to provide information to Congress \nexists unless the President asserts a Constitutionally-based privilege. \nSenator Byrd and I both agree that the Congress should have broad \naccess to intelligence information. I disagree, however, with that part \nof the Byrd amendment which strikes section 224(b)(3).\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, while I agree with the \nprovisions of Senator Byrd's amendment, No. 3845, that seeks to provide \ngreater congressional oversight of the national intelligence authority, \nmy objections to provisions in the amendment that would require the \nNational Intelligence Director to relinquish budget authority make it \nnecessary for me to oppose the amendment and vote in favor of the \nmotion to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, we must not take control of public moneys \nfrom the elected representatives of the people and give it to an \nunelected bureaucrat. The Byrd-Stevens-Inouye-Warner amendment gives \nthe director the flexibility to transfer personnel and appropriations \nto protect against terrorist attacks but provides a leash with which to \nrein him in should abuses occur. They may occur. They probably will in \ntime. This is a safeguard.\n  I say listen to the Constitution of the United States. I am very \ninterested in reform, and I admire the work the committee has done. But \nwe are acting too hastily. We are not given enough time, and we are \ngoing to rue the day that we turned this amendment down and failed to \nleash this unelected bureaucrat. We, the people, stand by the \nConstitution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, testimony from former DCIs as well as \nother experts confirmed the need for stronger authority to transfer and \nreprogram funds and told us this is key to reform of the intelligence \ncommunity. The Acting Director of the CIA said it best. He talked about \nhow cumbersome the current system is. He told us you first have to \nacquire the approval of the agency head, then you have to go to the \ndepartment secretary, then you have to go to OMB, and then you have to \ngo to Congress. We are keeping the OMB and congressional steps. I want \nto make that clear. But that process, he told us, typically takes 5 \nmonths, and, as he said--and I quote John McLaughlin:\n\n       So you can see that's not very agile to meet the needs of \n     today. My view is that the national intelligence director \n     ought to have the authority to move those funds.\n\n  I would also note that other provisions in the bill are opposed by \nthe White House, and the amendment is opposed by the chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee.\n  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cornyn) \nand the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from \nOklahoma (Mr. Inhofe) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka), the \nSenator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine), the Senator from North Carolina \n(Mr. Edwards), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the Senator from \nSouth Carolina (Mr. Hollings), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy), and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman).

Mr. President, I am very pleased to inform our \ncolleagues that, after working very closely with Senator Stevens, \nSenator Lieberman and I have agreed to a modification of his amendment \nthat is acceptable to us.\n  The bill originally called for an effective date after enactment of \n180 days. The amendment of Senator Stevens would retain that date but \ngive the President the ability to extend for another 6 months for \ncertain provisions of the bill. That is an acceptable compromise.\n  I thank the Senator from Alaska for working with the Senator from \nConnecticut and myself to reach this agreement. I want my colleagues to \ntake note that we have accommodated the Senator's concern in this \nregard.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I send a modification of my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3829), as modified, is as follows:\n\n\n                    amendment no. 3829 (as modified)\n\n       On page 133, line 4, strike ``90 days'' and insert ``180 \n     days''.\n       On page 134, line 4, strike ``180 days'' and insert ``270 \n     days''.\n       On page 135, line 15, strike ``270 days'' and insert ``1 \n     year''.\n       On page 140, line 6, strike ``30 days'' and insert ``90 \n     days''.\n       On page 145, line 12, strike ``1 year'' and insert ``15 \n     months''.\n       On page 149, line 16, strike ``1 year'' and insert ``15 \n     months''.\n       On page 150, line 20, strike ``1 year'' and insert ``15 \n     months''.\n       On page 212, beginning on line 3, strike ``subsection (b), \n     this Act, and the amendments made by this Act,'' and insert \n     ``subsections (b), (c), and (d), titles I through III of this \n     Act, and the amendments made by such titles,''\n       On page 212, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n       (b) Specified Effective Dates.--(1) The provisions of \n     section 206 shall take effect as provided in such provisions.\n       (2) The provisions of sections 211 and 212 shall take \n     effect 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       On page 212, line 7, strike ``(b)'' and all that follows \n     through ``United States'' on line 10 and insert ``(c) Earlier \n     Effective Date.--In order to safeguard the national security \n     of the United States through rapid implementation of titles I \n     through III of this Act while also ensuring a smooth \n     transition in the implementation of such titles,''.\n       On page 212, beginning on line 11, strike ``Act (including \n     the amendments made by this Act), or one or more particular \n     provisions of this Act'' and insert ``titles I through III of \n     this Act (including the amendments made by such titles), or \n     one or more particular provisions of such titles''.\n       On page 212, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n       (d) Delayed Effective Date.--(1) Except with respect to a \n     provision specified in subsection (b), the President may \n     extend the effective date of a provision of titles I through \n     III of this Act (including the amendments made by such \n     provision) for any period up to 180 days after the effective \n     date otherwise provided by this section for such provision.\n       (2) The President may extend the effective date of a \n     provision under paragraph (1) only if the President \n     determines that the extension is necessary to safeguard the \n     national security of the United States and after balancing \n     the need for a smooth transition in the implementation of \n     titles I through III of this Act against the need for a rapid \n     implementation of such titles.\n       On page 212, line 17, strike ``(c)'' and insert ``(e)''.\n       On page 212, line 18, strike ``(b)'' and insert ``(c) or \n     (d)''.\n\n       On page 212, line 23, strike ``earlier'' and insert \n     ``earlier or delayed''.\n       On page 212, line 25, strike ``earlier'' and insert \n     ``earlier or delayed''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senators from Maine and Connecticut for \nworking with us on this amendment. It does stretch out the timeframe \nand makes much more sense.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska. We \nhave improved this. We have said 180 days for the effective date. If \nthe President decides it is in the national security interest to extend \nthat, he can do that. If he decides he wants to implement it earlier \nthan 180 days in the national security interest, he can do that as \nwell. It is a good compromise. I support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3829), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3903, as modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Stevens amendment No. 3903.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, could we have order?\n  Determining classification is the responsibility and duty of the \nchief executive of the United States, the President, who is also \nCommander in Chief. Presidents Truman through Bush has determined that \nthe overall intelligence budget top-line figure is, and shall remain, \nclassified, and I believe we should not overrule that judgment.\n  The foundation of an effective intelligence capability, is secrecy. \nSecrecy protects not only the information that we collect, but also the \nbrave people that put themselves at risk to do the collection of it. We \nare an open and a free society that generally abhors secret dealings by \nour Government. But in the case of intelligence collection and \nanalysis, secrecy, is absolutely necessary.\n  Some of my colleagues argue that the American people have a right to \nknow how much of their money is being spent to defend their Nation's \nsecurity through intelligence-gathering operations. I assert today \nthat, through its elected officials, the public interests are being \neffectively served.\n  Some argue that disclosing the total budget amount will instill \npublic confidence and enable the American people to know what portion \nof the Federal budget is dedicated to intelligence activities. This \nbill recommends that the overall intelligence budget should no longer \nremain classified. I believe that the total budget figure is of no use \nto anyone but to those who wish to do us harm.\n  For example, what do the numbers tell our adversaries or potential \nadversaries in the world? In any given year, perhaps, not a great deal. \nBut while watching the changes in the budget over time, and using \ninformation gathered by their own intelligence activities, \nsophisticated analysts can indeed learn a great deal.\n  Trend analysis, as you know, is a technique that our own analysts use \nto make predictions and to reach conclusions. There are hostile foreign \nintelligence agencies all over the world that are focused solely on \ngathering every bit of information that they can about our own \nintelligence-gathering operations and our capabilities. Their ultimate \ngoal is to exploit weaknesses and to deny access and to deceive our own \nintelligence collectors. Denial and deception is already a serious \nconcern for the intelligence community, and providing our enemies or \npotential enemies with any insight as to what we spend on intelligence \nwill only make it worse, not better.\n\n  No other nation, friend, or ally, reveals the amount that it spends \non intelligence. It would set a terrible, dangerous precedent, because \nright after the aggregate budget was revealed, that number doesn't say \nmuch and so the calls would be quickly for more information.\n  This is a slippery slope. Reveal the first number and it will be just \na matter of minutes before there will be a call to reveal more \ninformation.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that we voted on a similar measure in \n1997--the amendment failed by a vote of 56-43. There have also been \nfive votes in the House--all of which have failed. Let us not change \nour records now.\n  The President of the United States and every President since Harry \nTruman has requested that the Senate not declassify the amount our \ncountry spends on intelligence. I believe we should listen to what he \ntells us. I have amended my original amendment to request that only a \nstudy be done on this important issue. That the national intelligence \ndirector have the time to investigate this important topic and let\n\n[[Page S10330]]\n\nhim, with the President, decide what the safety needs of our Nation are \nto be.\n  Based on the recommendations of our colleagues here in the past, I \nhope you will accept this change and support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I rise respectfully to oppose the amendment of the \nSenator from Alaska. The 9/11 Commission recommended that we disclose \nnot only the bottom line of what we spend on intelligence but the \nbudgets of each of the 15 constituent agencies.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee decided that we could respond and \nrespect the public's right to know by putting out the bottom line \nnumber. That means X billion dollars. No details about what goes to \nwhat agency or certainly not what goes to what program or what \npersonnel. But we were not ready to order the disclosure of the \nintelligence agency budget specifically, and we asked the national \nintelligence director to come back to us with a study.\n  That is a good balance. The Senator from Alaska would prohibit public \ndisclosures of the bottom line. The public has a right to know at least \nthat. One thing they might conclude from that is that we are not \nspending enough on intelligence in the war on terrorism as compared to \nother things we are spending on.\n  We worked hard on this. It is balanced. It respects the right to \nknow. The families of people lost on 9/11 oppose this amendment, as I \ndo.\n  I move to table and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I would also point out that if we do not \ndisclose the top line, the result is the intelligence budget is still \nfunded through the Department of Defense. So if we are trying to give \nthe national intelligence director real budget authority, we have to \ndisclose that top line. We are not disclosing the top line of the CIA, \nthe DIA, the NSA; it is only the aggregate figure for the entire \nnational intelligence budget. Otherwise we are not reforming the \nprocess. The funding will have to go through the Department of Defense.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3903), as modified, is as follows:\n\n\n                     amendment no. 3903 as modified\n\n       On page 115, strike lines 15 through 25 and insert the \n     following:\n       (a) Study on Disclosure of Aggregate Amount of \n     Appropriations Requested.--The National Intelligence Director \n     shall conduct a study to assess the advisability of \n     disclosing to the public the aggregate amount of \n     appropriations requested in the budget of the President for \n     each fiscal year for the National Intelligence Program.\n       On page 116, line 1, strike ``(c)'' and insert ``(b)''.\n       On page 116, strike lines 21 through 23, and insert the \n     following:\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the effective \n     date of this section, the National Intelligence Director \n     shall submit to Congress a report on the results of the \n     studies carried out under subsections (a) and (b).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I regret seriously I was unable to make \nmy statement in full. I was not notified of this time limit when I left \non Friday. I came back and found it. The statement of my amendment \nthere was not a statement of my amendment. It was a statement in \nopposition to my amendment.

Mr. President, I believe we have worked out an agreement \non Senator Stevens' amendment No. 3826, as modified, that is acceptable \nto both sides. I am pleased we have been able to reach a compromise. \nThis amendment would clarify the NCTC Director's role in advising the \nPresident and the national intelligence director. It uses language that \nwe worked out carefully during the committee markup with Senator Levin \nand others.\n\n[[Page S10331]]\n\n  Specifically, the NCTC Director would advise the President and the \nNID on interagency counterterrorism planning and activities which is \nconsistent with the NCTC Director's responsibility to conduct \ninteragency counterterrorism planning.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment, as modified.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Has the amendment been modified, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 84, beginning on line 8, strike ``joint operations \n     relating to counterterrorism'' and insert ``interagency \n     counterterrorism planning and activities''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will say for the record the Senator \nfrom Maine is correct. We have modified this as requested by the \ncommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3826, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3826) was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3827\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will be two minutes of debate evenly divided.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that \namendment be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Now what is the regular order, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order before the Senate.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3830\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3830.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is an objection to calling up the amendment?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I just want to call it up and set it aside and qualify \nit for a vote later.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It takes unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I repeat my objection, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I have had a conversation with the \nSenator from Alaska. I remove my objection to his calling up the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I renew my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for himself, Mr. \n     Warner, and Mr. Inouye, proposes an amendment numbered 3830.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To modify certain provisions relating to the Central \n                          Intelligence Agency)\n\n       On page 28, beginning on line 16, strike ``of the National \n     Intelligence Director''.\n       On page 43, beginning on line 1, strike ``OF THE NATIONAL \n     INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR''.\n       On page 43, beginning on line 5, strike ``of the National \n     Intelligence Director'' and insert ``for the National \n     Intelligence Director and the Director of the Central \n     Intelligence Agency''.\n       On page 43, beginning on line 17, strike ``of the National \n     Intelligence Director''.\n       On page 141, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n       (H) the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency or his \n     designee;\n       On page 141, line 16, strike ``(H)'' and insert ``(I)''.\n       On page 141, line 18, strike ``(I)'' and insert ``(J)''.\n       On page 141, line 21, strike ``(J)'' and insert ``(K)''.\n       On page 179, beginning on line 21, strike ``and \n     coordination of'' and all that follows through ``elements \n     of'' beginning on line 23 and insert ``, and coordinate \n     outside the United States, the collection of national \n     intelligence through human sources by agencies and \n     organizations within''.\n       On page 194, beginning on line 23, strike ``of the National \n     Intelligence Director''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, what is the pending amendment that was \nset aside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment was No. 3810 by Senator \nLevin which has been set aside.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, am I interfering with a time agreement \nnow by continuing on the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am constrained to say that I am \ndisturbed at the process that has just been used. I was out of town. I \nleft town saying I was willing to work. I come back and find a series \nof my amendments have a 2-minute time limit. I was not consulted on \nthat at all. I think in view of the haste with which this bill is \nmoving forward, it is very sad. It is going to change this Senator's \nvote on cloture tomorrow because I am tired of having this bill being \npushed so hard.\n  It is being pushed by a group of people who were part of a commission \nthat went out of existence. They went out and raised a million and a \nhalf dollars, and they are lobbying this Senate. They are lobbying \nhard, principally the two leaders. They are no longer leaders of that \nCommission, and they are demanding that we act. Are they registered \nlobbyists? Are they? What right have they to push this Senate so hard?\n  I think we should take some time and consider what we are doing. If \nwe are not careful, we will destroy the intelligence system we are \ntrying to reorganize. I am in favor of reorganizing it. I said that in \nthe beginning. But this is going too fast, when I am prevented from \neven reading, perhaps just 1 minute to read a 3-minute statement, and \nnothing in front of the Senators on our side indicated the President of \nthe United States was in favor of this amendment. I offered it because \nthe statement came from the administration.\n  I think we should slow down. If we don't slow down, we are going to \nbe around a long time because I remember Senator Allen who stretched \nout a cloture vote once for 3 weeks. I really believe there should be \nsome senatorial courtesy involved when a Senator is trying to oppose a \npressure group like this. It is not easy to do. I know that. But I am \nup to it, I tell you. I am up to it. And people better understand that.\n  I ask that that amendment be set aside for the purpose of further \nconsideration tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is set aside.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3740, As Modified\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment, and I call up amendment No. 3740 with a modification \nwhich I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is already pending.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member \nfor crafting an amendment with me that embodies several technical and \nclarifying modifications to their bill. If, in fact, the distinguished \nSenator and the distinguished ranking member at this time would accept \nthe amendment, it would be highly desirable on the part of this \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee for working very closely with us in proposing \nthis amendment which combines portions of several other amendments that \nhe has\n\n[[Page S10332]]\n\nintroduced. It clarifies that the mission of the national intelligence \nauthority includes eliminating barriers to the coordination of all \nintelligence activities, including but not limited to counterterrorism. \nIt appropriately ensures that the congressional intelligence committees \nwill receive reports relating to the acquisition authorities of NSA and \nNGA. It provides that the NID may directly modify budget proposals made \nby agencies as part of the national intelligence program. I appreciate \nhow closely the chairman has worked with Senator Lieberman and me. I am \npleased to support the amendment, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senators for their assistance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 9, line 13, strike ``counterterrorism'' and insert \n     ``intelligence, including counterterrorism,''.\n       On page 23, line 1, strike ``may require modifications'' \n     and insert ``may modify, or may require modifications,''.\n       On page 28, line 17, strike ``or'' and insert ``and''.\n       On page 112, beginning on line 12, strike ``Committee on \n     Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on \n     Government Reform of the House of Representatives'' and \n     insert ``Select Committee on Intelligence and the Committee \n     on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Permanent \n     Select Committee on Intelligence and the Committee on \n     Government Reform of the House of Representatives''.\n       On page 200, strike lines 5 through 11 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 307. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS ON RESPONSIBILITIES OF \n                   SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PERTAINING TO NATIONAL \n                   INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 105(a) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 \n     U.S.C. 403-5(a)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``ensure'' and inserting \n     ``assist the Director in ensuring''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``appropriate''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3740) was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Amendments Nos. 3741, 3744, and 3751, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw from \nconsideration amendment Nos. 3741, 3744, and 3751.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are \nwithdrawn.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3748, As Modified\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment, and call up amendment No. 3748, as modified, which I \nsend to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 78, line 19, insert ``regular and detailed'' before \n     ``reviews''.\n       On page 79, strike lines 1 and 2 and insert the following:\n\n     political considerations, based upon all sources available to \n     the intelligence community, and performed in a manner \n     consistent with sound analytic methods and tradecraft, \n     including reviews for purposes of determining whether or \n     not--\n       (A) such product or products state separately, and \n     distinguish between, the intelligence underlying such product \n     or products and the assumptions and judgments of analysts \n     with respect to the intelligence and such product or \n     products;\n       (B) such product or products describe the quality and \n     reliability of the intelligence underlying such product or \n     products;\n       (C) such product or products present and explain \n     alternative conclusions, if any, with respect to the \n     intelligence underlying such product or products;\n       (D) such product or products characterizes the \n     uncertainties, if any, and the confidence in such product or \n     products; and\n       (E) the analyst or analysts responsible for such product or \n     products had appropriate access to intelligence information \n     from all sources, regardless of the source of the \n     information, the method of collection of the information, the \n     elements of the intelligence community that collected the \n     information, or the location of such collection.\n       On page 80, line 1, insert ``(A)'' after ``(5)''.\n       On page 80, line 3, strike ``, upon request,''.\n       On page 80, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n       (B) The results of the evaluations under paragraph (4) \n     shall also be distributed as appropriate throughout the \n     intelligence community as a method for training intelligence \n     community analysts and promoting the development of sound \n     analytic methods and tradecraft. To ensure the widest \n     possible distribution of the evaluations, the Analytic Review \n     Unit shall, when appropriate, produce evaluations at multiple \n     classification levels.\n       (6) Upon completion of the evaluations under paragraph (4), \n     the Analytic Review Unit may make such recommendations to the \n     National Intelligence Director and to appropriate heads of \n     the elements of the intelligence community for awards, \n     commendations, additional training, or disciplinary or other \n     actions concerning personnel as the Analytic Review Unit \n     considers appropriate in light of such evaluations. Any \n     recommendation of the Analytic Review Unit under this \n     paragraph shall not be considered binding on the official \n     receiving such recommendation.\n       On page 80, line 6, strike ``Information.--'' and insert \n     ``Information and Personnel.--(1)''.\n       On page 80, line 8, insert ``, the Analytic Review Unit, \n     and other staff of the Office of the Ombudsman of the \n     National Intelligence Authority'' after ``Authority''.\n       On page 80 line 10, insert ``operational and'' before \n     ``field reports''.\n       On page 80, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n       (2) The Ombudsman, the Analytic Review Unit, and other \n     staff of the Office shall have access to any employee, or any \n     employee of a contractor, of the intelligence community whose \n     testimony is needed for the performance of the duties of the \n     Ombudsman.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, this amendment ensures that the analytic \nreview unit will be able to perform an important quality control and \naccountability mechanism for the analytic product of the intelligence \ncommunity. This is an important function that has not been performed by \nthe intelligence community as well as it should have. I thank the \nchairman and ranking member for working with me to ensure that this \nimportant amendment is adopted.\n  I yield to the distinguished chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I again thank the distinguished chairman \nfor working very closely with the floor managers on this amendment.\n  It provides thoughtful clarifications to the establishment of an \nanalytic review unit under the Collins-Lieberman bill. I believe the \nchanges made by this amendment would strengthen the bill. I urge its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I, too, rise to support the amendment \nthe Senator from Kansas offered. It clarifies and strengthens the bill. \nI thank him for it and I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3748), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like at this time to address the \nSenate and the managers with regard to two amendments. I want to be \ncooperative in the procedures that they may have in mind for further \namendments. If it is convenient, I would like to move forward. If not, \nI would like to know at what time would be more convenient for the \nmanagers. I think we are making considerable progress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the courtesy of \nthe Senator from Virginia. I would like to suggest that we have a brief \nquorum call so we can try to have some order. We have several requests \non both sides of the aisle to proceed on amendments. I need to compare \nnotes with the Democratic manager of the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I certainly want to be cooperative. I hope \nthe Senator will take into consideration that I now have the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I certainly will. If the Senator wants to proceed--\n  Mr. WARNER. No. I want to be cooperative. I am perfectly willing to \nyield the floor for the purpose of a quorum. It is my hope that I will \nbe recognized at such time as the quorum call is to be withdrawn at the \ndiscretion of the managers.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President. That is my intent.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S10333]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to proceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Chambliss are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering the Intelligence \nReform Act.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               IRAQ'S WMD\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Over the weekend, there was a very alarming report in the \nNew York Times that stated that senior administration officials \nrepeatedly failed to disclose the contrary views of America's leading \nnuclear scientists about tubes that could be used for either a nuclear \nweapons program in Iraq or for alternative purposes, such as short-\nrange rockets.\n  I understand the article is printed in today's Record in Senator \nByrd's remarks.\n  The investigative article found:\n\n       Senior administration officials . . . sometimes overstated \n     even the most dire intelligence assessments of the tubes, yet \n     minimized or rejected the strong doubts of nuclear experts.\n\n  That they had alternative uses.\n\n       They worried privately that the nuclear case was weak, but \n     expressed sober certitude in public.\n\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       The absence of unconventional weapons in Iraq is now widely \n     seen as evidence of a profound intelligence failure, of an \n     intelligence community blinded by ``group think,'' false \n     assumptions and unreliable human sources.\n       Yet the tale of the tubes, pieced together through records \n     and interviews with senior intelligence officers, nuclear \n     experts, administration officials and Congressional \n     investigators, reveals a different failure.\n       Far from ``group think,'' American nuclear and intelligence \n     experts argued bitterly over the tubes. . . .\n       Precisely how knowledge of the intelligence dispute \n     traveled through the upper reaches of the administration is \n     unclear. Ms. Rice--\n\n  The National Security Adviser--\n\n     knew about the debate before her Sept. 2002 CNN appearance. . \n     . . President Bush learned of the debate at roughly the same \n     time, a senior administration official said.\n\n  The report goes on to document how, even though the 15 different \nagencies of the Federal Government with responsibility for intelligence \ngathering and assessment differed on this analysis, according to \ncongressional and intelligence officials, none of them informed senior \npolicymakers in the Congress about the Energy Department's dissent, and \nthe Energy Department contained the nuclear experts most knowledgeable \nabout the probable use of these tubes for another purpose.\n  Despite this disagreement, despite the uncertainty, Vice President \nCheney in the fall of 2002, in a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars \non August 26 of that year, stated:\n\n       We now know Saddam has resumed his efforts to acquire \n     nuclear weapons. . . .Many of us are convinced that Saddam \n     will acquire nuclear weapons fairly soon. Just how soon we \n     cannot really gauge. Intelligence is an uncertain business, \n     even in the best of circumstances.\n\n  The Vice President went on to say:\n\n       Armed with an arsenal of these weapons of terror, and \n     seated atop 10 percent of the world's oil reserves, Saddam \n     Hussein could then be expected to seek domination of the \n     entire Middle East, take control of a great portion of the \n     world's energy supplies, directly threaten America's friends \n     throughout the region, and subject the United States or any \n     other nation to nuclear blackmail.\n\n  Yet the article goes on to say that neither the Vice President nor \nMs. Rice mentioned that the Nation's top nuclear design experts \nbelieved overwhelmingly that the tubes were poorly suited for the \ncentrifuges that would be used for nuclear warheads.\n  The article goes on:\n\n       Mr. Cheney, who has a history of criticizing officials who \n     disclose sensitive information, typically refuses to comment \n     when asked about secret intelligence. Yet on this day, \n     with a Gallup poll showing that 58 percent of Americans \n     did not believe President Bush had done enough to explain \n     why the United States should act against Iraq, Mr. Cheney \n     spoke openly about one of the closest held secrets \n     regarding Iraq. Not only did Mr. Cheney draw attention to \n     the tubes; he did so with a certitude that could not be \n     found in even the CIA's assessments. On ``Meet the \n     Press,'' Mr. Cheney said he knew ``for sure'' and ``in \n     fact'' and ``with absolute certainty'' that Mr. Hussein \n     was buying equipment to build a nuclear weapon. ``He has \n     reconstituted his nuclear program,'' Mr. Cheney said \n     flatly.\n\n  Ms. Rice said in a New York Times article today, referencing \nyesterday's investigative report, that she was aware of the dispute in \nSeptember 2002 among the different intelligence agencies when she \nstated in a television interview that the tubes ``are only really \nsuited for nuclear weapons programs.''\n  I have my own experience of being shown one of those tubes in a \nbriefing conducted by Ms. Rice and CIA Director George Tenet in the \nWhite House situation room on December 23, 2002. We were told \nunequivocally that the tube was intended for Iraq's reconstituted \nnuclear weapons program. We were given no indication that there was \nanother possible purpose for that tube. We were given no indication \nthat there was serious disagreement among the nuclear experts in the \nFederal Government about the use of those tubes. We were not given all \nthe facts. We were given one set of facts, the one that supported the \nposition of the President and the Vice President and the one they \nwanted us to take when we voted on the administration's war resolution \njust a few days later.\n  It turns out the information we were given was wrong. One and a half \nyears of subsequent inspections by over 1,400 U.S. weapons inspectors \nhas uncovered no evidence of a reconstituted Iraqi nuclear weapons \nprogram under Saddam Hussein. Some 1,300 of those tubes were found to \nbe part of a short-range rocket program which did not represent a \nthreat to our own national security.\n  The nuclear threat of Iraq was President Bush and Vice President \nCheney's trump card, and they played it to the hilt. They betrayed the \ntrust of the Members of Congress to persuade us to vote for their war \nresolution. They withheld information we should have had rightfully as \nMembers of this body before making that fateful decision.\n  We have 138,000 American troops committing their lives, risking their \nlives, bleeding, fighting, some of them dying, on a daily basis, and we \nare now told that the administration has any other number of plausible \nexplanations for why they conducted this operation. But the truth is \nthat for many of us, the overwhelming argument being made back in the \nfall of 2002 when that war resolution was being debated was the \nsupposed nuclear threat of Iraq. And for us to not have been told the \ntruth and all the truth about the facts the administration had before \nit at the time to me is shameful, disgraceful, and a fundamental \nviolation of the public trust.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I rise to speak to an amendment that \nwas accepted on Friday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if the Senator from Tennessee will yield \nfor a moment to make a unanimous consent request to follow the Senator \nfrom Tennessee.\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, the Senator was not on the \nfloor. I had the floor and yielded to the managers for the purpose of \ngoing into the cloakroom. So I think I have a\n\n[[Page S10334]]\n\nright to be recognized when the managers seek recognition, at which \ntime I want to go ahead with my amendments. May I inquire as to the \namount of time my distinguished colleagues desire?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I would like to have about 5 minutes, but it does not \nneed to be now.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am trying to be accommodating.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Speaking through the Chair, I am happy to follow the \nSenator from Virginia if the Senator will give some indication of the \ntime sequence. We can propound a unanimous consent request that I \nfollow the Senator from Virginia after he has spoken, if he can give me \nsome indication of how long he will speak.\n  Mr. WARNER. If it is agreeable to the distinguished Senator, I will \nfollow him and the Senator from Illinois can follow me.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Virginia give me a rough indication \nof how long he might speak?\n  Mr. WARNER. I will not take an undue period. It is largely in the \nhands of the managers as to their desire to probe some of the aspects \nof the amendments. I hope it can be a reasonable period of time, and I \nhope we will not prolong the Senator's schedule.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that I follow the Senator from \nVirginia, after he has spoken to his amendments, to speak in morning \nbusiness.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague for his usual courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Virginia, if \nhis amendments are ready to be adopted, he can offer them.\n  Mr. WARNER. No, they are not ready to be adopted.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3807\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly to an amendment \nthat was accepted on Friday. I thank the managers of the bill, the \nSenator from Maine and the Senator from Connecticut, for doing this and \nthe Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, for his work in making it \npossible.\n  This has to do with the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission that \nthe Federal Government set standards for the security of personal \nidentification documents such as drivers' licenses to prevent them from \nbeing counterfeited and used as identification for terrorists.\n  As a former Governor, I have always been skeptical of Federal rules \nthat require States to take action that cost States money. As someone \nwho respects civil liberties, I have been reluctant to unnecessarily \nidentify Americans. In fact, as Governor, I vetoed the bill requiring a \npicture on a driver's license three times because I thought it was an \nunnecessary imposition on civil liberties. But times have changed. I \nbelieve the Senator from Arizona and others did an excellent job of \nimplementing the 9/11 Commission's recommendation that drivers' \nlicenses and other personal identification documents be upgraded so we \ncan prevent terrorists from using them.\n  My one concern and the concern that the Senator from Arizona \nrecognized was that I do not want to see the Federal Government come up \nwith this good idea, pass it into law, require the States to do it, and \nthen send the bill to the States. We call that an unfunded Federal \nmandate, and most of us in this body have said we will not do that \nanymore.\n  Senators McCain, Collins, and Lieberman have worked out an acceptable \nway, I believe, to deal with that problem. Basically, the amendment \nthat was adopted on Friday will give the Secretary of Transportation 18 \nmonths from the passage of the bill to work with State and local \nofficials to come up with a set of minimum standards for driver's \nlicenses. During that negotiation, States will include estimates of the \ncost of implementing the proposed standards.\n  After this 18-month period, the rules will be made final. At that \npoint, we will have before us the new requirements for States for these \nupgraded drivers' licenses and other personal identification documents \nas well as the costs that we are imposing on the States. At that time, \nit will be up to us, if we are true to our word about no more unfunded \nFederal mandates, to appropriate the appropriate amount of money that \nit would take Tennessee, Montana, New York, and all the other States to \npay for this new requirement that we have imposed on the States. That \nwill be something we can debate and discuss at that time.\n  The State governments will have 2 years from the issuance of the \nfinal regulation to implement these standards, but it is our \nresponsibility then, if it is our good idea, if we impose it on the \nStates, to pay for it. I, and I am sure many others in this body, will \nbe here to argue strenuously that we do, and we should.\n  This is an excellent amendment. I am glad it was accepted on Friday. \nI appreciate the work of the National Governors Association and the \nSenators who were involved. This will give the States the time and \nresources that States need to make the necessary changes to drivers' \nlicenses and other personal identification documents.\n  I call on my colleagues to keep this moment in mind because 18 months \nto 2 years from now the bill will come due and the bill should be paid \nby us, those who impose the rule, and not sent to State governments. \nSending the States the bill would be an unfunded Federal mandate, which \nwe have said we will not do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nVirginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer.\n  I wish to inquire of the manager, is this an appropriate time to move \nforward?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest that the Senator from Virginia \ngo ahead and present his amendments.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 3874 and 3875, en bloc\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I send to the desk two amendments which I will address. \nThey are companion amendments, but I felt it was necessary to do it in \ntwo different amendments. One is 3874 and one is 3875. Copies are at \nthe desk, but for the convenience of the clerk I will send up \nadditional copies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3874\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for the treatment of programs, projects, and \nactivities within the Joint Military Intelligence Program and Tactical \n  Intelligence and Related Activities programs as of the date of the \n                         enactment of the Act)\n\n       On page 211, after line 22, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 337. RETENTION OF CURRENT PROGRAMS, PROJECTS, AND \n                   ACTIVITIES WITHIN JOINT MILITARY INTELLIGENCE \n                   PROGRAM AND TACTICAL INTELLIGENCE AND RELATED \n                   ACTIVITIES PROGRAMS PENDING REVIEW.\n\n       (a) Retention Within Current Programs.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, all programs, projects, and \n     activities contained within the Joint Military Intelligence \n     Program and the Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities \n     program as of the date of the enactment of this Act shall \n     remain within such programs until a thorough review of such \n     programs is completed.\n       (b) Removal From Current Programs.--A program, project, or \n     activity referred to in subsection (a) may be removed from \n     the Joint Military Intelligence Program or the Tactical \n     Intelligence and Related Activities programs only if agreed \n     to by the National Intelligence Director and the Secretary of \n     Defense.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3875\n\n (Purpose: To clarify the definition of National Intelligence Program)\n\n       On page 6, strike line 24 and all that follows through page \n     7, line 2, and insert the following:\n       (ii) includes all programs, projects, and activities of the \n     National Foreign Intelligence Program as of the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, including the Central Intelligence \n     Agency, the\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I have heard reference made to the fact that this bill \nleaves intact the manner in which we deal with the TIARA programs and \nthe JMIP; that is, the Joint Military Intelligence Program. I would \nlike to read from page 412 of the 9/11 Commission. The Commission \nstates as follows:\n\n       The Defense Departments's military intelligence programs--\n     the joint military intelligence program (JMIP) and the \n     tactical intelligence and related activities program \n     (TIARA)--would remain part of that department's \n     responsibility.\n\n  My question to the distinguished managers, if they desire to reply, \nis, Is it their position--and I believe they have so stated, but I wish \nto give them this opportunity--that the recommendation of the \nCommission that\n\n[[Page S10335]]\n\nthey remain at the Department of Defense, is it the understanding of \nSenators in their bill that is now before the Senate that that comports \nwith that objective?\n  May I read it again?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Yes, please do.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, I thank the Senator. Page 412 of the Commission \nreport:\n\n       The Defense Department's military intelligence program--the \n     joint military intelligence program (JMIP) and the tactical \n     intelligence and related activities program (TIARA)--would \n     remain part of that department's responsibility.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, if I could respond through the Chair to \nthe inquiry of the Senator from Virginia, the bill makes very clear \nthat any intelligence assets that are principally for joint military \noperations or for tactical intelligence stay within the Department of \nDefense.\n  Now, there may be national intelligence assets that are now included \nwithin the Joint Military Intelligence Program that could be \ntransferred to the national intelligence program. The tactical assets \nare clearly just under the control of the Secretary of Defense, but \nsome of the JMIP assets are national, so that is why the bill is worded \nas it is with the word ``principally.''\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  I would like to now go to the bill and specifically draw the \nmanagers' attention to pages 6 and 7. The bill reads:\n\n       The term ``National Intelligence Program''--\n\n  And that is what the distinguished manager was addressing--\n\n       (A)(i) refers to all national intelligence programs, \n     projects, and activities of the elements of the intelligence \n     community; (ii) includes all programs, projects, and \n     activities (whether or not pertaining to national \n     intelligence) of the National Intelligence Authority, the \n     Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, \n     the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the National \n     Reconnaissance Office . . .\n\n  Now, therein is the problem that the Senator from Virginia has. What \nis the meaning of ``whether or not pertaining to national \nintelligence''? Because the title says this is the definition of \nnational intelligence. (A)(i) basically gives that, and then (ii) seems \nto extend the definition to include programs that are not now part of \nthe national intelligence program; that is, ``whether or not \npertaining.'' I find that of considerable concern.\n  The purpose of the amendment is to clarify that form because having \nhad considerable experience when I worked in the Department and the \nyears that I have been privileged to be on the Armed Services \nCommittee--and I have to be very careful as I speak because these are \nso highly classified, but I will just give generally a picture of my \nconcern.\n  Right now, the JMIP literally contracts extensively with the \nGeospatial-Intelligence Agency, the NGA, as it is referred to. For \nexample, the Department of Defense puts in the JMIP budget, through the \nbudgeting process, a block of money. It can then go and contract with \nthese several what we call combat agencies, because they have all the \nassets--the technical people to do the work. So they sign the contract \nfor a program and that program is absolutely essential to the \nfunctioning of, in many instances, the TIARA program, but in many \ninstances the JMIP. And it is essential. The JMIP cannot function \nunless that particular program for which it has contracted with the NGA \nis fulfilled.\n  As I read this amendment--let's call it program X--program X could be \ntransferred under the language ``whether or not pertaining to National \nintelligence,'' and it goes into the NGA, and then, frankly, the NID \nmight make a decision that, wait a minute, we have to get a very \nexpensive overhead system and we have to go down into the various \nbudgets of the different combat agencies and scrape up some money.\n  So they come down and they say JMIP says they need the money, but I \nthink we have to prioritize. We are going to take the money and we are \ngoing to put it toward the overhead system and it will not be used--for \nexample, this is one of the main functions of the National Geospatial \nAgency--to make maps. As a matter of fact, when I first came to the \nSenate it was the old mapping agency. Now it has been combined several \ntimes through a number of job descriptions.\n  But that could be lost. Suddenly we are controverting the \nrecommendation of the 9/11 Commission, that everything in the TIARA and \nthe JMIP is going to be left untouched.\n  That is the problem I see. I think we have to take a good look at \nthis amendment because my amendment eliminates that language--that is \none of the two amendments--it eliminates it in such a way that we \nredefine that paragraph 1. On page 6, the one I read from, strike so-\nand-so and put this language in, that is:\n\n       The term ``National Intelligence Program''--\n       (ii) includes all programs, projects, and activities of the \n     National Foreign Intelligence Program as of the date of \n     enactment of this Act, including the Central Intelligence \n     Agency--\n\n  And then it goes on to read:\n\n     the National Security Agency, the National Geospatial. . . .\n\n  All I have done is keep in place the recommendation of the \nCommission. The very words I have heard the distinguished managers say \non the floor a number of times--and I have it back in the previous \nRecords, in which she has represented to this body in the course of the \nfour or five days we have been debating that we are not touching TIARA \nand we are not touching the JMIP.\n  There is my problem. I believe this fixes it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3874\n\n  The next amendment addresses what the distinguished managers said a \nfew minutes ago. There could come a time where it is the judgment of \nthe NID that some of these programs should no longer be under the \njurisdiction of the JMIP, and therefore my other amendment kicks in. It \nreads as follows:\n\n       Removal From Current Programs. A program, project, or \n     activity referred to in subsection (a) may be removed from \n     the Joint Military Intelligence Program or the Tactical \n     Intelligence and Related Activities programs only if agreed \n     to by the National Intelligence Director and the Secretary of \n     Defense.\n\n  So the two of them could make adjustments in the future. But right \nnow, we have a number of programs in JMIP which are being performed by \nthe combat agencies and I think it would not be in our best interests \nto dislodge those programs now. In the future, if the two heads agree, \nthis is the statutory authority to do it.\n  I feel very strongly about these amendments. So much so I will ask \nfor votes on them if we are not able to--I don't say that in the way of \nanything other than expressing my sincerity in these amendments, but I \nhope you could possibly accept them. If you cannot, I feel obligated to \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I would point out that the amendment of \nthe distinguished Senator would require that the Secretary of Defense \nagree to the movement of any asset from the JMIP or TIARA budget to the \nNational Intelligence Program budget.\n  I want to make sure my colleagues realize that the White House \nopposes giving the Secretary of Defense a veto over what can be moved \nfrom JMIP or TIARA to the new National Intelligence Program. I \napologize for talking in acronyms in describing this.\n  As you know, the tactical intelligence programs are the TIARA \nprograms that are run by the various services within the Department of \nDefense. The JMIP is the Joint Military Intelligence Programs.\n  I note we have tried to strike a delicate balance in this bill. We \ndecided, and so I joined the Senator from Virginia, to defeat an \namendment that would have moved the NSA, the NGA, the NRO out of the \npurview and daily supervision of the Secretary of Defense. We were \ncognizant that the NSA and the NGA provide direct support to the \nwarfighter.\n  The underlying legislation, however, does strike a delicate balance. \nWe give the national intelligence director control over the budgets, \nthe tasking of national assets, and certain personnel authorities, \nwhile leaving those agencies under the day-to-day supervision of the \nSecretary of Defense. I think that is the right balance.\n  Keep in mind, when we talked to the head of the NSA, the three-star \nGeneral who runs that agency, he told us\n\n[[Page S10336]]\n\nthat he has more contact with the CIA than he does the Secretary of \nDefense; that he is providing national intelligence everyday beyond the \nneeds of the Pentagon. That is not in any way to lessen the important \nrole he is providing to our warfighters, to the combat commanders, to \nthe Secretary of Defense. But these are national assets. Indeed, while \nI can't disclose the amounts of the budgets or the exact percentages \nbecause they are classified, the majority of the budgets for these \nagencies are already in the National Foreign Intelligence Program \nbudget.\n  I understand the point of the Senator from Virginia. As always, I am \nhappy to try to work with him. I know Senator Levin has some amendments \nin this area that may bring further clarity. But I am concerned about \nthe scope of his amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, replying to my distinguished colleague, \nlet's use the example of maps. They are absolutely essential to the \ntroops. They can't operate without maps.\n  The only existing entity of the Federal Government that can make maps \nis the NGA. Right now, the JMIP, which is the Joint Military \nIntelligence Program, is acting on behalf of all the services--the \nArmy, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. They all desperately need \nmaps. They have this contract which they pay for out of this budget to \nhave the maps made. But the way your bill is drawn, it seems to me that \nthey could stop making the maps for the military because they think \nthat the dollars are better needed for overhead systems. There sits the \nSecretary almost powerless unless he runs right up to the President and \nsays: Wait a minute. And you can't have him going to the President on \nall of the dozens of contracts that the JMIP has with the various \ncontract agencies.\n  I ask a question. The 9/11 Commission explicitly said don't do this. \nI thought I understood the manager to say: Well, we are not doing it. I \nhave about four or five references where on the floor the manager said \nwe are not touching TIARA or JMIP; those programs remain under the \nbudget of the Secretary of Defense.\n  With no intention to do other than what is right, we have a vague \nsituation that we cannot let remain and jeopardize the maps. It is the \nclearest thing I know that is understandable by everybody in this \nChamber--the need for those maps for our soldiers, our naval personnel \non the high seas, those flying the aircraft. You cannot limit the \nability of the Secretary of Defense to adequately provide those maps.\n  I say to my distinguished colleague, my colleague has a statute which \nputs in question the ability to control the very thing my colleague \nsaid time and time again she was not going to touch.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first let me clarify that we did what the \n9/11 Commission recommended with regard to these agencies. We did not \nsever their connection to the Secretary of Defense. The Senator from \nVirginia is well aware of that. He is well aware that I opposed \nattempts to sever the connection with the Secretary of Defense. The \nSenator from Virginia is well aware that the Secretary of Defense would \ncontinue to have day-to-day line authority supervision over these \nagencies.\n  The second point I make is there is nothing in this bill that would \nin any way hinder the ability of the NGA to provide much needed maps \nfor our troops. That is just not going to happen. The satellites that \nare used to produce these maps for the military are also used for \nsurveillance of international terrorism or compliance with \nproliferation treaties. They are used to look at camps in Afghanistan. \nThese are national assets that are used by multiple agencies, and the \nbill reflects that.\n  That is why the majority of the budgets for these agencies are \nalready part of the National Foreign Intelligence Program--what we \nwould rename as the National Intelligence Program. The majority of the \nbudget finances are already part of not JMIP, not TIARA, but what is \nknown as NFIP. That would not in any way hinder the ability of these \nagencies to meet their obligations to the Department of Defense and to \nour warfighters.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in response to my colleague, I am not \ntouching the satellites. I agree. Everything she said is absolutely \ncorrect. We are not touching the satellites. But we are concerned about \nthings such as the mundane maps which are about 80 percent used by the \ntactical forces, maybe 20 percent distributed elsewhere in the \nGovernment for other purposes. But that is the heart and soul of \ntactical intelligence. It is desperately needed. You simply have to let \nthose moneys that the Secretary of Defense allocates by contract to the \nNGA to do the maps be untouched. They cannot be seized in a sweep-up or \na reprioritization.\n\n  We just had an amendment which was rejected about the reprogramming \nauthority. You have extensive reprogramming authority. But time and \ntime again, I have heard the Senator from Connecticut say we are not \ngoing to touch TIARA, we are not going to touch the JMIP. Yet, if I \ncould draw the attention of my colleague from Connecticut to page 6 of \nthe bill, the language is very clear. It says:\n\n       The term ``national intelligence program'' includes all \n     programs, projects and activities whether or not pertaining \n     to national intelligence.\n\n  So you are going beyond national intelligence. You are grabbing the \nresponsibilities of the TIARA Program and the JMIP. There is the \nlanguage.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, responding to my friend from Virginia, \nthe intention here is to give the national intelligence director \nbudgetary authority over the national intelligence programs. That would \nnot include TIARA. It might include, as has been illuminated in a \ncolloquy between the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Maine, \nsome programs that are currently in JMIP, the Joint Military \nIntelligence Program.\n  For the sake of reasonable organization, we wanted to take the full \nbudgets of those national intelligence agencies--NSA, National \nGeospatial, and NRO. But what I want to say is that there is some \nindication that, for instance, a substantial percentage of one of those \nagency budgets is currently in JMIP. We expect that they will continue \nto work for the military and its joint programs. But for the sake of \ndecent organization and clear lines of authority, the judgment made by \nour committee was to say that all of the budgets of those three \nnational intelligence agencies within the national intelligence program \nwill go on budget under the national intelligence director and to leave \nit. There is going to be some overlap on what is now JMIP. The bill \nencourages the Secretary of Defense and the national intelligence \ndirector to work out those areas of overlap.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. He precisely came to \nmy point.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. That was not my intention.\n  Mr. WARNER. Roughly about 30 percent of the NGA budget is derivative \nof the JMIP budget. One of the pending amendments of the Senator has \nthis provision in it. He said the programs may be moved. My language \ndoes that. It says: A program, project, or activity referred to in \nsubsection (a) may be removed from the JMIP or the tactical \nintelligence but only if agreed to by the national intelligence \ndirector and the Secretary of Defense.\n  So they have the concurrence of the two principals, and then move it \nbut leave in place now those programs such that the budgets remain \nuntil they make a joint decision to move them.\n  I used the example of maps. You cannot cut off the flow of maps back \nto the troops, the sailors, and the airmen. Yet those maps are made by \nthe NGA.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator is right. He is correct, obviously. It is \nclearly not the intention of the bill to do that. The fact is the work \nof the National Geospatial Agency which we are describing here that \nproduces image intelligence which is so critical to the military is \nalso, as the Senator knows, increasingly critical to the Department of \nHomeland Security, even the Department of State.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I concur.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. That is why we want to put the budget of the National \nGeospatial-Intelligence Agency in the national intelligence program. \nThese are national intelligence assets.\n  Clearly, the call of the military for the services of those assets \nwill be a\n\n[[Page S10337]]\n\npriority of the agency wherever that budget authority is.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for that reassurance. \nBut the language now transfers that program, if we look at the \nparenthetical on page 6, and includes all programs, projects, and \nactivities, whether pertaining to national intelligence or not, which \nmeans you grabbed it all and moved it.\n  That may be to the advantage of our national intelligence system, our \ntactical system, some date in the future, but do not do it now until we \nhave had some measure of experience.\n  The Senator from Virginia has provided for the removal of those \nprograms with the concurrence of the two principals. You cannot take \naway from the Secretary of Defense. He is, under title 10, required to \nprovide for the men and women of the Armed Forces their basic needs. \nNothing is more basic than the simple maps, and 80 percent of that cost \nof producing those maps comes out of JMIP.\n  I plead with the Senator, leave it for the moment. As we go through \nthe progression and implementation of this, it seems to me the NID and \nDepartment of Defense can work it out if for some reason there is \nconcurrence of viewpoints. This is crippling the Secretary of Defense \nin fulfilling his missions under title 10 where he is required by law, \nenacted by this Senate over a period of many years, to keep those \ntroops supplied with what they need.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, of course, we do not intend nor do I \nthink we do in any sense cripple the Secretary of Defense. We make a \njudgment that some of these programs are national intelligence \nprograms. They ought to be in the budget control of the national \nintelligence director. We enumerate which programs--TIARA, the so-\ncalled tactical military programs--off the table. That is with the \nSecretary of Defense. That provides intelligence to single services or \nsome of the joint programs.\n  This is a difference of opinion. It is true that because we want to \ngive some credibility to this national intelligence director with these \nnational assets as he serves the entire community, including, most of \nall, the President of the United States, we are recommending those \nbudgets of those three agencies go to the national intelligence \ndirector. Then the negotiation begins with the Secretary of Defense. \nThat is a change.\n  I assure the Senator there is no intention in any way to contravene \nor to diminish the capacity of the Secretary of Defense to fulfill his \ntitle 10 statutory requirements. He will work it out with the national \nintelligence director.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I understood my colleague, all the \nTIARA and JMIP budgets are off the table. Did the Senator just say \nthat?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Not quite.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is the ``not quite.''\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. If I confused the Senator, I apologize.\n  Mr. WARNER. You did not confuse this old fox; he is listening. But \nthe others may not be able to follow these nuances.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The TIARA budget is totally within the control of the \nSecretary of Defense.\n  Mr. WARNER. Splendid. Leave it there.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. With the Joint Military Intelligence Program, it is \nnot so clear. That is where there will be, if it is part of a national \nintelligence program, the budget authority will be with the national \nintelligence director. But the No. 1 customer is going to be the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  We are talking almost as if these are people in different \ngovernments. They are going to work this out as they do every day.\n  I will read testimony from General Hayden, the head of the National \nSecurity Agency, before the House, August 18. He says:\n\n       An empowered national intelligence director with direct \n     authority over the national intelligence agencies should not \n     be viewed as diminishing our ability or willingness to \n     fulfill our responsibilities as a combat support agency.\n\n  General Hayden is a very respected head of one of those agencies--\nspeaking, in fact, for all of them later on--saying to have a national \nintelligence director with budget authority is not going to diminish \nour ability or commitment to the combat support agencies.\n  Then he goes on to talk about how he has forward deployed hundreds of \npeople with our U.S. military command, and there is no way that the \ncreation of a national intelligence director, he says, will alter that \ncommitment to the military.\n  We are trying to create some budgetary clear lines to the national \nintelligence director, not contravening the title 10 responsibilities \nof the Secretary of Defense.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, would the Senator look at page 412 of the \n9/11 Report, please.\n  Let me read it:\n\n       The Defense Department's military intelligence programs--\n     the joint military intelligence program (JMIP) and the \n     tactical and related activities program (TIARA)--would remain \n     part of that department's responsibility.\n\n  In testimony before your committee, the 9/11 Commissioners have \nrepeatedly stated that some portions, as the Senator said, of JMIP, \nmight ultimately need to be moved to the national intelligence program \nbut only after a thorough review.\n  The humble Senator from Virginia is just trying to keep the programs \nin place until as that wise old Commission said, ``ultimately'' you may \nreview them and consider moving them.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I respond to my friend who may be humble but is a very \ndistinguished, nonetheless, expert on these matters, and I appreciate \nthe Senator is so informed about the contents of the Commission report.\n  Interestingly, we communicated with the 9/11 Commission about this \nparticular part of our bill, and they changed their position. Their \nposition developed. I represent that as my best understanding, but I \nurge the Senator overnight to check with the staff and members of the \nCommission. I represent that they support our proposal for budgetary \nauthority for the national intelligence director as contained in the \nbill Senator Collins and I have put before the Senate that the \nSenator's amendment would alter.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I bring to the attention of the managers something they \nare already aware of, but I think it is important it be incorporated in \nthe debate. I draw the Senators' attention to the September 28, 2004, \nStatement of Administration Policy, which is in the Record in many \nplaces, the guidance that was sent to you and your distinguished \ncolleague, the chairman, Senator Collins. It says in the fourth \nparagraph:\n\n       The administration opposes the Committee's attempt to \n     define in statute the programs that should be included in the \n     National Intelligence Program; the Administration believes \n     that further review is required. The Administration also \n     believes that the Committee's bill provisions relating to the \n     NID's role in the acquisition in major systems needs further \n     study.\n\n  There is a clear statement of policy by the White House on the \nprecise point that is in these two amendments.\n  I say to my colleague, if the Senator has a reply to this, I am happy \nto hear it; otherwise, I ask for the yeas and nays and then I will \nfight on.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes, indeed. I respectfully disagree. I will share \nsomething because we have been talking about the National Geospatial-\nIntelligence Agency.\n  GEN James Clapper spoke before us and gave some very strong views \nthat support to military programs would not be compromised in any way \nby creation of a strong national intelligence director with budget and \nother authorities over his agency.\n  So this is a gentleman, a very distinguished general, who is in \ncharge of the exact agency we are talking about, who said to us \ndirectly that he was confident the support of his agency to the \nmilitary would not be compromised in any way by a national intelligence \ndirector with budget authority over his agency.\n  It was quite interesting. He described in some detail, as the Senator \nhas spoken to, the direct support the National Geospatial Agency is \ngiving to military operations in the nine combatant commands and \nincreasingly to levels far below the traditional boundaries of those \ncommands to their subordinate units.\n  In fact, as he said, national agencies--this where it is hard to draw \nreal hard lines--national agencies are more and more providing what \nmight on another occasion be called tactical support. When our \nwarfighters need imagery support, General Clapper said\n\n[[Page S10338]]\n\nthey get it from the NGA employees who are often right out there with \nthem on the ground alongside their commanders. What struck me is he \nsaid to us that is the way things work now in the real world, and that \nnothing in the legislation we have put before the Senate, Senator \nCollins and I, would change that. I think that is a very strong \nstatement from the head of the agency that I know the Senator is \nconcerned about.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might reply, I was privileged to know \nGeneral Clapper very well. I think you will find he was not with the \nNGA, but he was Director of the DIA, when he used to come before the \nArmed Services Committee. He is with the NGA now.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. He is now.\n  Mr. WARNER. I just point out to you, I will have to go back and look \nat his testimony, but I know he fully understands the need to keep \nintact the Secretary of Defense's absolute authority to control those \nmatters which are essential to the fulfillment of his title 10 \nresponsibilities.\n  I say to you most respectfully, this, in my judgment, is sufficiently \nvague as to put that in jeopardy. But I have taken generously of the \ntime of the managers, so at this time I ask for the yeas and nays on \nboth amendments that are pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to it being in order to \norder the yeas and nays with one show of hands?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will do it singularly if there is a \ntechnical problem. Why don't I do it singularly. First I ask for the \nyeas and nays on amendment No. 3875.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to seek the yeas and \nnays on amendment No. 3874, which is the currently pending amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer. I ask for the yeas and \nnays on amendment No. 3874.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3875 and ask for \nthe yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer and thank the managers of \nthe bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the managers \nwill allow the setting aside of the pending amendments and allow me to \ncall up three amendments that are at the desk that Senator Leahy has \nasked me to offer on his behalf.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Reserving the right to object, I am unaware of what \nthese three amendments are. We have a lot of requests for other \namendments to be brought up. I wonder if the Senator would withhold so \nthat I could talk with him about what the three amendments are. Senator \nDurbin was actually next in line.\n  Mr. REID. Well, that is fine. But I thought we were going to allow \namendments to be offered. If we are going to pick and choose what \namendments are going to be offered, I will object to all of them, \nbecause Senator Leahy has the right to offer his amendments if anybody \nelse does. I will be happy to withhold for a short time. I withdraw my \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding I have a unanimous \nconsent agreement to speak next as in morning business, but since the \nchairman of this committee and ranking member have been on the floor \nall day on this bill, I would withhold my opportunity to speak if they \nhave any pending business on this bill that they want to take care of \nat this point.\n  I say to the Senators, I know you want to stay for my speech, but I \nam sure you would like to take care of the bill before us and pending \namendments, and I do not want to stand in your way.\n  So at this point, Mr. President, if I can speak through you and ask \nthe chairman of the committee if she has any pending business at this \npoint related directly to the bill. If the Senator from Maine could \ninform me.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I do not yet know the answer to the \nquestion raised by the Senator from Illinois. It is very thoughtful of \nhim. I offer to withhold. I was going to debate a little bit further \nwith Senator Warner, but perhaps we have covered that to death and \nshould wait until tomorrow to conclude our comments.\n  I ask through the Chair, could the Senator tell me how long he wishes \nto speak?\n  Mr. DURBIN. In the neighborhood of 15 to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, during the time in the quorum, we have been \nable to speak with the managers of the bill. I now ask unanimous \nconsent that the pending amendments be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n              Amendments Nos. 3913, 3915, and 3916 En Bloc\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I call up en bloc amendments Nos. 3913, \n3915, and 3916 on behalf of Senator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendments are considered pending.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3913\n\n         (Purpose: To address enforcement of certain subpoenas)\n\n       On page 159, strike lines 19 through 25 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(2) Enforcement of subpoena.--In the case of contumacy or \n     failure to obey a subpoena issued under paragraph (1)(D), \n     either the Board or the Attorney General of the United States \n     may seek an order to require such person to produce the \n     evidence required by such subpoena from the United States \n     district court for the judicial district in which the \n     subpoenaed person resides, is served, or may be found.''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3915\n\n    (Purpose: To establish criteria for placing individuals on the \n consolidated screening watch list of the Terrorist Screening Center, \n                        and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that, pursuant to \nthe unanimous consent agreement, I am to be recognized to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                              War in Iraq\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I understand that an article printed in \nthe New York Times yesterday, October 3, relative to the war in Iraq \nand the intelligence leading up to it, was printed in the Record \nearlier today in Senator Byrd's remarks.\n  Mr. President, it was about 2 years ago that we faced a critical \ndecision on the floor of the Senate. It was a vote that most Members of \nthe Senate, certainly Members of the House, will never forget. It is \nrare in your legislative career that you are asked to vote to go to \nwar, and that is exactly what occurred in this Chamber in October of \n2002. It has happened two or three times in my congressional career.\n  Each time it has been a matter of grave concern. Each Member of the \nSenate and the House want to make certain that they use their best \njudgment, that they get it right. Because if we embark on a war, it \ngoes without saying that some of the bravest and best Americans we \nserve are going to risk their lives and some will lose their lives. \nThat was what faced us in October of 2002.\n  The final vote was 77 Members in favor of the use of force resolution \nto go to war in Iraq and 23 in opposition. Of the 23 Senators voting in \nopposition--1 Republican, Senator Chafee of Rhode Island--22 were \nDemocrats. I was included in that number of 22 Democrats.\n  I remember the vote. It was late at night. When we finally adjourned \nand left, each of us felt a heavy weight on our shoulders. We knew that \ndecision in this room by 100 Americans would lead to a war and others \nwould die, many others would be injured as a result. Each Member of the \nSenate, I am certain, tried to make the right choice and the right \ndecision based on the information they had and their conscience.\n  Now today, some 2 years later, we step back from that moment and \nreflect on it, because it was a critical moment in the history of our \ndemocracy.\n\n  When we vote to go to war, a war in this case which President Bush \nasked us to support, we have to do it based on facts and evidence given \nto us. It is rare that any one of us has any personal knowledge of the \ncircumstances that lead up to the possibility of war. We rely on people \nwho serve our Government--our military leaders, our intelligence \nexperts, people in the field of diplomacy. We ask them to give us \ninformation so we can make the right decision, and that is the position \nwe found ourselves in in October of 2002.\n  Today we reflect on the information given to the Congress and the \nAmerican people before this historic and momentous decision to go to \nwar in Iraq. As we view this information, we cannot help but believe \nthat we were deceived. We were misled. We were given the wrong \ninformation before that invasion. Many of the things said to us on the \nfloor of the Senate, much of the information given to us by the \nadministration that led to that decision to go to war in Iraq today, 2 \nyears later, we know was wrong. It was just wrong.\n  Think back about that debate and what led up to it. In the few short \nweeks when it became abundantly clear that we would face that decision, \nwe had heard about Iraq for years. We remembered their invasion of \nKuwait, the Persian Gulf War where, under General Schwarzkopf, our Army \nliberated the people of Kuwait, driving the Iraqis back into their \nhomeland.\n  We knew who Saddam Hussein was. We knew the kind of thug, brutal \ndictator that he had been in his own country. We remembered that \nwasting war that he had with Iran where thousands of innocent people \nwere killed. We knew exactly what we were dealing with in Saddam \nHussein. He was not a new character for me in my congressional career, \nnor for most Americans.\n  But prior to the invasion of Iraq we were told that it had more to do \nwith other issues. It wasn't just the fact that he was an evil \ndictator; it was the fact that he was a threat to the people of his own \nnation, to the region, and to the United States. That is what we heard \nfrom the Bush administration in support of the invasion of Iraq.\n  You will remember the debate very well. How often we heard from the \nPresident and others that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass \ndestruction that would be used to harm America, that he had unmanned \naerial vehicles which he could launch against other nations in the \nMiddle East, against Israel, even against the United States.\n  We were told that he was somehow linked with al-Qaida and Osama bin \nLaden, the perpetrators of the disgraceful and barbaric acts of \nSeptember 11, 2001. Those were the facts given to us.\n  We know in those cases and in so many others that those facts were \nwrong--just plain wrong. The American people were misled. They were \ntold there was a threat against this country that did not exist. The \nquestion which faces us today and one which goes to the heart of our \ndemocracy is whether the people who made those statements knew they \nwere misleading the American people.\n  That is a very serious charge. It may be the most serious charge in a \ndemocracy--that any leader in Congress or in the executive branch of \nthe Government deliberately misled the American people into believing \nthere was a threat, into believing that a war was necessary, and into \nmaking a decision that was based on wrong information. That debate has \nraged ever since.\n  When we invaded Iraq and found no weapons of mass destruction, when \nwe found no evidence of these chemical and biological stockpiles, these \narsenals of weapons, poised and ready to strike us, the American people \nand many Members of Congress had to stop and think: if that key element \nin the war against Iraq was wrong, if we were misled about that fact, \nwhat other facts were we misled about?\n  This New York Times article, which has been put into the Record for \nall to read, addresses one particular element. Most everyone who \nremembers that debate--I remember so many parts of it--will recall how \nmuch time we spent asking ourselves whether Iraq was in a position \nwhere it had nuclear weapons or the capacity to build them. Time and \nagain, this debate focused on one piece of tangible evidence: aluminum \ntubes, aluminum tubes which might or could have been used in the \nproduction of nuclear weapons.\n  You will remember the references to them. They were made by virtually \nevery member of the Bush administration--the President, the Vice \nPresident, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, the \nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency. Each one of them made some \nreference to these aluminum tubes and the fact that they were proof-\npositive evidence of the nuclear weapons that could threaten us from \nIraq. This New York Times piece has taken the time to go through the \nhistory of these aluminum tubes. What they have found is indeed \ntroubling. What they found is abundantly clear, that the administration \ndeliberately disregarded the facts and findings of the Department of \nEnergy and other key intelligence agencies and, as a result, misled the \nAmerican people about Iraq's nuclear program--the single most important \njustification for the war.\n  Now, a President--any President--must always take whatever actions \nare\n\n[[Page S10340]]\n\nnecessary to protect America. But the true test of leadership is \ntelling the truth to the American people about the world, tell them of \nour threats based on reality, based on truth, based on facts. That is \nthe hard work of the Presidency.\n  In this case, the President did not do that. In his State of the \nUnion Address, and in many other statements, we were told things that \nwere, frankly, not true. Even today, after we have investigated Iraq, \nafter we have sent thousands of inspectors to look for the evidence \nthat we were told would be there, after we have come up empty-handed \nfor a year and a half, even today, when National Security Adviser \nCondoleezza Rice was asked on public television whether she would \nconcede that the statements of the administration misled the American \npublic, she would not do so.\n  I say this: If Dr. Condoleezza Rice knows of any credible evidence to \nsupport the argument that Iraq was using those aluminum tubes to build \nnuclear weapons, she owes it to the American people and to her \nPresident to step forward and say so. The New York Times, in its \nlengthy investigation, produced evidence to the contrary. Yet Dr. Rice \nrefuses to even acknowledge it.\n  We should never give any country veto power over America's security. \nBut we have to be honest with the American people about what we need to \nbe safe. This New York Times article details how the administration \nspoke with such great certainty to the American people about Saddam's \nnuclear program, at a time when they knew privately that the evidence \nwas highly questionable. In fact, this article shows that top members \nof the administration repeatedly made statements that any fair analysis \nof the facts on our intelligence would have informed them were wrong.\n  Specifically, in September of 2002, before the vote to go to war, \nVice President Cheney said the United States had ``irrefutable \nevidence'' of Iraq's nuclear program, based on Iraq's possession of \nthousands of tubes made of high-strength aluminum. In September 2002--\nthe same month--Condoleezza Rice said: ``We do know that he [Saddam \nHussein] is actively pursuing a nuclear weapon.'' She went on to say \nthat it was based on the aluminum tubes that were ``only suited for a \nnuclear weapons program.'' She said, ``We don't want the smoking gun to \nbe a mushroom cloud.''\n  Can you think of a more provocative statement from the National \nSecurity Adviser to the President about the threat of Iraq to the \nUnited States, that we might face a mushroom cloud; that we, in fact, \nwould be the victims of a nuclear attack because Saddam Hussein had \nthese weapons? Those were the words of Dr. Rice. Those were words that \nwe know now were not backed up with facts and evidence.\n  In October 2002, President Bush said in Cincinnati:\n\n       Iraq has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes \n     and other equipment needed for gas centrifuges, used to \n     enrich uranium for nuclear weapons.\n\n  In fact, by the time the President made that statement, this \nadministration was clearly divided from within as to whether that \nstatement was true. I know because I sit on the Intelligence Committee. \nI know because I sat through days of hearings, where representatives of \nthe Department of Energy and the Central Intelligence Agency clearly \ndisagreed about whether those tubes were proof positive of Saddam \nHussein's nuclear weaponry program.\n  Let's concede the obvious. There was a time when Saddam Hussein was \nbuilding nuclear weapons back in the early 1990s. We were right to be \nvigilant and to find out whether he had renewed that program and it was \na threat to the region and the United States. The only thing we could \nfind was some evidence that Iraq had purchased these aluminum tubes \nfrom Hong Kong. And then we were fortunate to be able to intercept a \nshipment of these tubes in Jordan and to take a close look at them.\n  There was a fellow in the Central Intelligence Agency, working for \nthat agency, an analyst, who was building the case that these tubes \nwere proof positive that Saddam Hussein was back in the business of \nnuclear weapons.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee that I serve on took a look at his \nanalysis. Their conclusion was troubling because they concluded that \nhis facts were wrong, his conclusions were wrong; that he was involved \nin group-think, in their words, and a holy war within this \nadministration to prove that these tubes were related to nuclear \nweapons.\n  They wanted to prove--the CIA did--through this analyst that these \ntubes were part of a secret high-risk venture to build a nuclear bomb. \nBut they kept running into a problem: Within the same Bush \nadministration, the Department of Energy disputed their conclusions. I \nheard those arguments, most of America did not. One of the reasons I \nvoted against the use of force resolution was, in my mind, it clearly \nwas not established that Saddam Hussein had nuclear weapons which he \nwould use against the United States.\n  In June 2001, we seized a shipment of these aluminum tubes. We sent \nour very best expert to investigate whether they could be used for \nnuclear weapons, and those who looked at them came back and said, \nfirst, in size and materials--this is August of 2001--the tubes were \nvery different from those Iraq had used in centrifuge prototypes \nbefore. In fact, the team could find no centrifuge machines deployed in \na functioning environment that used such narrow tubes. They believed \nthat the conclusion was unlikely that these tubes were going to be \nused.\n  In the months after September 11, 2001, the Bush administration \ndevised a strategy to fight al-Qaida. Vice President Cheney became \ndeeply involved in reviewing the intelligence evidence. He became a \nself-appointed examiner of the worst case scenarios involving Iraq. He \nhad the background. He had been Chief of Staff of President Ford and \nSecretary of Defense for first President Bush. He knew all the \nintelligence agencies and what they did.\n  So he was not simply passing when it came to this whole question. He \nread of an allegation that Iraq was importing yellow cake uranium \nconcentrate from Niger in Africa. He went on to conclude in a statement \nmade on CNN that based on what he had read, Vice President Cheney said \nSaddam Hussein is actively pursuing nuclear weapons at this time. But, \nin fact, there was a debate raging within this administration as to \nwhether that was true.\n  Over and over the reports from the CIA were disputed by other \nagencies. The tubes just did not have the necessary thickness to be \npart of a nuclear weapons program. So we find ourselves in a situation \nwhere statements were being made by the Vice President and by others \nwhich could not be verified based on the facts within the same \nadministration.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee issued a 511-page report on this \neffort, and they concluded that the CIA analyst involved was so \ndetermined to prove his theory on this aluminum tube that he twisted \ntest results, ignored factual discrepancies, and ignored dissenting \nviews.\n  We know how this ended. It ended with the American people and many \nMembers of Congress convinced that these aluminum tubes were being used \nfor nuclear weapons. For some Members of the Senate, there was no \nchoice; they had to use this evidence to build a case to go to war in \nIraq. Statements were made by Vice President Cheney on August 26, 2002, \nat the VFW convention in Nashville. Despite the dispute going on within \nhis own administration, the Vice President said:\n\n       The case of Saddam Hussein, a sworn enemy of our country, \n     requires candid appraisal of the facts.\n\n  Mr. Cheney went on to say:\n\n       We now know--\n\n  And this is August of 2002--\n\n       We now know Saddam has resumed his efforts to acquire \n     nuclear weapons.\n\n  On the thinnest evidence, on the disputed aluminum tubes, Vice \nPresident Cheney made the strongest possible case he could make that \nthe nuclear weapons program in Iraq was underway. He conjured these \nimages of an Iraq of nuclear weapons and the threat they posed to the \nworld while members of his own administration disputed his conclusions.\n  Again, President Bush, Mr. Tenet, and others made these cases over \nand over again about the aluminum tubes. Mr. Cheney went on ``Meet the \nPress'' on September 8, 2002, and confirmed when asked that the tubes \nwere the\n\n[[Page S10341]]\n\nmost alarming evidence behind the administration's view that Iraq had \nresumed its nuclear weapons programs. He said the tubes had ``raised \nour level of concern.''\n  The same day, Dr. Rice went on CNN and said that the aluminum tubes \n``are only really suited for nuclear weapons programs.'' She made that \nstatement at a time when the President's own Department of Energy had \nreached an opposite conclusion. She said these tubes ``are only really \nsuited for nuclear weapons programs'' when, in fact, that was not the \ncase.\n  What we have learned here in the course of this investigation, what \nwe have learned from all of the investigations that followed after our \ninvasion of Iraq, what we have learned now that the 9/11 Commission, \nthe bipartisan Commission, has had a chance to look closely at the \nevidence is that in this case and in so many others, we were misled. \nThe American people were given wrong information and bad information \nabout the situation in Iraq. It was not just flawed intelligence; it \nwas not just a failure of the intelligence agencies; it was a failure \nof the leaders in the Bush administration to honestly portray the \nfacts, to tell the American people that there was suspicion of a \nnuclear weapons program but an honest dispute as to whether it existed. \nWhy didn't they portray it that way? Because we would never have gone \nto war if they had told us that fact, if they had given us the evidence \nstraight, if they had told us about disputes within this administration \nwhich were unresolved.\n\n  There was a debate last Thursday night between the two leading \ncandidates, the President and Senator Kerry, about foreign policy and \nabout Iraq. Time and again, President Bush said that his was a \ndifficult job, and I do not dispute that for a moment. He talked about \nall the hard work that was necessary to protect America, and I do not \ndoubt there is hard work. But I will tell you this: part of that hard \nwork has to include taking an honest look at the evidence given to you \nas the Commander in Chief, being willing to say that if there is a \ndispute about evidence so basic as these aluminum tubes and the nuclear \nweapon program of Iraq, that no President should step forward and \nmislead the American people.\n  That dispute was ongoing within the Bush administration, and yet \nclear statements were made by the President, the Vice President, and \nleading members of the Cabinet that a nuclear weapons program existed \nwhen, in fact, it did not.\n  I hope my colleagues and others will review this evidence, understand \nthe challenges we face, and I hope they will also come to the same \nconclusion that I have, and that is that whatever we face in terms of \nthreats in the future, whoever that President might be, I am certain he \nwill be committed to the security of America, but he also must be \ncommitted to the values of America--the values of honesty, openness, \nand candor, even when the facts do not support original conclusions.\n  In some cases, Senator Kerry has been criticized because he changed \nhis position. In this case, the Bush administration took a position on \nnuclear weapons in Iraq that was wrong, that history and the evidence \nhas proven was wrong. They refused to acknowledge the facts and \nevidence that came out to dispute it. They stuck with their story even \nwhen it was wrong, and now today we have serious questions as to the \nreasoning and the case made before our invasion of Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor in morning business. I would like to \nask the Presiding Officer--I do not see either the chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee or the ranking member in the Chamber. I \nhave a pending amendment to the bill. I am not going to even suggest to \noffer it since the chairman is not on the Senate floor, but I will at \nsome later time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois is very \neloquent in the position he takes, and he argues pretty aggressively in \nthis political season one point of view on the question of nuclear \nweaponry and how the Senate was briefed.\n  He said one thing that is true. I was not a member of the \nIntelligence Committee, but as a Senator, we received repeated \nbriefings on the weapons of mass destruction issue, and in the \nbriefings we received, all Members of the Senate, and that includes the \nDemocratic nominee for the Presidency, a Member of this body, Senator \nKerry, the issue of what those tubes were for was discussed and both \nsides of it were presented. It was left to the Senators, I guess, to \ndecide how they would call the question.\n  I felt as if the weight of the evidence indicated to me that Saddam \nHussein was doing what he had done before, that this was just one of \nthe weapons of mass destruction he was desirous of having, he was \ndesirous of possessing and that he wanted to use to threaten his \nneighbors, his own people, and to improve his threat standing in the \nneighborhood in which his country existed. In other words, he was \nclearly desirous of that, else why would he not agree to a full \ninspection to prove what he did with the remains of his nuclear program \nthat we know he had previously? Else why would he not show what he had \ndone with the chemical weapons we know he used against his own people? \nAnd we all heard those briefings.\n  I know the Presiding Officer was there in those briefings. We heard \nthem, and we knew the issues involved. We debated it on the floor of \nthis Senate for months and months and we discussed all those issues and \nwe had to make a decision about whether or not to allow Saddam Hussein \nto remain in violation of 16 U.N. resolutions.\n  We said we could not continue in this way. They fired at airplanes on \na regular basis as they enforced the U.N. no-fly zone over Iraq, and we \nvoted on it.\n  After having all of those issues discussed, after having received the \nintelligence with both sides of this question discussed before the \nSenators, Senator Kerry, as referred to by the Senator from Illinois--\nhe referred to him in his campaign--voted to allow the President to \nmake one final effort with Saddam Hussein and authorized him to \ncommence hostilities if that did not succeed.\n  Those last discussions did not succeed and we made one more effort. \nThey did not succeed and we went to war as every Member of this body \nknew when we cast that vote. This body was not misled and Senator \nDurbin was not misled because he heard the same briefings as he has \ntold us, and neither was Senator Kerry when he cast his vote in favor \nof allowing this war to proceed.\n  I think it is critical for leadership in America that if an American \nmakes a commitment and a decision on an issue as important as that to \nkeep the commitment and not flip-flop on it next week, not change their \nmind next week and go back and try to find some excuse to blame the \nPresident who is leading troops in the field and make complaints on the \nfloor of this Senate and in press conferences, statements which make it \nmore difficult for us to be successful.\n  We know what the challenge is, and we as a nation have made a \ncommitment. This Senate, by a three-fourths plus vote, voted to allow \nthis war to begin. We knew it was going to happen if Saddam Hussein did \nnot back down and admit what he was doing and allow inspectors to come \nin and demonstrate clearly that he did not have these weapons of mass \ndestruction. We received intensive briefings on that subject. We cast \nour votes and God gave us the ability to make a clear decision. We \nought to stand by that decision, and we are going to stand by it.\n  There are some who want to cut and run, bob and weave, flip and flop, \nbut the American people will not and this Senate is not. We are going \nto stand firm and we are going to be successful in Iraq because it is \nthe right thing to do.\n  Those people have suffered greatly but progress has been made and \nwill continue to be made. We are going to train the military, get them \nup to speed, and get them equipped. As we have seen in Samara when that \nhappens and they work with the American military, progress, success can \nand will occur. This is a longrun solution.\n  We have had so much success in Afghanistan where it is so wonderful \nto see over 10 million people registered to vote there, and 40 percent \nof them are women. To say that we cannot make progress in this area of \nthe world is a mistake.\n\n[[Page S10342]]\n\n  Yes, it is tough. Yes, it is difficult.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                           amendment no. 3923\n\n    (Purpose: To ensure the balance of privacy and civil liberties)\n\n       On page 154, strike lines 1 through 3 and insert the \n     following:\n       (1) analyze and review actions the executive branch takes \n     to protect the Nation from terrorism, ensuring that the need \n     for such actions is balanced with the need to protect privacy \n     and civil liberties; and\n       On page 155, line 6 strike beginning with ``has'' through \n     line 9 and insert the following: ``has established--\n       ``(i) that the need for the power is balanced with the need \n     to protect privacy and civil liberties;''.\n       On page 166, strike lines 4 through 6 and insert the \n     following: ``element has established--\n       ``(i) that the need for the power is balanced with the need \n     to protect privacy and civil liberties;''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that it now be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3871\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of an \namendment previously offered, No. 3871, and to share some thoughts \nabout what I believe to be a critical issue facing us in terms of \nsecurity for this country.\n  One thing this legislation we are discussing today could do better is \nit could more effectively help deal with weaknesses that exist in our \nsystem today. We are moving blocks around at headquarters and creating \nresponsibilities. Some of that may be good and some of that may not, \nbut what I have not seen enough of is focus on what really is a problem \nand a weakness in our system and proposals that will actually fix that \nand make it stronger.\n  We know, for example, that lack of human intelligence over decades \nsince I guess the Church Committee has left us far too few intelligence \nofficers around the world. We know that we have far too few translators \nwho can translate foreign languages that may involve people who have \nconnections to terrorism. Those are things we know are problems, and I \nam afraid we do not do enough about it.\n  This is a matter that I think is critically important that is a \nproblem generally recognized by people today in this country who give \nit much thought. It is simply this: That if a police officer in any \ntown in America were to stop an individual he or she believes to be \nhere illegally, I would suggest that most Americans do not know what \nwill happen at that point. As a former Federal prosecutor and Attorney \nGeneral of Alabama, I travel the State and frequently meet with local \nlaw officers, sheriffs and police officers, and I ask them what they do \nwhen they discover someone who has been in this country illegally.\n  The answer is, they let them go. They used to call the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service and they would tell them that if there were \nnot at least 15 people in this group illegally they would not bother to \ncome and even pick up this individual. As a result of that and a few \ncourt rulings that, in my view, are not persuasive, are not binding, \nthe mentality has developed among State and local law enforcement that \nthey do not have any role in enforcing our immigration laws, and they \ndo not do it.\n  I raise this simply because it used the same language I have used \nbefore. This is an article from, I believe, a Portsmouth, New \nHampshire, paper. It involves the Kittery, ME, police chief. The first \nline of the article says, ``This country is facing a tremendous \nsecurity issue when it comes to illegal aliens.''\n\n  The chief of police sent that strong message after his department \ndetained a Colombian citizen and a Bulgarian citizen. Both were found \nto be in the country after their visas had expired--illegally:\n\n       . . . but the police were told by Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service agents, to release them.\n       ``They just let them go,'' the Chief said.\n\n  That is what happens in America today. That is reality. Anyone who \nsuggests that our police are able to participate effectively in \napprehending people who are here illegally does not know what is \nhappening in the real world. We have 650,000 State and local police \nofficers in America--sheriff deputies, police officers, State troopers,\n\n[[Page S10345]]\n\nand the like. But there are only 2,000 Interior enforcement officers \nfor the Department of Immigration--ICE, they now call it; only 2,000 in \nthe whole country.\n  So, to tell our local people we don't want your help in this is \nunwise. It is a serious flaw in our system and I propose that we fix \nit.\n  I understand the way we are proceeding here that this amendment is \nprobably not germane. Therefore, if it is not germane, with cloture \nprobably we will not get a vote on it. But it is something I wanted to \nshare with the Members of this Senate.\n  We have Senator Cornyn, Senator Ensign, Senator Chambliss--who chairs \nthe Immigration Subcommittee in Judiciary--and Senator Miller from \nGeorgia. They have signed onto this amendment. Senator Inhofe, I see \njust came in, is a signer and supporter of this amendment. It is common \nsense. It is plain common sense. What we are doing now is wrong. I am \nvery concerned about it.\n  In addition to the fact that they are told not to participate in the \napprehension or detention or holding of someone who is here illegally, \neven more bizarre is the fact that we now have 400,000 alien absconders \nin this country. That is 400,000 people who were determined to be in \nthis country illegally, by one forum or another, by administrative \nruling or court determination, and have been issued final orders of \ndeportation, but are still at large. What do you think would normally \nhappen if that occurred, if someone is found here illegally and \ndetermined so by an administrative or court proceeding? You would think \nthey would be asked to leave. They would be deported.\n  What happens is they are released on bail pending a final order of \ndeportation and 80 percent of those never come back. They don't show up \nfor their deportation hearing. They abscond.\n  Mr. President, 86,000 of those are criminal felons; of that 400,000 \nwho absconded, 86,000 are criminal felons who came to this country with \npermission to live here and work here according to the rules and \nregulations. They have been convicted of a felony and they have been \nordered deported, but they abscond and they are out there--criminals, \nmany of whom are threats. Fifteen thousand of these 86,000 have been \ndetermined to be of ``national security interest,'' and 3,000 come from \nstate sponsors of terrorism.\n  We know that three of the 9/11 hijackers had contact with State and \nlocal police during routine traffic stops prior to 9/11. Hijacker \nMohammed Atta, believed to have piloted American Airlines flight 77 \ninto the World Trade Center's north tower, was stopped twice by police \nin Florida. Hijacker Ziad S. Jarrah was stopped for speeding by \nMaryland State police 2 days before 9/11. Hani Hanjour, who was on the \nflight that crashed into the Pentagon, was stopped for speeding by \npolice in Arlington, VA.\n  Right now, if a State or local officer stops one of these 400,000 \nabsconders, they have no real way of knowing the person has been \nordered removed from the country by an immigration court. Do you \nunderstand that? The key thing here is that people need to understand \nhow the system works. Let's say a Mohammad Atta had been arrested for \nreckless driving or DUI, that he was in violation of his immigration \nlaws and was ordered deported, and that he absconded back into the \ncountry and he is stopped in Maryland or Alabama or Maine by a local \npolice officer. What would happen? If he had committed larceny and had \na warrant out for his arrest from Maine, I will tell you what would \nhappen if he is stopped in Alabama. The police officer will run the \nNational Crime Information Computer check. It will come out that there \nis a warrant out for his or her arrest for larceny in Maine, and he \nwill be held and turned over to the Maine authorities to be prosecuted.\n\n  What happens if a person is one of the 400,000 alien absconders? That \ninformation is not being put in the NCIC database, so it is not \navailable to the police officers who make a check. They can't determine \nwhether this is a danger to America.\n  This is what our amendment would do. It would simply clarify the \nauthority of State and local police, that they have a voluntary role in \ntheir local role that requires information, and it requires information \nsuch as revoked visas and final orders of deportation be listed in the \nNCIC so the State and local officers can have access to it in the \ncourse of their routine duties. It does not say people have to go out \nand start looking for illegal aliens, but if they apprehend somebody, \nthey run the NCIC check and see whether there is a final order of \ndeportation in the system.\n  Action by state and local police is totally voluntary. There has been \nsome concern that similar legislation would require the local police to \nparticipate in enforcing immigration laws, which I personally think \nmost should--or at least they ought to. But this amendment would not \nrequire any action by state and local officers. It also has no link to \nany funding they are currently receiving.\n  The amendment goes a step further to clarify the voluntary nature of \nthis amendment it includes language saying that nothing would require \nthe State and local officers to report the immigration status of \nwitnesses of crimes or victims of crimes. Some say if you do that, \npeople will not come forward and report a crime; if they are a victim, \nthey will not come forward and report if they are a witness. This \namendment does not require any of that.\n  Let me briefly conclude. I could say much more about this. But the 9/\n11 Commission dealt with this issue. They recognize the ``growing \nrole''--that is a quote in the 9/11 Commission report--of our State and \nlocal law enforcement agencies in the area of immigration law \nenforcement, and for effective cooperation of all levels of immigration \nlaw enforcement--Federal, State, and local.\n  They also noted this challenge. On page 383 of the 9/11 report:\n\n       The challenge for national security in an age of terrorism \n     is to prevent the very few people who may pose overwhelming \n     risk from entering or remaining in the United States \n     undetected.\n\n  We ought to listen to that. It is a threat to our country, that the \npeople who are here illegally remain here without being apprehended. \nThey say there is a growing role for State and local law enforcement in \nthis area. That is why we have offered this language. That is why, even \nbefore 9/11, I recognized the problem would be crucial for this \ncountry.\n  I am very frustrated but we need to step up to the plate and make \nsure every local and State law enforcement officer knows what their \nauthority is; that the Federal ICE people will come and retrieve people \nwho are here illegally; that people who have absconded after a valid \norder of deportation and a warrant for their arrest has been issued. \nThat ought to be in the NCIC for an immigration offense just as much as \na petty larceny offense or a DUI offense. That is not the way it is \ntoday.\n  We have to confront this issue. In one fell sweep we could add \n600,000-plus law officers--the eyes and ears of America on the streets \nof every city and town in America. We could add them to the effort to \nmake this country secure. We could add them as eyes and ears with the \nability to identify and arrest people who have warrants out for them, \nwho may be 1 of 3,000 from countries that harbor terrorism.\n  I thank the Chair. I believe we need to continue to work on this. I \nintend to do so. We ought to have a vote on this, if possible. If not, \nwe will just keep coming back at it.\n\n\n    Amendments No. 3850, No. 3851, No. 3855, No. 3856, and No. 3872\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside, and \non behalf of Senator Grassley, I would like to call up en bloc five \namendments that are filed at the desk. I call up amendments No. 3850, \nNo. 3851, No. 3855, No. 3856, and No. 3872, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat the amendments be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Objection is made.\n  I ask the Senator from Alabama if he could indicate what the \namendments are.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Lieberman. This was a request from \nSenator Grassley, and I called these amendments up and then asked that \nthey be set aside.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator.\n  I remove my objection.\n\n[[Page S10346]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3566\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have filed amendment No. 3866, which \nwould prohibit racial profiling with the relevant section as follows:\n\n       The term ``racial profiling'' means the practice of law \n     enforcement agents relying to any degree on race, ethnicity, \n     religion or national origin in selecting which individuals to \n     subject to routine or spontaneous investigatory activities or \n     in deciding upon the scope and substance of law enforcement \n     activity following the initial investigatory procedure except \n     where there is trustworthy information relevant to the \n     locality and timeframe that links persons of a particular \n     race, ethnicity, religion or national origin to an identified \n     criminal incident or scheme.\n\n  The amendment further defines routine or spontaneous investigative \nactivities to include interviews, traffic stops, pedestrian stops, \nfrisks, and other types of body searches, consensual or nonconsensual \nsearches of the person and possessions, including vehicles, \npedestrians, entrants into the United States that are more extensive \nthan those customarily carried out, immigration-related workplace \ninvestigations, or other types of enforcement encounters as compiled by \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Bureau of Statistics.\n  As evident from these definitions, a number of these items would \nrelate to the kinds of activities of national intelligence, the \nimmigration-related workplace investigations, inspections and \ninterviews of interest to United States.\n  This amendment tracks very closely the provisions of the Department \nof Justice guidance regarding use of race by Federal law enforcement \nagencies promulgated in June of 2003 which says in relevant part, ``in \nmaking routine or spontaneous law enforcement decisions, such as \nordinary traffic stops, Federal law enforcement officers may not use \nrace or ethnicity to any degree except that officers may rely on race \nor ethnicity in a specific subject description.''\n  I understand the managers are not prepared to have another vote this \nevening.\n  But for the Record I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment \nbe set aside and the amendment No. 3866 be taken up for consideration.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I understand \nthe legal prowess of the Senator from Pennsylvania when there is a \nlegal issue. I know the good intentions he has in regard to this most \nimportant subject matter and to what the amendment relates. But on \nbehalf of the authorizers, I think this matter should be discussed at \nthe Judiciary Committee level in some detail, and it has not. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought to offer this amendment for \nmost of the afternoon. I offered two amendments last week. I know how \ndifficult it is to manage a bill.\n  I, again, compliment the distinguished chairman, Senator Collins, and \nthe distinguished ranking member, Senator Lieberman, for their work.\n  As soon as the bill was called to the floor last week, I came to the \nfloor and offered two amendments to cooperate with the managers. I was \nawaiting the time to offer this amendment.\n  The problem which is posed procedurally is that cloture will be filed \ntomorrow. If cloture is invoked, this amendment will not satisfy the \ngermaneness requirements which is the reason I have offered it this \nevening. But in light of the objection to set aside the pending \namendment so debate and a vote can occur on this amendment, I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania. \nHe is a very valued and constructive member of our committee in \nconsidering this legislation. He was dealing in this amendment with a \nproblem that ought to be dealt with, but, unfortunately, because of the \nmoment we have reached on this bill where effectively unanimous consent \nis necessary to take up a matter for a vote and objection has been \nheard on both sides, that will not be possible.\n  I thank him. I thank him for getting the process going last week and, \nas he said, coming over early and submitting two amendments which \nhelped to clarify the matters this bill contains. There will be another \nday for this amendment, I am sure.\n  Once again, I thank him for his real leadership in pursuit of reform \nof our national intelligence assets.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Connecticut and \nthe Senator from Nevada in their compliments of the Senator of the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania. I do very much appreciate that he was so \nwilling to come forward early last week and offer the first amendments. \nI regret that objection on both sides of the aisle prevent us from \naccommodating him this evening.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their gracious \ncomments and pick up on what Senator Lieberman said. This amendment \nwill return. There will be a day for its due consideration and I think \nenactment by this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be recognized to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Grant Dollars at EPA\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to shed some light on a \nsubject that is very important to me in my oversight duties as the \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. Earlier this \nyear, the Environment and Public Works Committee held an oversight \nhearing where the committee heard testimony from the General Accounting \nOffice and the EPA inspector general regarding a 10-year history of \nnumerous problems with the management of grant dollars at the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n  Some of the problems included EPA not requiring grant recipients to \ndemonstrate real environmental benefits for grants, EPA not requiring \ncompetition in its grants awards, and a general lack of oversight of \nEPA grant officers and recipients. The EPA inspector general released \nan audit only 2 days before the hearing, finding that a particular \nnonprofit guaranty had violated the Lobbying Disclosure Act, and with \nnearly $5 million of EPA grant funding.\n  Members may recall, because I talked about it at that time, that it \nwas the Consumer Federation of America, which is a 501(c)(4), that had \nbeen a recipient of discretionary grants from the EPA. That is a \n501(c)(4) as in lobbying organization. They support candidates. It is \nstrictly against the law.\n  Over the last few months, my staff has done considerable research \ninto the EPA grant and confirmed many of the problems and also found \nthe EPA has a long history of awarding grant dollars without \ncompetition to some well-known nonprofit environmental groups that \nregularly engage in political activity. My staff has compiled some of \nthese findings in this 30-page report to the chairman.\n  In examining how the environmental groups receive and spend their \nFederal dollars, it became apparent they receive funding from numerous \nsources, including large foundations. Within these organizations, \npolitical and grassroots efforts quickly became difficult to \ndifferentiate the sources of their funding and how they spend them. \nTherefore, I instructed my staff to examine the funding and expenditure \nrecords of the organizations. That has resulted in a second report \nwhich is the focus of my remarks today.\n  My staff has compiled this information into a 15-page report for the \nchairman to provide some preliminary examples describing five of the \nmost widely politically active environmental groups, the description of \ntheir activity, the foundations that provide the financial support for \nthese groups, and the interconnected web among all those organizations.\n\n[[Page S10347]]\n\n  Interestingly, these environmental groups are all tax-exempt, IRS-\nregistered 501(c)(3) charitable organizations, meaning contributions to \nthese groups are tax deductible. These groups profess to be the \ngreatest stewards of the environment and solicit contributions from a \nvariety of sources by that claim. But they demonstrate more interest in \ngiving apocalyptic environmental scenarios to raise money for raw \npolitical purposes rather than working together to improve the \nenvironment for America.\n  We have money from foundations, individuals, and government grants \ngoing into environmental groups, and then they turn around and put \nthese out to the 501(c)(3), 527 organizations and 501(c)(4), these are \npolitical organizations. All these nonprofit groups are also closely \nassociated and fund their affiliated 501(c)(4) lobbying organizations \nand the 527 political organizations.\n  This report could not be more timely as the Washington Post, as \nrecently as September 27 of this year, published an article \ndemonstrating that IRS 501(c)(3), 501(c)(4), and 527 organizations are \nall engaged in political activity this election cycle with expenditures \ndesigned to circumvent the prohibitions in the bipartisan campaign \nReform Act of 2002, otherwise known as McCain-Feingold.\n  This article quoted a Federal Election Commission official stating:\n\n       In the wake of the ban on party-raised soft money, evidence \n     is mounting that money is slithering through on other \n     routes as organizations maintain various accounts, \n     tripping over each other, shifting money between \n     501(c)(3)'s, (c)(4)'s, and 527's. . . . It's big money.\n\n  Why is this important? Because the environment is important to all \nAmericans. Despite what we hear from the groups in their attack \nadvertisements against President Bush and the Republican candidates \nacross the Nation, our air is cleaner, water more drinkable, and our \nforests are becoming healthier.\n  Keep in mind this is over a period of time when we have almost \ndoubled the amount of miles that are driven, and our population is \ndramatically increasing. Yet things are cleaner than they were before.\n  For instance, over the last 30 years we have cut air pollution in \nhalf. Why, then, are some extremists spending millions upon millions to \nhijack the conservation movement? It seems to me that it is more \nimportant to the leadership of these groups to turn their once laudable \nmovement into a political machine by sending out their bipartisan snake \noil, salesmen, and misleading the American public regarding their \npurely politically partisan agenda under the guise of environmental \nprotection.\n  Our Nation's father of conservation, Teddy Roosevelt, said:\n\n       To waste, to destroy, our natural resources, to skin and \n     exhaust the land instead of using it so as to increase its \n     usefulness, will result in undermining in the days of our \n     children the very prosperity which we ought by right to hand \n     down to them amplified and developed.\n\n  These words ring true today, but unfortunately it is clear that the \nenvironmentalist movement is deaf to them. What we find now is the \nfleecing of the American public's pocketbooks by the environmental \nmovement for their political use. What we find now is exhausting \nlitigation, instigation of false claims, misleading science, and scare \ntactics to fool Americans into believing disastrous environmental \nscenarios that are untrue.\n  Pay close attention to the webs of this incestuous activity of these \nenvironmentalists groups and their financial benefactors. Environmental \norganizations have become experts at duplicitous activity, skirting \nlaws up to the edge of illegality, and burying their political \nactivities under the guise of nonprofit environmental improvement.\n  Chart No. 2 demonstrates the interconnection environmental family \naffair with nonprofits and their benefactors. As we can see, six \norganizations at the bottom of the chart are all either 527 groups or \n501(c)(4)s. These are political organizations. Money that comes up \nhere--for example, the Heinz Foundation, goes to the various \norganizations and ultimately gets to the Environmental Accounting Fund, \nthe Save the Environment Organization, Action Fund, Sierra Club Votes, \nDefenders of Wildlife, Environment 2004. These are all either \n501(c)(4)s or 527 organizations.\n  The LCV calls itself the political voice of the national \nenvironmental movement, and much of its grants from even its 501(c)(3) \norganizations go to fund voter mobilization and education drives. In \neach election cycle, LCV endorses congressional candidates and since \n1996 has published a ``dirty dozen'' list. They brag about the dirty \ndozen list that has been very effective, but the LCV mostly singles out \nonly Republican candidates.\n  What we are talking about is the money that is channeled from \n501(c)(3) organizations is going to defeat Republican candidates.\n  Mr. President, let me provide some examples. So far this year, the \nLCV has released a ``Dirty Dozen'' list of eight congressional \ncandidates--seven Republicans and one Democrat. For the first time \never, it includes the President and Vice President. I cannot forget \nthat LCV has, of course, endorsed the junior Senator from Massachusetts \nfor President, the earliest endorsement of a Presidential contender in \nits 34-year history.\n  The LCV's 527 organization last reported to have raised over $3.3 \nmillion in the 2004 election cycle. This is chart No. 3: $3.3 million. \nIt has also joined with Environment2004, another 527 political \norganization directed by former Clinton administration EPA staffers \npurchasing air time to run ads against the President.\n  Interestingly, not all candidates appreciate LCV's help.\n  I recently read where the senior Senator from South Dakota requested \nthe LCV not air advertisements in the South Dakota Senate contest this \nyear and even characterized outside organization advertisements as \n``often too negative, too personal, and lack any real substance.''\n  However, LCV has a long history of political involvement. This is \nchart No. 4. In 1996, LCV spent a total of $1.5 million in ads trying \nto defeat its ``Dirty Dozen'' list of targets of 11 Republicans and 1 \nDemocrat.\n  In 1998, LCV spent $2.3 million targeting its ``Dirty Dozen'' list of \n12 Republican candidates and 1 Democratic candidate.\n  In 2000, the LCV spent a total of $4 million, again targeting 11 \nRepublicans and 1 Democrat on its ``Dirty Dozen'' list. And I cannot \nforget, in 2000 the LCV also endorsed Al Gore for President.\n  In 2002, the LCV once again targeted 11 Republican congressional \ncandidates and 1 Democrat.\n  I see a partisan pattern that is well developed here. LCV spent \nhundreds of thousands of dollars in congressional contests against \nRepublican candidates. However, the strongest effort seems to have been \nfocused on Senator Allard. The LCV claims to have budgeted a total of \n$700,000 for that race alone and hired a campaign staff of 12 to \ncoordinate phone banks and precinct walks in addition to running \ntelevision and radio advertisements. Altogether, LCV is reported to \nhave spent $1.5 million in independent expenditures during the 2002 \nelection cycle. Of that total amount, LCV spent $1.313 million \nbenefiting Democratic candidates while only spending $136,000 for \nRepublican candidates.\n  Another example is the Sierra Club. The Sierra Club describes itself \nas ``America's oldest, largest and most influential grassroots \nenvironmental organization.'' Sierra Club is also an IRS-registered, \ntax-exempt, nonprofit 501(c)(3) foundation. Here we go again. The \nSierra Club Foundation is closely affiliated with its Sierra Club \n501(c)(4) and section 527 political organizations. In fact, the \nWashington Post detailed the interconnected organizations of the Sierra \nClub in an article it featured last Monday. This is what the Post \nprinted:\n\n       Perhaps no one better illustrates the host of interlocking \n     roles than Carl Pope, one of the most influential operatives \n     on the Democratic side in the 2004 election. As executive \n     director of the Sierra Club, a major 501(c)(4) environmental \n     lobby, Pope also controls the Sierra Club Voter Education \n     Fund, a 527. The Voter Education Fund 527 has raised $3.4 \n     million this election cycle, with $2.4 million of that amount \n     coming from the Sierra Club. A third group, the Sierra Club \n     PAC, has since 1980 given $3.9 million to Democratic \n     candidates and $173,602 to GOP candidates.\n\n  The Sierra Club is consistently critical of the Bush environmental \nrecord and sometimes others as well. The Sierra Club even accused me of \ntrying to\n\n[[Page S10348]]\n\nraise the levels of mercury pollution. The Sierra Club's 527 political \norganization reports to have raised over $6.8 million for the 2004 \nelection cycle alone, with a goal of over $8 million by the end of the \nmonth.\n\n  Like the LCV, the Sierra Club has a history of involvement in \npolitics. In the year 2000 Presidential contest, the Sierra Club spent \nseveral hundred thousand dollars in advertisements attacking President \nBush. And in the 2002 election cycle, the Sierra Club endorsed 184 \nDemocratic incumbents and challengers and endorsed 10 Republican \ncandidates--184 Democrats and 10 Republicans. Not surprisingly, the \nSierra Club is heavily involved in the 2004 political cycle. The Sierra \nClub began spending early in the 2004 Presidential contest and has made \na series of endorsements this year. Of course, the Sierra Club has \nendorsed the junior Senator from Massachusetts for President, and it \nhas endorsed 16 Democratic Senate incumbents and challengers and no \nRepublican candidates--16 Democrats, no Republicans. In races for the \nHouse of Representatives, the Sierra Club has endorsed 114 Democratic \nincumbents and challengers and has endorsed 7 Republican candidates.\n  Let me use one more example briefly--the Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil. The NRDC is also an IRS-registered, tax-exempt, nonprofit \n501(c)(3) receiving $55 million in tax-deductible contributions--these \nare tax-deductible contributions; no money going into the Treasury--in \njust the last year running bogus ads like this one on this chart \nclaiming President Bush is rolling back a mercury regulation that never \nexisted. This is an outrageous lie. I do not remember how much this ad \ncost, but if you look, this was a full-page ad run in the New York \nTimes. Down here it says:\n\n       Yes, I want to join the Natural Resources Defense Council \n     and help thwart President Bush's plan to weaken controls on \n     toxic mercury.\n\n  There are already controls on toxic mercury. This is an outrageous \nlie. How can you lower something that does not exist? The truth is, \nPresident Bush's Clear Skies legislative proposal, which I support, is \nthe biggest emissions reduction plan ever proposed by any American \nPresident. Over 14 years, it would reduce emissions from powerplants of \nnitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and mercury emissions from powerplants \nby 70 percent. Let's be sure and understand that the NRDC deliberately \nlied in this ad because you cannot roll back standards that do not \nexist.\n  The NRDC is affiliated with the NRDC Action Fund, a 501(c)(4) \norganization--here we go again--and the Environmental Accountability \nFund, its section 527 political organization. The NRDC describes itself \nas ``the nation's most effective environmental action organization,'' \nand has a long history of political activity.\n  The NRDC has joined this year with LCV and the Sierra Club to air \ntelevision and radio ads and hire campaign staffs to work against \nPresident Bush in several States, including New Mexico, Florida, \nArizona, and Nevada. Overall, the Environmental Accountability Fund, \nNRDC's 527 organization, last reported to have raised nearly $1 million \nin the 2004 election cycle.\n  Well, that is three of the culprits. The report outlines two others \nin depth--Greenpeace and Environmental Defense--and shows similar \npatterns of partisan fundraising and spending, such as this Greenpeace \nad that equates President Bush's conservation policies to the Texas \nchainsaw massacre--a disgusting comparison, especially considering that \nhistoric healthy forest legislation was proposed and passed by this \nadministration. It is sad that many of these groups would rather watch \nour forests burn and our watersheds become destroyed rather than employ \n21st century forest management technology to improve forest health.\n  But misleading and scaring the American people during a Presidential \nelection year, I guess, is more important to them than true forest \nhealth.\n  501(c)(3)s, 501(c)(4)s, political action committees, and 527 \npolitical organizations--it is all tangled up in a web. Back to that \nchart we used, chart No. 2, you can see how convoluted it is.\n  But the money all ends up down here being used for political \npurposes, millions upon millions of dollars going for partisan \npolitical activity while these groups attempt to maintain a nonpartisan \ncloak and justification that they are helping our environment. But \nthese funds do not just come from scared mothers and others furiously \nwriting checks because these groups have lied to them and told them \nthat eating fish will kill their children. Our research has found that \nmuch of the funding these groups receive comes from independent \nfoundations and trusts which also claim to be nonpartisan.\n  Let's take a look now at some of these nonpartisan institutions and \nhow their money finds its way to this intricately growing web. The \nHeinz foundations are a few of the largest contributors to these \nnonprofit environmental organizations. And, of course, Mrs. Teresa \nHeinz Kerry is either a chairperson of the board of trustees or a \nmember of the board of trustees of each one of these foundations.\n  In fact, Mrs. Heinz Kerry is the head of the $1.2 billion Heinz \nFoundation Endowment.\n  Since 1998, these foundations have contributed nearly $3 million to \nthe Sierra Club, LCV, the NRDC, and Environmental Defense. Each \nfoundation is also a large contributor to the Tides Center and the \nTides Foundation, contributing over $6 million since 1998. The Tides \norganization has in turn also contributed over $1.4 million to the \nSierra Club, Greenpeace, and the NRDC over the same period of time.\n  Another major supporter is the Turner Foundation, founded in 1990 by \nTed Turner, who is chairman of the foundation board of trustees. The \nTurner Foundation sponsors the work of its special projects which \ninclude the Partnership Project, comprised of 20 national environmental \ngroups. Since 1998, the Turner Foundation has contributed over $6.4 \nmillion to the Partnership Project. Individually, the Turner Foundation \nhas contributed more than $20 million to the LCV since 1998; over $2.6 \nmillion to the NRDC; over $1 million to the Sierra Club; and nearly $2 \nmillion to Environmental Defense, Earth Justice, and Greenpeace.\n  Finally, another large supporter is the Pew Charitable Trust. You can \nfollow the lines of the money there. It claims it is an independent \nnonprofit serving to inform the public on key issues. Two of the Pew's \nenvironmental priorities include global warming and wilderness \nprotection. Pew has contributed $17.4 million to Clear the Air Campaign \nsince 1999, with which it publishes materials such as this claiming \nthat the Bush plan means more pollution. Again, another impossible lie \nbecause you can't roll back mercury standards that don't exist.\n  Perhaps wilderness protection is where the Pew shows its true colors. \nIt has joined with the Heritage Force Campaign, the Natural Resource \nDefense Council, Environmental Defense, and the Sierra Club in a \ncampaign characterizing the President's conservation policies as \n``Crazy George's National Forest Give-a-Way.'' Once again, it is silly \nscare ads like this. For them, it is only about politics, not about \ntrue forest management.\n  We should be more scared of this tangled web of political financing \nand the fact that there is no way to tell where taxpayer funded grants \nand private dollars cross. These are the grants we started out talking \nabout. It is also convoluted where advocacy funding and political \nfunding intermingle and even if environmental groups really spend any \nmoney actually improving the environment.\n  Since 1998, Pew Foundation has contributed several million dollars to \nvarious environmental organizations. These contributions have included \nnearly $18 million to Earth Justice; over $3 million to NRDC; over $3.7 \nmillion to Environmental Defense. Pew has also contributed $32.6 \nmillion to the Tides Center and Foundation over the same period. The \nTides organization has contributed over $1.4 million to the Sierra \nClub, Greenpeace, NRDC, among others, since 1998.\n  This does not even represent all of the political involvement of \nenvironmental extremists. These groups have established an \nunquestionable record of partisanship and demonstrated a slithering \nflow of money among themselves and from their financial benefactors.\n  Today's environmental groups are simply Democratic political machines\n\n[[Page S10349]]\n\nraising millions of dollars in contributions and spending millions in \nexpenditures each year for the purpose of raising more money to pursue \ntheir agenda. Especially in this election year, the American voters \nshould see these groups and their many affiliated organizations as they \nare--the newest insidious conspiracy of political action committees and \nperhaps the newest multimillion dollar manipulation of Federal election \nlaws.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the reports be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Political Activity of Environmental Groups and Their Supporting \n                              Foundations\n\n\n                       questionably non-partisan\n\n       Following the League of Conservation Voters' endorsement of \n     Senator John Kerry for President, The Hill, a Capitol Hill \n     publication, published an article featuring the financial \n     connection between the League of Conservation Voters and \n     Heinz family foundations. The article further featured the \n     connections between the League of Conservation Voters and \n     other well-known environmental groups such as the Natural \n     Resources Defense Council and Environmental Defense and their \n     financial links to Heinz family foundations as well. The Hill \n     article cited specific contributions such as a $56,000 \n     contribution in 2003 to the Natural Resources Defense Council \n     from a Heinz family foundation and three $200,000 \n     contributions from two Heinz family foundations from 2001 to \n     2003 to Environmental Defense. The article revealed that Ms. \n     Teresa Heinz Kerry is the chairperson or board member on each \n     Heinz family foundation, and since 2000, the Heinz \n     foundations have given nearly $1 million to the League of \n     Conservation Voters, members of its board, and the groups \n     those board members represent.\n       Groups such as the League of Conservation Voters, the \n     Natural Resources Defense Council, and Environmental Defense \n     represent themselves as organizations concerned about the \n     protection of the environment. They are all tax exempt \n     Internal Revenue Service (IRS) registered 501(c)(3) \n     organizations often associated with 501(c)(4), 527 political \n     organizations, or other affiliated organizations. However, as \n     recently as September 27, 2004, the Washington Post published \n     an article demonstrating that IRS designated 501(c)(3), \n     501(c)(4), and 527 organizations are all engaged in political \n     activity this election year with expenditures potentially \n     designed to circumvent the prohibitions in the Bipartisan \n     Campaign Reform Act of 2002, otherwise known as McCain-\n     Feingold. The article quoted a former Federal Election \n     Commission official stating.\n       ``In the wake of the ban on party-raised soft money, \n     evidence is mounting that money is slithering through on \n     other routes as organizations maintain various accounts, \n     tripping over each other, shifting money between 501(c)(3)'s, \n     (c)(4)'s, and 527's. . . . It's big money, and the pendulum \n     has swung too far in their direction.''\n       This report for the Chairman provides preliminary examples \n     describing five of the most widely politically active \n     environmental groups with a description of their activity and \n     the foundations that provide the financial support for those \n     groups.\n\n\n                      environmental organizations\n\n                     League of conservation voters\n\n       Beginning with the League of Conservation Voters (LCV) \n     provides an appropriate beginning because the LCV board of \n     directors is comprised of various representatives from a \n     number of other environmental groups. Among those sitting on \n     either the LCV board of directors, LCV political advisory \n     committee, or the LCV political committee are leaders in the \n     following organizations:\n       --Natural Resources Defense Council\n       --Environmental Defense\n       --Sierra Club\n       --Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund\n       --The Wilderness Society\n       --Trust for Public Lands\n       --Defenders of Wildlife\n       --U.S. Public Interest Research Group\n       --National Wildlife Federation\n       --Environmental Working Group\n       The LCV is an IRS registered 501(c)(4) organization \n     affiliated with the LCV Education Fund, a 501(c)(3) \n     organization. The LCV is also affiliated with a LCV political \n     action committee, a section 527 organization, and another \n     501(c)(4) organization, the LCV Accountability Project. The \n     LCV describes its affiliates as the ``LCV family of \n     organizations'' and describes its work as ``the political \n     voice of the national environmental movement and the only \n     organization devoted full-time to shaping a pro-\n     environment Congress and White House.'' Since 1996, a \n     symbol of the political activity of the LCV has been the \n     Dirty Dozen list it publishes each election year. The LCV \n     represents that it has defeated 28 of 49 candidates \n     targeted by its Dirty Dozen campaigns since 1996. Citing \n     two examples from the 2000 election year, the LCV contends \n     on its Web site,\n       ``How much impact can LCV campaigns make on national \n     policy? In 2000, two of the most dangerous anti-\n     environmentalists in the U.S. Senate--Spencer Abraham of \n     Michigan and Slade Gorton of Washington--were defeated by \n     less than 1% following major LCV campaigns. In a Congress \n     closely divided on the environment, these LCV victories can \n     make all the difference.''\n       Senators Abraham of Michigan and Slade Gorton of Washington \n     were both Republicans running for reelection in 2000. In \n     fact, in 1996, the LCV spent a total of $1.5 million dollars \n     sending 254,000 direct mail pieces and airing 9,000 \n     television and radio advertisements attempting to defeat its \n     Dirty Dozen list of eleven Republican congressional \n     candidates and one Democrat congressional candidate.\n       In 1998, the LCV Dirty Dozen list targeted twelve \n     Republican congressional candidates and one Democrat \n     congressional candidate for defeat--spending a total of $2.3 \n     million. The LCV spent in many cases over $200,000 per \n     congressional race--airing television and radio \n     advertisements and sending direct mail pieces. In the Nevada \n     Senate race, LCV aired a total of 661 individual television \n     airings against the Republican candidate. LCV spent up to \n     $420,000 in the Wisconsin Senate race against the Republican \n     candidate.\n       In 2000, the LCV spent a total of $4 million--again \n     targeting eleven Republican congressional candidates and one \n     Democrat congressional candidate on its Dirty Dozen list. The \n     LCV spent up to $444,000 in the Washington Senate race, \n     $520,000 in the Virginia Senate race, and $705,000 in the \n     Michigan Senate race, all in an effort to defeat Republican \n     candidates. However, the LCV also reported spending $52,000 \n     to attempt to defeat Congressman Traficant of Ohio for re-\n     election, the only Democrat on the LCV Dirty Dozen for 2000. \n     Additionally, in May of 2000, the LCV endorsed Al Gore for \n     President.\n       In 2002, the LCV again targeted eleven Republican \n     congressional candidates and one Democrat congressional \n     candidate with television and radio advertisements including \n     a television advertisement in the South Dakota Senate race \n     implying that the Republican candidate's environmental \n     positions were bought by campaign contributions. The LCV sent \n     thousands of direct mail pieces including 100,000 pieces \n     mailed in the Georgia Senate race and 75,000 pieces sent in \n     the New Hampshire Senate race--both against Republican \n     candidates. The LCV also joined other organizations and spent \n     a total of $570,000 against the New Hampshire Republican \n     Senate candidate. However, the strongest effort seems to have \n     been focused on the Colorado Senate contest. The LCV budgeted \n     a total of $700,000 for this race against incumbent \n     Republican Senator Wayne Allard. The LCV hired a campaign \n     staff of twelve against Senator Allard to coordinate phone \n     banks and precinct walks in addition to running television \n     and radio advertisements that LCV claims reached sixty-seven \n     percent of the state. altogether, the LCV is reported to have \n     spent $1,449,951 in independent expenditures during the 2002 \n     election cycle. Of that total amount, LCV spent $1,313,041 \n     benefitting Democrat candidates while only spending $136,910 \n     for Republican candidates.\n       Although the LCV has yet to release its completed Dirty \n     Dozen list for the 2004 campaign year at the time of this \n     report, it has released a Dirty Dozen list of eight \n     Congressional candidates, seven Republicans and one Democrat. \n     For the first time it has included the President and Vice \n     President on its Dirty Dozen list. The LCV has endorsed \n     forty-two candidates in Congressional elections in addition \n     to endorsing Senator John Kerry for President. In fact, the \n     LCV's endorsement of Senator Kerry is the earliest \n     endorsement of a Presidential contender in the thirty-four \n     year history of the LCV. Of the forty-two candidates endorsed \n     by the LCV at the time of this report, thirty-one are \n     Democrat candidates, and ten Republicans are candidates.\n       As in previous election cycles, the LCV is active this year \n     airing political advertisements--already spending $100,000 to \n     elect a Democrat candidate in a Kentucky congressional \n     special election this year. The LCV is also reported to have \n     already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on Senator \n     John Kerry's Presidential campaign including joining with \n     Environment2004, a 527 political organization, purchasing air \n     time in Florida and Washington, D.C. At the time of this \n     report, Environment2004 last reported to have raised over \n     $600,000 in the 2004 election cycle. The LCV's 527 \n     organization last reported to have raised over $3.3 \n     million in the 2004 election cycle.\n       However not all candidates appreciate LCV's help. The \n     senior senator from South Dakota is reported to have \n     specifically written LCV characterizing outside organization \n     advertisements, like those aired by LCV, as ``often too \n     negative, too personal, and lack any real substance.'' He \n     further requested that the LCV not air advertisements in the \n     South Dakota Senate contest this year.\n\n                   Natural Resources Defense Council\n\n       The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) is an IRS \n     registered 501(c)(3) tax exempt organization affiliated with \n     the NRDC Action Fund, a 501(c)(4) organization. The NRDC is \n     also affiliated with the Environmental Accountability Fund, a \n     section 527 political organization. The NRDC's mission \n     statement is to ``safeguard the Earth: its people, its plants \n     and animals and the natural systems on which all life \n     depends;'' additionally, the NRDC describes itself as ``the \n     nation's most effective environmental action organization.\n       Since the beginning of the Bush Administration, the NRDC \n     has compiled a ``Bush Record'' on its Web site characterizing \n     the Bush Administration as, ``in catering to industries that \n     put America's health and natural heritage at risk, threatens \n     to do more\n\n[[Page S10350]]\n\n     damage to our environmental protections than any other in \n     U.S. history.\n       The NRDC has a long history of political activity. As early \n     as 1982, NRDC spent a record $2.5 million with other \n     environmental organizations on congressional and \n     gubernatorial races to ``oust Reagan supporters. The NRDC is \n     also involved in this year's Presidential race joining with \n     LCV and the Sierra Club to work against President Bush in the \n     state of New Mexico which has been characterized as a \n     ``battleground state'' this year. The Albuquerque Journal \n     reports that NRDC has already aired television and radio \n     advertisements against the Bush Administration's \n     environmental record joining the LCV and Sierra Club working \n     to hire their own campaign staffs against the Bush candidacy. \n     The NRDC's Environmental Accountability Fund, a 527 political \n     organization, is sponsoring political advertisements against \n     President Bush throughout New Mexico and other ``battle \n     ground states'' including Florida, Arizona, and Nevada. \n     Overall, at the time of this report, this 527 organization \n     has raised nearly $1 million in the 2004 election cycle.\n       The NRDC 501(c)(3) organization, however, is also \n     nationally politically involved joining earlier this year \n     with Moveon.org, another section 527 political organization, \n     purchasing advertisements in the New York Times accusing the \n     Bush Administration of weakening regulations on drinking \n     water and air quality while soliciting contributions for the \n     NRDC 501(c)(3) affiliate.\n\n                              Sierra Club\n\n       The Sierra Club describes itself as ``America's oldest, \n     largest and most influential grassroots environmental \n     organization.'' With a reported membership of 700,000, the \n     Sierra Club is represented by a 501(c)(4) organization, a \n     section 527 political organization, and the 501(c)(3) Sierra \n     Club Foundation. In a September 27, 2004 article on the \n     interconnectedness of IRS designated 501(c)(3), 501(c)(4), \n     and 527 organizations this election year, the Washington Post \n     featured the Sierra Club as the prime example of this web \n     writing the following:\n       ``Perhaps no one better illustrates the host of \n     interlocking roles than Carl Pope, one of the most \n     influential operatives on the Democratic side in the 2004 \n     election. As executive direct of the Sierra Club, a major \n     501c(4) environmental lobby, Pope also controls the Sierra \n     Club Voter Education Fund, a 527. The Voter Education Fund \n     527 has raised $3.4 million this election cycle, with $2.4 \n     million of that amount coming from the Sierra Club. A third \n     group, the Sierra Club PAC, has since 1980 given $3.9 million \n     to Democratic candidates and $173,602 to GOP candidates.\n       ``These activities just touch the surface of Pope's \n     political involvement. In 2002-03, Pope helped found two \n     major 527 groups: America Votes, which was raised $1.9 \n     million to coordinate the election activities of 32 liberal \n     groups, and America Coming Together (ACT), which has a goal \n     of raising more than $100 million to mobilize voters to cast \n     ballots against Bush. Finally, Pope is treasurer of a new \n     501c(3) foundation, America's Families United, which \n     reportedly has $15 million to distribute to voter \n     mobilization groups.\n       `` `I am in this as deeply as I am,' Pope said, `because I \n     think this country is in real peril.' ''\n       The Sierra Club is consistently critical of the Bush \n     Administration and it compiles a ``Sierra Club RAW \n     newsletter'' featuring ``The Uncooked Facts of the Bush \n     Assault on the Environment'' with regular criticisms of the \n     Bush Administration evironmental record and sometimes \n     expanding its criticisms to other officials as well. For \n     instance in its June 23, 2004 edition, the Sierra Club \n     accused Senator Inhofe of attempting to raise ``levels of \n     mercury pollution'' claiming the following: ``But wait--\n     there's more. The Bush administration's weak air proposals \n     were not weak enough, it seems, for Senator James Inhofe, the \n     chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. \n     Inhofe tried to raise the `acceptable' levels of mercury \n     pollution. . . .''\n       Like NRDC's ``Bush Record,'' the Sierra Club has its own \n     ``W Watch'' where it features articles critical of the Bush \n     Administration on environmental issues to judicial \n     nominations. Sierra Club affiliated organizations such as \n     Earthjustice, which began as the Sierra Club Legal Defense \n     Fund, is also highly critical of the Bush Administration and \n     is regularly engaged in legal actions against the federal \n     government. In fact, in its most recent IRS filings, \n     Earthjustice describes eighty-six legal actions on a variety \n     of environmental related issues. Earthjustice also publishes \n     its own political information. It issued its ``Paybacks'' \n     report shortly before the 2002 elections that made such \n     explicit claims as, ``the Bush Administration is weakening \n     environmental laws in particular to help those industries \n     that paid to put it in office.''\n       Like other environmental groups, the Sierra Club has a \n     history of involvement in political campaigns. In the 2000 \n     Presidential contest, the Sierra Club spent several hundred \n     thousand dollars in advertisements attacking Candidate George \n     W. Bush's campaign throughout the country including what is \n     reported as the largest expenditure of a third party on \n     Spanish language advertisements. In the 2002 election cycle, \n     the Sierra Club is reported to have spent $265,772 in \n     independent expenditures all for Democratic candidates and \n     making no independent expenditures for Republican candidates. \n     Additionally, in the 2002 Senate races, the Sierra Club \n     endorsed nineteen Democrat incumbents and challengers and \n     endorsed no Republican candidates. In the 2002 races for the \n     U.S. House of Representatives, the Sierra Club endorsed one \n     hundred sixty-five Democrat incumbents and challengers and \n     endorsed ten Republican candidates.\n       Like previous election years, the Sierra Club is heavily \n     involved in the 2004 political cycle. The Sierra Club began \n     spending early in the 2004 Presidential contest and is \n     reported to have spent at least $350,000 as early as late \n     2003 in advertisements against President Bush throughout the \n     country including in New Hampshire, Michigan, Wisconsin, \n     Pennsylvania, Florida, Nevada, and Nebraska. The Sierra Club \n     has made a series of endorsements in this year's political \n     contests, and like LCV, the Sierra Club has endorsed Senator \n     John Kerry for President. In Senate races, the Sierra Club \n     has endorsed sixteen Democrat Senate incumbents and \n     challengers and no Republican candidates. In races for the \n     U.S. House of Representatives, the Sierra Club has endorsed \n     one hundred fourteen Democrat incumbents and challengers \n     and has endorsed seven Republican candidates. At the time \n     of this report, the Sierra Club's 527 political \n     organization claims to have raised over $6.8 million for \n     the 2004 election cycle alone.\n\n                               Greenpeace\n\n       Greenpeace USA describes itself as ``the leading \n     independent campaigning organization that uses non-violent \n     direct action and creative communication to expose global \n     environmental problems and to promote solutions that are \n     essential to a green and peaceful future.'' It claims 250,000 \n     members in the United States and 2.5 million members around \n     the world. Greenpeace USA is represented by Greenpeace, Inc., \n     a section 501(c)(4) organization and the Greenpeace Fund \n     Inc., a section 501(c)(3) organization.\n       Greenpeace USA and its affiliate organizations through \n     Greenpeace International have received attention for many \n     years more through demonstrations than through political \n     endorsements. Press reports that have described some of \n     Greenpeace USA's demonstrations have included activists \n     rapelling down skyscrapers, occupying abandoned oil rigs, \n     intervening in whale hunts with inflatable rafts, and \n     illegally boarding ships while at sea, among other \n     demonstrations that often result in arrests and criminal \n     convictions for Greenpeace activists. In fact, on Earth Day \n     2001, Greenpeace USA founder John Passacantado was arrested \n     with the founder of the Rainforest Action Network for locking \n     themselves to a gate during a protest blockading the entrance \n     to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n       Although, Greenpeace may be better known for its \n     demonstrations, its political views may be clear as it has \n     characterized President Bush as the ``toxic Texan,'' and hung \n     a banner from a water tower near the President's ranch in \n     Texas that read the same. Greenpeace has devoted much of its \n     Web site toward criticism of the Bush Administration equating \n     the Administration's environmental and conservation policies \n     to the ``Texas chainsaw massacre.''\n\n                         Environmental Defense\n\n       Environmental Defense describes itself as ``fighting to \n     protect human health, restore the oceans and ecosystems, and \n     curb global warming.'' Environmental Defense is represented \n     by two organizations: Environmental Defense, Inc., a \n     501(c)(3) organization and the Environmental Defense Action \n     Fund, Inc., a 501(c)(4) organization.\n       Environmental Defense represents its work in a number of \n     issue campaigns for instance, increased air regulations, \n     increased regulation of ocean industries, strengthening \n     Endangered Species Act and adding additional listings, and \n     reversing global warming. Environmental Defense is involved \n     with various other environmental organizations such as the \n     Sierra Club on many other ``campaigns'' as well. All \n     ``campaigns'' are featured on its Web site or its \n     Action!Network Web site.\n       Environmental Defense is regularly associated with other \n     politically involved environmental organizations as well such \n     as NRDC, Greenpeace, and LCV, among others, and its board of \n     directors not only includes the wife of the Democratic \n     Presidential nominee but also includes former Clinton \n     Administration officials involved in their own environmental \n     organizations regularly critical of the Bush Administration.\n\n\n                              foundations\n\n       The following are three of the foundations that regularly \n     contribute to the five environmental organizations referenced \n     in this report, among others.\n\n                         Pew Charitable Trusts\n\n       The Pew Charitable Trusts (Pew) are comprised of seven \n     separate trusts and reports it is an ``independent non-\n     profit'' serving to ``inform the public on key issues and \n     trends, as a highly credible source of independent, non-\n     partisan research and polling information and that its \n     environmental priorities include global warming, protecting \n     ocean life, and wilderness protection.'' In two of those \n     priorities in particular, global warming and wilderness \n     protection, Pew has joined and supported other \n     organizations and campaigns.\n       In 1998, Pew created the Pew Center on Global Climate \n     Change. The Pew Center reports, ``the growing scientific \n     consensus is that this warming is largely the result of \n     emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from \n     human activities including industrial processes, fossil fuel \n     combustion,\n\n[[Page S10351]]\n\n     and changes in land use, such as deforestation.'' Pew also \n     sponsors the work of the Clear the air Campaign with a $3.4 \n     million grant in 1999, $4.3 million grant in 2000, nearly $5 \n     million grant in 2001, and $4.7 million grant in 2003 with \n     which it published its Dirty Air, Dirty Power report in June \n     2004 claiming, on the first page of the publication, that \n     coal burning power plants ``make people sick and shorten the \n     lives of thousands each year'' and further claiming that \n     ``President Bush has allowed polluters to re-write clean air \n     rules.''\n       Concerning wilderness protection, Pew endorses the Heritage \n     Forests Campaign also highly critical of the Bush \n     Administration conservation policies, and, joining with the \n     Natural Resources Defense Council, Environmental Defense, the \n     Sierra Club, characterize the President's conservation \n     policies as ``Crazy George's National Forest Give-a-way, \n     Every Tree Must Go.''\n       Since 1998, Pew has contributed several million dollars to \n     various environmental organizations. These contributions have \n     included nearly $18 million to Earthjustice, over $3 million \n     to NRDC, and over $3.7 million to Environmental Defense. Pew \n     has also contributed $32.6 million to the Tides Center and \n     foundation over the same period. The Tides organization has \n     contributed over $1.4 million to the Sierra Club and \n     affiliates, Greenpeace and affiliates, the NRDC, and the \n     Environmental Working Group since 1998.\n\n                           Turner Foundation\n\n       The Turner Foundation describes itself as ``a private, \n     independent family foundation committed to preventing damage \n     to the natural systems--water, air, and land--on which all \n     life depends.'' It was founded in 1990 by Ted Turner who is \n     Chairman of the Foundation Board of Trustees. The Turner \n     Foundation makes grants ``in the areas of the environment and \n     population.'' The Foundation is especially involved in the \n     issues of global warming and overpopulation, and supports the \n     work of its ``special projects'' which include the \n     Partnership Project which is comprised of twenty national \n     environmental groups. The Turner Foundation's other special \n     projects include the League of Conservation Voters Education \n     Fund, the NARAL Foundation, and Planned Parenthood Federation \n     of America.\n       Since 1998, the Turner Foundation has contributed over $6.4 \n     million to the Partnership Project that is comprised of the \n     League of Conservation Voters, Sierra Club, Earthjustice, \n     Environmental Defense, Natural Resources Defense council, and \n     Greenpeace among others. Individually, the Turner Foundation \n     has contributed more than $20 million to the LCV since 1998, \n     over $2.6 million to the NRDC, over $1 million to the Sierra \n     Club, nearly $2 million to the National Wildlife Federation, \n     and nearly $2 million to Environmental Defense, Earthjustice, \n     Greenpeace, and the Environmental Working Group.\n\n                           Heinz foundations\n\n       The Heinz foundations are comprised of several different \n     foundations, some established for specific purposes. Of the \n     Heinz family affiliated foundations, the largest contributors \n     to environmental organizations are the Howard Heinz \n     Endowment, Vira I. Heinz Endowment, and Heinz Family \n     Foundation.\n       Ms. Teresa Heinz Kerry is either chairperson of the board \n     of trustees or member of the board of trustees on each \n     foundation. Ms. Heinz Kerry is the head of the $1.2 billion \n     Heinz Foundation endowment. Since 1998, these foundations \n     have contributed nearly $3 million to Environmental Defense, \n     the Sierra Club, the LCV, and the NRDC. Each foundation is \n     also a large contributor to the Tides Center and Tides \n     Foundation and affiliates contributing over $6 million since \n     1998. The Tides organization has in turn also contributed \n     over $1.4 million to the Sierra Club and affiliates, \n     Greenpeace and affiliates, the NRDC, and the Environment \n     Working Group over that same period.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       This report does not represent the totality of \n     environmental groups engaged in political activity in this \n     election year or prior election years. It does not even \n     represent all the actions taken by the environmental groups \n     that are highlighted in this report each election year. \n     However, this report provides examples of some of the actions \n     taken by these groups and clearly questions any claims these \n     groups make concerning being ``non-partisan.'' These group \n     shave clearly established a record of partisanship and \n     clearly demonstrated each election cycle that they simply \n     have an agenda to work together against Republican candidates \n     and work to elect Democrat candidates. Additionally, these \n     groups are, in large part, annually financed by foundations \n     consistently supporting those groups' partisan efforts and in \n     some cases directly involved in partisan criticisms of the \n     Bush Administration. Moreover, these groups' activities \n     demonstrate the concern expressed in the Washington Post \n     article regarding political money this election year--money \n     ``slithering through on other routes as organizations \n     maintain various accounts, tripping over each other, shifting \n     money between 501(c)(3)'s, (c)(4)'s, and 527's.''\n       Today's environmental groups are simply political machines \n     reporting millions in contributions and expenditures each \n     year for the purpose of raising more money to pursue their \n     agenda. Especially in this election year, the American voter \n     should see these groups and their many affiliate \n     organizations as they are--the newest insidious conspiracy of \n     political action committees and perhaps the newest multi-\n     million dollar manipulation of federal election laws.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, I thank the managers of the intelligence \nreform bill, S. 2845, for accepting an amendment offered by myself and \nSenator Coleman on the issue of terrorist financing. This amendment, \namendment No. 3867, was developed in coordination with Senators Collins \nand Lieberman of the Governmental Affairs Committee and Senators Shelby \nand Sarbanes of the Banking Committee. I thank each of my colleagues \nfor their guidance and assistance which has enabled us to fashion a \ngood amendment with bipartisan support and offer it to the bill today.\n  This amendment is the result of an extensive investigation by the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations, initiated at my request, into \nmoney laundering allegations involving Riggs Bank, a nationally \nchartered bank located right here in the Nation's Capital. Our \ninvestigation found a bank which routinely allowed highly questionable \ntransactions with few questions asked. Some of these transactions \ninvolved millions of dollars in cash or suspicious wire transfers; \nothers have raised serious concerns about possible terrorist financing.\n  We live in a post-9/11 world. After the attack on America, we \nstrengthened our antimoney laundering laws, in part, because Osama bin \nLaden boasted that his modern new recruits knew the ``cracks'' in \n``Western financial systems'' like they knew the ``lines in their \nhands.'' That chilling statement helped fuel a new effort to strengthen \nour defenses against terrorists, corrupt dictators, and others who \nwould use our financial systems against us. Part of that effort was \nCongress' enactment of the PATRIOT Act which, in title III, \nstrengthened U.S. laws to stop money laundering, foreign corruption, \nand terrorist financing.\n  Even before the PATRIOT Act, we had laws and regulations to stop \nmoney laundering. In fact, since 1987, the Office of the Comptroller of \nthe\n\n[[Page S10356]]\n\nCurrency, OCC, has required nationally chartered banks to establish \nanti-money laundering programs to ensure the banking system is not \nmisused by criminals. The PATRIOT Act was intended to build on that \nexisting foundation to further strengthen our defenses against money \nlaunderers.\n  Our investigation found that Riggs Bank ignored its antimoney \nlaundering obligations before the PATRIOT Act, and continued to ignore \nthem afterward. We found that the bank didn't get serious in part \nbecause, in the past, when bank regulators pointed out problems with \nRiggs' antimoney laundering controls, if the bank promised to do \nbetter, the regulators let it go. The regulators tolerated the bank's \nweak antimoney laundering program, continued to accept excuses when \ndeficiencies were not corrected, and continued to hold off on tough \nenforcement measures.\n  We were particularly surprised to learn that the OCC examiner-in-\ncharge who oversaw Riggs Bank for 4 years, from 1998 to 2002, appeared \nto function at times as more of an advocate for the bank than an arms-\nlength regulator. The investigation found, for example, that in 2001, \nthe examiner-in-charge advised more senior OCC personnel against taking \na formal enforcement action against Riggs for its lax antimoney \nlaundering program, because the bank had promised to do better. In \n2002, after subordinate examiners had uncovered troubling transactions \nand bank accounts involving Augusto Pinochet, the former President of \nChile, and actions by Riggs to hide those accounts from the OCC for 2 \nyears, the examiner-in-charge ordered the examination materials not to \nbe included in the OCC's electronic database, even though such \nmaterials are normally placed in that database. The examination \nmaterials were instead saved in paper form, making it much more \ndifficult for subsequent examiners to learn about the Pinochet \nexamination. About a month after giving this order, that same Examiner-\nin-Charge was offered a job at Riggs. He later retired from the OCC and \n3 days after retiring, took a senior position with Riggs.\n  These actions--advising against a formal enforcement action, \nsuppressing the Pinochet examination materials, and accepting a job \noffer at the bank he regulated, among others--raise serious conflict of \ninterest concerns. Federal bank examiners are our first line of defense \nagainst money laundering and terrorist financing at U.S. banks, and we \ncan't allow their independence to be undermined by the lure of a job at \nthe banks they oversee.\n  The 9/11 Commission report notes the important role that stopping \nterrorist financing plays in our counterterrorism efforts. It \nexplicitly recommends that U.S. antiterrorist financing programs remain \n``front and center in U.S. counterterrorism efforts.'' Subcommittee \nhearings and a report released by my staff in July of this year support \nthat recommendation and offer a detailed legislative record \ndemonstrating the need for new measures to further strengthen federal \noversight of the antimoney laundering programs at our financial \ninstitutions.\n  The Levin-Coleman amendment would strengthen U.S. anti-terrorist \nfinancing efforts in two ways. First, it would require the President, \nthrough the Treasury Secretary, to take a hard look at the current \nstate of U.S. efforts to combat terrorist financing and issue a report \nin 6 months with recommendations for reforms. One of the most important \nissues to be addressed is improving our process for setting priorities \nand coordinating U.S. agency efforts to detect, track, disrupt, and \nstop terrorist financing. It is far from clear today, when it comes to \ncombating terrorist financing, what U.S. agency official, if any, has \nprimary responsibility for developing priorities, assigning tasks to \nagencies, and monitoring the implementation of policy and operations.\n  Secondly, the amendment would impose a 1-year cooling off period \nbefore a senior Federal examiner may take a job with a financial \ninstitution that he or she was responsible for overseeing. This cooling \noff period is similar to one already in place for Federal procurement \nofficials under 41 U.S. 423(d). Members of Congress, Congressional \nstaff, and many other Federal employees already operate under cooling \noff periods, which have been in place for years and have had a \nbeneficial effect. Our amendment would apply a new cooling off period \nto senior federal bank examiners like the OCC examiner who oversaw \nRiggs.\n  John D. Hawke, Jr., U.S. Comptroller of the Currency and head of the \nOCC, which served as the primary regulator of Riggs, has expressed \nstrong support for legislation imposing a 1-year cooling off period for \nsenior Federal examiners, stating in a memorandum to OCC staff that \n``when an OCC examiner, with no break in continuity, takes employment \nwith a bank he or she has been supervising, there are inevitably \nquestions that will be asked and suspicions raised.'' He apparently \nwanted to impose a cooling off period on OCC examiners 4 years ago but \nwas advised that he lacked the statutory authority to do so. The report \nreleased by my subcommittee staff in July also recommends enacting a 1-\nyear cooling off period for bank examiners. Similar legislation, \nintroduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-\nIll., and Rep. Sue Kelly, R-NY, was recently approved by the House \nFinancial Services Committee for inclusion in the House intelligence \nreform bill.\n\n  The Levin-Coleman amendment would close the revolving door and \neliminate potential and actual conflicts of interest for our federal \nexaminers. It would also provide a fresh look at our country's \nantiterrorist financing efforts. I thank my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle for supporting this amendment.\n  A brief section-by-section explanation of the amendment follows.\n  Subsection (a) directs the Treasury Department to prepare a report \nwithin 6 months evaluating the current state of U.S. efforts to curtail \nthe international financing of terrorism. The report is required to \naddress the effectiveness and efficiency of current Federal programs to \ndetect, track, disrupt, and stop terrorist financing; the relationship \nbetween terrorist financing and money laundering; the nature, \neffectiveness and efficiency of current efforts to coordinate \nintelligence and agency operations related to terrorist financing, \nincluding identifying which agency official, if any, has primary \nresponsibility to develop priorities, assign tasks to agencies and \nmonitor the implementation of policy and operations related to \nterrorism; the effectiveness and efficiency of efforts to protect the \ncritical infrastructure of the U.S. financial system; ways to improve \nthe effectiveness of financial institutions; ways to improve \nmultilateral and international governmental cooperation on terrorist \nfinancing; and recommendations for reforms.\n  Subsection (b) imposes a 1-year cooling off period on senior \nexaminers at the OCC, Federal Reserve Banks, Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation, Office of Thrift Supervision, and National Credit Union \nAdministration before a senior examiner can take a job at a financial \ninstitution that he or she oversaw. The subsection does so by \nestablishing a new subsection (k) in the statutes applicable to these \nagencies.\n  The new subsection (k) contains language that was drawn from two sets \nof postemployment provisions now in the federal code, the provisions in \nsection 207 of title 18 applicable to a variety of senior federal \nemployees and the provisions in section 423(d) of title 41 applicable \nto senior Federal procurement officials. For example, the new \nsubsection (k) draws on the ``knowing'' standard used in the section \n207 provisions, and the ``compensation'' language that appears in \nsection 423(d).\n  The new subsection (k) is intended to apply only to senior examiners \nwho have a meaningful relationship with a financial institution, such \nas an examiner-in-charge or a senior examiner with dedicated \nresponsibility to oversee a particular institution. It is not intended \nto apply to less senior examiners who may examine or inspect dozens of \nfinancial institutions in a single year without developing a sustained \nrelationship with any one institution. It is also not intended to apply \nto persons holding supervisory positions that do not involve routine \ninteractions with an institution for purposes of examining or \ninspecting the institution's books or operations. The provision may \napply to more than one senior examiner at the same financial \ninstitution, and is not limited to examiners with an\n\n[[Page S10357]]\n\noffice at the site of the financial institution or to examiners who \nspend 100 percent of their time on a single institution.\n  Each Federal banking agency is directed to issue rules, regulations, \nand guidance to delineate the personnel to which this postemployment \nrestriction applies. Each agency head also has authority, on a case-by-\ncase basis, to waive the postemployment restriction for a particular \nindividual if the waiver would not hurt the integrity of the agency's \nsupervisory program. It is intended that the agency head issue these \nwaivers personally, without delegating the waiver authority to another \nofficial, to ensure careful usage.\n  The new subsection (k) authorizes two types of penalties for senior \nexaminers who violate the 1-year cooling off period. These two \npenalties are in addition to any other administrative, civil, or \ncriminal remedy or penalty that may be available to the United States \nor any other person for the same conduct. The first penalty is an \nindustry-wide employment ban which requires the relevant agency to \nremove the affected individual from the financial institution and \nprohibit them from employment at any insured financial institution for \nup to 5 years. The second penalty authorizes the agency to impose a \ncivil monetary fine on the individual of up to $250,000. This fine \nwould have to be imposed either in a Federal court proceeding or in an \nadministrative proceeding that accords with the agency's administrative \nrules for imposing civil monetary penalties. The provision also \nauthorizes the Attorney General to impose a civil monetary penalty if \nan agency does not, but prohibits both from doing so.\n  The requirement for a 1-year cooling off period is intended to become \neffective one year after the date of the enactment of this act, whether \nor not any agency issues implementing regulations to carry out the \nact's requirements.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, first of all, I thank Chairman Collins \nand ranking Member Senator Lieberman, for their diligence and hard work \non the National Intelligence Reform bill. I would like to say a few \nwords on the Levin-Coleman amendment on terrorist financing. Without \nquestion, financial institutions are vital to our economy. \nUnfortunately, banks can also be used as conduits for terrorist \nfinancing and money laundering.\n  In July, 2004, as chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, I held a hearing on suspicious financial activity in \naccounts handled by Riggs Bank. The subcommittee uncovered clear \nevidence of poor bank compliance and lax oversight regarding Federal \nlaws, designed to protect the integrity of the international financial \nsystem.\n  Chairman Collins is currently looking at certain Saudi Arabian \naccounts that may have benefited two of the September 11, 2001 \nhijackers. I commend her diligence in expanding our investigation and \nlook forward to the results of her investigation.\n  Equally disturbing, PSI's investigation demonstrated that Federal \nbanking regulators took far too long to implement proper controls and \nprocedures to identify, monitor, and combat money laundering, \nsuspicious activity, and terrorist financing. In particular, I was \ntroubled by the actions of a former senior bank examiner of Riggs Bank \nwho began to work for Riggs Bank immediately after retiring from the \nOffice of Comptroller of the Currency. Prior to leaving Riggs Bank, \nthis examiner apparently limited findings of accounts owned by Augusto \nPinochet contrary to established policies. Upon taking employment at \nRiggs Bank, this former examiner attended numerous meetings with bank \nregulators such that the potential for undue influence was less than to \nbe desired.\n  Certain provisions of this legislation will close the revolving door \nbetween senior examiners and the financial institutions they examine, \nby requiring a cooling off period of 1 year before taking employment at \nthe financial institutions they previously regulated.\n  In a post-9/11 world, we need to ensure that financial institutions \nand Federal banking regulators uphold Federal banking statutes, \nincluding the Bank Secrecy Act and the Patriot Act. This legislation \nwill maintain the separation between Federal banking regulators and \nfinancial institutions. Given our concern for terrorist financing, and \nour heavy reliance on the integrity of the financial system, reducing \nthe potential of harm is necessary because the stakes are too high if \nproblems go uncorrected. I hope my colleagues will all join me in \nsupport of this amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, on the morning of September 14, 2001, I \ntoured the Pentagon with officials from the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency, FEMA. I was so impressed, that on the morning of \nSeptember 11, in the hours following an unspeakable tragedy, first \nresponders and rescue workers from different departments were able to \nwork as one great team to extinguish the fires, to help the injured, \nand to save lives. This first impression only tells half of the real \nstory. In actuality, the bravery and selflessness of the firefighters, \nemergency medical technicians, and police officers were hindered by a \nlack of interoperability between their communications systems. I spoke \nwith workers at the Pentagon who experienced this limitation firsthand. \nIt's inconceivable to me that members of fire departments and emergency \nagencies from Fairfax and Arlington Counties, the District of Columbia, \nand Montgomery County were held back because of equipment \nincompatibility.\n  The lack of adequate communications equipment was not only an \nunnecessary impediment to response operations in and among units on \nduty across the Potomac at the Pentagon, but has also been an obstacle \nto other emergencies. In March 2002, I chaired an Environment and \nPublic Works Committee hearing to address the budget needs of FEMA. At \nthe hearing, then-Director Joe Allbaugh testified that:\n\n       This problem of limited interoperability is especially \n     frustrating in the area of communications. While at Ground \n     Zero for several days, I personally witnessed first \n     responders passing notes, handwritten notes, back and forth \n     to one another as the most reliable, effective means of \n     communication. On September 11 and in other emergency \n     situations, seamless communication interoperability would \n     have saved lives.\n\n  Today, more than 3 years after the attacks of September 11, the \nSenate is still debating the issues of interoperability and sufficient \ncommunications capabilities.\n  Interoperability is not only an issue during times of extreme \nnational distress, whether brought on by a terrorist attack or a \nnatural disaster. On August 19, 1997, residents and police officers \nfrom northern Vermont and New Hampshire were faced with tragedy when \nCarl Draga began a shooting spree, killing four and wounding three \nothers, before being killed in an standoff with police. Throughout that \nsad day, officers from the Vermont and New Hampshire State Police and a \nNew Hampshire Fish and Game warden chased Draga across the Connecticut \nRiver from New Hampshire to Vermont and back again to New Hampshire. \nCompounding the difficulty of pursuing a fugitive across State lines, \nwas the lack of interoperability between the departments. \nCommunications were hampered by the technical limitations of the radios \nand other equipment.\n  Last week, the Senate unanimously adopted amendments that will \nprovide for a higher priority for public safety in terms of Spectrum \nallocation. My amendment will further address the needs of first \nresponders. My amendment will establish National Interoperability \nStandards and a National Interoperability Implementation Plan to put \nthose standards into place. Specifically, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, DHS, will, no later than 1 year after the enactment of this \nbill, adopt interoperability goals and standards to fully assess and \nevaluate the technical needs of first responders for more routine \noperations and for catastrophic events like those we suffered on \nSeptember 11, 2001. After those goals and standards are developed, the \nDHS will create an implementation plan, and will report to the Congress \non its plan and its progress. This will ensure that as the Federal \nGovernment, States, and localities spend money on interoperability, we \nwill all be working in the same direction, toward one set of goals, \nwith measurable results.\n  My amendment also requires that the DHS establish a means of \ncoordinating international interoperability. For States like Vermont, \nwhich share an international borer, it is imperative\n\n[[Page S10358]]\n\nthat first responders in both nations communicate with each other.\n  We must be prepared for the future, and we must give our first \nresponders the tools they need to perform their duties.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor United States \nArmy 1LT Tyler Hall Brown, who was killed proudly fighting for his \ncountry in Iraq on September 14, 2004. An Airborne Ranger and ROTC \ngraduate from Atlanta, GA, Tyler was 26 years old.\n  Tyler was born on May 27, 1978, in Atlanta. He attended Woodward \nAcademy and was senior class president, where his classmates considered \nhim a ``politician in the making.''\n  Tyler Brown then attended the Georgia Institute of Technology where \nhe was student body president of the Class of 2001 and a cadet in the \nArmy ROTC program. Tyler graduated with dual bachelor of science \ndegrees in management and in history, society and technology. After \nbeing commissioned as an Army Officer, he was assigned to the 2nd \nInfantry Division--Camp Hovey, in Tongduchon City, Korea. From Korea, \nhe deployed to Iraq early last month with his unit, C Company, 1st \nBattalion, 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division. He was killed \nby small arms fire when his unit was attacked by insurgents in the \nIraqi town of Ar Ramadi, Iraq, 70 miles west of Baghdad.\n  Lieutenant Brown was slain by a sniper as he led a reconnaissance \npatrol in an Iraqi town infested with insurgents. Mortally wounded by \nthe sniper's shot, Lieutenant Brown was able to give a warning to his \nmen, which prevented any others from being hit. Though he was wearing \nupper body armor, he was hit in the upper thigh where a tourniquet \ncould not stop the bleeding.\n\n  His unit had deployed from Korea in early September and had been in \nIraq only two weeks when Tyler was killed.\n  Tyler's company commander, CPT Daniel Gade, made the following \ncomments: ``Tyler was the finest officer I've ever known . . . he loved \nhis men, and they loved him in return.''\n  It is certainly ironic that Lieutenant Brown had been approved for \nservice in the Army's famous 3rd Infantry Regiment, known as the Old \nGuard, which guards the Tomb of the Unknowns and serves as escorts at \nmilitary burials at Arlington Cemetery. Instead, Brown chose to go to \nIraq with men from his battalion in South Korea. On September 28, at \nArlington Cemetery, the Old Guard that he was to join honored Tyler \nBrown at his gravesite.\n  Tyler Brown was a great American, a great soldier, a great leader, \nand an outstanding young man. He and his comrades in Iraq deserve our \ndeepest gratitude and respect as they go about the extraordinarily \nchallenging, important job of rebuilding a country, which will result \nin freedom and prosperity for million of Iraqis. I join with Tyler's \nfamily, friends, and fellow soldiers in mourning his loss and want them \nto know that Tyler's sacrifice will not be lost or forgotten, but will \ntruly make a difference in the lives of the Iraqi people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/04/senate-section/article/S10358-3", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HE SAPA WACIPI\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to let my Senate \ncolleagues know about a wonderful event going on back in my home state \nof South Dakota later this week. For 3 days starting on Friday, October \n8, the 18th Annual He Sapa Wacipi (Black Hills Powwow) and Fine Arts \nShow will be taking place in the beautiful Black Hills, traditional \nhomeland of the Oceti Sakowin Oyate, or Great Sioux Nation. I can think \nof no better way, or place, to celebrate life and the vibrant cultures \nof the bands of the Oceti Sakowin Oyate, and of the many other tribal \nnations who live throughout the Great Plains.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to congratulate the tribal \ncitizens of the Oceti Sakowin Oyate, the board of directors of the \nBlack Hills Powwow Association, the organizers and event staff, and the \nall those participating in the Wacipi.\n  In Washington on September 21, 2004, we celebrated the opening of the \nNational Museum of the American Indian. The events associated with the \nmuseum's dedication marked the first time in history that so many \npeople from throughout the Western Hemisphere have gathered to \ncelebrate a museum dedicated solely to their historic contributions to \nhumankind, their many struggles for survival, and their present-day \naccomplishments and life-ways. Featured prominently in the museum and \naccompanying celebrations were the tribal nations of the Great Plains.\n  The opening week of the museum was also historic because the Senate \nCommittee on Indian Affairs held an oversight hearing on the \ncontributions of Native American code talkers in World War I, the \nKorean War, and World War II. There have been code talkers from at \nleast 17 tribes, the Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota among them. As a \ncosponsor of legislation that would honor all Native American code \ntalkers, I was especially proud to have met and visited with Clarence \nWolf Guts, of the Oglala Lakota Nation, the last surviving Lakota code \ntalker. I had the honor of presenting Clarence with a framed copy of a \nrecent Senate floor speech I delivered that was submitted to the \nCongressional Record in Lakota, marking the first time a Native \nAmerican language has been memorialized in the Record.\n  Like the National Museum of the American Indian, and the legacy of \nthe code talkers, the He Sapa Wacipi is a living testament to the \ntribal nations of the Great Plains. It brings people from across North \nAmerica, young and old, Indian and non-Indian, together to celebrate \nlife through song and dance. It is a chance for old friends to see one \nanother, and for new ones to be made. The art show gives Native \nAmerican artists the opportunity to showcase their talent, and there \nare various other activities, including traditional hand-game \ntournaments, contemporary Native American music concerts, and \nactivities targeted to the youth. It is more than just a dance; it is a \nmodern expression of the traditional values of respect, honor, devotion \nto family, and patriotism that so many of our tribal nations have \nembodied throughout history.\n  For my part, I am sorry that my schedule keeps me from attending such \na wonderful event. But I am proud to officially acknowledge and honor \nall those participating in the He Sapa Wacipi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/04/senate-section/article/S10358-4", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10358-S10359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. BEVERLY KEEPERS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nspecial and valued educator in my hometown of Louisville, KY, Dr. \nBeverly Keepers. Dr. Keepers has devoted her time and energy for the \npast 34 years to the educational growth of the Commonwealth's youth.\n  Dr. Keepers is a native of Shively, KY where she attended McFerren \nElementary and graduated from Western High school. Following high \nschool, she entered Western Kentucky University and earned a Bachelor \nof Arts Degree in English with minors in theatre arts and education. \nWith her degree in hand, she started her career at Butler High School \nteaching English, theater, journalism, and photography.\n  Dr. Keepers' many talents in the classroom were recognized and in \n1988 she accepted the assistant principal position at Southern High \nSchool. One year later she became the principal at the Youth Performing \nArts School, YPAS, in Louisville. While this position was challenging \nin and of itself, Dr. Keepers was offered a second principalship at \nLouisville's duPont Manual High School. She accepted the offer and \nbecame the first woman in higher administration in Manual's history. In \nthe fall of 1991, she began her dual roles as principal at two \ndifferent schools, and hit the ground running.\n\n[[Page S10359]]\n\n  During her years at Manual and YPAS, Dr. Keepers has earned the \nrespect of students and teachers alike. She has made the campuses \nsafer, kept the schools up to date with the latest technologies, strove \nto make student's voices heard, and worked hard to continue the long \nstanding tradition of excellence at Manual High School and YPAS.\n  If all this work were not enough, Dr. Keepers was recently a student \nherself. She went back to school in 2000 and completed her doctorate in \neducational leadership and organizational development at my alma mater, \nthe University of Louisville, where she was named to the dean's list \nand was recognized with an Outstanding Student award.\n  Dr. Keepers' hectic schedule does not end when the school bell rings \neither. While she has shown tireless dedication by working 70-hour \nweeks, she remains devoted to her family: husband Jerry, and their two \ndaughters, Tiffany and Lauren.\n  While most would say her contributions to the Louisville community \nare more than enough, she is quite active outside of school. She serves \nas a board member of the Kentucky Derby Festival and Kosair Children's \nHospital and has participated in Leadership Louisville and the Bingham \nFellows.\n  Today I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring and recognizing Dr. \nBeverly Keepers as a truly remarkable member of the Louisville \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/04/senate-section/article/S10359-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On May 19, 2002, in Wise, VA, Joseph Armstrong murdered his cellmate, \nKenneth Boothe Jr., at Red Onion State Prison. During the trial, \nprosecutors contended Armstrong killed Boothe because he hated gays and \nblacks and thought Boothe was gay.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/04/senate-section/article/S10359-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10359-S10361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MINNESOTA'S FAVORITE TEACHERS\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, Recently I invited Minnesotans to honor \ntheir favorite teachers. The response was overwhelming.\n  Over 4,000 Minnesotans nominated their favorite teachers. Many \nteachers were nominated more than once. Current students nominated \npresent teachers. Older Minnesotans nominated teachers from years, even \ndecades, ago.\n  Many of the honored teachers are still actively teaching; others are \nnow retired; some have passed away. I wish there was time here and \nspace in the Congressional Record to read all of the words of \nadmiration and gratitude, which accompanied those 4,000 nominations.\n  They were truly heartwarming. Very successful adults credited special \nteachers with turning their lives around; helping them to recognize \ntheir undiscovered talents, or sparking interests which led to their \nsuccessful careers.\n  The specific details varied but the conclusions were the same. Those \nteachers made huge differences in the lives of their students. They \nsaved lives. They made lives. They taught more than their subjects. \nThey taught ways of thinking, ways of being. They taught study skills \nand the value of hard work. They helped boys and girls; young women and \nyoung men to find themselves, to believe in themselves, and to better \nthemselves. They helped young dreamers learn how to live out those \ndreams and how to make them life-enhancing realities.\n  We do too little to credit and honor the many teachers--dedicated men \nand women--who perform these human miracles for our children. They are \nmodestly paid at best, underpaid at worst, although most of them do not \nteach for monetary rewards. They teach for their love of teaching, for \nthe joys of performing their magical awakening of young minds to new \npossibilities. They take personal satisfaction in their own knowledge \nof their successes, even when they are seldom recognized and \nappreciated by the rest of us. It may be only years later that someone \nthinks to note their incredible contributions. Now is one those \nmoments.\n  Sadly, in Minnesota, there is mostly bashing and trashing of public \nschool teachers and public schools. They are paid $2,500 less than the \nnational averages for public school K-12 teachers. Their class sizes \nare larger than the national average. State support for public school \nstudents is declining, both in real dollars and relative to other \nstates. They are asked to do more and more, with less and less.\n  The least we can do is to say thank you, when they do their jobs \nwell. I encourage my fellow Minnesotans to thank a teacher this week or \nthis month, and next week or next month. Either a present or former \nteacher. For a special job, well done. They deserve it. They have \nearned it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that names of teachers nominated by \nMinnesotans as their favorite teachers be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       ABE Program (Burnsville)--Dorien Busch;

Mr. President, I rise today to remind my colleagues that \nthis week, October 3 through October 9, is Nuclear Medicine Week. \nNuclear Medicine Week is the first week in October every year and is an \nannual celebration initiated by the Society of Nuclear Medicine. Each \nyear, Nuclear Medicine Week is celebrated internationally at hospitals, \nclinics, imaging centers, educational institutions, corporations, and \nmore.\n  I am particularly proud to note that Dr. Henry Royal, a physician \npracticing nuclear medicine at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology \nin St. Louis, is a constituent and immediate-past president of the \nSociety of Nuclear Medicine. The Society of Nuclear Medicine is an \ninternational scientific and professional organization of more than \n15,000 members dedicated to promoting the science, technology and \npractical applications of nuclear medicine. I commend him and his \ncolleagues for their outstanding work in the field of nuclear medicine \nand for their dedication to caring for people with cancer and other \nserious and life-threatening illnesses that can be diagnosed, managed, \nand treated with medical isotopes via nuclear medicine procedures.\n  With nuclear medicine, health care providers can use a safe, \nnoninvasive procedure to gather information about a patient's condition \nthat might otherwise be unavailable or have to be obtained through \nsurgery or more expensive diagnostic tests. Nuclear medicine procedures \noften identify abnormalities very early in the progression of a \ndisease--long before some medical problems are apparent with other \ndiagnostic tests. This early detection allows a disease to be treated \nearly in its course, when there may be a more successful prognosis.\n  An estimated 16 million nuclear medicine imaging and therapeutic \nprocedures are performed each year in the United States. Of these, 40 \nto 50 percent are cardiac exams and 35 to 40 percent are oncology \nrelated. Nuclear medicine procedures are among the safest diagnostic \nimaging tests available. The amount of radiation from a nuclear \nmedicine procedure is comparable to that received during a diagnostic \nx-ray.\n  Nuclear medicine tests, also known as scans, examinations, or \nprocedures, are safe and painless. In a nuclear medicine test, small \namounts of medical isotopes are introduced into the body by injection, \nswallowing, or inhalation. A special camera, PET or gamma camera, is \nthen used to take pictures of your body. The camera does this by \ndetecting the medical isotope in the target organ, bone or tissue and \nthus forming images that provide data and information about that area \nof your body. This is how nuclear medicine differs from an x-ray, \nultrasound or other diagnostic test--it determines the presence of \ndisease based on function rather than anatomy.\n  Recently, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' announced its \ndecision to approve coverage of positron emission tomography or PET for \nMedicare beneficiaries who have suspected Alzheimer's disease. This \ndecision will allow physicians to obtain an early and more definitive \ndiagnosis and to begin treatment at the time when it provides the best \nchance of prolonging cognitive function for our Medicare beneficiaries. \nSome of the more frequently performed nuclear medicine procedures \ninclude: bone scans to examine orthopedic injuries, fractures, tumors \nor unexplained bone pain; heart scans to identify normal or abnormal \nblood flow to the heart muscle, measure heart function or determine the \nexistence or extent of damage to the heart muscle after a heart attack; \nbreast scans that are used in conjunction with mammograms to more \naccurately detect and locate cancerous tissue in the breasts; liver and \ngallbladder scans to evaluate liver and gallbladder function; cancer \nimaging to detect tumors and determine the severity--staging--of \nvarious types of cancer; treatment of thyroid diseases and certain \ntypes of cancer; brain imaging to investigate problems within the brain \nitself or in blood circulation to the brain; renal imaging in children \nto examine kidney function.\n  Unfortunately, the field of nuclear medicine is not attracting enough \nincoming students to fill the current demand for nuclear medicine \ntechnologists--usually called NMTs. Currently, there is approximately \nan 18-percent vacancy of NMTs as determined by the American Hospital \nAssociation, AHA. By 2010, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, BLS, \nprojects that the U.S. will need an additional 8,000 NMTs to fill the \nprojected demand created by the aging workforce and expanding senior \npopulation. Over the next 20 years, the BLS expects that there will be \na 140-percent increase in the demand for imaging services. The use of \ndiagnostic imaging services has been increasing by approximately four \npercent a year, even as the number of certified NMTs and registered \nradiologic technologists has remained stable. As a result, imaging \ntechnologists often work longer shifts, and patients can face weeks of \ndelay for routine exams.\n  A similar situation is developing for nuclear medicine physicians. \nAccording to the American Board of Medical Specialties, there currently \nare 4,087 certified nuclear medicine physicians in the United States. \nAt the same time, the number of physician training programs is also \ndeclining, exacerbating the future shortage.\n  Over the next 20 years, the number of people over the age of 65 is \nexpected to double at the exact same time when the nation will face \nshortages of medical personnel--including nurses, NMTs, physicians, \nlaboratory personnel, and other specialists. With an increasing number \nof people needing specialized care--such as nuclear medicine--coupled \nwith an inadequate workforce, our Nation quickly could face a \nhealthcare crisis of serious proportions with limited access to quality \ncancer care, particularly in traditionally underserved areas.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support Nuclear Medicine Week, to \nsupport policies such as the newly released CMS decision, and to \nsupport increased funding for programs so that our Nation will have a \nsufficient supply of nuclear medicine physicians and technologists to \ncare for all patients in need of nuclear medicine procedures and \nrelated care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/04/senate-section/article/S10361-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10361-S10362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CHIP PROTECTION AND IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I introduced S. 2759, along with my \ncolleague, Senator Rockefeller, to help States with healthy State \nChildren's Health Insurance programs remain strong, so that they may \ncontinue to provide high-quality health care coverage to the children \nthey serve. Our bill achieves this objective by allowing States to keep \n$1.1 billion in expiring funds in the SCHIP program and continuing \ncurrent law redistribution rules through 2007.\n  Concerns have been expressed that S. 2759 would not reallocate SCHIP \nfunds in an effective manner and that States cannot utilize their \ncurrent SCHIP allotments. Proponents of this view believe the expiring \nSCHIP funds could be more effectively used for outreach and enrollment \nin the program. We fully support greater outreach and enrollment, but \ndo not believe that it should come at the expense of providing adequate \nhealth insurance to children currently served by the program. In 2003, \ndue to State budget deficits, seven States capped enrollment in their \nSCHIP. Over the next few years, unless we extend the availability of \nexisting SCHIP funds and target them to the States with the most need, \nmany States will lack adequate funds to meet their existing need, much \nless enroll more eligible but uninsured children. It is also important \nto note that ten percent of the amount States spend on coverage can be \nspent on administrative costs, including outreach. Consequently, an \nincrease in coverage would also increase the funding States have for \noutreach and enrollment. Moreover, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation \ncurrently provides SCHIP outreach grants to community health centers, \nhospitals, and faith-based organizations through its Covering Kids & \nFamilies Initiative.\n  Another criticism of S. 2759 deals with the amount of money States \nwill have available in fiscal year 2005.\n\n[[Page S10362]]\n\nStates and territories will have $10.8 billion available to provide \nhealth insurance coverage to children in 2005. It has also been \nestimated that States will only require $5.3 billion in fiscal year \n2005 to provide adequate coverage. Although this is true in the \naggregate, this funding figure does not take into account the realities \nof the existing SCHIP financing system. These excess funds are \nconcentrated in low-spending States that have not utilized their SCHIP \nallotments in previous years, and they are not available to States \nfacing Federal funding shortfalls. In the absence of a fundamental \nalteration of the current SCHIP financing system, the aggregate funding \nin the program is not relevant to critical issue of whether there is \nadequate funding within specific States.\n  Lastly, it has been proposed that the Secretary of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services has the authority to redistribute unspent \nallotments from fiscal year 2002 to States where Federal funding \nshortfalls are anticipated in fiscal year 2005. While it is encouraging \nthat the concerns of States facing an immediate shortfall in 2005 would \nbe alleviated under this approach, our larger concern about the long-\nterm financial health of the SCHIP in fiscal years 2006 and 2007 \npersists. Eleven States would receive less in redistributed fiscal year \n2002 funds under this proposal than they would otherwise receive, and \nthey would not have access to the $1.07 billion in federal SCHIP funds \nthat are scheduled to expire.\n  The Children's Health Protection and Improvement Act addresses the \nlong-term Federal funding shortfalls in the SCHIP program over the next \n3 years. The Governors of all 50 States have endorsed our proposal and \nview it as a comprehensive approach to addressing the Federal SCHIP \nfunding shortfalls that will occur prior to the program's \nreauthorization in fiscal year 2007. We stand ready to work with the \nSenate leadership and the administration to keep the SCHIP strong so \nthat it may continue to provide critical health care coverage to \nuninsured children through fiscal year 2007, when a more comprehensive \nresolution of the formula problems can be explored.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/04/senate-section/article/S10362-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY ACT OF 2004\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Assistive \nTechnology Act of 2004, which passed the Senate last week by unanimous \nconsent on September 30, 2004. I thank Senator Gregg for his commitment \nto this very important issue and to my colleagues who have spent \nseveral months working on this bill.\n  The Assistive Technology Act is legislation that helps those \nindividuals with disabilities receive the necessary equipment, devices, \nand services that allow them to live independently, improve their \neducation, or assist with employment opportunities. This program is \nopen to all ages, so it may help the smallest child receive equipment \nthat will help him or her in the classroom or older adults who may need \na device to adapt their workspace so they continue on the job.\n  Many States, such as Ohio, offer many different services to \nindividuals with disabilities. Successful programs--equipment exchange \nprograms and demonstration centers, for example--help ensure that the \nindividual needing assistance is receiving the appropriate equipment to \naddress the obstacle he or she is trying to overcome. Programs like \nthese and the financial loan program help provide everyone in need with \nthe opportunity to receive and purchase the technology and devices \nnecessary to lead productive lives.\n  This legislation is very important to the millions of individuals \nwith disabilities living in the United States. Again, I thank Senator \nGregg and my colleagues on the HELP Committee for working on this \nissue. I look forward to working with my colleagues on other \nlegislation that will address the needs of individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of three letters from groups \nsupporting the Assistive Technology Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Chairman Gregg and Senator Harkin: On behalf of the \n     National Association of Assistive Technology Act Programs \n     (ATAP), I am writing to indicate our support for the Senate's \n     passage of HR 4278, a bill to reauthorize the Assistive \n     Technology Act. We understand it will be ``hotlined'' today.\n       Thank you for your work to bring this process to this \n     point. The bill allows AT programs to continue so that people \n     with disabilities can access assistive technology devices and \n     services. We hope to work with you to make sure that the bill \n     is adequately funded in future appropriations bills so that \n     we can fully realize all of the goals of the bill.\n       If you have questions or need additional information, \n     please contact Jane West at 202-289-3903 or jwest@wpllc.net.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Deborah Buck,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Mr. DeWine: On behalf of the Association of University \n     Centers on Disabilities (AUCD) I would like to thank you for \n     your leadership and remarkable bi-partisan work on HR 4278, \n     the reauthorization of the Assistive Technology Act. The bill \n     will assist people with disabilities throughout our country \n     who will be able to work more effectively, learn at school \n     and more fully participate in their communities, thanks to \n     their increased access to assistive technologies.\n       We appreciate the hard work that has gone into every phase \n     of the process of developing and negotiating this vital \n     legislation. We are especially pleased that the bill clearly \n     delineates the authorization of appropriations so that state \n     grants will have defined and equitable minimum allotment \n     levels. We also appreciate the fact that the bill provides \n     flexibility to states to design locally responsive programs \n     while still assuring a focus on activities that will get \n     assistive technology into the hands of the people that need \n     it. We are pleased, as well, that the bill has enhanced \n     provisions for Research and Development efforts.\n       The network of University Centers for Excellence in \n     Developmental Disabilities represented by AUCD urge you to \n     pass HR 4278 now, and we look forward to working with you as \n     you continue to work to ensure that the future holds nothing \n     but enhancements of the programs and services authorized by \n     this legislation.\n       Thank you for your support of people with disabilities and \n     families who will now see increased benefits from the vast \n     technological advances the 21st century will bring. And thank \n     you again for your bipartisan work and your leadership.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             George Jesien, Ph.D.,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: On behalf of the National Association \n     of Protection and Advocacy Systems (NAPAS) we would like to \n     thank you for your leadership on assistive technology and \n     moving forward with the process of reauthorizing the \n     Assistive Technology Act of 1998. The substitute bill before \n     the Senate ``Improving Access to Assistive Technology for \n     Individuals with Disabilities Act of 2004'' represents a true \n     bipartisan piece of legislation.\n       The bill is a step forward for the protection and advocacy \n     system. The bill makes the following changes that we support: \n     Establishes a grant to the American Indian Consortium for a \n     Protection and Advocacy for Assistive Technology (PAAT) \n     program; establishes a line item to fund the PAAT program; \n     enables a PAAT program to retain earned income for an \n     additional fiscal year beyond current law and regulation; \n     included language to continue needed training and technical \n     assistance for the PAAT program.\n       All of these changes to current law will help make the PAAT \n     program consistent with other protection and advocacy \n     programs. We are thankful for the hard work and dedication of \n     you and the staff who have endeavored to improve this program \n     for people with disabilities.\n       Regrettably, the bill did not contain recommended language \n     to include a provision which would enable the minimum \n     allotments for states and territories to rise when the \n     program receives an appropriations increase.\n       Thank you very much for working in a bipartisan manner to \n     move this legislation. We look forward to working with you to \n     enact this into law this year. If you would like additional \n     information or have questions, please contact myself or Nadia \n     Facey, Public Policy Analyst, at 202-408-9514.\n           Sincerely,\n     Maureen Fitzgerald,\n       President, Board of Directors.\n     Curtis L.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the City of Pacifica for its efforts to renovate and restore \nPacifica State Beach.\n  California's beaches are an integral part of our State's heritage. \nWhether they are vast expanses of flat, sandy\n\n[[Page S10363]]\n\nshores or rocky cliffs overlooking the ocean, California's beaches are \ndiverse and beautiful. People from all over the world come to \nparticipate in the myriad activities California's beaches offer. With \nover a thousand miles of coastline, California is truly a State that \nthrives on its beaches.\n  For over 10 years, the City of Pacifica has striven to renovate \nPacifica State Beach, which serves as a gateway to Northern \nCalifornia's spectacular coastline. The city has demonstrated a great \ncommitment to protect, enhance and restore the 4 miles of shoreline \nthat define the community. Through the strong leadership of Pacifica \nMayor Jim Vreeland and countless other local, State, and Federal \nrepresentatives, many changes have been made at Pacifica State Beach.\n  From the restoration of sand dunes and wetlands, to the creation of \nbike paths, coastal trail paths and a new skate park, to habitat \nenhancement and new amenities for visitors, the renovation of Pacifica \nState Beach has been a success. The City of Pacifica has not only \nunderstood the importance of protecting and restoring California's \nfragile coastal areas, its restoration efforts are a model of balancing \nenvironmental needs, public access and economic necessities.\n  The City of Pacifica's dedication to the community is inspiring, and \nits vision and commitment in protecting California's coastal resources \nshould be commended. I congratulate the City of Pacifica for its hard \nwork, and wish all concerned the best as they dedicate Pacifica State \nBeach on October 16, 2004.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/04/senate-section/article/S10363-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MR.

Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to salute \nmy constituent Merle Johnson, who served America with bravery and \ndistinction behind enemy lines during World War II.\n  Merle Johnson joined the National Guard in 1939, at age 16. He was \nmobilized the following year and was sent to Hawaii 2 weeks after the \nattack on Pearl Harbor.\n  In October 1942, he was sent to the Solomon Islands with the Army's \n25th Infantry Division, which conducted mop-up operations after the \nMarines' bloody assaults on Guadalcanal and New Georgia Island.\n  After being wounded in action and recovering on New Caledonia, Merle \nvolunteered to join a unit that would become known to the world as \nMerrill's Marauders. This elite group of Army Rangers was formed to \nconduct extremely dangerous top-secret missions behind Japanese enemy \nlines in Burma.\n  The Marauders' most famous and important mission was to capture the \nstrategic airfield at Myitkyina, Burma. To accomplish this goal, they \nhad to fight their way for 9 months through more than 600 miles of \njungle, surrounded by Japanese troops. By the time they captured the \nairfield, more than 2,500 of the 3,000 Marauders had been killed, \nwounded, or struck by illness.\n  For his valiant service, Merle Johnson was awarded a Purple Heart, \nthree Bronze Stars, three Battle Stars, and a Presidential Unit \nCitation.\n  After the war, Mr. Johnson worked on the production line at Rockwell \nCorporation and as a labor organizer for the steelworkers union. He now \nlives in Tustin, CA.\n  Earlier this year, Mr. Johnson represented Merrill's Marauders during \nthe dedication ceremony for the World War II Memorial. This monument \nnow stands as a tribute to Merle Johnson, Merrill's Marauders, and 16 \nmillion other brave men and women who served America in World War \nII.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/04/senate-section/article/S10363-3", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10363-S10365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-9534.

A bill to build capacity at community colleges in order to \nmeet increased demand for community college education while maintaining \nthe affordable tuition rates and the open-door policy that are the \nhallmarks of the community college system; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Community \nCollege Opportunity Act.'' Community colleges are the gateway to the \nfuture for first time students looking for an affordable college \neducation, and for mid-career students looking to get ahead in the \nworkplace. As college tuition at four-year colleges continues to rise, \nmore and more students are turning to community colleges for the \neducation they need to prepare for 21st century jobs.\n  Yet soon we may not be able to count on our community colleges being \navailable to everyone. The combination of budget cuts and increased \nenrollments is forcing community colleges to make tough choices between \nraising tuition and turning students away. This important legislation \nwill help keep the doors of our community colleges open to increasing \nnumbers of students without sending tuition through the roof. My bill \nauthorizes $100 million for a competitive grant program to help \ncommunity colleges serve more students. Community colleges could apply \nfor a grant to help with the cost of constructing or renovating \nfacilities, hiring faculty, purchasing new computers and scientific \nequipment, and investing in creative ways of addressing overcrowding--\nlike distance learning.\n  Why is this important? Community colleges are one of the great \nAmerican social inventions. I used to teach night school at Baltimore \nCity Community College. I know firsthand the vital role they play in \nour communities. Their low cost, convenient location, and open door \nadmissions policy have made them the key to the American dream for so \nmany. Many generations of immigrants pursued the American dream by \nworking all day and going to school at night. After World War II, the \nGI bill gave returning veterans a chance to get ahead by going to local \njunior colleges.\n  Now, more than ever, it's important to invest in community colleges. \nIn the next ten years, 40 percent of new jobs will require college \neducation. At the same time, college tuition is on the rise. Tuition at \nthe University of Maryland is up by as much as 21 percent. That's \ncausing many students to take a second look at community colleges \nbecause they're more affordable. They're also leaders in training \nworkers for 21st century jobs from nurses to computer techies, and even \nlab techs for new industries, like biotechnology. They're playing a key \nrole in addressing shortages in nursing and teaching. In Maryland, \ncommunity colleges train 55 percent of new nurses.\n  Yet our community colleges are bursting at the seams. They're growing \nfaster than 4-year colleges. Enrollment at Maryland's community \ncolleges is expected to grow 30 percent in the next 10 years, while 4-\nyear colleges will grow by 15 percent. Community colleges are holding \nclasses from 7 in the morning to 10 at night, on weekends, and over the \ninternet. In my own state of Maryland, they are starting to turn \nstudents away because there isn't enough room. As many as 2000 students \nwere shut out of Montgomery College last year because they couldn't get \ninto the classes they needed or they couldn't afford the cost. Last \nfall, Prince George's Community College had to turn away 630 \nprospective nursing students and 1,000 prospective education students.\n  It's great that so many Americans are going to community colleges. \nFor so many Americans, community colleges are the only way to get the \neducation they need to be competitive for 21st century jobs. Yet the \nrapid increase of students is threatening the very mission of community \ncolleges. If we want a world-class workforce, we need to invest in \nhigher education. We need to make sure we have always institutions \navailable to everyone who wants a college degree or just a couple of \ncourses.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nfrom gross income certain hazard mitigation assistance; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nconcerning a critical issue this year--disaster assistance. This has \nbeen one of the worst hurricane seasons that Florida has seen in recent \nyears. The Sunshine State has been battered by four hurricanes in the \npast six weeks. I extend my deepest sympathies to the residents of \nFlorida where some have had to evacuate more than three times during \nthis hurricane season only to return home and find their homes leveled, \ntheir crops uprooted, their neighborhoods flooded, and their dreams \nshattered.\n  In my home State of Missouri, we are no strangers to natural \ndisasters. Located smack in the middle of Tornado Alley, Missouri has \nbeen hit by some of the largest storms in U.S. in history. In May of \n2003, a string of tornadoes ripped through the western part of the \nState causing major damage and devastation.\n  With two rivers--the Mississippi and the Missouri--we have also seen \nour fair share of flooding through the years. I will never forget when \nthe Mississippi River breached its banks in 1993--one of the most \ndevastating floods in U.S. history. Of the nine Midwestern States \naffected, the State of Missouri was the hardest hit and State officials \nestimate that damages totaled $3 billion.\n  While both the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers have made the State of \nMissouri susceptible to riverine flooding, the State is also \nsusceptible to flash flooding. A case in point is the city of Union, \nlocated about 45 minutes from St. Louis, which suffered tremendous \ndamage from a severe flash flood in May of 2000.\n  I mention the city of Union as a specific example of the benefits \nthat a disaster mitigation program can hold in flash-flood situations. \nAfter the flood, the City of Union applied to the State of Missouri \nEmergency Management Agency to seek help in a demolition and \nacquisition project. With the mitigation grant money, 17 properties \nwere acquired in residential areas with substantial damage. These \nproperties are now dead restricted for ``open space,'' which will \nprevent future development and the potential for flash flood related \ndeaths in that area because many of the homes and people will no longer \nbe in harm's way. This is an excellent example of the value of disaster \nand mitigation money invested by the federal, state and local \ngovernments.\n  Over the years, the State of Missouri has worked with the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency (FEMA) to build structures that prevent \nflooding and other damage from occurring when natural disasters strike. \nTime and time again, FEMA has come to the rescue by establishing \nfunding for disaster relief and mitigation activities within the State \nof Missouri and in other States across the country.\n  Having served as the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nSubcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies, which until recently \noversaw FEMA, I know first hand the value of the agency's disaster \nmitigation grant programs--the Hazards Mitigation Grant Program (HGMP), \nthe Pre-Disaster Mitigation program (PDM), and the Flood Mitigation \nAssistance (FMA) program. Designed to manage future emergencies, these \nprograms have been essential to countless communities, and without \nthem, thousands of lives would be in jeopardy.\n  Recently, some very disturbing news was brought to my attention. \nAccording to a June 2004 legal memorandum issued by the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS), FEMA mitigation grants may be subject to income \ntaxation. While some may argue that this is merely the IRS's \ninterpretation of the statute, it is clearly the position the IRS \nintends to take against American taxpayers whose only recourse will be \nto fight the agency in court.\n  I must say that I am absolutely stunned by this determination by the \nIRS!! How in the world could the IRS possibly think that Congress \nintended to tax these types of grants to prevent natural disasters, \nespecially when we went out of our way to ensure that disaster-relief \npayments to individuals recovering from a hurricane, flood, tornado or \nother natural disaster are not subject to income taxes?\n  Today, I am offering a bill that will stop the IRS in its tracks and \nprevent the taxation of disaster mitigation grants. This language will \nensure that any Federal grants, as well as state grants indirectly \nassociated with this program, will not be deemed to be income by the \nIRS's tortured reasoning. This bill will be effective as of the \nbeginning of this year to ensure that any grants currently out there, \nespecially in light of the current hurricanes that have happened, are \nnot subject to tax. In addition, there should be no inference by this \nlegislation that Congress intended such grants to be taxable prior to \nthe effective date of this legislation.\n  Why is this important? Why am I out here today? Because the Missouri \nand Mississippi Rivers rise, because tornadoes will ravage through the \nstate once again, and because flash flooding can decimate an entire \ncommunity. The last thing Americans who are working to prevent such \npotential destruction need is for government-grant funding to be \nsubject to tax. My bill ensures that such taxes do not see the light of \nday.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                S. 2886\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXCLUSION FROM GROSS INCOME FOR CERTAIN DISASTER \n                   MITIGATION PAYMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 139 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (relating to disaster relief payments) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(g) Certain Disaster Mitigation Payments.--Gross income \n     shall not include the value of any amount received directly \n     or indirectly as payment or benefit by the owner of any \n     property for hazard mitigation with respect to the property \n     pursuant to the Robert T.

The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 446) honoring former President James \n     Earl (Jimmy) Carter on the occasion of his 80th birthday.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize President Jimmy \nCarter on the occasion of his 80th birthday.\n  The people of Nevada elected me to the U.S. House in 1982, so I \narrived in Congress after President Carter had already left the White \nHouse. I did not have a chance to work with him.\n  But I have had, and I continue to have the pleasure of observing his \ngreat leadership on many important projects and issues.\n  What I admire most about President Carter is that he has never \nforgotten where he came from. Jimmy Carter was brought up on his \nfamily's peanut farm outside the small town of Plains, GA. His family \nhome lacked electricity and indoor plumbing.\n  He is a product of the American dream, ascending from the red clay \nfields of Georgia to the most powerful office in the world.\n  I have heard a story that when he told his mother he was going to run \nfor President, she replied, ``President of what?''\n  After graduating as valedictorian of his high school class, a young \nJimmy Carter enrolled in the U.S. Naval Academy. He graduated in 1946 \nin the top tenth of his class, and signed on as an officer under the \ntough but inspirational Captain Hyman Rickover in the Navy's first \nexperimental nuclear submarine.\n  Due to his service, a submarine was named for him: The USS Jimmy \nCarter. This is one of the very few US Navy vessels to be named for a \nperson still alive at the time of the commissioning.\n  President Carter's presidency was distinguished by his strong \ncommitment to human rights in the world, and his commitment to justice \nand protection of the environment at home.\n  As the governor of Georgia, he had reorganized the State government \nto make it more responsive to the needs of the people. He did the same \nthing as president, separating the Department of Health, Education and \nWelfare into the Department of Education and the Department of Health \nand Human Services. He also recognized the importance of establishing a \nstrong national energy policy by creating a new cabinet-level \ndepartment, the United States Department of Energy.\n  The Carter administration's foreign policy is best remembered for the \npeace treaty he brokered between the states of Israel and Egypt with \nthe Camp David Accord. The unfortunate assassination of President Sadat \nonly underscored the deep-seated animosity in that part of the world, \nwhich made this agreement so remarkable.\n  He also brokered the SALT II treaty with the Soviet Union to control \nthe proliferation of nuclear weapons. At the same time, he aggressively \ndeveloped weapons systems like cruise missiles and stealth bombers, \nwhich are still a vital part of our military arsenal.\n  Since leaving the White House, Jimmy Carter has redefined the role of \nan ex-President, using his status and standing to mediate for peace and \nfight disease worldwide.\n  He has been involved in a number of public policy, human rights, and \ncharitable causes. His work in international public policy and conflict \nresolution is largely through the Carter Center, which also focuses on \nworldwide health care and includes a campaign to eliminate guinea worm \ndisease.\n  Outside of the Carter Center, President Carter conducts diplomatic \nmissions as an elder statesman. In 2002 the Nobel committee recognized \nhis efforts at Camp David and the accomplishments of his post-\npresidency by awarding him the Nobel Peace Prize.\n  In addition to promoting peace and human rights through the world, \nPresident Carter has been involved with the non-profit group Habitat \nfor Humanity since 1984.\n  Habitat is an ecumenical Christian housing ministry dedicated to \neliminating substandard housing. Habitat volunteers have built more \nthan 100,000 houses worldwide, providing decent and affordable homes \nfor grateful families, including some in my home State of Nevada.\n  Unlike some public figures who support good causes merely by lending \ntheir name, President Carter gives his sweat to Habitat for Humanity. \nHe hammers nails and cuts boards. Each year he leads a work project, \nand he and his wife Rosalyn donate a week of their time to this \nwonderful cause.\n  The late educator Booker T. Washington once said, ``There are two \nways of exerting one's strength: one is pushing down, the other is \npulling up.''\n  President Carter's life has been a testament to the latter. The value \nof his life's work cannot be measured or quantified by the years he \nserved as President, but by the scope of all his deeds, political as \nwell as humanitarian.\n  I have visited the President at his home in Plains. I have attended \nhis Sunday School class. I am honored to have served as his Nevada \nfinance chairman when he ran for President. President Carter is my \nfriend, for which I am grateful.\n  President Carter leads by example. Living modestly and decently, he \ncontinues to stand up for the weak, the less fortunate, and those whose \nGod-given rights have been denied.\n  It is my honor to wish the Naval lieutenant, Nobel Prize recipient, \nand 39th President of our United States, James Earl Carter, a happy \n80th birthday.\n  I have submitted a resolution to commemorate this occasion, and \nCongressman Lewis has introduced the accompanying resolution in the \nHouse. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nmeasure.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and that any statements be printed in the \nRecord without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S10379]]\n\n  The resolution (S. Res. 446) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follow:\n\n                              S. Res. 446\n\n       Whereas Jimmy Carter was born in Plains, Georgia, on \n     October 1, 1924;\n       Whereas Jimmy Carter attended Georgia Southwestern College \n     and the Georgia Institute of Technology, and received a B.S. \n     degree from the United States Naval Academy in 1946;\n       Whereas Jimmy Carter served honorably as a submariner in \n     the United States Navy in both the Atlantic and Pacific \n     fleets, working under Admiral Hyman Rickover in the \n     development of the nuclear submarine program;\n       Whereas Jimmy Carter continued his commitment to public \n     service, serving as Georgia State Senator and Governor of \n     Georgia;\n       Whereas Jimmy Carter was elected the 39th President of the \n     United States on November 2, 1976;\n       Whereas Jimmy Carter created both the Departments of \n     Education and Energy and implemented major education policies \n     and a comprehensive national energy program;\n       Whereas Jimmy Carter oversaw deregulation of the airline, \n     energy, and banking industries;\n       Whereas Jimmy Carter promoted human rights as a tenet of \n     American foreign policy and pressed nations to uphold basic \n     human rights;\n       Whereas Jimmy Carter furthered diplomatic relations with \n     the People's Republic of China;\n       Whereas Jimmy Carter was instrumental in the negotiation \n     and signing of the Camp David Accord between Israel and \n     Egypt, signaling a new era of peace between those 2 \n     countries;\n       Whereas Jimmy Carter has continued his service to his \n     country since leaving the Presidency by championing safe and \n     affordable housing, human rights, and disease prevention;\n       Whereas Jimmy Carter remains actively committed to \n     promoting peace and democracy abroad, supervising elections \n     in fledgling democracies, and helping to defuse international \n     crises in North Korea, Somalia, and Haiti; his decades of \n     untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international \n     conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to \n     promote economic and social development; and\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate honors former President Jimmy \n     Carter on the occasion of his 80th birthday and extends best \n     wishes to him and his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/04/senate-section/article/S10379-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       MISCELLANEOUS TRADE AND TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF 2004\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.
