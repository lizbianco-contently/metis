We will then resume debate \non the intelligence reform bill.\n  Yesterday, we did invoke cloture on the bill by a vote of 85 to 10; \ntherefore, we will conclude this bill today.\n  This morning the managers will be here and will have additional \ncleared amendments to consider prior to a series of stacked votes, \nwhich are to begin at 11:30 this morning. In addition to those \namendments that can be worked out, Senators may want to come to the \nChamber to make closing remarks on the bill.\n  The order from last night provides for the Senate to begin voting at \n11:30 on the pending amendments that will require rollcall votes. It is \nexpected some of the pending amendments will be accepted after some \nmodifications, or possibly withdrawn.\n  In any event, the voting sequence today will be lengthy. Therefore, \nMembers should be prepared to remain close to the Chamber during that \ntime. I expect to limit the votes to 10 minutes after the first vote in \norder to expedite passage of the bill.\n  I remind my colleagues that at the conclusion of the pending \nintelligence reform bill, we will begin consideration of the resolution \nrelating to the Senate's intelligence restructuring. Our distinguished \nwhips will have a proposal to put forth and we will begin work on that \nlater today. Therefore, additional votes will occur following the \ncompletion of the Collins-Lieberman bill.\n  Lastly, I add that before we finish our business on Friday, which is \nour goal, we will consider any of the available conference reports, \nspecifically, those of Homeland Security appropriations and FSC/ETI, if \nthose are available.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/06/senate-section/article/S10469-6", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we have come a long way and I \ncongratulate our managers and thank, once again, our assistant \nDemocratic leader for his assistance in moving our effort along. We \nwill complete our work on the bill today. That is very gratifying. I \nonly hope now once we have completed our work we can expedite \nconsideration with the House. We will await their decisions with regard \nto how they might proceed. Clearly, we are in a position to complete \nour work in a reasonable time. I hope the same spirit of bipartisanship \nthat was so clearly demonstrated from the very first day with regard to \nconsideration of this legislation can be equally as evident and \napparent as we finish our work. It is the only way the bill will get \ndone under these circumstances. Again, I thank the majority leader for \nsetting that tone.\n\n  I also say we are in a very good position to do the same with the \nlegislative reorganization. A lot of thought and effort has gone into \nthe working group's recommendations. I am one who believes this \nresolution is as close to the consensus within the Congress, within the \nSenate, at least, regarding how we might respond to the recommendations \nmade by the 9/11 Commission as we will get. We cannot let the perfect \nbe the enemy of the good.\n  We have provided the Senate with an opportunity to address the \nconcerns raised by the 9/11 Commission in a very reasonable, \nthoughtful, and comprehensive way.\n  I thank the assistant Republican leader and the assistant Democratic\n\n[[Page S10470]]\n\nleader for their work and hope we can complete our work as a result of \ntheir contribution in the next couple of days.\n  We could have a very productive week. As the majority leader has \nindicated, there are other bills that could be addressed, as well. We \nhave made a lot of progress and I hope we continue to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/06/senate-section/article/S10470-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10470-S10472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this month is Domestic Violence Awareness \nMonth. It was launched over 20 years ago by the National Coalition \nAgainst Domestic Violence. In 1989, the first Domestic Violence \nAwareness Month commemorative legislation was passed by the Congress. \nIt has been passed every year since 1989.\n  We have come a long way in understanding the causes of domestic \nviolence. Most importantly, we understand now that spousal battery is \nnot a mere private matter, something that happens behind closed doors. \nDomestic violence is a crime. It devastates lives, rips apart families, \nand affects every aspect of community life. Its victims deserve our \nbest efforts to prevent and prosecute family violence as we would any \nother violent crime.\n  Battery is a pattern of fear and intimidation to establish power and \ncontrol over another person. It is wrong. Battering happens when one \nperson believes they are entitled to control another. Acts of domestic \nviolence include physical assault, sexual abuse, and psychological \ncruelty. It often escalates from insults and verbal jabs to physical \nharm.\n  Fortunately, the work done by many courageous and committed \nindividuals, including community leaders and churches and police \ndepartments, family courts, shelters, and advocates, have made a \ndifference. The Department of Justice reports that the number of female \nvictims of intimate violence declined through the 1990s. The number of \nmale victims of intimate violence also went down over this period.\n  As a society, we are much more aware of the danger signs and of our \nresponsibility to respond and to intervene and to act. We are also more \naware of our responsibility as moms and dads and husbands and wives to \nteach our children by example the value of compassion and respect.\n  I commend those dedicated to keeping this in the public's \nconsciousness. I urge my colleagues to join in the effort to raise the \npublic's awareness. We have come a long way, but there is still more to \ndo.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Senator Biden has long been a champion in bringing \ndomestic violence to the forefront of the national agenda. He was a \nleader in the bipartisan effort to pass the Violence Against Women Act, \nand I worked with him last year to ensure the independence of the \nOffice on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice.\n  The Violence Against Women Act made a statement in law that fighting \ndomestic violence is not just sound family policy, it is a moral \nimperative. It made a statement that domestic violence is not the \nshameful secret of a select few families, it is an issue with immense \nrepercussions for all of us. Most importantly, it made a statement that \nas a country, a society, and a national family, we can do something \nabout domestic violence.\n  As a direct result of the Violence Against Women Act our Nation has \nmade significant strides in the fight against domestic violence. There \nare more domestic abuse hotlines and more shelters today than there \nwere 10 years ago. There are more doctors, nurses, therapists, \nteachers, police officers, judges and other community leaders today who \nrecognize the signs of domestic violence, and know how to help when \nthey see those signs.\n  VAWA has also provided financial means to Native American communities \nand tribes to combat domestic violence. Before 1994, domestic violence \nand sexual assault services and resources were rare in Indian Country. \nVAWA has enabled Native communities to provide safe locations, \ncounseling services, and technical assistance and training, and it has \ngiven these communities the flexibility to tailor those services to the \nunique needs of Indian people.\n  In addition, just last Wednesday, the Senate passed a VAWA STOP grant \ntechnical fix that would allow for a direct Federal tribal coalition \nrelationship. This fix provides an important clarification to ensure \nthat tribal domestic violence and sexual assault programs have a direct \nlink with the Department of Justice underscoring the unique Federal-\ntribal relationship.\n  In South Dakota, in Rapid City and on the Pine Ridge Indian \nReservation, a non-profit organization known as Cangleska is helping to \nbreak the cycle of violence by providing domestic violence prevention \nand intervention advocacy and services. Cangleska works with \norganizations like Sacred Circle that serve as a vital national \nresource for Native women, and I am proud to have it based in South \nDakota.\n  There are similar organizations doing good work in communities all \nacross America, Native and non-Native, rich and poor. We have made \nprogress. But there is much more to be done.\n  Each year, more than 1 million women in America are victims of \ndomestic violence, and more than 3 million American children witness \ndomestic violence. Protecting the victims of domestic violence is \nessential, but it is not enough. Domestic violence does not just \ndestroy families, it cascades through generations. Children who get \nabused or witness abuse are more likely to become parents who abuse.\n  Next year, when Congress re-authorizes the Violence Against Women \nAct, in addition to taking further steps to prevent domestic violence, \nwe need to do more to help the children who witness it. This is the \nonly way to begin to break the cycle of domestic violence.\n  This month, we acknowledge the strength and bravery of the victims \nand survivors of domestic violence, and we rededicate ourselves to \nraising awareness about and confronting this deeply disturbing issue.\n  Let us also vow to do even more in the months ahead to create a \ncountry and a climate where home is a refuge, and domestic violence a \nthing of the past.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today on the Senate floor we are \nrecognizing the month of October as National Domestic Violence \nAwareness Month.\n  For far too long, we have been reluctant to talk openly about family \nviolence. When I was growing up, few viewed violence in the home as a \ncrime. As a young deputy sheriff, I learned that people thought of it \nas a private matter.\n  Today, we know that domestic violence is not a private family matter, \nit is a serious crime.\n  And for far too long, domestic violence has been seen as a problem \nwhich impacts only women, but this is not true either. Domestic \nviolence is not just a woman's issue. It impacts the entire American \nfamily.\n  Domestic violence damages children. The seeds of violence are planted \nearly. We know that children are harmed both emotionally and \ndevelopmentally when they witness or experience violence.\n  Violence is a learned behavior. So, the cycle of domestic abuse \ncontinues generation after generation.\n  Domestic violence also threatens the security and peace of entire \ncommunities. The impacts of abuse are felt by the families, friends and \nco-workers of victims. They are felt by law enforcement officials, \nmedical workers and other social service workers who are called upon to \nrepair the lives shattered by violence.\n  Now, there are advocacy groups, support groups, 24-hour-crisis \nhotlines, and housing assistance.\n  And, today there is a network of almost 1800 domestic violence \nprograms in the United States. Approximately 1,200 of these include \nshelter. Now, most shelters include facilities for the children, too.\n  Understanding first-hand the impact of family violence, I have made \nanti-violence and domestic violence legislation a top priority \nthroughout my years in Congress.\n  A year ago, during the month of October, the Stamp Out Family \nViolence Stamp was issued. The stamp, similar to the Breast Cancer \nStamp, earns monies for domestic violence shelters throughout the \ncountry, with special emphasis on programs for children who witness \ndomestic violence. By the end of July this year, the stamp had netted \n$1.2 million for shelter programs.\n\n[[Page S10471]]\n\n  But there is more to be done. Domestic violence can be prevented. \nAround the country there is innovative and exciting work taking place \nto help reduce family violence. While we must continue our efforts to \nprovide help and shelter for victims, we must also step up our efforts \nin providing helps that will prevent violence.\n  Many believe that enacting broader Federal laws is the answer to this \nproblem. But, I believe that adding more rules on the books without the \nability to enforce them is a hollow and incomplete gesture.\n  We must all speak out on this issue. Victims must speak up and ask \nfor help. Local, State and national authorities must speak up. And, \ncommunities must recognize the pervasive effects of violence on all \naspects of community life. I believe that by combining education, \nresearch, and community-based efforts, we can create reasonable, multi-\nfaceted solutions to a problem that has no boundaries and knows no \nlaws.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today with my colleague, Senator Kyl, \nI commemorate Domestic Violence Awareness Month and pay tribute to the \nmillions of victims of domestic violence in the United States: both \nthose who daily face fear and pain at the hands of the ones they love, \nand those who have had the courage to seek help.\n  Domestic violence causes far more pain than the visible marks of \nbruises and scars. It is devastating to be abused by someone that you \nlove and think loves you in return. It is estimated that approximately \n3 million incidents of domestic violence are reported each year in the \nUnited States. Tragically, domestic violence remains a pervasive threat \nto the fabric of America's families and the well-being of America's \nfuture.\n  Around the world, one out of three women is abused by their domestic \npartner or another member of their family. This means that each of us \nprobably knows at least one victim of domestic abuse.\n  It is primarily a crime against women, who account for approximately \n85 percent of domestic abuse victims each year. Indeed, nearly one-\nthird of American women report being physically or sexually abused by a \nhusband or boyfriend at some point in their lives, and each year as \nmany as 324,000 women experience domestic violence during their \npregnancy. It is truly heartbreaking to hear these victims' stories and \nto know that so many women and even some men face this pain on a \nregular basis.\n  Domestic violence does not only happen to adults. Forty percent of \ngirls age 14 to 17 report knowing someone their age who has been hit or \nbeaten by a boyfriend, and approximately one in five female high school \nstudents reports being physically and/or sexually abused by a dating \npartner. And these are only the cases that are reported.\n  Additionally, many children are caught in the middle, witnessing \nabuse or being abused themselves. Domestic violence is witnessed by \nbetween 3.3 and 10 million children every year. And, studies show that \nhalf of all men who frequently assault their wives also frequently \nabuse their children. The emotional impact of this abuse during \nchildhood can have a devastating effect on the rest of a person's life.\n  Domestic abuse creates a cycle of violence. Children who are abused \nor witness abuse are at a higher risk of abusing their own family and \nsignificant others as an adult as well as long-term physical and mental \nhealth problems, including alcohol and substance abuse. It is evident \nthat these abuse victims follow the example they learned in childhood \nand continue the cycle of violence when they are adults.\n  Statistics can show the wide scope of domestic violence, but numbers \ncannot demonstrate how frightening domestic violence is to a victim. I \nhave read stories of many victims, both men and women, whose lives are \nchanged forever by the fear and pain they feel as a result of their \npartner's violent behavior.\n  Let me talk about just one story I read recently. At first glance, \nPam Butler appeared to have the perfect life. She grew up in a stable, \nloving family in Palo Alto, CA. That stability was shattered when she \nmet Michael Braga.\n  Michael Braga was a charismatic but troubled man who quickly romanced \nPam Butler. He began to control every aspect of her life: limiting her \ncontact with friends and family, controlling her money and living space \nand chipping away at her self-confidence. This behavior quickly \nescalated into violence. Pam was beaten unconscious on several \noccasions. She painfully learned to hide the signs of the beatings \nbecause she was ashamed to be in such a horrible situation.\n  After several beatings caused re-injury to an old skull fracture, Pam \nButler realized that staying in the relationship could kill her. She \nenlisted the help of Santa Clara County Assistant District Attorney \nJoyce Allegro.\n  I am pleased to report that Mr. Braga was arrested and prosecuted. \nFollowing his trial, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison, one of the \nlongest sentences for domestic violence passed down in California \nhistory.\n  As a result of her experiences with domestic violence, Pam Butler has \ndevoted many hours to assisting other victims. She is the Domestic \nViolence Victim Advocate for the County of Santa Clara's Social \nServices Agency. She has also spoken about domestic violence across the \nUnited States. Her story is an inspiration to every person who has been \na victim of domestic violence.\n  Another heartbreaking story is that of Michele, a Chicago woman who \nhad been abused just as her mother and grandmother had before her. \nMichele's father hit and insulted her throughout her upbringing. \nUnfortunately, Michele was not able to break the cycle of violence and \nfell into the same trap as her mother and grandmother.\n  Her first husband beat her, cheated on her, called her insulting \nnames and controlled her ability to come and go from her house. \nAlthough she was well-read and bright, Michele did not believe she had \nthe ability to escape this horrible situation.\n  Ultimately, her husband left her and her children, and she continued \nthe cycle of violence with other abusive men. Eventually, she and her \nchildren found themselves homeless. Only then did she realize that she \ncould get help. Michele now encourages other victims to seek help and \nspeak out against domestic violence.\n  It is vital that we act to stop the cycle of domestic violence. To \nthis end, last April the Senate passed the Victims' Rights Act by a \nvote of 96 to 1. I am proud to have been a long-time supporter and \ncosponsor of this important legislation. The act amends the federal \ncriminal code to expand the rights of victims, especially the \nprotection of victims of domestic violence, during the course of an \nalleged offender's trial and imprisonment.\n  This is landmark legislation in its ability to ensure the rights of \nall victims, but it is especially important for victims of domestic \nabuse. The Victims' Rights Act assures victims the right to be \nreasonably protected from the accused. It guarantees the right to \nreasonable, accurate and timely notice of any public proceeding \ninvolving the crime, as well as any release or escape of the accused \noffender. And it protects the victim's right to be treated with \nfairness and with respect for his or her dignity and privacy.\n  The Victims' Rights Act is one of the most important pieces of \nlegislation that I have had the privilege of supporting during my 12 \nyears in the Senate. It is currently before the House Subcommittee on \nCrime, Terrorism and Homeland Security, and I strongly encourage the \nHouse to take it up soon.\n  In closing, I am grateful for the opportunity to honor the victims of \ndomestic violence and to call for an end to the cycle of violence. It \nis my sincere hope that we will all know peace and security in our own \nhomes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join the majority leader and others who \nI understand will come to the floor to call attention to the need for \nrecognition of the problems of domestic violence. October is National \nDomestic Violence Awareness Month. As the majority leader noted, last \nweek we passed a resolution supporting the efforts to address more \neffectively domestic violence in this country.\n  This is an important issue, a very troubling issue to people all over \nthis country. We have been lax in recognizing the depth and the breadth \nof the problem within our country. In South\n\n[[Page S10472]]\n\nDakota and across the land, new efforts are being made to address the \nneed for greater awareness, the need for greater education, the need \nfor greater prevention, the need for greater response. And it is only \nif we as Senate leadership ensure that the people of this country \nrecognize the importance of making this a higher priority will those \nneeds be addressed throughout the Nation.\n  So I commend those who are taking the floor this morning to once \nagain draw attention to these needs, draw attention to our need to \nrespond, and to draw attention to the important priority it ought to \nhave as we consider public policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/06/senate-section/article/S10472-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ONGOING JOB CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, 18 months ago, a group of 450 economists, \nincluding 10 Nobel laureates, made it clear that because the White \nHouse put the narrow interests of a few ahead of our Nation's economy, \nits jobs plan would fail. It would fail to create jobs, it would fail \nto lift wages, and it would fail to bring down our deficit.\n  The warning was clear. Now the record is undeniable. In the last 3 \nyears, we have lost 1.6 million private sector jobs. The last time the \neconomy took this long to replace jobs lost in a recession was the \nGreat Depression. Mr. President, 2.7 million manufacturing jobs have \nbeen lost, and many sent overseas on a one-way ticket. Unemployment has \nincreased 40 percent, and today 8 million Americans are out of work. \nAnd 1.7 million have been out of work for 6 months or longer.\n  That is horrible news for a couple that is hoping to retire, a family \nthat is trying to put a child through college, or anyone who has been \nliving from paycheck to paycheck.\n  But this situation touches all Americans, including those who have \njobs today. That is because the weakness in the job market has \nundermined wage and salary growth. Real household income has dropped \n3.4 percent since 2001. Adding to the squeeze, college tuition is up, \ngas prices have risen to all-time highs, and the cost of health care \nhas risen by 45 percent since 2001.\n  Middle-class families are beginning to believe that the deck is \nstacked against them, and for good reason. The CBO recently confirmed \nwhat many of us have been saying for the past few years: The \nPresident's economic plan rewards wealth and punishes work by shifting \nthe tax burden onto the shoulders of middle-class families. Even with \nmiddle-class families bearing more than their fair share of the tax \nburden, the country is looking at years and years of record deficits \nand debt.\n  This past weekend, I traveled around South Dakota, meeting with \npeople and going door to door. More than any time in my memory, people \ntell me they need two or three jobs--not to get ahead, not to save for \na house or their child's education, but simply to make their monthly \nbills. Many good manufacturing jobs have left the State, and it is \ngetting more difficult to find full-time jobs that pay a wage good \nenough to raise a family.\n  Recently, I received a letter from a young woman in Lake Andes. She \nhas done everything right. She went to college, got a master's degree, \nand got advanced skills that could help move our economy forward. But \nbecause there are so few good jobs, she has been out of work now for \nmonths. Just to get by, she has applied for lower skilled work. But \noften she is passed over for those jobs because employers worry that \nshe is overqualified. What does it say about our economy that someone \nwith real skills, willing to work hard, cannot get a job?\n  Out in our small towns and farming and ranching communities, the \nstory can even get worse. I have been visiting these communities for \nmore than 25 years. There is nothing more gratifying to me than to see \na family farmer or rancher raise their children, teach them how to \nfarm, and then pass their land down to them. That is why we led the \nfight to create an exemption in the estate tax to allow families to \npass from one generation to the next the farms they have lived on for \ngenerations before. But too many family farms are getting swallowed up.\n  More often, children are forced to leave the communities they know \nand the families they love to find work in other places. They don't \nwant to leave, but they cannot find work good enough to allow them to \nraise a family. So the way of life their families have enjoyed for \ngenerations is being lost. These families have been struggling for \nyears, watching all they have worked for slip away from them. Yet when \nthey look to Washington, they do not see their Government fighting for \nthem, or even hearing them at times. The administration continues to \nsay the economy has turned a corner. When these families look ahead, \nthey don't see a corner, they see a cliff, and they are worried they \nare going to fall off.\n  Americans do not want to wait until after the election to do \nsomething. They need help now. I am glad we extended the middle-class \ntax cuts. Middle-class families need relief. Previous tax cuts were \nunfairly skewed to the very wealthiest of Americans. This was the right \nthing to do. It will probably help those people who are struggling, but \nthere is much more that we need to do.\n  First, we need to pass a real jobs bill, one that puts top priority \non creating jobs at home, closes corporate tax loopholes, and ends the \nincentives that encourage companies to ship American jobs overseas.\n  Second, we need to extend the unemployment benefits. Every week, \nanother 85,000 Americans exhaust their unemployment benefits. They \nshould not be punished because the economic policies that are in place \nhave created the longest jobs slump since the Great Depression.\n  Third, it is time to raise the minimum wage. Today, the minimum wage \nis $5.15 an hour, and it is worth less than $3 when using 1968 wage \nindicators. Americans who work at the minimum wage for 40 hours a week, \n52 weeks a year, still fall $5,000 short of the poverty line. No \nAmerican who works full time, 52 weeks a year, should live in poverty. \nIn the time we have left this year, we should increase the minimum wage \nto $7. It will not lift every working family out of poverty, but it \nwill move millions of minimum wage workers closer to the life of \nsecurity and dignity they deserve.\n  Fourth, we need to pass a Transportation bill that would provide \nneeded infrastructure improvements across the Nation.\n  Fifth, we need to help workers whose jobs have been outsourced \noverseas to get back on their feet.\n  Finally, we need to pass the renewable fuels standard. In South \nDakota alone, a renewable fuels standard would create 10,000 jobs and \nrevitalize the rural economy. By reducing reliance on foreign oil, \nfamilies would be less vulnerable to high energy costs.\n  It looks as though this Congress will end having failed to take \nstrong action on behalf of American working families. Unfortunately, \nthe leadership has stood in the way of commonsense proposals that would \ncreate jobs and improve the lives of working people.\n  Republican opposition to legislation designed to create jobs and help \nworkers would be troubling at any time, but considered together, at a \ntime when working families continue to feel the effects of a 3-year-\nlong jobs slump, their stubborn opposition demonstrates a troubling \nindifference to the needs of American middle-class families.\n  Americans still dream of a better life. They still dream of a better \nfuture for themselves and their families. We have a responsibility to \ngive Americans a chance to make that dream real. But it is time we tell \nAmericans who are struggling that help is on the way. We are not \nhelpless. We can create jobs, lift wages, and stop the outsourcing of \nthe American workplace. All it takes is leadership.\n  Americans have been looking to Congress to provide the new direction \nof economic leadership they need. We have 1 more week before the Senate \nrecesses. The American people are demanding action, and we have an \nobligation to deliver it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Senator allow me to make an \nannouncement?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/06/senate-section/article/S10472-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10472-S10473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, there are a lot of problems that affect \npeople around the world and in this country. Some go unmentioned and \nyet affect millions of lives and are with us every day. One of those \nproblems is the problem of domestic violence.\n  I was so pleased that both the majority leader and the Democratic \nleader, this morning, began their official presentations in the Senate \ntalking about the problem of domestic violence and the fact that the \nSenate, last week, unanimously passed a resolution which supports ``the \ngoals and ideals of National Domestic Violence Awareness Month,'' which \nis this month of October, and expresses ``the sense of the Senate that \nCongress should raise awareness of domestic violence in the United \nStates and its devastating effects on families.''\n  Our message in passing this resolution is aimed both at a national \naudience as well as every individual who is a victim of domestic \nviolence or who knows one. Their message is not a moment of silence, as \nis frequently the case but, rather, the message is: ``It's time to \ntalk.'' And all around the country--indeed, the world--this message is \nbeing conveyed today and for the remainder of this month.\n  I want to thank Marie Claire magazine, for example, and organizations \nthat are promoting this theme: ``It's time to talk.'' And why is that \nimportant? Because as almost anyone who understands the problem of \ndomestic violence knows, the biggest reason the problem remains with us \nis that it is kept a secret.\n  People are ashamed or afraid to talk, to begin the conversation that \nwould confront and, therefore, solve the problem. That is why ``It's \ntime to talk'' is so important. It is not just the victims who should \ntalk, it is society as a whole.\n  As the resolution states:\n\n       There is a need to increase the public awareness about and \n     understanding of domestic violence and the needs of battered \n     women and their children.\n\n  It is hard to convey the sense of this problem talking statistics, \nbut I think it is important that we understand the magnitude of the \nproblem, not in terms of human suffering with individual stories but to \nunderstand the statistics of how serious the problem is. We have made \nprogress to be sure, but it is still a very serious problem.\n  An average of more than three women are murdered by their husbands or \nboyfriends in the United States every day, and someone in the United \nStates is sexually assaulted every 2 minutes each year. Each year, \nabout 342,000 pregnant women in the United States are battered by the \nmen in their lives, leading to pregnancy complications, including low \nweight gain, anemia, infections, and many others. In 2002 alone, \n250,000 women and girls older than the age of 12 were raped or sexually \nassaulted, a quarter of a million women. One out of every 12 women has \nbeen stalked in her lifetime.\n  It is an issue not only for today's generation but for children \nbecause nearly 9 million witness domestic violence every day. This \nobviously creates a risk factor in their lives for having long-term \nphysical and mental health problems, including substance abuse, being a \nvictim of abuse, and becoming a perpetrator of abuse. A boy who \nwitnesses his father's domestic violence is 10 times more likely to \nengage in domestic violence than a boy from a nonviolent home. Forty \npercent of girls ages 14 to 17 report knowing someone their age who has \nbeen hit or beaten by a boyfriend. One in five adolescent girls in the \nUnited States becomes a victim of physical or sexual abuse or both in a \ndating relationship.\n  The cost is devastating. The real cost is the emotional and \npsychological harm that occurs to victims of domestic violence and to \ntheir families. But there is also a staggering cost to society. As we \nnoted in the resolution adopted in the Senate, the cost of domestic \nviolence, including rape, physical assault, and stalking, exceeds $5.8 \nbillion each year, of which $4.1 billion is spent on direct medical and \nmental health care services.\n  The problem exists in my State of Arizona. Just to cite a couple \nstatistics: 81 of the 440 homicides reported in Arizona in the year \n2003 were a result of domestic and/or dating violence; this year, as of \nSeptember 8, there were 61 domestic violence-related deaths reported; \nin the year 2002, every 5 minutes police responded to a call involving \ndomestic violence; every 19 minutes an arrest was made as a result of a \ndomestic violence incident; and every 36 minutes police were called to \nthe scene of domestic violence where children were present. In that \nsame year, 91 law enforcement agencies in Arizona reported a total of \nover 112,000 calls to service for domestic violence. Of those calls, \nthere were a total of 26,000 arrests made.\n  I conclude by acknowledging the dedication of all the people \ntirelessly working behind the scenes to try to end domestic violence \nand to deal with the crisis of strengthening the survivors of domestic \nviolence.\n\n  I have toured centers in Arizona--for example, city centers against \nfamily violence in Mesa, Glendale, and Scottsdale, all leading the way. \nWe have raised money and dedicated sites for the Autumn House Domestic \nViolence Shelter, Chrysalis Shelter, the Center Against Sexual Abuse, \nChildHelp USA, and the Sexual Assault Recovery Institute, and many \nothers. I thank all of them for their efforts in trying to deal with \nthis important crisis.\n  I also thank those of my colleagues who have been involved in this \neffort: my colleague Dianne Feinstein, who has worked so tirelessly in \nthis effort in trying to provide help for victims of crime, for \nexample; Senator Biden, who was one of the authors of the resolution \nabout which I spoke earlier. There are others who will come to the \nfloor of the Senate throughout the morning either to provide statements \nor to deliver them here noting the nature of the problem.\n  It is fitting that this month is designated as National Domestic \nViolence Awareness Month. It is fitting that our resolution passed in \nthe Senate notes that we should raise awareness of domestic violence in \nthe United States and its devastating effects on families, as I said in \nthe beginning. In order to solve this problem, we have to begin by \nacknowledging it and confronting it. It is indeed time to talk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/06/senate-section/article/S10473-3", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10473-S10474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WAR ON TERROR AND THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the situation in \nthe war on terror. I listened to the debate last night, and I heard the \ncandidate from the other side of the aisle talk about what a mess \nthings were, how terrible everything was, how terrible things are in \nAfghanistan. Afghanistan is on the verge of having elections. Ten \nmillion Afghanis have registered to vote in spite of threats.\n  The Vice President made a compelling case talking about El Salvador. \nPeople thought that democracy would never flourish. Yet because of the \ndesire for democracy and the opportunity to vote, we have seen matters \nturn around.\n  I had the opportunity to be with the President of El Salvador and the \nPresidents of other Central American countries at a breakfast. We have \ndemocracy in Central America. The lure of democracy is so powerful.\n  I was listening to the distinguished minority leader, and he made \nreferences to the Great Depression, references to the economic \nsituation today in analogy to the Great Depression.\n  The President has made it clear: As long as any American does not \nhave employment, we have to do better. But the reality is so far from \nthe Great Depression. Some people must walk around and see us \nsurrounded in darkness. In 1996, when Bill Clinton was running for \nreelection, the January to August average unemployment at this time, \nwhere we stand today, was 5.5 percent. It is 5.6 percent today. The \nunemployment rate for African Americans during that same period, the \nfirst-\n\n[[Page S10474]]\n\nterm average of President Clinton was 11.3 percent. It is 9.9 percent \ntoday. The unemployment rate for Hispanics during the first term of \nPresident Clinton was 9.7 percent. It is 7.2 percent today. America's \nstandard of living is on the rise. Real after-tax incomes are up nearly \n10 percent since December 2000, substantially better than the \ncomparable time period in the previous business cycle. Consumer \nconfidence continues to be substantially high. The national home \nownership rate was at an alltime high. Minority ownership has set a new \nrecord of 51 percent in the second quarter and is up 2.1 percentage \npoints from a year ago. Core inflation remains low. Mortgage rates \nremain at historic lows.\n\n  There are challenges in this economy, but to draw a comparison to the \nGreat Depression is a little excessive. The reality is, we do have \nthings to do. But I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: \nSet us free. Let's get an energy bill passed, an energy bill that had \n44 Republicans voting for it, 13 Democrats. The reality is that if the \nminority leader wanted to get this done, it could get done.\n  I represent the State of Minnesota. We are neighbors of the folks in \nSouth Dakota. I know they want an energy bill. Within that energy bill \nis a renewable fuels standards that would double the production of \nethanol and will bring to life the soybean biodiesel industry, a great \nopportunity for our communities. If you want to grow jobs, get an \nenergy bill passed. Give us the number of votes we need to get through \ncloture.\n  Let us have class action reform. We came within a few votes of \ngetting that done. You want to grow jobs, talk to the manufacturers in \nthis country, talk to the small business people. They will tell you \nwhat they need. They need class action reform. Our friends on the other \nside won't give it to us.\n  We need asbestos reform. We need medical malpractice reform. We \ncouldn't even get welfare reform done. Again, those on the other side \nof the aisle were filibustering, saying: We will not allow it to \nhappen. There is no work requirement today in welfare, if the welfare \nreform change that was previously passed expires.\n  We have a lot of work to do. There is a plan and a vision out there. \nThe vision is to make American business competitive with businesses all \nover the world. We do that by cutting taxes. We don't do that by \nraising the tax on small businesses, many of which are subchapter S \ncorporations or sole proprietorships that pay taxes at the rate of the \nhighest level. They pay more than large corporations pay. Yet my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle talk about rolling back that tax \ncut, which would have a devastating effect on small business.\n  In Minnesota we sometimes talk about the Scandinavian who loved his \nwife so much he almost told her. As I listened to the distinguished \nminority leader, I got this sense that folks care so much they will \nalmost do something.\n  We have a path to do something. It lies through an energy bill. It \nlies through medical malpractice reform. It lies through class action \nreform. It lies through getting the FSC/ETI JOBS bill through. Right \nnow American manufacturers are paying a double-digit tax, in effect, \nbecause of a WTO violation.\n  We can lower that. We can change it. Instead, we find it blocked. No, \nit is not the Great Depression. There is more work to be done. There is \na path, but the path doesn't lie with obstruction. I know the people of \nMinnesota and of South Dakota need an energy bill, and they want one.\n  In the last few minutes I have, because I want to give some time to \nmy friend and colleague, the Senator from Pennsylvania, I want to talk \na little about what is happening in the war on terror and in Iraq.\n  This week, the forces of freedom won a major battle. We reclaimed the \ncity of Samarra. We reclaimed it by working with the 5,000-member joint \nforce of Americans and Iraqis liberating that city from insurgents and \nforeign fighters. The fact is that we are not out there by ourselves, \nand the reality is that we need the Iraqis to step forward, and they \nare doing so. Yet the Prime Minister of Iraq came here and addressed a \njoint session of this body and the House. He then was disparaged by the \nDemocratic nominee for President; the Iraqi sacrifice was disparaged.\n  Last night, we heard the Democratic Vice Presidential candidate \nsimply dismiss the sacrifice of our strongest ally. We are not in this \nalone. We are not going to win it alone. But we can win it. We are not \ngoing to win it if we take an attitude that it is simply a diversion, \nif we take an attitude that things are so messed up that nothing will \ncome together. We are not going to win it with folks who don't have the \nresolve to see this through or have the consistency to say, yes, it is \na good thing that Saddam is no longer in power. We are not going to win \nby dismissing the contributions of our allies--the Polish, the English, \nthe Italians, the Salvadorans, and on and on. We are not going to win \nit if we dismiss the sacrifice of the Iraqi people. We need them to \nstep forward. We saw in Samarra what happens when you come together: \nYou can liberate a city from insurgents.\n  Mr. President, we have a lot of work to do. The situation is not \nperfect, but we can get it done with the leadership of this President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Nobody has been sued, by \nthe way. What was sued under the Good Samaritan Food Donation Act--we \nwere not taking money out of anyone's pocket with lawsuits.

Mr. President, last night, I was in Cleveland, OH--I got \nback in the early hours of this morning--to be present at the Vice \nPresidential debate between our colleague, Senator Edwards, and Vice \nPresident Cheney. It is an interesting responsibility and assignment \nthat I had, along with several of my colleagues on the Republican side, \nto provide the so-called spin after the debate. You would think that \nvoters could reach their\n\n[[Page S10475]]\n\nown conclusions about who said what and how they should vote, but there \nare many who line up in an effort to stress the important and strong \npoints made by their candidate. That was my role last night.\n  I am not going to presume to tell anybody who watched that debate who \nwon or lost. I will point out two specific things that were said by \nVice President Cheney that I believe demand some clarification. He said \nat one point in the debate that he had never met Senator Edwards. In \nfact, he said:\n\n       In my capacity as Vice President, I am President of the \n     Senate, the presiding officer. I am in the Senate most \n     Tuesdays in session. The first time I met you [Senator \n     Edwards] was when you walked on the stage tonight.\n\n  That is what Vice President Cheney said last night. You know, all of \nus forget from time to time when we have met someone. In this \nparticular instance, the Vice President had forgotten that at least on \ntwo previous occasions he had not only met Senator Edwards but had been \nin very close contact with him. In fact, at the National Prayer \nBreakfast on February 1, 2001, Vice President Cheney acknowledged \nSenator Edwards, who was in the audience. They were at the same event. \nThen, at the swearing-in ceremony for Senator Edwards' colleague, \nSenator Elizabeth Dole, in 2003, in fact, Vice President Cheney was \nstanding right next to Senator Dole and Senator Edwards.\n  So to suggest that he never met the man last night--it turns out that \nhe had a lapse in memory. It happens to us all. It is a rather \nincidental thing in the scheme of things but for the other lapse of \nmemory the Vice President had last night. I listened to him say these \nwords, and I could not believe it. He said:\n\n       I have not suggested there is a connection between Iraq and \n     9/11.\n\n  I wrote that down and underlined it, saying I can't believe that, \nbecause I have heard him say repeatedly that there was a connection \nbetween 9/11 and Iraq that warranted our invasion of Iraq before we put \ntogether a broad and strong coalition to share in the burden. So with \nsome research we find that at least on two occasions, and many others \nperhaps, the Vice President has forgotten again. This is what he said \non December 2, 2002:\n\n       His [Saddam Hussein] regime has had high level contacts \n     with al-Qaida going back a decade, and has provided training \n     to al-Qaida terrorists.\n\n  That is a direct quote from Vice President Cheney, who said last \nnight he had never suggested that connection.\n  Then again, on January 22, 2004, on National Public Radio, the \n``Morning Edition,'' he said:\n\n       I think there is overwhelming evidence that there was a \n     connection between al-Qaida and the Iraqi government.\n\n  Those are his quotes. Last night, he denied them. I will tell you why \nhe should have denied them. He was wrong. He was wrong then and wrong \nthe other times he suggested the connection between Saddam Hussein and \nal-Qaida to justify our invasion of Iraq. In fact, the 9/11 Commission, \na bipartisan commission, has dismissed that premise. The Senate \nIntelligence Committee, which I serve on, has dismissed that premise \nand said the intelligence community failed us when they made that \nsuggestion. And here is the best part. On October 4 of this year, \nSecretary Donald Rumsfeld, in the President's Cabinet with the Vice \nPresident, said he had no hard evidence to link al-Qaida and Saddam \nHussein. The Secretary of Defense said:\n\n       To my mind, I have not seen any strong, hard evidence \n     linking the two.\n\n  Why is this significant? It is significant for the same reason that \nthe report that is about to come out today, ordered by this \nadministration, a report prepared by the chief U.S. weapons inspector \nin Iraq, again says that there is no evidence of weapons of mass \ndestruction. This administration is in denial when it comes to the \nreality of Iraq.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Would the Senator like to yield there?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No, not until I have completed my statement; then I'll be \nhappy to yield.\n  This administration is in denial when it comes to the reality of \nIraq. We have a Vice President who linked Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida, \nand that has been debunked and dismissed by several sources, including \nhis own Secretary of Defense, and an administration that still clings \nto this notion of weapons of mass destruction despite report after \nreport of no evidence of weapons of mass destruction, and they tell the \nAmerican people that is why we had to do this; that is why we had to \ninvade before we put together a coalition, that is why we had to send \ntroops into combat before they had the necessary body armor to protect \nthemselves, before the Humvee vehicles that our brave soldiers were \ndriving in Iraq were protected with armor, before our helicopters had \nthe necessary defensive equipment, we sent our troops into harm's way.\n\n  The Bush administration saw an urgency based on wrong information. \nToday, neither the President nor Vice President will accept the reality \nthat they were wrong. How can you make a policy in America to make it \nstronger unless and until you accept the reality?\n  Last night, Vice President Cheney could not accept the reality that \nhe was wrong linking 9/11 to Saddam Hussein, and the President cannot \naccept the reality that there were no weapons of mass destruction. In \nfact, now the report says the best they can find was a desire to build \nweapons of mass destruction. Is that what it takes to justify a \npreemptive attack on a country, that its leader may desire to create a \nweapon that could threaten us? I certainly hope the standard would be \nmuch higher.\n  If you look at the record--I listened to the Senator from Minnesota \nwho talked to us about domestic issues--it is hard to imagine that they \nare going to make an argument on the Republican side that this has been \na successful administration when it comes to domestic issues.\n  Just take a look at private sector jobs. Under President Clinton, \n20.7 million private sector jobs were created; under President Bush, we \nlost 1.6 million private sector jobs. You have to go back 70 years \nthrough Democratic and Republican Presidents to find such a failure in \nthe creation of jobs. But this administration clings tenaciously to the \nnotion that their economic policy is the best.\n  I see the Senator from Delaware. How much time do I have remaining in \nmorning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Chair advise me when I have 1 minute remaining?\n  Let me also talk about our fiscal situation. When we talk about the \nneed for more money for education, more money for health care, tax \ncredits for small businesses to provide health insurance, tax \ndeductions for families to help pay for college tuition, we find we are \nin a difficult position to even consider it. Why?\n  Here is the chart that tells the story. Take a look at this. As \nPresident Clinton left office, there was a $236 billion surplus in the \nFederal Treasury. Today, under President Bush's leadership, there is a \ndeficit of $422 billion, the largest deficit in the history of the \nUnited States.\n  We have our hands tied when it comes to doing things to help American \nfamilies get through this tough time when they see the cost of \ngasoline, the cost of health care, and the cost of college tuition \ngoing up, while their personal incomes are not increasing.\n  Take a look, as well, at the specifics when it comes to real \nhousehold income for families in America under President Bush. It \ndeclined by $1,535, 4 years of President Bush; real family income down \n$1,500.\n  Now take a look at the cost to families. Under President Bush's \nleadership, the cost of family health care premiums has gone up $3,599. \nWhen Senator Edwards turned last night to Vice President Cheney and \nsaid, I don't think America can take 4 more years of this, this is what \nhe is talking about. Real family income is declining and the cost to \nfamilies for the necessities of life is increasing.\n  What we are finding out over and over is that families are not better \noff. We have seen household income go down under the Bush \nadministration, gasoline prices up 22 percent, college tuition costs up \n28 percent, family health care premiums up 45 percent. That is the \nharsh reality of the cost of\n\n[[Page S10476]]\n\nliving for working families across America.\n  When Senator Edwards confronted Vice President Cheney last night with \nthose realities, what the Vice President said was, Well, we certainly \nhope everyone can find a job. Hope is not enough. You need a policy \nthat does not reward the wealthiest in America with tax cuts, but that \ninstead helps working families deal with the realities of the costs of \nlife.\n  The Vice President and the President are wrong. They are wrong in \ntheir policies and some say resolute, I say perhaps too resolute, in \nsticking with the policy that has failed.\n  We are in a position where we need new leadership. We have that \nopportunity, and last night's debate showed the sharp contrast between \nthe projected programs and hopes and policies of the Kerry/Edwards \nticket as opposed to the harsh realities of the programs we have seen \nover the last 4 years.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have 5 \nminutes and the Senator from Delaware have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object to that request. If the Senator from Alaska is \ngoing to address me, I would like to have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator will not yield to me, I will not yield to \nhim. I want 5 minutes and the Senator from Delaware wants 5 minutes. \nDoes the Senator object?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object, Mr. President.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that, under the order \nthat is now before the Senate, we on the minority side have about 3\\1/\n2\\ minutes remaining; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Delaware be \ngiven 5 minutes and the Senator from Alaska be given 10 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I object. I only want 5 minutes, and I want to be able \nto respond to the Senator from Illinois. He would not yield to me. I \nsee no reason why I should yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Carper has 3 minutes now. There is no unanimous \nconsent request pending now, is there?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What is the time situation?\n  Mr. REID. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Carper.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. The \nSenator from Delaware is recognized for 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I cannot hear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, later this morning, I will introduce \nlegislation, along with Senator Biden, calling for a feasibility study \nby the Department of the Interior for establishing a National Park \nService unit in a State that has never had a national park.\n  Believe it or not, the State that started the Nation, the first State \nto ever ratify the Constitution, has no national park.\n  The State in which the first Swedes and Finns came to America and \nlanded on what is now Wilmington, DE, calling it New Sweden, has no \nnational park.\n  The State where John Dickinson grew up, who is a coauthor of the \nGreat Compromise creating a bicameral legislature, has no national \npark.\n  I could go on.\n  The heritage of our State and the history of our State together \ncreate a fabric which, in a sense, is the tapestry of America. Senator \nBiden and I thus call on the Department of the Interior to conduct a \nfeasibility study to see if maybe a wonderful idea that has evolved \nfrom a committee led by Dr. Jim Soles, a professor at the University of \nDelaware, might win favor with the Department of the Interior and maybe \nwith our colleagues in the year to come.\n  What is being proposed is a Delaware national coastal heritage park.\n  It would weave together many of the elements and attractions along \nthe coast of our State, which include the Atlantic Ocean, the Delaware \nBay, and the Delaware River.\n  For the last year or more, a wonderful group of Delawareans has \nworked together with the Delaware State Division of Parks and \nRecreation, with the National Park Service, with the Delaware Division \nof Historical and Cultural Affairs to develop what we believe is a \nunique and innovative concept, a concept that would include four hubs. \nThe major hub would be in Wilmington, DE, at the rocks where the first \nSwedes and Finns came ashore in 1638 to America to establish what is \nnow the longest living active Episcopal church, Old Swedes Church, in \nNorth America.\n  That hub would be almost like the hub of a wheel, with spokes \nemanating to historic sites, natural areas, recreational opportunities, \nand other attractions in the area. There would be three other similar \nhubs up and down the State of Delaware as well.\n  Later today, when I have more time, I welcome the opportunity to \nshare with my colleagues a bit more about this proposal.

The second \namendment, No. 3830, modifies a certain provision related to the \nCentral Intelligence Agency and that amendment is at the desk. \nAmendment No. 3882 revises the provisions related to the inspector \ngeneral of the National Intelligence Authority. It conforms these \nprovisions to those in the Inspector General Act and avoids duplication \nof the inspector general efforts across the impacted agencies. That \namendment is at the desk.\n  I appreciate the courtesy of the managers of the bill and their \nstaffs, and their willingness to engage in dialog on these amendments \nwith me and my staff.\n  We are still working to resolve differences over amendment No. 3827 \nregarding the information-sharing network to address some of the \nconcerns identified by the White House and others. We hope to reach a \nresolution on that language this morning, but, as I said, I thank the \nmanagers of the bill for their help in resolving these issues. It has \nbeen a matter of great concern to those of us who have worked with the \nintelligence community for quite some time.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that amendments Nos. 3840, 3830, and 3882 \nbe amended as noted in the revised amendments that I have sent to the \ndesk; that the amendments be considered en bloc and adopted en bloc, \nand that the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Alaska \nfor working with Senator Lieberman and me to resolve these three \namendments. I very much appreciate the good-faith suggestions that were \nmade on both sides, and I am grateful to him for working with us to \naddress his concerns.\n  I think we have come up with very good suggestions, and I am pleased \nthat the amendments have been adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time do I have remaining of the 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n\n\n                      Weapons of Mass Destruction\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have heard this talk about the \ninspectors and their conclusion that they have not found weapons of \nmass destruction. Seventeen times the United Nations asked Saddam \nHussein to disclose where the weapons of mass destruction were. We know \nhe used them on the Kurds. We know he used them in Iran. We know we \nhave evidence he was trying to build additional weapons but the \ninspectors kept asking to return. They asked again and again to return \nso they could find out if there was evidence of where he had those \nweapons of mass destruction.\n\n[[Page S10479]]\n\n  Now they are before the Armed Services Committee this morning and \nthey are going to testify that they have found ``no evidence'' of the \nweapons of mass destruction. We had the same conclusion with regard to \nthe Iraqi air force. We were told Saddam had destroyed a series of \nairplanes. Later we found them buried in the Iraqi desert--a whole \nseries of airplanes--the whole airplane buried. It was capable of being \ndug up, brought out of the dirt and used.\n  Now, we have not found the weapons of mass destruction yet. This \nSenator believes he had them. We know he had them in the Kurd area. We \nknow he used them on Iran. This idea that somehow or another the \nPresident or the Vice President have lied, I am tired of hearing this \ndisrespect for the President and Vice President of the United States \nand I will be willing to debate any time what happened in Iraq.\n  I went to Kuwait time after time, and to Saudi Arabia, and talked to \nthe pilots who were flying the continuous air patrol over Iraq. Since \nthe gulf war, our pilots were up there every day, and every day they \nwere shot at by ground-to-air weapons that Saddam was not supposed to \nhave at all.\n  This idea that somehow or another the President and Vice President of \nthe United States lied because they believed there were weapons of mass \ndestruction there, I believe there are weapons of mass destruction \nthere and I still believe there are weapons there somewhere. Where they \nhave taken them, I do not know, but they have not found them. The \ninspectors kept finding enough reason to go back and go back. They went \nback 17 times.\n  To say the President lied, what about those inspectors who said, We \nhave to go back; we have not found them yet but we are going to find \nsome more? Did they lie?\n  I think there ought to be greater respect for the Presidency and the \nVice Presidency of this country, and in this campaign. I have never \nheard such disrespect. I did not go out and campaign against President \nClinton and say he lied, and yet we know he did. He admitted he lied \nabout the matters that were before the grand jury. Now we did not go \nout and accuse the President of lying. We had a lot of discussions on \nthe floor about that.\n  So if we want to compare Presidents and who lied and who did not, I \nam ready any time the Democrats want to do it, but I am tired of this \ndisrespect. It is time we showed respect for the system. I do not \nremember in the past when a Senator asked another Senator to yield and \nif that Senator had time, it normally would happen. At the very least \nthe Senator would say: Let me finish my statement now and I will yield \nat the end of my statement. That kind of senatorial courtesy has to \ncome back to the Senate.\n  If the Senator wants me to yield, I will yield the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Has the Senator yielded the floor?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding I have 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say that----\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator has 10 minutes on his time on the 1 hour to \nwhich the Senator is entitled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will check the record, he \nwill find that without exception I have always yielded for a question \nbut I was in a difficult position because the Senator from Delaware \nwanted to speak after me. In the entire amount of time given to me, I \nwould have been happy to yield.\n  I think, frankly, dialog between two Senators is something perilously \nclose to debate in the Senate, which we hardly ever have. I am sorry we \ndid not have that opportunity, but I think we have the opportunity at \nthis moment.\n  What I hear from the Senator from Alaska is that we should show \nrespect for the Office of the Presidency. I could not agree more. \nWhether the President is of my party or any other party, he should be \ngiven respect. Even if I disagree with that President, his policy or \nhis statements, I am hoping that I will always be viewed as a person \nwho has that respect for the Office of the Presidency. That is the \nleast that is expected of every single Member of Congress, and I hope \nthe people across the United States.\n  Having said that, I do not believe that disagreeing with the policies \nof an administration is disrespectful. In fact, I think it is part of \nthe national debate which makes America so unique.\n  I do not believe it is disrespectful to say that the information \ngiven by the President, the Vice President, the Secretary of Defense, \nand the Secretary of State was wrong and misleading. It was. I have \nnever used the word ``lie,'' nor would I because a lie means there was \na deliberate misrepresentation. I don't have any evidence there was a \ndeliberate misrepresentation. But there was a misrepresentation, at \nleast in four specific elements. Let me tell you what they were.\n  The administration misled the American people in believing there were \nweapons of mass destruction--an arsenal of chemical, biological, and \nnuclear weapons set to strike countries in the Middle East as well as \nthe United States--in Iraq before our invasion. We know now, based on \nclear and convincing evidence, there is no indication that Saddam \nHussein ever had these arsenals of weapons of mass destruction. So when \nthe President and the administration said that to justify the invasion, \nthey were wrong. The American people were misled. That is a fact.\n  Point No. 2, this administration misled the American people about the \ncapacity of Iraq to build nuclear weapons. Yesterday I came to the \nfloor and talked about the most recent disclosure about aluminum tubes. \nThe American people were misled into believing Saddam Hussein was about \nto become a nuclear power, threatening the region and the United \nStates. The administration was wrong. The American people were misled.\n  Point No. 3, the administration said there was linkage, and I quoted \nthis morning direct quotes from Vice President Cheney. They argued \nthere was linkage between Saddam Hussein and the 9/11 tragedy in \nAmerica; that somehow Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida were consorting to \nattack the United States. We have seen repeatedly through the 9/11 \nCommission Report, the Senate Intelligence Committee report, as well as \nclear statements now, today, by the Secretary of Defense, that was \nwrong. The American people were misled. That is a fact.\n  These elements are facts that cannot be denied. To say the \nadministration misled the American people is there for the record. I \nhave not said the President lied. But I do say he gave wrong \ninformation to the American people, and even the President has conceded \nthat fact. When the Secretary of Defense says there is no linkage, when \nthe President removes the offensive words from the State of the Union \nAddress, he concedes the fact that statements made before the invasion \nwere misleading and they were wrong.\n  Why in the world can't this administration accept that reality? Why \ndo they have to cling to the fiction that was presented to the American \npeople?\n  The Senator from Alaska said we should show respect for the \nPresidency, and I agree. But more important, we need to show respect \nfor the American people. They are the ones we serve, the President and \nevery Member of Congress. We need to show them respect by giving them \nthe clear, unvarnished truth so they understand the facts before we \nmake critical decisions.\n  We have now lost over 1,050 of our best and brightest and bravest \nAmerican soldiers in Iraq. We lost them because we invaded that country \nbefore we let the inspectors do their job in Iraq, before we created a \nbroad coalition of countries that would join us in this military \neffort, and here we stand today.\n  Last night, Vice President Cheney said don't demean the coalition. \nOther countries stand with us. I certainly respect the fact that they \nwould stand by the side of America. But make no mistake, when you open \nthe morning paper, regularly, virtually every morning you learn of the \ndeath of another American soldier. It is American soldiers who are \nfighting and dying in Iraq in much greater numbers, even, than any \nother country I should say, and much greater numbers than I think \nshould be the case.\n  Had this President done the same thing his father did, gone to the \nUnited Nations for approval of our invasion, put together a coalition \nof nations\n\n[[Page S10480]]\n\nwhich included Arab nations--President Bush's father understood that, \nin the Persian Gulf. He knew that to bring in Arab nations as part of \nthe coalition meant there would be less resentment in Arab states for \nour action. This President did not wait to bring in an Arab state to \nhelp us in this coalition of the willing. As a consequence, the \nresentment against the actions of the United States in the Arab world \nhas been growing apace, and we have found the recruiting efforts to \nfind more terrorists to not only invade Iraq and kill our soldiers but \nto spread around the world are mushrooming. Are we safer today because \nof that invasion, because we didn't build the coalition? I think not.\n\n  I am glad Saddam Hussein is in prison. I am glad he is out of power. \nBut don't diminish the cost to the United States and the fact that \nthere is no end in sight to this war in Iraq.\n  There was no plan from this administration to execute this war and \nprotect our troops with body armor, with Humvees armored, with \nprotective equipment on helicopters, and certainly we understand today, \nbased on Ambassador Bremer's statements just 2 days ago, that we didn't \nhave a sufficient number of troops to bring stability to the region.\n  We are paying the price for those bad decisions. Statements were made \nby this administration that were wrong and misleading. Decisions were \nmade that clearly evidence that we were not prepared, as we should have \nbeen. We are paying that price, and there is no end in sight.\n  If the Senator from Alaska suggests it is disrespectful to the \nPresident to raise these issues, I respectfully disagree with him. It \nis our obligation to have an open, honest, national debate about the \nforeign policy of this country, which involves families far and wide in \nIllinois, Alaska, and around the United States.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am delighted to have an opportunity to \ndebate with the Senator from Illinois because I listened to the \ncomments he made before, comments I violently disagree with. For \ninstance, in 1998, President Clinton went before the general officers \nof this Nation, officers from all of our units of the military, and he \ntold them he believed Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. \nHe laid down a just challenge to Saddam Hussein to come forward and \ndisclose them or he believed he might have to go into Iraq himself. \nThat seems to be forgotten.\n  Apparently, the Senator from Illinois didn't hear the Vice President \nwhen he mentioned Mr. Zarqawi last night, a man who was in Iraq before \neven the problems of Afghanistan who was operating there. He is back \nthere now. He had operated in Afghanistan and Pakistan, was part of the \nbad guys there. Now we know he is back in Iraq again. He is mentioned \nas being one of the senior contacts within the al-Qaida organization \nthat was there before and came back again now. The Vice President has \nmentioned the contacts that existed in the al-Qaida world in Iraq.\n  I still believe he was right. There is no question about it. There \nwas a portion of the terrorist organization in Iraq before, and they \nare back there now.\n  As far as the weapons of mass destruction, I believe at the time we \nhad seen the briefings--and I am one of the eight in the Congress who \nreceived the same briefings the President of the United States got \nabout Iraq. We got them in confidence. As a matter of fact, even the \nstatement the Senator from Illinois made about Mr. Bremer, who is the \nPresident's representative, that is from a classified report that we \nshould not be discussing on the floor. It ended up somehow being \nleaked, that one line from the report. But the report deals with the \noverall relationship of Mr. Bremer to the whole process.\n  The problem is this: When we look at the Bremer situation, what \nBremer did--we were there. We talked to him. He did want more forces \naround Baghdad. He thought there should be more. The President relied \nupon our general officers. He told me personally and he told us as we \nwent to Iraq and came back from Iraq, we are doing what our general \nofficers request, as far as the troop strength is concerned.\n\n  The general officers disagreed with Bremer as to the location of \nthose forces. There is no question about it. We probably should have \nhad more. In my opinion, we should have been able to come through Iraq \nfrom the north, through Turkey, and come from the south from Kuwait, \nand had two forces moving through Iraq and squash those people over \nthere.\n  Instead, because of developments in Turkey, we could not go through \nTurkey. We flew our troops down to Kuwait, we took their supples all \nthe way around, and when the supplies reached them they then went in, \nand instead of having forces meet in Baghdad, particularly in Saddam \nHussein's home part of Iraq, they then come back to Baghdad, and that \nleft them spread out. My memory is that the insurrection started in the \nsouth because the forces had gone north and we couldn't spread them \nthat thin.\n  People said: Send more troops. Send more troops. We heard that on the \nfloor: Send more troops. The ability to maintain and supply those \ntroops was a real difficult situation, particularly when all the \nsupport supplies were coming through Kuwait. We even started sending \nsome supplies through Jordan.\n  But the problem really is what happened in terms of Saddam Hussein, \nin terms of the relationship to al-Qaida, and the relationship to \nweapons of mass destruction. I stood here on the floor of the Senate \nand called Saddam Hussein a Hitler. I did that at least 9 months before \nthe war started. I still believe he was a Hitler. He invaded Kuwait, \nand we had to kick him out. He was rebuilding his military within that \narea that he still maintained control of in Iraq. We had control of the \nsouth and north part of his country. Yet look at it in terms of the no-\nfly zone we were trying to protect.\n  But in terms of the part he controlled he was rebuilding his military \nbecause of the money that came into his hands through the ``food-for-\noil'' program.\n  You can stand here, no matter what you say, and say we haven't found \nweapons of mass destruction. That is true. We haven't found them. I \nstill believe there are some out there, whether they are in adjoining \nnations or buried in the ground. Whatever happened to them, he had \nthem.\n  To accuse the administration of misleading the public when they \nrelied upon the intelligence analysts that we relied on--the same \nintelligence analysts President Clinton relied on when he made his 1998 \nspeech. Certainly those of us who were here supported the resolution \nthat asked the President to send troops into Iraq; we believed it. When \nyou look at it, if we want to get into situations when Senator Kerry \nvoted against the 1991 war resolution in spite of what Iraq did in \ninvading Kuwait, he voted against us going into Kuwait to liberate \nKuwait.\n  I think my friends on the other side of the aisle have been wrong for \n30 years. As a matter of fact, those on the other side of the aisle \nmainly opposed the Reagan buildup in the 1980s. I was chairman of the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee, and I remember those votes. Fifty \ntimes here we voted on amendments that were offered to try to strike \nweapons systems from the defense bill that I managed to bring to the \nfloor to rebuild the military capacity of the United States. All of \nthose amendments came from the other side of the aisle.\n  When you look at it, when you look at the trouble, why did we have a \nshortage of intelligence? President Clinton started degrading human \nintelligence in the CIA. He denuded the intelligence system as far as \nhuman intelligence is concerned because he wanted to rely on the \nsatellites in the air and the communications systems, electrical \nsystems.\n  I cannot believe we are going to get into these one-sided statements. \nI would like to have a full debate. I am sort of at a loss. I don't \nhave my records. The Senator from Illinois has his records, but I don't \nhave them.\n  But I have a feeling that had we not denuded the CIA in the 1990s, we \nwould have had better intelligence. But the information we had relied \nupon, the American public relied upon, and this Senate relied upon when \nwe voted to give the President the right to go into Iraq.\n\n[[Page S10481]]\n\n  To say the President was wrong because he relied on the same \nintelligence we relied upon I think is a faulty argument, and it should \nnot happen on the floor of the Senate in a political season where we \nare trying to destroy the reputation which the President deserves for \nhaving the guts to do what Clinton didn't have the guts to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say in response to the Senator from \nAlaska before he leaves the floor--I want to let him know I want to \nrespond to his comments so there will be no mistake about it.\n  First, the statement that Ambassador Bremer's comments had something \nto do with classified information, what I have said on the floor was \nbased upon some front pages of the newspapers. Ambassador Bremer was \nreported to have said to a private organization in a speech that one of \nthe problems we have in Iraq today stems from the fact that we had an \ninadequate number of troops in the field to bring stability, to stop \nthe looting and violence immediately after the deposition of Saddam \nHussein. That is not classified. It is on the front pages of the \nnewspapers. Ambassador Bremer has now backed away from those comments. \nBut the fact is he made them, and many believe the same thing--that we \nhad an inadequate number of troops at the right and appropriate moment \nand are paying the price today because the insurgency has grown.\n  Second, last night Vice President Cheney, and this morning the \nSenator from Alaska, make a great deal about the so-called Ayman al-\nZawahiri link, a ruthless terrorist who is affiliated with al-Qaida. \nThe Vice President made the statement last night that the Senator made \ntoday--that there was a linkage between Ayman al-Zawahiri and Saddam \nHussein and, therefore, proof positive al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein were \nworking together justified the invasion.\n  I commend to my colleagues and those following the debate this \nmorning's report from MSNBC.com from Washington:\n\n       A CIA report has found no conclusive evidence that former \n     Iraqi President Saddam Hussein harbored Ayman al-Zawahiri \n     which the Bush administration asserted before the invasion of \n     Iraq.\n\n  This is a fact. It comes from the President's own CIA. They continue \nto build these straw men to justify an invasion when the facts don't \nback them up--no weapons of mass destruction, no nuclear arsenal, no \nevidence of bringing in yellowcake from Niger, no evidence of linkage \nwith al-Qaida. And they cling tenaciously and stubbornly to these \nassertions even though the facts defeat them.\n  How can you trust an administration that will not accept the facts \nand reality to prepare a defense for America? Shouldn't the defense of \nour Nation be based on reality rather than theory? Shouldn't it be \nbased on sound intelligence instead of political ideology? I would \nthink so.\n  Any President who comes to this office with a predetermined set of \nideas on what we need to do to protect America regardless of the facts \nis not serving our country well. I hope both political parties would \nacknowledge that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3801\n\n  Let me also say we are about to consider in the early parts of the \ndebate this morning an amendment by Senator Kyl to the underlying bill \non intelligence reform. I oppose this amendment. I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in opposing it.\n  We have come together with a bipartisan agreement on the civil \nliberties board. It is a board which has been created by both sides of \nthe aisle working to implement the recommendations in the 9/11 \nCommission report. What Senator Kyl is trying to do is take away some \nimportant powers and responsibilities of this board.\n  For example, he wants to eliminate the board's standard of review. \nThis is the standard that the board uses to take a look at proposed \nexpansions of the government's power and make sure they don't infringe \non rights. What Senator Kyl suggests is we take away the standard of \nreview from the civil liberties board. That would frankly create a ship \nabove water.\n\n  We need to make sure this board has a standard of review so they can \nlook at government actions and decide whether they go too far. That is \nwhat the 9/11 Commission suggested and that is what we should stick to.\n  Senator Kyl's amendment also would remove the Board's subpoena power. \nHe said he would be concerned that this civil liberties board would be \nsubpoenaing members of our Government, agents of our Government, to \ncome in from all over the world and give them evidence. I hope the \nSenator from Arizona will read this provision more carefully and more \nclosely because the subpoena authority in this bill is very narrow. It \nonly applies to people outside of the Government.\n  The Kyl amendment would also eliminate the requirement of the board \nto inform the public about its activities in a manner consistent with \nprotecting classified information. This directly contradicts the \nrecommendation of the 9/11 Commission. We are talking about protecting \nthe American public's rights, liberties, and freedoms. It is essential \nthat the work of the civil liberties board be made public so the \nAmerican people can understand what they are doing and whether our \nGovernment has gone too far. Why the Senator from Arizona would want to \nkeep secrecy and a veil over this activity, I don't understand.\n  I certainly hope we reject the Kyl amendment which would demolish the \nCollins-Lieberman civil liberties board, a bipartisan creation. It \nwould upset the delicate balance between government powers and civil \nliberties this bill strikes. I urge my colleagues to oppose the \namendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the time for the quorum call \nbe charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Is there still time on both sides under the order that has \nbeen entered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 20 minutes on each side.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Delaware gets 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the minority leader for yielding to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. CARPER pertaining to the introduction of S. 2899 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. REID.

Parliamentary inquiry: Was there time reserved for the \nSenator from Vermont prior to the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I seek recognition in my own right.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator need? I \nbelieve 30 minutes has been reserved for\n\n[[Page S10482]]\n\nSenator Warner and Senator Levin of the hour and a half of debate that \nwas available this morning.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, am I correct that we are planning to vote \nat 11:30 on the Kyl amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the order.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will speak for 3 to 4 minutes on the Kyl \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may say to my distinguished friend, the \nSenator from Vermont, time was evenly divided, and the minority's time \nis gone. We were not aware of the Senator from Vermont needing time.\n  I ask the Senator from Maine, does she wish to make a statement? All \nthe time left is hers.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I do intend to speak, so we need to \nreserve time. I am also concerned that the two Senators who \nspecifically requested time have not had an opportunity to speak.\n  Mr. REID. They have had an opportunity but have not taken it. We need \nto get this vote off near the time. The Senator from Vermont needs 3 or \n4 minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Vermont be recognized \nfor 4 minutes and that time also be added to that of the majority, so \nthere would be an extra 8 minutes. We cannot extend it past that time \nbecause there are things people need to do.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada and the \nSenator from Maine.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the provisions in the Collins-\nLieberman bill establishing a privacy and civil liberties oversight \nboard and to respond to some of the disturbing discourse and efforts to \nundermine those provisions.\n  It is unquestioned that one of the key recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission was the creation of a civil liberties board to fill a clear \nvoid in government structure for addressing these concerns. The \nCommission discovered that there was ``no office within the government \nwhose job it is to look across the government at the actions we are \ntaking to protect ourselves to ensure that liberty concerns are \nappropriately considered.'' In response to this vacuum, the Commission \nexplicitly recommended that ``at this time of increased and \nconsolidated government authority, there should be a board within the \nexecutive branch to oversee adherence to the guidelines we recommend \nand the commitment the government makes to defend our civil \nliberties.'' The 9/11 Commission concluded: ``We must find ways of \nreconciling security with liberty, since the success of one helps \nprotect the other.''\n  The Commission was certainly right. There is no doubt that such a \nboard is needed given the heightened civil liberty tensions created by \nthe realities of terrorism and modern warfare. The tools of the \ninformation age include precise data-gathering, networked databases, \nand tracking and sensing technologies impervious to the common eye. The \nlegal tools are similarly powerful, ranging from substantial \ncapabilities under the USA PATRIOT Act and under our immigration laws. \nAs the Commission noted, ``[e]ven without the changes we recommend, the \nAmerican public has vested enormous authority in the U.S. government.'' \nIn an even more pointed and ominous assessment of these powers, Vice \nChairman Hamilton noted, in a recent Judiciary Committee hearing, these \ndevelopments are ``an astounding intrusion in the lives of ordinary \nAmericans that (are) routine today in government.''\n  One of my colleagues suggested that this bill is solely to strengthen \nour intelligence tools and ``not a bill regarding our civil \nliberties.'' But this is a myopic view. You cannot divorce one from the \nother. Security and liberty are always in tension in a free society, \nand that is readily apparent today. It is our vigilant duty to work \nhard at striking the right balance. We must enhance our capabilities, \nbut with such powerful tools comes heightened responsibility, and the \nCommission has challenged us to take up those reins: ``This shift of \npower and authority to the government calls for an enhanced system of \nchecks and balances to protect the precious liberties that are vital to \nour way of life.''\n  We have an obligation to ensure that there are mechanisms in place \nthat will see to it that this power is subject to appropriate checks \nand balances and congressional oversight. An effective civil liberties \nboard can help provide those checks and contribute to preserving both \nliberty and security.\n  We need a civil liberties board whose members collectively can think \ncritically and independently about the policies we implement as a \nnation and about how they affect our fundamental rights. The board must \nbe able to participate in the policymaking process, review technology \nchoices and options, peer into various agencies and assess actions, \nreview classified materials and investigate concerns. This board must \nhave the versatility to work closely with government officials, but at \nthe same time it must be sufficiently independent to assess those \ngovernment policies without fear, favor or compromise. Given these \nsignificant responsibilities, it is equally important that the board be \naccountable to Congress and the American people.\n  The civil liberties board outlined in the Collins-Lieberman bill \nmakes great strides toward meeting these goals. It represents a true \nbipartisan effort from conception to introduction. I was pleased to \nwork with these Senators along with Senator Durbin to make this civil \nliberties board the kind of board that would honor the 9/11 \nCommission's intent. It should not go without notice that Commissioners \nSlade Gorton and Richard Ben-Veniste issued a bipartisan statement \nthat, ``A civil liberties board of the kind we recommend can be found \nin the Collins-Lieberman bill in the Senate.''\n  This legislation establishes a bipartisan board that would have \naccess to the documents and information needed to assess our \ncounterterrorism policies that affect the vital civil liberties of the \nAmerican people. It provides a mechanism for them to work closely with \nadministration officials, including working with a network of newly \ncreated department-level privacy and civil liberty officers, whose \nproximity to decision makers will ensure that these concerns are \nconsidered from the earliest stages of policy formation. It requires \nthe board to report to Congress on a regular basis, and--without \ncompromising classified information--to inform the public about \npolicies that affect their vital liberties.\n  Unfortunately, Senator Kyl's amendment 3801 attempts to gut the \ncarefully crafted, bipartisan civil liberty and privacy provisions that \nare the hallmark of the Collins-Lieberman bill. It is inconsistent with \nthe recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and would undermine the \ncivil liberties that we cherish.\n  First, Senator Kyl's amendment attempts to cut off the information \nflow that would ensure that the board could accurately, reliably and \neffectively advise on the impact of policies on privacy and civil \nliberties. It would also eliminate the board's ability to subpoena \npeople outside of the government who may have important information, \nsuch as private sector data collectors working on behalf of the \ngovernment. It would also eliminate the privacy officers, as well as \npublic hearings and reports to the public.\n  It is clear that the Commission intended for the board to have access \nto the information that it needed in order to effectively assess \npolicy. In a recent House Judiciary Committee hearing, Vice Chairman \nHamilton said, ``The key requirement is that government agencies must \nbe required to respond to the board.'' He went on to note that the \nCommission itself had subpoena power, and ``if we had not had it, our \njob would have been much, much more difficult.'' I would note that the \nCollins-Lieberman bill does not go as far as to mandate subpoena power \nover government officials, but rather only over relevant non-government \npersons.\n\n  Given the secrecy and civil liberty concerns that have been pervasive \nin this administration, we should be enhancing information flow and \ndialogue, not eliminating it. It is ironic that at the same time that \nthe administration has been making it more difficult for the public to \nlearn what government agencies are up to, the government and its \nprivate sector partners have been\n\n[[Page S10483]]\n\nquietly building more and more databases to learn and store more \ninformation about the American people themselves.\n  Second, Senator Kyl's amendment would eliminate a provision that \ngives the board important guidance on how to review requests by the \ngovernment for new and enhanced powers. This is a critical omission. In \norder to balance liberty and security, we need to ensure that the board \nwill be looking at policies through a prism that would allow for \nheightened security protection, while also ensuring that intrusions are \nnot disproportionate to benefits, or that they would unduly undermine \nprivacy and civil liberties. This guidance would also keep the board \nfocused on the right priorities and prevent the mission creep that some \nfear.\n  Contrary to assertions that this would be a ``citizen board'' gone \nwild that would ``haul any agent in anywhere in the world and grill \nhim,'' this board would consist of highly accomplished members who have \nthe appropriate clearance to access classified information, who have \nextensive professional expertise on civil liberty and privacy issues, \nand who have the knowledge of how to view these concerns in the context \nof important anti-terrorism objectives. Again, its subpoena power would \nbe limited to non-government persons, and so could not used willy-nilly \nto drag in agents from the field.\n  It simply cannot be that the government can create and implement \npolicies that impinge on our liberties without having to account to \nanyone. While that may make things convenient or easy, it certainly \ndoes not preserve the ideals of the country we are fighting to protect. \nAs the Commission reminded us, ``if our liberties are curtailed, we \nlose the values that we are struggling to defend.''\n  Some have suggested that we leave this responsibility to ``federal \nagencies that are already equipped and designed for that function.'' \nBut this misses precisely the point raised in the report. There is \ncurrently no such suitable entity that can look across government and \noffer an independent, uncompromised assessment of the impact of \ngovernment powers on civil liberties. And I emphasize look, because \nsome would suggest that we do not need a board with an affirmative \nobligation to go out and review policy. To the contrary, what we do not \nneed is passivity. We need to be as vigilant about protecting our \nfundamental rights as we are in hunting down and capturing terrorists. \nIt is what Commissioner Gorton, a former Republican Senator from \nWashington, described as a ``watchdog to assure maximum protection of \nindividual rights and liberties in those programs.'' Similarly, \nCommissioner Hamilton has said that ``it ought to have a very tough \ninvestigative staff and it ought to be a very active board and \nagency.''\n  Others have suggested that the administration's recent efforts are a \nsuitable substitute. I strongly disagree. Rather, the Executive Order \nattempted to foist upon us an anemic civil liberties board. I and \nseveral of my colleagues noted in a letter to the President that the \nboard was not a bipartisan or independent entity. It had no authority \nto access information and it had no accountability. It was housed in \nthe Department of Justice, and it was comprised solely of \nadministration officials from the law enforcement and intelligence \ncommunities, precisely the communities that the board would have an \nobligation to oversee. It was the proverbial case of the fox guarding \nthe henhouse. This would not have resulted in a vigorous consideration \nof policy that the Commission intended.\n  As the Commission noted, the ``burden of proof for retaining a \nparticular governmental power should be on the Executive, to explain \n(a) that the power actually materially enhances security and (b) that \nthere is adequate supervision of the Executive's use of the powers to \nensure protection of civil liberties. If the power is granted, there \nmust be adequate guidelines and oversight to properly confine its \nuse.''\n  We should be looking for ways to ensure that this burden of proof \nwill be met, rather than weakening oversight and accountability.\n  As the 9/11 Commission noted, when it comes to security and civil \nliberties, ``while protecting our homeland, Americans should be mindful \nof threats to vital personal and civil liberties. This balancing is no \neasy task, but we must constantly strive to keep it right.''\n  Senator Kyl's amendment fails to ``keep it right,'' and I urge that \nthe Senate honor the spirit of the recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission, and reject it.\n  Senators Collins and Lieberman have it right in their bill and we \nshould not allow that to be gutted.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter to the President from myself \nand others on this subject be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 21, 2004.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     President of the United States,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Bush: We are writing in response to the \n     recent creation and activities of the Administration's Board \n     on Safeguarding Americans' Civil Liberties.\n       One of the key recommendations of the 9/11 Commission was \n     the creation of a civil liberties board to balance the \n     enormous powers granted by the people to the government for \n     protection against terrorism. Critically, it concluded: ``We \n     must find ways of reconciling security with liberty, since \n     the success of one helps protect the other.''\n       There is no doubt that such a board is needed given \n     heightened civil liberty tensions created by the realities of \n     terrorism and modem warfare. The tools of the information age \n     include precise data-gathering, networked databases, and \n     tracking and sensing technologies impervious to the common \n     eye. With such powerful tools comes heightened \n     responsibility.\n       But the civil liberties board established by the August 27, \n     2004, Executive Order and the manner in which it is \n     proceeding do little to further the goal of balancing liberty \n     and security. The board resembles a presidential advisory \n     team, and not an independent, bi-partisan entity. Housed in \n     the Department of Justice, the board will be comprised solely \n     of Administration officials from the law enforcement and \n     intelligence communities, precisely the communities that the \n     board will need to oversee. In essence, this board's \n     responsibility would be to oversee itself; it is the \n     proverbial case of the fox guarding the hen house. Further, \n     the board has no meaningful investigative authority, and \n     there is no apparent role for Congress.\n       While such an entity may help inform the White House of the \n     impact of Administration policies on civil liberties, it is \n     no substitute for the sort of civil liberties board that \n     would meet the 9/11 Commission's call for an ``enhanced \n     system of checks and balances to protect the precious \n     liberties that are vital to our way of life.'' Simply put, \n     the Executive Order does not establish an entity with the \n     authority, independence and accountability necessary to \n     protect civil liberties.\n       Further, the board's hasty meeting, with no discussion of \n     these matters, and with no advance notice to the public, is \n     inherently inconsistent with the very characteristics of \n     openness and accountability necessary to protect civil \n     liberties. A post-meeting press release is simply not the \n     kind of open communication that will foster any trust and \n     confidence in this board's ability to protect the liberties \n     we hold dear.\n       It is important that we have a civil liberties board that \n     can think critically and independently about the policies we \n     implement as a nation and how they impact our fundamental \n     rights. Choices about its composition, powers and \n     accountability should serve that goal and will need to be \n     openly discussed and carefully weighed. The board must be \n     able to participate in the policymaking process, review \n     technology choices, peer into various agencies and assess \n     actions, review classified materials, and investigate \n     concerns. In particular, the hoard will need to be \n     sufficiently independent of the Department of Justice to \n     assess its actions without compromise.\n       Accountability is essential. We cannot assign a board such \n     significant responsibilities without periodically reviewing \n     its progress to ensure that its mandates are being met. \n     Regular reports to Congress and the public provide such \n     checks.\n       As the 9/11 Commission noted, when it comes to security and \n     civil liberties, the ``balancing is no easy task, but we must \n     constantly strive to keep it right.'' We agree. We must do \n     this right and we must do it together. Congress is currently \n     considering various proposals to create an effective civil \n     liberties board that can achieve these goals, and we hope \n     that the Administration and its civil liberties advisors will \n     support and cooperate with Congress in its development.\n           Sincerely,\n     Patrick Leahy,\n     Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Russell D. Feingold,\n       U.S. Senators.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S10484]]\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Will the Senator suspend? Is time yielded to the Senator from West \nVirginia?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \namendment of my good friend from Virginia, Senator Warner. The Warner \namendment would effectively undermine the ability of the national \nintelligence director to manage the intelligence programs by changing \nthe definition in the bill of what constitutes a national intelligence \nprogram.\n  Under the Collins-Lieberman bill, the national intelligence program \nincludes all programs--all programs--projects, and activities of a \nnumber of national intelligence agencies, including the National \nSecurity Agency, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and the \nNational Reconnaissance Office.\n  The Collins-Lieberman bill has been carefully crafted to provide the \nnew intelligence director with the consolidated budget, personnel, and \ntasking authority necessary to manage the newly defined national \nintelligence program. The Warner amendment seeks to unravel this. It is \na major ``undoing'' amendment. It unravels these unified authorities \nunder the intelligence director by giving the Secretary of Defense \nsignificant control over the National Security Agency, the National \nGeospatial-Intelligence Agency, and the National Reconnaissance Office.\n  I specifically mention this troika of national intelligence \nagencies--NSA, NGA, and the NRO--because each agency is partially \nfunded through the Joint Military Intelligence Program budget, known as \nJMIP.\n  For instance, in the President's fiscal year 2005 budget request, 30 \npercent of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's budget comes \nfrom the JMIP. Similarly, hundreds of millions of dollars in the NRO \nand NSA budgets are funded through JMIP.\n  The Warner amendment would eliminate these programs from the \ndefinition of the national intelligence program, thereby splitting the \nmanagement of these national intelligence agencies between the national \nintelligence director and the Secretary of Defense.\n  It is very important to note that these programs are not--repeat \nnot--tactical military intelligence programs. The Secretary of Defense \nwould retain control over these tactical military programs under the \npending bill. So under the Collins-Lieberman bill, the national \nintelligence director, consistent with the 9/11 Commission mandate, is \ngiven authority over the programs and activities of these three basic \nprograms.\n  But now the Warner amendment would have the Senate say: Hold on, we \ndo not want the director to have complete authority over these \nagencies. We want a sizable portion of their activities to be jointly \nshared, jointly managed, jointly tasked by the national intelligence \ndirector and the Secretary of Defense.\n  That is exactly what the situation is today and why we are trying to \nchange all of this. It is exactly the type of bifurcated arrangement \nthe 9/11 Commission highlighted as fundamentally dysfunctional. This is \nexactly the type of crossways organizational setup that inhibits our \nintelligence community from achieving efficiency and effectiveness of \nmanagement that we need to protect our national security. This is \nexactly the type of problem the Collins-Lieberman bill would correct.\n  Adoption of the Warner amendment would strip away from the national \nintelligence director an essential ability to manage what is now an \nintelligence community in name but not in reality.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Mr. President, I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia \nfor his comments.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the \nSenator from Arizona and the Senator from Georgia to each have 2 \nminutes to discuss their amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 2 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3801\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we are going to be asking unanimous consent \nto withdraw amendment No. 3801, which is an amendment Senator Chambliss \nand I offered to deal with the problem of overlapping and redundant \ncivil rights and privacy investigations, entities, or individuals that \nwould be added to those that already exist to protect civil rights and \nprivacy in the national intelligence director office and other offices \nof the intelligence community.\n  The head of the 9/11 Commission, Philip Zelikow, the Executive \nDirector, noted one of the biggest problems we have with our \nintelligence collection and analysis when he said:\n\n       We also found--\n\n  ``We'' meaning the 9/11 Commission--\n\n       that the 9/11 story illustrated the danger of risk aversion \n     from constant worry of being investigated. We gave several \n     important examples of officials who overinterpreted existing \n     legal constraints for fear of exceeding their authority. We \n     were also astonished by the extent to which CIA officials, \n     beyond any others in the Government, already conduct their \n     work in a manner that anticipates and guards themselves for \n     the prospect of future investigations.\n\n  We found this in the Intelligence Committee, and the 9/11 Commission \nfound the same thing--a profound aversion to taking risks because of \nall the people looking over the shoulders of these agents, ready to \npounce on them if they do anything wrong or make a mistake.\n  What does the underlying legislation do? It exacerbates the problem \nbecause it requires that existing agencies of the Government either \ndesignate an existing officer or create a new position for privacy and \ncivil liberties. Notwithstanding the fact that each Department--\nHomeland Security, Health and Human Services, CIA, and others--already \nhave officers with the responsibility, including an inspector general, \nchief privacy officer, and the officer for civil rights and civil \nliberties.\n  In each one of these agencies, those officers currently exist. There \nis a new mandate placed on all of them, in addition to which the \nPresident, following the 9/11 Commission recommendation, appointed his \nown board on Safeguarding American's Civil Liberties, and the bill \ncreates a privacy and civil liberties oversight board with subpoena \npower and puts under the National Intelligence Authority an officer for \ncivil rights and liberties and a privacy officer, in addition to the \nalready existing inspector general.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. And the creation of an ombudsman. This is overkill. It is \ngoing to exacerbate the problem of risk aversion with having too many \npeople looking over the shoulder of too many people we tasked with the \ndifficult job of collecting and analyzing intelligence.\n  Mr. President, 9/11 did not happen because we had too many people \nwith privacy being violated or civil rights being violated. It happened \nbecause our intelligence was not good enough. Too many of these are \ngoing to impede our intelligence, and that is why we offered this \namendment. I regret we are going to have to withdraw it, but I \nappreciate the fact that the sponsors of the legislation are committed \nto working with us in the conference to try to bring a better balance \nto the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arizona for \nhis tremendous leadership on this particular issue.\n  I voted yesterday with our leadership to invoke cloture on this bill, \nbut, frankly, I did so reluctantly because I sympathize with the \ncomments that the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, made just yesterday \nand the day before relative to the fact that we are rushing into an \nissue that is so complex that we really need to take the time to do \nthis right. But I understand we are at\n\n[[Page S10485]]\n\nthe end of this session and that we need to get this bill done and get \nit to conference. That is the only reason that Senator Kyl and I are \nwilling to withdraw this amendment. Let's get it to conference and try \nto clean this up there.\n\n  Once again, I have been reminded about the problems we have at the \nCIA under the leadership now of a new CIA Director whose hands are \ngoing to be tied by this particular provision that we are seeking to \nmodify in this bill. We are concentrating, from an overall intelligence \nreform standpoint, on building up our collection of intelligence \nthrough human assets. But now with the creation of the civil liberties \nboard in this bill, a political bureaucracy is being established that \nis going to be looking over the shoulder of every CIA agent around the \nworld and is going to have the ability to determine whether that CIA \nagent violated the civil liberties of somebody in the prosecution of \ngathering intelligence. I think this is a very harmful provision in \nthis bill.\n  The Senator from Arizona has provided strong leadership on this \nissue, and I thank him for that. We need to clean up the provision of \nthe bill as it relates to the civil liberties board before we destroy \nthe morale of our agents in the field. While I regret we are going to \nhave to withdraw the amendment at this point in time, I also am \nencouraged by the comments of the chairman, as well as Senator \nLieberman, that they are willing to work with us as we move into \nconference. It is critical to make the necessary modifications in \nconference to ensure that our intelligence community has a free hand in \ntrying to gather intelligence to protect the lives of our citizens \nwithout violating civil liberties, and without violating privacy \nrights. Our intelligence professionals have and will conduct their \ndangerous and important work within the framework of our laws.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3801, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the two Senators. I understand \ntheir concern. This issue is going to be the subject of much \ndiscussion, I am sure, in the Senate-House conference.

Mr. President, I thank Senator Roberts for offering this \namendment. As chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, his \nexpertise and advice on this bill have been invaluable. As he \nindicates, this preserves a requirement in section 504 of the National \nSecurity Act of 1947 that funds appropriated for an intelligence \nactivity must also be specifically authorized before being obligated or \nexpended.\n  It is my understanding that other committees with interest in this \nmatter have been consulted and there is no objection. I will ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment and \nthank Senator Roberts for offering it. I thank him generally for the \nmany ways in which he has strengthened this bill.\n  The bottom line here is this amendment will ensure that intelligence \nactivities, which by their nature are classified and not subject to \npublic scrutiny, receive specific review and authorization by the \nSenate and House of Representatives Intelligence Committees. It is \nanother way to make clear that what we have said all along, that this \nbill does not represent an alteration of power and authority between \nthe Congress and the executive branch, is in fact what happens. I thank \nthe Senator and I am glad to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested.

Could we make that 2:15?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I would be glad to amend the request to \nmake it 2:15. I ask unanimous consent that be the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3945\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I understand my amendment regarding \ntranslators, No. 3945, is now before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is pending.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, this is an amendment on behalf of myself \nand Senator Grassley. We did this because 3 years ago, a law was passed \nrequiring the Attorney General to report on the FBI translators \nprogram, why it was failing, and how he is going to fix it. The \nAttorney General has never followed the law and submitted that report.\n  Our amendment requires the Attorney General to submit a report on FBI \ntranslators within 30 days of enactment of this act.\n  Senator Grassley, of course, is well known as being one of the most \nvigilant people on FBI oversight issues.\n  Last week the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General \nreleased an unclassified version of its Audit of the FBI's Foreign \nLanguage Program. The report shows that despite concerns expressed for \nyears by some of us in Congress and by former FBI contractors, among \nothers, and despite an influx of tens of millions of dollars to hire \nnew linguists, the FBI foreign language translation unit continues to \nbe saddled with growing backlogs, systemic difficulties, security \nproblems, too few qualified staff, and an astounding lack of \norganization.\n  What is the use of taping thousands of hours of conversations of \nintelligence targets in foreign languages if we cannot translate the \nmaterial promptly, securely, accurately and efficiently? The \nadministration owes Congress and the American public an explanation as \nto why it has repeatedly failed to take the necessary steps to fix \nthese serious intelligence failings.\n  Almost 3 years ago, Congress required the Attorney General to report \nupon where the FBI translators program was failing and how he was going \nto fix it. The Attorney General has never submitted that report.\n  To make sure that report is delayed no more, and to respond to the \nInspector General's recommendations, Senator Grassley and I have \noffered the Translator Reports Act of 2004 as an amendment. I am proud \nto be joined in this effort by my friend from Iowa, who has been ever-\nvigilant on FBI oversight issues.\n  Our amendment requires the Attorney General to submit a report on FBI \ntranslators within 30 days of enactment of the National Intelligence \nReform Act. It also adds further reporting requirements that will be \ncrucial to understanding whether or not the FBI is capable of fixing, \nand has fixed, the problems outlined by the Inspector General.\n\n[[Page S10487]]\n\n  This report will allow Congress to meet the 9/11 Commission's \ndirective that Congress exercise greater oversight over the \ncounterintelligence and counterterrorism needs of the executive branch. \nI urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator from Vermont \nworking with Senator Lieberman and me. His amendment would require the \nAttorney General to submit annual reports to the House and Senate \nJudiciary Committees on the number of translators employed or \ncontracted for by the FBI and other components of the Department of \nJustice, the needs of the FBI for translation services, a description \nof the implementation of quality control procedures, among other \nprovisions.\n  As we know, there is a serious backlog of translation in the FBI, and \nthis sends a very strong message that Congress is going to be carefully \nmonitoring the progress of this program.\n  I urge support for the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for \nthis amendment. It responds to a direct call, a conclusion of the 9/11 \nCommission report that the FBI did not dedicate sufficient resources to \nthe surveillance and translation needs of counterterrorism agents and \nlacks sufficient translators proficient in Arabic and other key \nlanguages.\n  The reporting requirement contained in this amendment will obviously \nhelp and force Congress to determine the scope of the problem and \ndevelop possible fixes. I thank the Senator from Vermont for his \ninitiative and accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3945.\n  The amendment (No. 3945) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3821, As Modified\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I call up among the pending \namendments amendment No. 3821 offered by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nHarkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask unanimous consent on behalf of Senator Harkin to \nsend a modification of the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 158, between lines 9 and 10 insert the following:\n       (C) the minority views on any findings, conclusions, and \n     recommendations of the Board resulting from its advice and \n     oversight functions under subsection (d).\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I urge adoption of the amendment, as \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the modified \namendment?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Very briefly, the Harkin amendment is focused on a \nrequirement relative to the new board we are creating in this proposal. \nThe new board, to watch out for the privacy and civil liberties rights \nof American citizens and others, is required to make periodic reports \nto Congress. This amendment now simply says that in those reports, \nthere should be an opportunity for minority views to be recorded as \nwell. It is a good amendment, as modified, having eliminated some more \ncontroversial provisions. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I very much appreciate the fact that \nthe Senator from Iowa has worked with us on it. The revised amendment, \nunlike the original, is one I support and I, too, urge adoption of the \nmodified amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3821), as modified was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3809, as Modified\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed to \nthe consideration of Levin amendment No. 3809, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is pending.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 3962 To Amendment No. 3809, as Modified\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I call up a second-degree amendment to \nthat amendment. The second degree is numbered 3962. I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for herself and Mr. \n     Lieberman, proposes an amendment numbered 3962 to amendment \n     No. 3809, as modified.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 1, line 3, strike ``military'' and all that follows \n     through page 2, line 9, and insert the following:\n\n     uniformed services personnel, except that the Director may \n     transfer military positions or billets if such transfer is \n     for a period not to exceed three years; and\n       (E) nothing in section 143(i) or 144(f) shall be construed \n     to authorize the Director to specify or require the head of a \n     department, agency, or element of the United States \n     Government to approve a request for the transfer, assignment, \n     or detail of uniformed services personnel, except that the \n     Director may take such action with regard to military \n     positions or billets if such transfer is for a period not to \n     exceed three years.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I am going to have Senator Levin first \ndiscuss this issue, and then Senator Lieberman and I will respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, military personnel comprise an important \npart of the national intelligence community. Managing military \npersonnel is the appropriate function of the Secretary of Defense and \nthe military departments.\n  The bill, as drafted, would permit the transfer of military personnel \nwithin the national intelligence program. This amendment strikes that \nlanguage and does not permit the transfer of the military personnel \nwithin the national intelligence program.\n  The second-degree amendment makes it clear that the positions, of \ncourse, cannot be transferred. In other words, providing that the \npeople who are in those positions are not transferred by the national \nintelligence director, if it is just the money for the positions, which \nproviding it falls within the scope of reprogramming, for instance, and \ncan be done in any event; providing it is the positions or the money \nattached to the positions that are transferred from one part of the \nintelligence community to another, that we do not prevent. It is the \ntransfer of uniformed people that cannot be accepted, and this \namendment would prevent that from happening.\n  So if we are in a situation, for instance, where the national \nintelligence director says, I want those five people from a particular \nagency, and if these are uniform military personnel, that would not be \npossible when my amendment is adopted. The national intelligence \ndirector would be able to transfer positions, or the money, and say\n\n[[Page S10488]]\n\n$400,000 or $1 million or whatever, providing, again, it is within or \nbelow the limit that is established, which would require programming \napproval by the Congress; providing it is below that limit, the NID \ncontinues to have that authority, which he would have in any event, to \ntransfer funds or positions from one place to another. So we don't \ntouch the money or the positions.\n  However, we maintain a chain of command. We maintain military \ncareers. These are uniform military careers, and we do not have an \noutside civilian person changing that career by transferring a uniform \nmilitary person from one place to another.\n  I thank my colleagues, the managers of the bill, for working out this \nlanguage with us. It is a very important change in terms of military \ncareers, in terms of military personnel, in terms of the management of \nmilitary personnel, in terms of morale. But it does not disturb, again, \nthe budgetary power or the shifting around of budgets--or billets, as \nwe call them--or positions, providing, again, they are underneath and \nwithin the limits established by the reprogramming procedures that have \nbeen established, where individual agency heads are allowed to transfer \nmoney from one place to another. If it is above that limit, it is \nestablished by the reprogramming procedures, then, of course, they have \nto go through the normal reprogramming process before money can be \ntransferred from one place to another.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, the Collins-Lieberman bill grants the \nnational intelligence director the authority to transfer personnel \nwithin the national intelligence program to meet higher priorities. \nThis is extremely important authority because we want to make sure the \nNID can, for example, staff up the National Counterterrorism Center \nwith individuals from a variety of agencies, including military \npersonnel who may be at the Defense Intelligence Agency, for example.\n  But the compromise that we have reached addresses two important \nconcerns. One, it puts a 3-year limit on the length of time for this \npersonnel. That is important because we don't want to disrupt the \nmilitary careers of individuals who are temporarily transferred. \nSecond, it makes clear that we are talking about slots, or billets, and \nnot individual members of the military.\n  In other words, the NID cannot say: I want ``Colonel Murkowski'' to \ngo to the National Counterterrorism Center. Instead, the NID would say: \nI want a linguist to go to the National Counterterrorism Center, or \ndescribe what the slot may be.\n  I think this is a good compromise on this issue, and it leaves intact \nthe strong authority of the national intelligence director, while \naddressing the legitimate concerns raised by Senator Levin.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise to support this modification \nof the amendment. Here, again, we have reasoned together about the \nsignificant changes that will come about as a result of the underlying \nproposal in the creation of an NID. I think it will come out with a \nresult that is fair and will be effective.\n  As I have said before, our intelligence forces today are like an army \nwithout a general. The whole idea of creating an NID is to put somebody \nin charge. Part of being in charge has to mean the ability to transfer \nthe forces to places where the director thinks they are needed.\n  Senator Levin was understandably concerned about the impact that \nmight have on the military chain of command. In an initial proposal he \nsaid these transfers could not occur without the approval of the \nSecretary of Defense. We thought that would frustrate the authority \nthat we are trying to give to the national intelligence director. So we \nhave come to a very reasonable compromise, which is, as Senator Collins \nand Senator Levin said, with regard to uniform military personnel \nworking within the intelligence community. If the NID believes he needs \nthree, four, or five positions from military intelligence, the slots \ncan be moved. But the NID, with regard to uniformed military personnel, \ncannot go in and say, I want--as Senator Collins said--``Colonel \nMurkowski'' to be transferred to the national intelligence center, or \nsome other subdivision of the intelligence community. That is quite \nreasonable. But it would allow the position, the slot, to be \ntransferred. And then, presumably, for a process of negotiation, it \nwould allow a process of negotiation to go on for the Secretary of \nDefense or the NID, or their designees, as to who actually filled that \nslot. With regard to nonuniformed personnel, including military \npersonnel, those within the Department of Defense, they can be \ntransferred by the national intelligence director, acting on his own.\n  I think this is a very good, balanced compromise. I thank Senator \nLevin for his characteristic thoughtfulness. I even thank him for his \npersistence, which I think has brought about a good result. I am happy \nto support this amendment, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, my thanks to the managers, not just for \ntheir work on this amendment, but their work generally on this bill.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is considering \nthe Hatch-Leahy substitute to H.R. 1417, the ``Copyright Royalty and \nDistribution Reform Act of 2004,'' which provides a much-needed \noverhaul of the process by which statutory royalty rates are determined \nand the manner in which the fees paid pursuant to statutory licenses \nare distributed to copyright holders.\n  The extensive reforms made this bill are important to virtual all the \nparticipants in the process, and I hope that my colleagues will consent \nto move this bill without delay.\n  The measure we are considering today represents a recently-reached \ncompromise which I am hopeful can be enacted without delay.\n  Because the areas of disagreement with H.R. 1417 were relatively \nnarrow in scope, the Hatch-Leahy substitute to H.R. 1417 retains most \nof the House-passed bill, but does contain a few important changes that \nare the product of several months of negotiations and discussions \nbetween the Hatch and Leahy offices and various stakeholders. The most \nsignificant substantive change involves the scope of available \ndiscovery in ratemaking proceedings. The changes to the discovery \nprovisions are self-explanatory, so I will not belabor them here.\n  This bill responds to widespread dissatisfaction among the \nparticipants in the current system involving Copyright Arbitration \nRoyalty Panels--or ``CARPs''. I will refrain from going into detail \nabout this highly-technical bill--which many would find about as \ninteresting as watching astroturf grow--and will simply express my firm \nbelief that it addresses many of the legitimate concerns expressed by \nthe stakeholders, the members of the House and Senate Judiciary \nCommittees, and the many others that have provided valuable input and \nthat lent us their expertise during the legislative process. I am \ncontent simply to refer my colleagues to the comprehensive and detailed \ncommittee report drafted by the House if they desire an explanation of \nthe concerns and problems this legislation addresses.\n  While we were not able to reach absolute consensus on a few difficult \nissues, for the most part this legislation reflects broad agreement on \nthe fundamental changes that are required to make the existing CARP \nprocess more efficient, logical, and--some would content--bearable by \nparticipants.\n  In conclusion, I would be remiss if I did not publicly recognize that \nthis legislation is the product of some very hard work by our \ncounterparts in the House. Chairman Sensenbrenner, Chairman Smith, and \nRepresentative Berman deserve much of the credit for building a near \nconsensus on this bill and for moving it through the House. I commend \nthem for their bicameral, bipartisan approach to this legislation and \nfor the hard work put in by their respective staffs.\n  In particular, I would like to thank Blaine Merritt, David Whitney, \nand Alec French for their hard work.\n  I would also like to thank Marybeth Peters, the Register of \nCopyrights, and David O. Carson, the General Counsel of the Copyright \nOffice, for providing invaluable technical assistance to members in \nboth chambers of Congress on this complicated bill.\n  I would be equally remiss if I did not recognize the outstanding \nefforts of some in the Senate, including Senator Leahy and his staff--\nin particular Susan Davies, Rich Phillips, and Dan Fine--for their \nefforts on this bill. I also commend Mary Foden and Dave Jones of my \nstaff for their hard work and their efforts to build a consensus around \nthe bill in the Senate.\n  With that, I will urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 1417 with the \nHatch-Leahy substitute.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is taking up \nand passing the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004. \nI have been working to reform the copyright royalty arbitration \nprocedures for several years. As early as 2002, I noted in a Judiciary \nCommittee hearing that there was widespread dissatisfaction with the \ncurrent law.\n  In particular, we heard the testimony of Frank Schliemann of Onion \nRiver Radio of Montpelier, VT. Mr. Schliemann noted that many small \nwebcasters could not afford to take part in CARP proceedings, even \nthough their livelihoods would depend on the outcome. We also heard \nfrom Billy Strauss, president of Websound, another small webcaster in \nBrattleboro, VT. Mr. Strauss noted many of the structural problems that \nplagued the old CARP procedures. In addition, I have been concerned \nthat the current procedures are often hindered by unreasonable delays, \nand the outcomes subject to manipulation.\n  The Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act responds to these \nconcerns. It replaces arbitrators, who serve for only one CARP \nprocedure and are paid by the parties, with full-time administrative \njudges. As a result, the financial burden of taking part in a CARP \nprocedure is alleviated. In addition, all parties can rest assured that \nthere will be continuity and stability in the resolution of these \nproceedings. At the same time, this bill preserves the traditional role \nof the Register of Copyrights. This bill also resolves longstanding \ndisputes over the availability of discovery. Because discovery is \navailable where it is needed, the copyright royalty judges will have \nthe information necessary to render a correct determination but the \ncosts of discovery will be kept to a minimum.\n  I am pleased to have cosponsored with Senator Hatch the amendment in \nthe nature of a substitute to the House bill. I thank Chairman \nSensenbrenner, Chairman Smith, and Congressman Berman for their \nleadership in this matter. We believe that in\n\n[[Page S10504]]\n\nadopting this version of the House bill, H.R. 1417, we will be able to \nmove to final passage without delay. It is time these important reforms \nwere implemented.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment that is at the desk be agreed to, the committee-reported \nsubstitute, as amended, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time and passed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, en bloc, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased that today we are about to \nenact S. 1134, the Economic Development Administration Reauthorization \nAct of 2004. This bipartisan bill, which I helped craft, will \nstrengthen the agency's ability to assist economically distressed \ncommunities in Vermont and across the Nation by providing approximately \n$1.3 billion in economic development grants over the next 5 years.\n  Since its establishment in 1965, the Economic Development \nAdministration, EDA, has invested more than $18.4 billion in more than \n52,000 projects in all 50 States and in U.S. territories. These EDA \ninvestments have been supplemented by approximately $8.3 billion in \nmatching funds from investment partners and have leveraged \napproximately $90.6 billion in private sector investment. In total, \nthese investments have created more than 2.9 million jobs and saved \nmore than 830,000 jobs.\n  In Vermont, for example, EDA funds have been used to develop a \nbusiness incubator in Randolph and will soon be used to provide high-\nspeed Internet access to the states most rural region of Caledonia, \nEssex, Orleans, Lamoille, Franklin, and Grand Isle Counties. My goal \nwith this legislation has been to increase the investment of EDA \ndollars\n\n[[Page S10511]]\n\nin Vermont, and 5 years from now I believe that will be demonstrated.\n  The bill we are considering today is slightly altered from the one \nthat we passed out of the Environment and Public Works Committee last \nJune. In an effort to speed eventual enactment into law, this \nsubstitute bill is not only supported by myself, Senator Inhofe, the \nChairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senators Bond \nand Reid, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Environment \nCommittee's Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, but it is \nalso supported by our House counterparts on the Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee.\n  I am pleased we were able to increase funding for planning in this \nbill. EDA has an important role to play in supporting planning at the \nlocal level. EDA has an important role as well to encourage the \nleveraging of federal funds. However, there is language in this bill \nthat ensures that rural and urban economically distressed areas are not \nadversely impacted by internal EDA leveraging goals.\n  Turning to brownfields, I am pleased this bill encourages EDA to \npromote the redevelopment of abandoned industrial facilities and \nbrownfields. The economic and social benefits of brownfields \nredevelopment are well documented. For example, in June 2003, the U.S. \nConference of Mayors estimated that brownfields redevelopment could \ngenerate more than 575,000 additional jobs and up to $1.9 billion \nannually in new tax revenues for cities. In addition, according to EPA, \nevery acre of reused brownfields preserves an estimated 4.5 acres of \nunused open space. Estimates of the number of brownfields sites \nnationwide range from 450,000 to as many as a million.\n  This bill complements the 2002 Environmental Protection Agency \nbrownfields cleanup law by encouraging EDA to make economic \nredevelopment of brownfields a priority. In other words, EPA's focus is \nto facilitate the environmental assessment and cleanup of abandoned \nsites, whereas EDA's role is to encourage the economic reuse of the \nproperty.\n  I agree with EDA Administrator David Sampson, who in response to a \nquestion from the EPW Committee, wrote, ``cleanup activities are most \nappropriately handled by state and federal environmental regulatory \nagencies with the background and technical expertise to address complex \nremediation issues.'' As such, I expect that EDA would only fund \nredevelopment projects at sites that have been certified as ``clean'' \nby EPA or the State environmental agency. In the rare circumstance that \nan EDA grant recipient discovers minimal contamination as part of a \nredevelopment project, this bill would require any remediation \nactivities be conducted in compliance with all Federal, State, and \nlocal laws and standards. EDA grantees should obtain the prior written \napproval of EPA or the State environmental agency to ensure that the \nremediation is protective of human health and the environment.\n  Of course, EDA also must uphold the ``polluter pays'' principle by \nensuring that Federal dollars are never given to the polluter to clean \nup contamination that they caused in the first place. Likewise, nothing \nin this bill in any way affects the liability of any party under \nSuperfund, RCRA or any other federal or state law.\n  The final brownfields-related aspect of the bill requires a General \nAuditing Office study of EDA's brownfield grants. This study should \nprovide valuable data on the extent to which EDA brownfield \nredevelopment grants involve remediation activities, the environmental \nstandards applied and the role of Federal, State and local \nenvironmental agencies and public participation in the cleanup process. \nIt is my hope that such information will enable future Congresses to \nrevisit these issues to ensure more explicitly that any remediation \nperformed is truly incidental to the larger economic redevelopment \nproject and that cleanups performed using federal dollars are \nprotective of human health and the environment.\n  In closing I praise the bipartisan member and staff effort that went \ninto crafting this important bill. In particular, I acknowledge the \nwork of Geoffrey Brown and Malcolm Woolf on my staff; Angie Giancarlo \nand Frank Fannon on Senator Inhofe's staff; David Montes on Senator \nReid's staff; and Nick Karellas and Ellen Stein on Senator Bond's \nstaff.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Economic Development Administration \nprovides critical support to distressed communities. Included in this \nreauthorization bill is assistance for the productive reuse of \nabandoned industrial facilities and the redevelopment of brownfields. I \nsupport that effort.\n  Unfortunately, the bill also includes new language allowing EDA to do \nsite assessment and remediation. This is, and should remain, the job of \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. As is evident in the manager's \namendment to the bill, it is Congress's intent that EDA abide by the \nsame site assessment and remediation standards and protocols as does \nEPA.\n  Furthermore, under this bill, Federal funds provided by EDA for \nassessment or cleanup will only be provided consistent with the \n``Polluter Pays'' principle. That is, funds will not be provided to \nthose who are responsible for the pollution.\n  Specifically, EDA shall not provide funds for response costs to \nparties potentially responsible for those costs under section 107 of \nCERCLA, or to owners or operators responsible for corrective action \nunder the Leaking Underground Storage Tank program pursuant to the \nSolid Waste Disposal Act, or to any other party responsible for the \npollution.\n  Mr. President, EDA agrees with Congress's intent. On April 28, 2004, \nDavid Sampson, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic \nDevelopment, told the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, \n``EDA is not seeking to in any way relieve a responsible party from \nliability under CERCLA nor to provide funds to a party to undertake \nclean-ups required under CERCLA, since to do so would undercut the \n`Polluter Pays' principle on which CERCLA was founded.''\n  Under any Federal program, when Federal funds are used for cleanup, \nit is very important to ensure that assessment and cleanup costs not be \nshifted away from the polluter and onto taxpayers. To the limited \nextent EDA is involved in funding cleanups, Congress's intent in this \nbill and EDA's policy is that polluters remain responsible for their \nown cleanup costs. Polluters must pay to clean up their own messes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the bill to \nreauthorize the Economic Development Administration, EDA, which \nprovides critical support to needed communities. Since its \nestablishment, the Economic Development Administration has invested \nover $18 billion in more than 50,000 projects in all parts of the \nUnited States. These investments have been supplemented by matching \nfunds from investment partners, and have leveraged a great deal of \ninvestment by the private sector.\n  The reauthorization bill before us today includes assistance for the \nproductive use of abandoned industrial facilities and the redevelopment \nof brownfields. I support that effort. While the Environmental \nProtection Agency's role under the 2002 law is to facilitate the \nenvironmental assessment and cleanup of abandoned brownfield sites, \nEDA's role is to encourage the economic reuse of the property.\n  Under this bill, Federal funds provided by EDA for assessment or \ncleanup will only be provided consistent with the ``Polluter Pays'' \nprinciple. That is, funds will not be provided to those who are \nresponsible for the pollution. They are responsible for cleaning up the \nmess they made. That is, funds will not be provided to those who are \nresponsible for the pollution. They are responsible for cleaning up the \nmess they made.\n  Specifically, EDA shall not provide funds for response costs to \nparties potentially responsible for those costs under section 107 of \nCERCLA, or to owners or operators responsible for corrective action \nunder the Leaking Underground Storage Tank program pursuant to the \nSolid Waste Disposal Act, or to any other party responsible for the \npollution.\n  It is very important to ensure that assessment and clean-up costs are \nnot shifted from the polluter to the taxpayers. To the extent that EDA \nis involved in funding cleanups, Congress'\n\n[[Page S10512]]\n\nintent in this bill and EDA's policy must be the same: polluters are \nresponsible for paying to clean up their own messes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise to discuss S. 1134, the Economic \nDevelopment Administration reauthorization bill, that was approved by \nthe Senate today. This is an important piece of legislation for our \nNation's economically distressed communities. These areas count on EDA \nto help create favorable environments for long-term economic growth. \nStudies have shown that EDA uses Federal dollars efficiently and \neffectively--creating and retaining long-term jobs at an average cost \nthat is among the lowest in government. The bill emphasizes \ncoordination, flexibility and performance. These tools will allow the \nSecretary to continue and even improve and increase the good work done \nby the agency.\n  In particular, I would like to highlight the performance award \nprogram and the reforms to the revolving loan fund, RLF, program \nincluded in the bill. The performance award program will allow the \nSecretary to reward those grant recipients who meet or exceed \nexpectations regarding performance measures such as jobs created and \nprivate sector investment.\n  The reforms to the RLF program are needed to ensure the agency can \ncontinue to capitalize new and recapitalize existing RLFs. The current \nadministrative burden of these funds is large. This bill will allow the \nSecretary to reduce that burden, both for the agency and for the local \nRLF managers, while providing appropriate oversight.\n  Enactment of this legislation will be good for my home State of \nOklahoma in several ways as well. First, it will ensure that the \ncommunities of Elgin and Durant are able to move forward with \ninfrastructure improvements that will support the attraction of private \nsector investment and the creation of jobs. Enactment will also result \nin much needed investment in Ottawa County, providing funding for the \ncity of Miami--a city that has suffered economic hardship due to its \nproximity to a Superfund site.\n  Additionally, the bill preserves the ability of Economic Development \nDistricts to use planning funds to provide technical assistance and \ncover administrative costs. This is especially important for the small, \nrural communities of Oklahoma that do not have the resources to \nmaintain the professional and technical capacity needed to develop and \nimplement comprehensive economic development strategies. Economic \nDevelopment Districts work to fill this hole and should not be \nprevented from doing so.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues here in the Senate, in the House \nof Representatives and in the administration for working so diligently \nand cooperatively with me to complete work on this very important \nlegislation. I would also like to thank the staff for their hard work--\nfrom my staff: Angie Giancarlo and Frank Fannon; from Senator Jeffords' \nstaff: Geoff Brown and Malcolm Woolf; from Senator Bond's staff: Nick \nKarellas and Ellen Stein; from Senator Reid's staff: David Montes; and \nfrom EDA: Nat Wienecke, Paul Pisano, Ben Erulkar and Dennis Alvord.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the Economic Development Administration \nReauthorization Act of 2004, S. 1134, contains important provisions \nrelating to the redevelopment of brownfields. As the ranking member of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, I want to take the \nopportunity to explain these provisions. Before I begin, let me \nacknowledge the contributions of Senator Chafee, chair of the Superfund \nand Waste Management subcommittee, in developing these provisions and \nnote that he supports my comments today.\n  S. 1134 encourages EDA to promote the redevelopment of abandoned \nindustrial facilities and brownfields. The economic and social benefits \nof brownfields redevelopment are well documented. For example, in June \n2003, the U.S. Conference of Mayors estimated that brownfields \nredevelopment could generate more than 575,000 additional jobs and up \nto $1.9 billion annually in new tax revenues for cities. In addition, \naccording to EPA, every acre of reused brownfields preserves an \nestimated 4.5 acres of unused open space. Estimates of the number of \nbrownfields sites nationwide range from 450,000 to as many as a \nmillion.\n  This bill complements the 2002 Environmental Protection Agency \nbrownfields cleanup law by encouraging EDA to make economic \nredevelopment of brownfields a priority. In other words, EPA's focus is \nto facilitate the environmental assessment and cleanup of abandoned \nsites, whereas EDA's role is to encourage the economic reuse of the \nproperty.\n  I agree with EDA Administrator David Sampson, who in response to a \nquestion from the EPW Committee, wrote, ``cleanup activities are most \nappropriately handled by state and federal environmental regulatory \nagencies with the background and technical expertise to address complex \nremediation issues.'' As such, I expect that EDA would only fund \nredevelopment projects at sites that have been certified as ``clean'' \nby EPA or the State environmental agency. In the rare circumstance that \nan EDA grant recipient discovers minimal contamination as part of a \nredevelopment project, this bill would require any remediation \nactivities be conducted in compliance with all Federal, State, and \nlocal laws and standards. EDA grantees should obtain the prior written \napproval of EPA or the State environmental agency to ensure that the \nremediation is protective of human health the environment.\n  Of course, EDA also must uphold the ``polluter pays'' principle by \nensuring that Federal dollars are never given to the polluter to clean \nup contamination that they caused in the first place. Likewise, nothing \nin this bill in any way affects the liability of any party under \nSuperfund, RCRA or any other Federal or State law.\n  The final brownfields-related aspect of the bill requires a General \nAuditing Office study of EDA's brownfield grants. This study should \nprovide valuable data on the extent to which EDA brownfield \nredevelopment grants involve remediation activities, the environmental \nstandards applied and the role of Federal, State and local \nenvironmental agencies and public participation in the cleanup process. \nIt is my hope that such information will enable future Congresses to \nrevisit these issues to ensure more explicitly that any remediation \nperformed is truly incidental to the larger economic redevelopment \nproject and that cleanups performed using Federal dollars are \nprotective of human health and the environment.\n  In closing I would like to praise the bipartisan Member and staff \nwork that went into crafting this important bill and urge swift passage \nby the other body.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nsubstitute amendment that is at the desk be agreed to, the committee-\nreported amendment, as amended, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time and passed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, en bloc, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3976) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The committee amendment, in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1134), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/06/senate-section/article/S10512-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10512-S10543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE REFORM ACT OF 2004--Continued\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate has voted overwhelmingly to \ninvoke cloture on the national intelligence reform bill. I voted \nagainst cloture on the bill. The Senate leadership, in supporting \ncloture on this bill--I speak most respectfully--argued that this \ndebate has gone on long enough. In essence, that is what has been \nstated.\n\n[[Page S10513]]\n\n  I will soon begin my 47th year in this body. I never thought I would \nsee the demise of the Senate as a debating institution. I am very sorry \nabout that. I have seen the demise of the Senate as a debating \ninstitution. I have been here when debate on a bill went over 100 days.\n  Today's situation is eerily reminiscent of the autumn of 2002. A few \nyears ago, the hue and cry went up for all Senators to support a \nmassive bureaucratic reshuffling of our homeland security agencies and \na war resolution--I will refer to in that way--against Iraq just weeks \nbefore election day.\n  Like a whipped dog fearing his master, the Senate obediently complied \nwith the demands of the White House, to which our leadership said: let \nus get this matter behind us; let us get it behind us.\n  I know many of the Members who come to this body in this day and time \nare from the other body, and I speak most respectfully of the other \nbody. I came from the other body likewise. But I can remember when I \nwas in the other body I often said, Thank God for the Senate of the \nUnited States. That is when I was still in the other body. Thank God \nfor the Senate of the United States. They take their time over there to \ndebate. In this day and time, we do not take time to debate.\n\n  Hindsight reveals the mistakes that the Senate made 2 years ago. \nToday, the Department of Homeland Security finds itself bogged down by \nbureaucratic infighting, unresolved turf wars, and insufficient \nfunding. The central argument for the war resolution against Iraq, the \nthreat of weapons of mass destruction, has disintegrated into a mess of \nlies and hot air. The calls for Congress to act quickly were revealed \nto be ill-advised, misguided, misinformed.\n  The 108th Congress has an opportunity to learn from the mistakes of \nthe 107th Congress. Yet the repeated calls by Senators for immediate \naction on this bill suggests we have learned very little.\n  Most of the hundreds of amendments offered to this bill, or certainly \nscores of amendments, have focused on trying to speed up reforms that \nwe already do not understand. Apparently, few Senators have dared to \nspeak about the need for caution in arranging a massive, secretive \nbureaucracy. It would be the most secretive around.\n  The risk that this bill will grow into a hydra-headed monster \nincreases exponentially as election day nears. Many believe the House \nbill will include a number of provisions unrelated to intelligence \nreform, all the way from amendments on immigration to reauthorization \nof the PATRIOT Act. I hear lately the House has no intention of adding \nthat last mentioned measure. In the rush to pass this bill on a \npolitical timetable, what type of Faustian bargains will be struck to \njam this bill through the Congress? We have had it happen before. We \nhave been jammed on these important bills. We have had our backs \nagainst the wall because of some nearing date, perhaps of a recess, and \nso forth. What kind of deals with the devil will be made in order to \nget this bill done in time for election day? That is the big rush--get \nthis bill through in time for election day.\n  Even one Republican Member of the House of Representatives is \nconcerned that a slam-dunk conference would open the door to \npolitically motivated poison pills. Why is there such a clamor to vote \non a bill that is increasingly viewed as a way to make political hay in \nthe hours before a Presidential election? Will Senators even get to \nread the conference report on this bill before we are expected to vote \non it? If we pass this bill, who knows what may be lurking in the walls \nsurrounding that conference between the two Houses unless the House \nshould decide to accept the Senate-passed bill, making it all the more \nimportant for the Senate to take our time and thoroughly debate the \nbill.\n  The mistake of how the Senate is choosing to consider this bill is \nnot the fault of the 9/11 Commission. That panel is a group of \nexperienced and dedicated public servants. Their research went straight \nto the heart of the question that has burned in the minds of millions \nof Americans for 3 years: Namely, how did such a powerful Nation fail \nto defend itself from those attacks?\n  In chilling detail, the panel's report lays out the facts about how \nthe U.S. Government failed to stop 19 hijackers--not from Iraq--19 \nhijackers armed with box cutters; 19 hijackers, not from Iraq, not a \none. Not even one of those 19 hijackers came from Iraq. Yet some have \nattempted to tie the hijackers with Iraq.\n\n  ``The document is an improbable literary triumph,'' declared U.S. \nCircuit Judge Richard Posner in the New York Times Book Review. \n``However, the commission's analysis and recommendations are \nunimpressive,'' he said, ``not sustained by the report's narrative,'' \nhe said, ``come to very little . . . [and more] of the same.''\n  That is pretty harsh criticism. And contrary to what some believe \nabout the critics of intelligence reform, Judge Posner is not \nprotecting his turf, and he does not have an ax to grind.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee held hearings 2 weeks ago on the \nSeptember 11 recommendations. A bipartisan array of national security \nexperts pleaded with the Congress as they gave testimony to the \nAppropriations Committee, pleaded with the Congress not to rush these \nreforms.\n  My, what an impressive list of names: The former chairman of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, David Boren; former Senator Bill \nBradley; former Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci; former Secretary \nof Defense William Cohen--we all remember him. He has been an \noutstanding Secretary of Defense. He was a Republican--former CIA \nDirector Robert Gates; former Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre; \nformer Senator Gary Hart; former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger--he \nindicated we ought to take several months on this bill--former chairman \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee Sam Nunn--there is a good one \nfor you. I served in the Senate with Sam Nunn. I served on the Armed \nServices Committee when he was chairman. Here is a man who is a \ncareful, careful legislator--former Senator Warren Rudman, Republican \nfrom New Hampshire; former Secretary of State George Shultz, another \nRepublican.\n  Among them they have decades of knowledge and experience, and the \nCongress stands ready to dismiss their concerns out of hand.\n  I pointed out that several of these distinguished persons are \nRepublicans just to emphasize there are several preeminent Republicans \nwho have had great experience in government who say: Wait, take your \ntime. What is the hurry here? Why the big hurry?\n  This group of 11 experienced public servants who urged the Congress \nto stop, look, and listen, they have no turf to protect. They have long \nsince left the service of the executive and legislative branches. Why \ndoes the Senate not take their advice? Why does the Senate not pause to \nlisten to their sage advice?\n  Let us remember that 2 years ago Members of Congress fell all over \nthemselves in a mad frenzy to adopt the advice of Senator Hart and \nSenator Rudman to create a Department of Homeland Security. Anyone who \ndid not agree with the Hart-Rudman report was viewed as being \nobstructionist or out of touch. But today, the Senate sloughs off the \ncounsel of those same two men to slow down--slow down. That is what the \nSenate is all about.\n\n  The Senate is not a second House of Representatives with a 6-year \nterm. Thank God for that. As I said many years ago when I was a Member \nof the other body, the body that is closest to the people, I said thank \nGod for the Senate. So I did not come to this body with any idea of \nchanging the rules to make it a second House of Representatives with a \n6-year term. I never thought that about it. I have thought that it is \nmeant to be a place where men and women could argue as long as their \nfeet would hold them erect. I have said time and again that as long as \nwe have a forum in which elected representatives of the people can \nspeak out, speak out without fear and speak out as long as they want to \nspeak on a matter they feel very deeply about, thank God, the people's \nliberties will be secure.\n  But today, as I say, the Senate sloughs off the counsel of these \neminent luminaries to slow down. How quickly we turn on the advice of \nour friends.\n  I fear the Senate wants change, in some instances, merely for the \nsake of\n\n[[Page S10514]]\n\nchange, and that we do not yet possess an adequate understanding of why \nwe are doing what we are doing. It is not even clear why or how the 9/\n11 Commissioners arrived at all of their recommendations. The \nCommission's report does not explain it. What recommendations did the \nCommission consider and reject, and why did they reject the \nrecommendations? Did the 9/11 panel receive any independent assessments \nof their ideas before they were published? Will the Commission's \nproposals prevent intelligence failures in other areas, such as \nstopping a repeat of the Iraq weapons of mass destruction fiasco? Even \nas the Senate rushes to pass this intelligence reform bill, with one \neye on the public opinion polls, of course, and the other on the \nadjournment date, we do not know the answer to these questions.\n  Given the Senate's failure to ask more questions about the creation \nof a Department of Homeland Security and the need for war in Iraq, I \nwould hope this Chamber would be more circumspect about rushing to \nrestructure our intelligence agencies on the eve of a Presidential \nelection.\n  These agencies are very secretive--very secretive. And look at the \npower Congress is about to give the national intelligence director. \nLook at the power. He is not an elected individual. I would hope that \nthe Senate would pause to consider the powers that may be shifted to \nthe executive branch in this legislation. I also hope that Senators \nwill consider if such a timid Congress could possibly exercise proper \noversight over a powerful and secretive bureaucracy.\n  We are being naive about these intelligence reforms. It may be \ncomforting to embrace the 9/11 report, and I hold in the highest regard \nthe members, as I say, of that Commission and for its work. It may be \ncomforting to embrace the 9/11 report, but its reforms ignore more \nfundamental intelligence problems.\n  At the Appropriations Committee hearing on September 21, 2004, I \nasked Henry Kissinger: If the 9/11 Commission's recommendations had \nbeen implemented in 2002, would our intelligence agencies have come to \na different conclusion about Iraq's nonexistent weapons of mass \ndestruction? His answer was no, nothing would have been different. \nThere still would have been false claims of huge stockpiles of WMD in \nIraq.\n\n  Mr. President, we are all too focused just on the failings of 9/11. \nThe Senate has not focused enough attention on the intelligence \nfailures leading to war in Iraq, in which, as of the last reading of \nthe news reports, we have lost 1,061 men and women. For what? For what \ndid they give their lives? I would wonder, if I had a grandchild who \nhad gone and lost his life in this war, for what did he give his life? \nWas it worth it? Was it worth it to invade a country under the new \ndoctrine of preemption, which flies right into the face of the \nConstitution of the United States?\n  I did not hear the Constitution mentioned last night in the debate. I \nam not sure, maybe I had my back turned at the moment. I have a sick \nwife and maybe, perhaps, I did not hear it. But I certainly did not \nhear it in the first debate between Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry; not one \ntime did I hear the Constitution mentioned. And I did not hear it \nmentioned last night. Yet it is mentioned every day throughout this \ncountry in the courtrooms of this Nation, the Constitution of the \nUnited States. Here we have these Presidential debates and nobody--if I \nfind I am mistaken about last night's debate, I will certainly amend my \nwords in this respect, but I do not believe I missed something there.\n  The Senate has not focused enough attention on the intelligence \nfailures leading to the war in Iraq. We have not focused enough \nattention on the nuclear threat posed by Iran and North Korea. We have \nnot focused enough attention on China. We have not focused enough \nattention on the proliferation of deadly germs and gases.\n  Any of these challenges could be responsible for the next \ncatastrophic attack on our country or our interests, and they are \nconspicuously ignored by this bill. Congress is showing myopic vision \nin failing to see the universe of threats to this country. Terrorism \nmay be the most immediate threat to our country, but it is not the only \nthreat.\n  As a Member of the Senate and as the then-chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee in the Senate, I and my committee responded \nquickly to the attack of 9/11. Within 3 days, Congress passed an \nappropriations bill, appropriating $40 billion--within 3 days, $40 \nbillion. Congress, both Houses, passed an appropriations bill \nappropriating $40 billion. In other words, $40 for every minute since \nJesus Christ was born, $40 for every minute since Jesus Christ was \nborn--$40 billion. So Congress acted quickly.\n  We all are concerned. There is no monopoly of concern on either side \nof the aisle here. I support the effort to reform our intelligence \nagencies. I support the creation of a national intelligence director. \nBut I do not support this hurry in which we are engaged. We need to \nstop, look, and listen, debate, offer amendments, answer questions, \nhold more hearings, like Ted Stevens and I holding hearings in the \nAppropriations Committee.\n\n  I have been one of the harshest critics of the status quo. \nIntelligence agencies are expected to uncover terrorists plots against \nour country and produce unbiased, accurate intelligence, free from \npolitical interference. The CIA and other agencies have fallen \ntragically short on both marks. However, I am not convinced that the \nCongress fully understands the implications of the reforms proposed by \nthe 9/11 Commission, and the rush to vote on these issues before the \nPresidential elections means it will not have that opportunity. Henry \nKissinger called attention to that fact.\n  We are legislating in an atmosphere, just before a Presidential \nelection, that is not conducive to thoughtful reform of these \nintelligence agencies. But the greatest contribution the Senate can \nmake to the cause of the 9/11 families is to take the time to get those \nreforms right. Prematurely cutting off debate on this bill only \nsucceeds in further politicizing a process that is more mindful of \nelection day than it is the result of this debate.\n  Like 2 years ago, the Senate is being stampeded into voting on major, \nfar-reaching legislation. The result of this ill-considered course is \neasily seen: Any reforms the Congress enacts will be the product of \nrush and haste rather than thoughtful deliberation. We owe more to the \nmemories of those who lost their lives on September 11.\n  Mr. President, a little earlier I made the statement to the effect \nthat I heard no one in last night's debate on either side mention the \nConstitution of the United States. My press has since called me and \ntold me I was wrong. That, indeed, one of the candidates--and he said \nSenator Edwards--did mention the Constitution of the United States. \nThank God for that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nremarks of the Senator from Virginia and I be recognized to offer a \nWarner-Levin amendment which which has now been worked out and cleared. \nI think Senator Warner is somewhere nearby. If there is no objection, I \nask unanimous consent to put us next in line with that amendment, which \nis a modified amendment and has been agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an issue that is \ngetting quite a bit of play in the press, other than the security issue \nhaving to do with our intelligence community and homeland security. \nThis is a different kind of security issue. It is an issue having to do \nwith health care. I wanted to discuss with Members today the two \napproaches that the candidates for President have about health care and \nwhat the consequences are to the consumer, to the patient, as well as \nto the taxpayer and to our health care system in general.\n  This is a very important debate we are having about health care \nbecause there is an acute problem. It is a problem that, candidly, this \nCongress has not dealt with. We saw in the debates last night and other \nconversations about the importance of a Patients' Bill of Rights, which \nwould have done nothing but add more cost to the health care system. It \nwould have caused more uninsured, and that is the term I want to focus \non today, ``the uninsured.''\n  As I travel around Pennsylvania--and I am sure this is true for my \ncolleagues as they travel in their States--\n\n[[Page S10515]]\n\nwhat we hear repeatedly is the problem of the spiraling cost of health \ncare. A Patients' Bill of Rights would have done nothing but add more \ncost to that system and add more to the uninsured problem. What we \ndon't hear are answers from Congress on how to deal with the problem of \nthe uninsured.\n  We have two Presidential candidates who have laid out a plan to deal \nwith this very complex problem. I will say that Senator Judd Gregg \nchaired a task force on our side of the aisle that put forth a variety \nof different proposals to deal with the uninsured because it is a very \ncomplicated group of people in the sense that there isn't one reason \npeople are uninsured. Senator Gregg has given eloquent talks about the \napproach we have offered. But, candidly, we have not moved forward on \nthis on either side of the aisle to try to bring it to fruition.\n  The Presidential candidates have put forward some ideas. I wanted to \ntalk about both of those plans.\n  Let me first talk about Senator Kerry's plan. Senator Kerry has \nproposed a plan which, according to the revenue estimates, runs in the \narea of about $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years, $1.5 trillion in \nnew spending for tax breaks to provide for the uninsured. What the \nSenator from Massachusetts has suggested is that this $1.5 trillion \nwill cover roughly 27 million people who are currently uninsured, which \nwould make up a little over half of the uninsured in America. But at a \ncost of $1.5 trillion over 10 years to get someone insured in America, \none person under his proposal is $5,500 per insured per year--not per \nfamily, per insured per year, $5,500 in Government subsidies to provide \nfor insurance per year. That is a very high-cost way of trying to \nprovide insurance.\n  On top of that, not only is it a high-cost way, but as you will see \nin a moment, it is a very bureaucratic way. It is a very inefficient \nway, and it is a further Government takeover of the private health care \nsystem. It federalizes under Medicaid a dramatic expansion of Medicaid \nfor a lot of the people who currently are either uninsured or in many \ncases insured by private sector employers.\n  I want to talk about the fiscal voodoo that is going on as to how \nthis program is going to be paid for, which is one of the many \nproposals that Senator Kerry has put forth in the election. But this is \nby far the most expensive, $1.5 trillion. He says he is going to pay \nfor it by repealing the Bush tax cuts.\n  As you can see from this chart, the Bush tax cuts, scored over the \nnext 10 years, will cost the Treasury $1 trillion. So there is still an \nunaccounted for half a trillion dollars, if we repeal all of them.\n  Now, what he has said is he only wants to repeal the ones that are on \nthose who make over $200,000. Well, if we go down here and look at what \nis the tax cut for those who make $200,000, it is roughly $612 billion \nover the next 10 years, which is less than half of this $1.5 trillion. \nThere is still almost $900 billion in unaccounted-for new spending or \ntax incentives in the Kerry plan that are not paid for. He could add an \nadditional $400 billion, roughly, in getting rid of the 10-percent \nbracket and the marriage penalty, the child credit, and the middle-\nclass rate reductions. We can do that, too. We are still half a \ntrillion dollars short.\n  The plan doesn't add up. It adds up to a fiscal disaster. As many \nknow, the biggest group of people, as far as percentage, who pay in \nthis bracket for which the Senator from Massachusetts wants to \neliminate this tax reduction is small businesses. These are the job \ncreators. He wants to eliminate tax incentives for people in small \nbusiness who are the job creators. He wants to get rid of, I assume, or \nadd other taxes on to pay for the additional $900 billion it is going \nto take to pay for this new proposal which spends $5,500 per person to \nprovide insurance for them. I would just suggest that that is a very \ncostly way.\n  Let me contrast that with the President's approach, which does not, \nas Senator Kerry's plan does through his program, displace private \ninsurance. What do I mean by that? The reason this costs so much is \nbecause he is going to be insuring more people than the 27 million in \nhis new program, but a lot of those people he is insuring are already \ninsured.\n  He is going to take them from the private sector and move them to the \npublic sector. That is why it costs so much. It is a new publicly borne \ncost that is now a privately borne cost. The taxpayers are going to pay \nfor this, as opposed to employers and employees.\n  What the President has done is a much smarter, more targeted \napproach. He put together a plan that does not cost $1.5 trillion but \n$129 billion. It spends $1,900 to attract someone who is currently \nuninsured into the new insurance pool that will be created, and it does \nso in a way that doesn't take someone who has insurance and displaces \nthem into a public pool, which is what the Kerry plan does. So this is \na much more commonsense approach, leaving the private insurance market, \nwhich has served our country so well, in place and not replacing it \nwith a public sector plan, but creating incentives through low-income \ntax credits, small employer tax credits, above-the-line deductions, \nsome private market reforms, like AHPs and other things, to broaden the \npool for people to be able to purchase health insurance.\n  This will add almost 7 million people to the ranks of the insured \nfrom the ranks of the uninsured. It does so at a responsible cost, \nsomething we can likely afford over the next 10 years, as opposed to \nblowing a hole through the deficit. I find it remarkable that we hear \nover and over again from the Senator from Massachusetts about how this \nPresident has very high deficits, yet we look at a plan here that, \nunder the current scenario he proposes, is a $600 billion repeal of \ntaxes to pay for a $1.5 trillion program. If you are talking about \nblowing a hole in the deficit, this will do so, and then some; it will \nadd about $100 billion in new deficits every year as a result of this \nproposal.\n  This is only part of the problem. The other part of the problem is \nhow the Kerry plan works. Unlike the Bush plan which, again, doesn't \ndisplace people from the private sector to the public sector, does not \ncost $5,500 per person to get them into the insured category, Senator \nKerry's plan is incredibly complicated and promises things he cannot \ndeliver. For example, he talks about how he is going to provide the \nsame health plan that Members of Congress have, by participating in the \nFederal Employees Health Benefit system. He said that, and then the \nFederal Employees Union got to him and said, whoa, whoa, whoa, you are \nnot going to do that; you are not going to put everybody into our \ninsurance pools. That is going to drive up the cost of our health care \ndramatically. You can say you are going to give everybody what Members \nof Congress have, but we are going to set up a separate pool.\n  So he sets up a separate insurance pool. It is not what Members of \nCongress have. It is something completely different. It sets up this \ninsurance pool that people can participate in, but the cost of that \npool is going to be based on who enrolls in it. So I don't understand \nhow that will save any money, because all insurance pools are based on \nwho is enrolled in the plan. So there is this idea that somehow or \nother we are going to give you a congressional health care benefit--\nwhich, by the way, is the same as every other Federal employee--for \nnothing, when in fact they are going to get something like a \ncongressional health care plan. Let me assure you, it won't be for \nnothing; it will be for a lot of money, in a very complicated way.\n  This is a chart that tries to describe how the Kerry plan works from \nthe standpoint of the Medicare portion over here, including schools, by \nthe way. Schools are going to be responsible for being a social service \nagency and signing up people for Medicaid. Now we talk so much about \nhow schools are being asked to do so much more when it comes to \neducation. Senator Kerry has another idea for them. They are going to \ntake the responsibility for enrolling children into Medicaid as part of \ntheir responsibilities.\n  Over here, you have sort of how we interact with the doctors and the \nhospitals. You have this new agency, the premium rebate pool agency--\nnot a particularly creative acronym. We have this agency that is going \nto determine what is covered, how much we pay. So you are going to \nhave, in a sense, the Federal Government making these decisions as to \nwhat doctors you see, how much they are going to pay these doctors, \nwhat is going to be covered by these plans.\n\n[[Page S10516]]\n\n  Again, it is not just an expansion of Medicaid, which is very costly, \nand bringing a lot of new people into the Medicaid Program, many of \nwhom already have insurance, not only setting up this other plan to \ndeal with how we are going to handle the ``private market reforms'' \nSenator Kerry wants to impose to help, in this case, those who are \nhigh-cost patients in the health care system. So here is the \ncongressional health plan, and you have all these different \norganizations, or different functions with new organizations, and some \nare going to be organizations that will have increased responsibility \nto offer this new congressional health plan, which isn't a \ncongressional health care plan.\n  You have a tax credit idea. It is not simple. In fact, Senator Kerry \nhas not been particularly clear about how these tax credits will work. \nHe has several of them, not just one. There are four different tax \ncredits Senator Kerry is going to put in place here. Here they are. \nThis is a very complicated system, and it is an extremely costly \nsystem, and one that puts more people into Government, less in the \nprivate sector, and when private sector reforms happen, puts more \noversight into the Government over the private sector--all at the cost \nof $1.7 trillion.\n  This is not the direction we want to take in health care. We don't \nwant more Government oversight of the private sector to drive up costs \nin the private sector. We don't want more people from the private \nmarkets going into the Government pools, and we don't want to create \nthe shell game that Senator Kerry is in the area of the new \ncongressional health plan, which isn't a congressional health plan.\n  The idea of tax credits has some appeal to me. The President's \nproposal is to try to provide tax credits. But this is a very \ncomplicated plan, and it has not been well spelled out. We worked very \nhard to try to understand it. It is not a very well thought out, \nplanned out approach. I suggest this is bad policy. This is complicated \npolicy. It is very costly policy. It doesn't deliver to people what has \nbeen promised. What it does deliver is a big tax bill, or very big \ndeficits in the future, neither of which is something we should be \ndesirous of here in the Senate.\n  With that, I think we have done a pretty good comparison of where the \nPresident wants to go, which is responsible reform and the \nencouragement of people who do not have insurance to be insured, \nwithout disrupting the private markets, without increasing the size of \nthe Government-run health care plans, and doing so at a responsible \ncost, as opposed to Senator Kerry, who wants to dramatically increase \nGovernment's role in health care, increase the Government's role in \noverseeing private health care, and play a shell game because it sounds \ngood that you are getting congressional health care for nothing, when \nin fact you are not, and for a lot. Again, I will give Senator Kerry \ncredit for the tax credit idea, but it is very foggy and not \nparticularly well thought out, in my opinion. So I think it is a \nfailure on all fronts. It is very complicated and will not serve the \nbest interests of the patients in America and will not serve the \ninterests of taxpayers in America.\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

GENERAL REFERENCES.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer. I shall be very brief on \nthis matter.\n  The distinguished manager and comanager have worked with my staff and \nSenator Levin and myself, and we have come to an agreement on this \nissue.\n  Again, it is an amendment by myself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Stevens, Mr. \nInouye, Mr. Allard, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Cornyn, and Mr. Chambliss.\n  I start by referring to the 9/11 report. This is a very important \nreport which has been a roadmap for so many of the provisions and it is \na roadmap I have used for this provision.\n  I read from page 412:\n\n       The Defense Department's military intelligence programs--\n     the joint military intelligence program (JMIP) and the \n     tactical intelligence and related activities programs \n     (TIARA)--would remain part of that department's \n     responsibility.\n\n  That is the purpose of this amendment. It is to clarify. I think it \nwas the intent of the managers all along. They made statements \ncomparable to what is in the 9/11 report from which I just quoted and, \ntherefore, this amendment would leave in place those programs being \nperformed by what we call the combat agencies, largely under a \ncontractual relationship, and they would remain in place, but with the \nunderstanding that upon completion of a review, to be conducted by the \nnational intelligence director and the Secretary of Defense, if they \nreach, as is specified under the bill, a joint opinion as to the \ndesirability to move them into the national intelligence program, in \nall likelihood that can be achieved.\n  I thank the managers. I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague \nfrom Michigan. I thank my distinguished colleague, Senator Levin, for \nhis work on this very important amendment, an aspect of which is \ntailored to meet a concern that the Senator from Michigan has.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, my concern about the definition of \nintelligence programs that the budget execution authority would be \ntransferred to relates to the definition in the bill\n\n[[Page S10517]]\n\nthat, in turn, relates to the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n  There are a number of Defense Intelligence Agency programs which, in \nmy judgment, should not have their budget execution authority \ntransferred to the new national intelligence program. Specifically, \nthere are three programs. These are a small set of DIA programs but, \nnonetheless, there are three in particular to which I refer.\n  First is the intelligence staff of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Second \nis the intelligence staff of the combatant commanders. Third is certain \nsensitive communications systems which support the Department of \nDefense command structure.\n  The principal purpose of those programs is to support joint or \ntactical military operations, and I think it would be a mistake to \ntransfer the budget execution authority for those three programs to the \nnational intelligence director. They are just simply too deeply \nembedded in supporting joint or tactical military operations for that \nto make sense.\n  However, rather than trying to resolve that debate here and rather \nthan having the bill transfer the budget execution to the national \nintelligence program, what we have arrived at is a compromise which \ndoes the same thing relative to these programs, as Senator Warner just \noutlined, relative to a number of other programs; that is, we assign \nand task the new national intelligence director and the Secretary of \nDefense to review these DIA programs, then to make a recommendation as \nto where the budget execution ought to rest, whether it should be in \nthe national intelligence program or in the Department of Defense, and \nthen to make a recommendation to the Office of Management and Budget \nand then to the President who would make the decision on this issue.\n  The review would be an expedited review. It would not take more than \n60 days. But it would make it possible to have this decision in review \nbased on the facts relating to this program rather than to make an \nabstract judgment about all programs in the Defense Intelligence Agency \nin this bill.\n  During this period of review, we have agreed that nothing would be \ndone to prejudice the outcome of this review. With the adoption of this \namendment, assuming it is adopted, then my amendment No. 3810 will be \nwithdrawn because that is the purpose of this amendment.\n  Again, as I did with another amendment earlier today, I thank the \nmanagers of the bill for working with us to make this possible. It is a \nvery rational approach, as well as a good compromise to a very \ncomplicated situation. We want to avoid--we want lines to be clear, but \nwe do not want them to be arbitrary in a way which will force budget \nexecution of programs to be where they logically should not be.\n  I also thank Senator Warner for his leadership on a very related \nissue. The way in which we have addressed these two issues is similar \nbut not exactly the same. It just makes a lot of sense.\n  I thank the managers for their willingness to work with us on this \nmatter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague and \nranking member. Given that the two of us are about to start a hearing \nin 10 minutes, I guess it is best we go to the adoption of the \namendment, but I yield for any comments the distinguished chairman may \nlike to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first, I thank the distinguished chairman \nand ranking member of the Armed Services Committee for working so \nclosely with Mr. Lieberman and me on this very important issue to set \nforth a process for determining what intelligence assets belong in the \nNIP, the national intelligence program, versus the joint military \nintelligence program and the tactical program.\n  The Collins-Lieberman bill gives the national intelligence director \nstrong budgetary authority over the national intelligence program. \nSenator Lieberman and I envision that his program will be composed of \nthe intelligence assets that serve national purposes, meaning those \nthat pertain to the interests of more than one department.\n  In the long run, I strongly believe the budgets for the National \nSecurity Agency, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and the \nNational Reconnaissance Office should be wholly within the national \nintelligence program.\n  Currently, these agencies have split budgets, and the heads of these \nagencies tell us that leads to a great deal of administrative \ninefficiency. Now, it is possible that some intelligence assets from \nthe Department of Defense's Joint Military Intelligence Program may \nultimately be moved to the national intelligence program, but, of \ncourse, military intelligence assets that principally serve joint or \ntactical military needs should stay within the Department of Defense, \nand I think the language is very clear on this point.\n  Through this amendment, we have tried to address concerns that both \nSenators have raised. I think the compromise language does address and \nalleviate those concerns. The reviews that are underway will help us \nbetter define the parts of the intelligence budget that will be \ncompleted within 1 year after the effective date, in one case 60 days, \nin the case that Senator Levin is concerned with the three activities \nin the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n  The reviews mandated in this compromise amendment will provide a \nrational process for determining which assets belong in the national \nintelligence program and which do not. I very much appreciate the \ncooperation of our colleagues, and I do urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment as \nmodified. In fact, I know that the chairman and ranking member of the \nArmed Services Committee have to go to a hearing, so that may only \nshorten the praise that I want to offer to them.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator can take his time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Take my time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I truly thank them for their extraordinary service on \nbehalf of our national security generally but also for their work on \nthis amendment. We had some very good discussions about this, and I \nnever had a moment where I felt they were doing this just to protect \nturf. I know they were pursuing these questions with a genuine interest \nin what would work best for our national security, both the \nintelligence and the military sides of it.\n  This is not an uncomplicated problem. We are setting up a national \nintelligence director. We want that person to coordinate the \nintelligence community, and budget authority is a critical part of \nthat. Senator Warner is quite right, obviously, in the section that he \nread from the 9/11 Commission Report.\n  Interestingly, as my colleagues on the Governmental Affairs Committee \nmay remember, when Dr. Zelikow, the chief of staff of the Commission, \ncame before our committee, he said they had changed their mind a bit on \nputting the Joint Military Intelligence Program into the Department of \nDefense budget control because of the Commissioners' concern that the \nnational intelligence assets--the National Security Agency, Geospatial \nAgency, and Reconnaissance--all have a single budgetary accountability, \nin this case to the national intelligence budget. I believe in the long \nrun that is the way it ought to go.\n  I must say in my own mind, perhaps simplistically, I always believed \nthat what we wanted to do was to say that the national intelligence \ndirector should have control over the national intelligence budget; \nthat the Secretary of Defense should have clear control over TIARA, the \ntactical intelligence budget; and that the Joint Military Intelligence \nProgram was somewhere in between. We had to find a rational way to \ndecide where authority went.\n\n  I think in some sense what we are saying in this legislation is we \nare not quite ready to make those decisions. So this amendment that we \nagreed to essentially freezes the status quo with regard to the JMIP \nand the particular programs that we discussed in the Defense \nIntelligence Agency, subjects them to review, consideration of all of \nthe factors--effectiveness, budgetary authority, all the rest, military \neffectiveness--and then has a decision made ultimately by the Office of \nManagement and Budget on recommendation from the national intelligence \ndirector.\n\n[[Page S10518]]\n\n  It is a very strong, balanced, reasonable conclusion which does no \ndamage to the basic purpose of this legislation and provides for, \nultimately, a rational allocation of budget authority in the shared \ninterest of our national security, which is, after all, what this is \nall about.\n  So this is really what legislating is supposed to be about. I thank \nmy colleagues for all the work they and our staffs have done, and I \nmove adoption of the modified amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the yeas and nays had been ordered. I ask \nunanimous consent that the order for the yeas and nays on this \namendment be vitiated and that we have a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3875), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I want to thank our colleagues and managers of the bill \nand, as always, thank Senator Warner. The managers have worked so well \nwith us, and I want to thank them for that, and also thank them for the \nway they worked with each other.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3810, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 3810 now be \nwithdrawn since that was covered in the amendment which was just \nadopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3827, As Modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I call up amendment No. 3827, and I send to the desk a \nmodified version of that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I think it is already before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has now been modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3827), as modified, is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To strike section 206, relating to information sharing)\n\n       On page 126, strike lines 23 through 25.\n       On page 127, line 1, strike ``(2)'' and insert ``(1)''.\n       On page 127, line 4, strike ``(3)'' and insert ``(2)''.\n       On page 128, strike lines 1 through 3 and insert the \n     following:\n       (3) Environment.--The term ``Environment'' means the \n     Information Sharing Environment as described under subsection \n     (c).\n       On page 130, strike line 10 and insert the following:\n       (c) Information Sharing Environment.--\n       On page 130, line 20, strike ``Network'' and insert \n     ``Environment''.\n       On page 133, lines 5 and 6, delete ``Director of the Office \n     of Management and Budget'' and insert ``principal officer as \n     designated in subsection 206(g)''.\n       On page 133, line 10, strike ``Network'' and insert \n     ``Environment''.\n       On page 134, line 2, strike ``Network'' and insert \n     ``Environment''.\n       On page 134, line 22, strike ``Network'' and insert \n     ``Environment''.\n       On page 135, beginning on line 16, strike ``the Director of \n     Management and Budget shall submit to the President and'' and \n     insert ``the President shall submit''.\n       On page 135 strike lines 19 through 22 and insert \n     ``Environment.

Mr. President, I again thank the managers of the bill, \nSenator Collins and Senator Lieberman and their staffs, for working \nwith us on this amendment. That amendment has now been modified, and I \nthink it meets the objections or the reservations that were set forth \nby the administration Statement of Position, the so-called SAP, that we \nreceived on this bill.\n  It has been modified to make certain that the President will have the \nauthority to designate an entity. We all agree, we hope, that he will \nnot delegate this matter to the national intelligence director. I think \nit is a function that is essential to carry out the purposes of this \nbill. Therefore, I am offering the modified amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment, as modified, be \nconsidered and adopted, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3827), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3839, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 3839 be \nwithdrawn from consideration. I am still sad about the vote that was \nagainst the position I supported with regard to disclosing the \naggregated top line of intelligence. I hope before we are through with \nthis bill that we will find some way to accommodate some of the \nreservations I have about that process, but in any event I withdraw the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I say to the two Senators, it is my \nintention now to support this bill. I congratulate them for listening \nto us. Sometimes I have raised my voice. One newspaper said I shouted \nat the distinguished Senator from Maine. That is just my trial lawyer \nvoice, and I apologize for it.\n  I do thank the Senator for her courtesy and apologize if I have been \nmistaken in terms of the tone of my voice, but that is my voice. I \ncannot do much about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Alaska \nfor his cooperation and his many helpful suggestions for improving this \nbill. I have great affection and respect for the senior Senator. I very \nmuch appreciate the fact that he is going to support this bill on final \npassage. That means a great deal to me and will certainly assist us. I \nlook forward to continuing to consult with him as we move through the \nconference process, and I will tell the senior Senator from Alaska that \nI am very relieved today to see that he is not wearing his ``Incredible \nHulk'' tie but, rather, a very restrained tie from some national \nmuseum, I believe. I know that bodes well for the day ending well. \nAgain, I thank the Senator. I very much enjoy working with him.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am delighted that we have reached a \nmeeting of the minds on the information-sharing part of the bill, which \npreserves intact the considerable reforms that are called for which \nwill protect our national security, as advanced by Senator Durbin, but \nalso quite appropriately embrace the concerns that Senator Stevens and \nthe administration had as to who would be in charge of this \ntransformation.\n  Second, I grew up in a family where if you were not passionate and \ndidn't raise your voice about things that mattered to you, it was \nthought that something was wrong. I also want to make clear that when \nyou raised your voice the other day, I did not think you were only \nshouting at the Senator from Maine, I thought that I was also included \nas a recipient.\n  Look, it reminds me of the old Teddy Roosevelt line about being in \nthe arena, not standing on the side reading a newspaper but getting \ninto the arena and fighting with all your heart for what you believe \nin. I admire the Senator greatly for doing that. I would much rather \nhave him on my side rather than against me, and that is why I am \nparticularly thrilled to hear the announcement of the Senator from \nAlaska that he will support this measure as amended.\n  I thank him and I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken just now with the two managers \nof the bill. There is not going to be a vote in the immediate future. \nAs the record indicates, this legislation has to be completed by 4:30, \nso final passage certainly will take place at 4:30. There may be an \namendment or two before that time, but there is nothing right now. If \npeople are on their way over, they should turn around and go back. \nThere probably won't be anything, probably within the next hour.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, of all the testimony presented to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs during our eight hearings on the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission perhaps none was more powerful \nthan that of Mary Fetchet. Her son, Brad, died in the World Trade \nCenter on September 11. Here are a few of her words.\n  She said:\n\n       When American lives are at stake, indifference or inertia \n     is unacceptable. When critical reforms are implemented to \n     make our country safer, I will know that neither Brad's life \n     nor the lives of nearly 3,000 others who perished on \n     September 11 were lost in vain.\n\n  Throughout this debate it has been the families of the victims of 9/\n11 who have reminded us of why we are here and why these reforms are so \nimportant.\n  In passing the National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004--as I believe \nwe will later this afternoon--the Senate will reject indifference and \ninertia. We will endure critical reforms to make our country safer. We \nwill declare that the lives lost to terrorism were not lost in vain. \nThe action we take in their memory will benefit people of good will in \nthis country and throughout the world today and for many years to come.\n  This legislation will make the most sweeping changes in our \nintelligence structures in more than 50 years. It is the result of \nenormous effort. The issues are complex and many. The timetable was \ntight, but the stakes were so high and the times so dangerous that we \nsimply could not delay this urgent task. Now we are on the threshold of \ngetting the job done and getting it done right.\n  I am deeply grateful to my good friend Senator Lieberman. This \nlegislation would not have been possible without his tireless effort \nand his bipartisan spirit. From the moment we were first assigned the \ntask of developing this legislation on July 22nd, our fellow members of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee dug in with energy and intellect. I \nam grateful to the Presiding Officer as one of the committee\n\n[[Page S10520]]\n\nmembers for his contributions. It was an August recess we will never \nforget.\n  We are very grateful to the leaders of the Senate. Senator Frist and \nSenator Daschle had the confidence in our committee that they felt they \ncould charge us with this enormous and critical undertaking.\n  Our whips, Senator Reid and Senator McConnell, have also been very \nhelpful. Senator Reid has been a constant presence in the Chamber \nthroughout this debate.\n  We could not have accomplished all that we did without our dedicated \nstaff, led by Michael Bopp and Joyce Rechtschaffen. We have worked so \nclosely with them. We have worked arm in arm. They have literally \nworked day and night to produce this bill. I am so proud of their \nextraordinary efforts.\n  Our staffs were supplemented by hard-working detailees from the CIA, \nthe DIA, and other agencies, as well as by members of the Commission \nstaff who, rather than going back to their previous jobs and lives, \nworked with us on the committee to help give the benefit of their \nexpertise. Without the efforts of all these staff members we never \ncould have gotten the job done. I am very grateful to all of them.\n  This legislation, however, is not merely the result of months of \nextraordinary effort by our committee or of the expert and insightful \ntestimony we heard from more than two dozen witnesses at eight \nhearings. Rather, it builds upon a rock-solid foundation laid by the 9/\n11 Commission and the investigation that it conducted over 20 months, \nincluding 19 days of hearings with 160 witnesses. I thank all \nCommission members for all of their extraordinary effort.\n  The need for reform in our intelligence system was not, however, \nsuddenly revealed in hearings spurred by one catastrophic failure 3 \nyears ago. The failures that led to that day are numerous and reach \nback many years. They were overlooked in terrorist attack after \nterrorist attack for more than a decade. The call for reform was made \nin studies, commission reports, and legislation going back half a \ncentury. It is a call we can no longer ignore.\n  Our committee was guided by clear principles. An intelligence \ncommunity designed for the Cold War must be transformed into one \ndesigned to win the war against global terrorism and future national \nsecurity threats. The new structure must build upon the strengths of \nthe old and recognize the considerable improvements made since \nSeptember 11.\n\n  The unique experience, expertise, and viewpoints of the 15 agencies \nthat comprise our intelligence community are assets that must be \npreserved. The barriers to information sharing, cooperation, and \ncoordination within the community, what the 9/11 Commission calls \nstovepipes, must be demolished. In their place must come a structure \nwith the agility the times and the threats demand--not another layer of \nbureaucracy.\n  We were determined, in crafting this new structure, that we not \ninfringe upon the freedoms that define us as Americans. The legislation \nthat came out of our committee by a unanimous vote adhered to these \nimportant principles and it has been strengthened by the vigorous \ndebate we have had in the Senate during the past week. The debate has \nnot merely been vigorous but also highly informed. Throughout these \nproceedings, it has been clear the commitment that drove our committee \nto act is shared by the full Senate. From the authorities of the \nnational intelligence director to the structure of our transformed \nintelligence community to the protection of civil liberties, many \ncritical issues have been raised, debated, and resolved. I particularly \nthank the members of the Committee on Armed Services, the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, and the Appropriations Committee, \nparticularly their chairs and ranking members. Their knowledge and \ntheir input have been invaluable.\n  Many important issues have been raised and will be resolved as this \ntransformation continues. One of the most remarkable aspects of this \ndebate has been the widespread recognition that intelligence reform is \nnot a single act but an ongoing process.\n  The fundamental obligation of government is to protect its citizens \nand those protections must evolve to meet new threats. This legislation \nbrings about much-needed reforms and it creates an environment in which \nthis ongoing process can continue.\n  I began these remarks with a quote from a mother who has suffered the \nworst loss any parent can endure. She turned her loss into positive \nadvocacy. It is Senator Byrd, however, who inspires me to end these \nremarks with a quote from the Constitution.\n       To form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure \n     domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote \n     the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to \n     ourselves and our Posterity . . . \n  The opening lines of our Constitution provide, in some ways, a job \ndescription of America's Government that is a miracle of clarity as \nwell as an awesome challenge. Rarely does one piece of legislation \nencompass all of its elements or do we have the opportunity to do so in \na way that clearly demonstrates the spirit that animates it. This is \none of those rare times. Let us do what the times demand. Let us act to \napprove this legislation this afternoon and by doing so make our \ncountry safer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Has the Senator from Maine completed her statement?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Yes.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3915, As Modified\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, after 9/11, there was broad agreement that \nthe absence of an accurate, reliable, and comprehensive terrorist watch \nlist was a serious deficiency. Unfortunately, 3 years later, we still \nhave not accomplished this important task.\n  My amendment, which has been modified to reach an agreement with \nSenators Collins and Lieberman, addresses this deficiency. It requires \na report to Congress on the watch list, specifically on the standards \nin place to ensure we have a list that is reliable and accurate, and \nthat we have procedures for determining threat levels and the \nconsequences to listed individuals. It also mandates a process for \nindividuals erroneously listed on the ``Automatic Selectee'' and ``No-\nFly'' lists to have their names removed. Finally, it would require an \nassessment of the privacy and civil liberty implications of using these \nlists. It is critical that we have a complete, accurate and \nconsolidated watch list, but we also need to be mindful of our \nliberties in the process.\n  We know that one of the most senior and respected Members of this \nSenate who for decades has taken the same flight was told he could not \nboard because he was, apparently, on some kind of terrorist list. They \nsaid: Of course, it is an obvious error, and we will get it cleared up. \nBut repeatedly when he tried to get on the same plane, he was \ncontinually stopped.\n  Now, as a Member of the Senate, after six or seven times of this \nhappening, and after calls from the White House, the head of Homeland \nSecurity and others, the problem was finally corrected. Can you imagine \nwhat it is like if you are Jane Smith or John Jones from a small town \nsomewhere in this country, but you have to travel on business and your \nname is there, and you lose important clients, you lose important \nbusiness, or you are unable to get home to visit a friend or a family \nmember, and you probably cannot pick up the phone and call the White \nHouse and say, ``Look, this is the sixth or seventh time I have been \nmistakenly barred from traveling. Please fix it''?\n  Now, there are other concerns I would like to have addressed, but \nthis modified version reflects the agreement with Senators Collins and \nLieberman.\n  Mr. President, I believe the modified amendment is at the desk, and I \nask unanimous consent it be in order to call up my amendment No. 3915 \nand that it be so modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, (No. 3915) as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. TERRORIST WATCH LISTS\n\n       (a) Criteria for Watch List.--The National Intelligence \n     Director of the United States, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of State, and \n     the Attorney General, shall report to Congress on the \n     criteria for placing individuals on the Terrorist Screening \n     Center consolidated screening watch list, including\n\n[[Page S10521]]\n\n     minimum standards for reliability and accuracy of identifying \n     information, the degree of information certainty and the \n     range of threat levels that the individual poses, and the \n     range of applicable consequences that apply to the person if \n     located. To the greatest extent consistent with the \n     protection of law enforcement sensitive information, \n     classified information, and applicable law, the report shall \n     be in unclassified form and available to the public, with a \n     classified annex where necessary.\n       (b) Safeguards Against Erroneous Listings.--The Secretary \n     of Homeland Security shall establish a process for \n     individuals to challenge ``Automatic Selectee'' or ``No Fly'' \n     designations on the applicable lists as maintained by the \n     Transportation Security Administration and have their names \n     removed from such lists, if erroneously present.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Department of Homeland Security \n     Privacy Officer shall submit a report assessing the impact of \n     the ``No Fly'' and ``Automatic Selectee'' lists on privacy \n     and civil liberties to the Committee on the Judiciary, the \n     Committee on Governmental Affairs, and the Committee on \n     Commerce, Science and Transportation of the Senate, and the \n     Committee on the Judiciary, the Committee on Government \n     Reform, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, \n     and the Select Committee on Homeland Security of the House of \n     Representatives. The report shall include any recommendations \n     for practices, procedures, regulations, or legislation to \n     eliminate or minimize adverse effects of such lists on \n     privacy, discrimination, due process and other civil \n     liberties, as well as the implications of applying those \n     lists to other modes of transportation. In its analysis, the \n     report shall also consider the effect these recommendations \n     would have on the ability of such lists to protect the United \n     States against terrorist attacks. To the greatest extent \n     consistent with the protection of law enforcement sensitive \n     information, classified information, and applicable law, the \n     report shall be in unclassified form and available to the \n     public, with a classified annex where necessary.\n       (d) Effective Date.--Notwithstanding section 341 or any \n     other provision of this Act, this section shall become \n     effective on the date of enactment of this Act.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Leahy for working with \nSenator Lieberman and me on his amendment. It requires two reports \nrelated to watch lists: one on the criteria for listing a name on the \nTerrorist Screening Center's consolidated watch list, and another on \nthe effect of the ``automatic selectee'' and ``no-fly'' lists on \nprivacy and civil liberties.\n  We worked with him to incorporate some modifications that make the \namendment acceptable to the two managers and incorporate some \nrecommendations from the administration.\n  I am well aware of some of the problems with the watch list. A \nconstituent of mine from Camden, ME, a retired physician, has the \nmisfortune to have a name that is identical to a name that is on the \nwatch list. Every time he flies, he encounters great difficulties. I \nbelieve the Senator's amendment will help to address that.\n  It is important to ensure we are safe and that those who want to do \nus harm do not have access to aircraft. But at the same time we want to \nmake sure that law-abiding travelers are not impeded from conducting \ntheir travels simply because they have the misfortune to share a name \nwith someone on the watch list.\n  The process required by the Senator, I think, will be helpful. I urge \nadoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3915), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, first, I thank the distinguished chair of \nthe committee for her cooperation and help, and also commend her and \nher distinguished ranking member for moving this far along.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3916, As Modified\n\n  Mr. President, a major weakness uncovered after 9/11 was the failure \nof Government agencies to share information with one another. The 9/11 \nCommission recommended a government-wide information system to ensure \nthat we connect the dots. The Commission also recommended that the \n``[p]rotection of privacy rights should be one key element'' of \nimplementing the system. Given the sweeping powers that Congress is \nabout to grant for building an information sharing system, we have to \nprotect the privacy and civil liberties of the American people.\n  After all, we fought a Revolution to guarantee our privacy. The \ndistinguished Presiding Officer and the distinguished chair know, \nbecause they come from New England, that the Revolution was fought on \nour soil.\n  We all agree we must maximize this information, but we must also \nmaximize the protection of personal information. And we need assurances \nthat private information will be protected before we build the system, \nnot after. We certainly do not want to repeat what happened with CAPPS \nII, when $100 million of taxpayer money was spent on deploying a system \nthat then subsequently collapsed because we failed to adequately \naccount for civil liberties and privacy concerns.\n  My amendment, which has been modified to reach an agreement with \nSenators Collins and Lieberman, would require that we take advantage of \navailable privacy-enhancing technology that would prevent unauthorized \ndissemination of information. It also requires the Administration to \nfulfill its obligations to report to Congress on plans for the network \nbefore spending funds to build it. This oversight is critical to \nensuring the network maximizes security while balancing civil liberties \nand privacy.\n  Senators Collins and Lieberman have agreed to accept this important \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to call up \namendment No. 3916, and that it be modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, No. 3916, as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 132, line 23, strike ``and''.\n       On page 133, line 3, strike the period and insert ``; \n     and''.\n       On page 133, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n       (L) utilizing privacy-enhancing technologies that minimize \n     the inappropriate dissemination and disclosure of personally \n     identifiable information.\n       On page 153, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       (o) Limitation on Funds.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this section, none of the funds provided \n     pursuant to subsection (n) may be obligated for deployment or \n     implementation of the Network unless the guidelines and \n     requirements under subsection (e) are submitted to Congress.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand there is no objection to this \namendment from the managers of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, again, I thank Senator Leahy for \nmodifying his amendment to address concerns that the manager raised. I \nhave no objection to the modified amendment, and I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3916), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3913 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have an amendment No. 3913, which I will \nsoon withdraw. It is on the subpoena powers of the civil liberties \nboard created in this bill.\n  We have worked hard to strengthen the powers of the board both at the \ncommittee level and then here on the floor, and I believe we have made \ngreat progress. We added teeth to this oversight body and fought \nagainst efforts to weaken it.\n  I think the goal of this amendment, which is to give the board \nenforcement power for its subpoena authority, is an important one. \nHowever, in order to expedite the passage of this bill, I will withdraw \nthe amendment now. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this \nimportant issue next year. But I also understand the need to expedite\n\n[[Page S10522]]\n\nthe passage of this bill. There may be another time to bring this up. I \nwill withdraw the amendment now, though I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues on the issue next year.\n\n  I withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his \ncooperation on that last issue. As I have explained to my colleagues, \nthe bill strikes a very delicate balance on the civil liberties board's \npower, and there were amendments to strengthen it as well as amendments \nto weaken it. I appreciate my colleagues' cooperation on both sides of \nthe aisle. I am sure there will be more discussion of this issue as we \ngo along.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Consolidation of Amendments\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder for previously agreed upon amendments, which I will list, to be \nconsolidated into one title under the heading: ``9/11 Commission Report \nImplementation Act,'' with a short title section (a), short title: This \nact may be cited as the ``9/11 Commission Report Implementation Act of \n2004.''\n  The amendments should be included in this order: No. 3942, No. 3807, \nNo. 3702, No. 3774, No. 3705, No. 3766, No. 3806.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for up to 30 minutes and have that time allotted \nagainst my 1 hour postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, will the \nSenator from Michigan inform me whether her statement is going to be \ngermane to the bill as is required in the postcloture situation?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I will ask to speak as in morning \nbusiness using this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I will not object because I am aware that \nthe Senator could speak for up to an hour under the cloture rules, \nalthough I remind the Senator that she could not speak on the subject \nabout which she appears to be ready to speak. But in the interest of \nmoving forward, and since there have been others today who have also \nspoken as in morning business, I will not object. I do think it is \nunfortunate, however.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Stabenow are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to commend my colleagues on \nthe adoption of amendment No. 3765 to S. 2845, the National \nIntelligence Reform Act of 2004, which will create an Office of \nGeospatial Management within the Department of Homeland Security, DHS.\n  This amendment originated as a stand alone bill, S. 1230, which was \nintroduced by Senator Allard and amended by Senators Collins, \nLieberman, and myself in a Governmental Affairs Committee business \nmeeting. I thank Senator Allard, who shares my interest in geospatial \ninformation sharing, for offering this amendment, as well as Senators \nCollins and Lieberman for their continued support on this issue.\n  Much of the discussion that has grown from the 9/11 Commission report \nhas centered around the institutional stovepipes that impede \ninformation sharing within the Government, which is why this amendment \nis so important. While the term ``geospatial'' is foreign to many, the \ntools it describes are relied upon by all. The 9/11 Commission \nrecommended that the President ``lead a government-wide effort to bring \nmajor national security institutions into the information revolution.'' \nGeospatial coordination is a critical component of that effort.\n  Geospatial technologies, such as satellite imagery and aerial \nphotography, provide data that create the maps and charts that can help \nprevent a disaster from occurring or lessen the impact of an \nunforeseeable event by equipping first responders with up-to-date \ninformation. In the event of a terrorist chemical attack, knowing which \nway a contaminated plume will travel can save lives. Similarly, the \ndamage of a natural disaster, such as a wildfire, can be lessened by \nmaps that help predict which areas will be in the path of the blaze.\n  All levels of government are more effective and efficient when \nemploying geospatial technology, especially in the area of homeland \nsecurity. According to DHS, geospatial information is used for \nintelligence, law enforcement, first response, disaster recovery, and \nagency management--virtually every function of the Department.\n  When the Department was created in 2003, it brought together \ncomponents from 22 separate agencies, each of which managed its \ngeospatial needs independently. In the past year, the Department has \nencountered significant difficulties integrating personnel, financial \nsystems, and computer systems from the legacy agencies. Geospatial \ninformation has been no different.\n  A September 2004 Government Accountability Office, GAO, report \nentitled ``Maritime Security: Better Planning Needed to Help Ensure \nEffective Port Security Assessment Program,'' found that the \ndevelopment of a geographic information system, GIS--GIS is often used \nas a synonym for geospatial to map the Nation's most strategic ports \nwould greatly benefit the Coast Guard as it implements the Port \nSecurity Assessment Program. A GIS would integrate all security \ninformation pertaining to one port into a single database so that it is \neasily accessible and can be frequently updated. In addition, it would \ngive the Coast Guard the ability to visually map a port so that it can \nquickly identify the location and surrounding environment of an at-risk \ncontainer before deploying a response team, for example.\n  However, GAO also found that:\n\n       The Coast Guard lacks a strategy that clearly defines how \n     the (GIS) program will be managed, how much it will cost, or \n     what activities will continue over the long term.\n\n  The legacy agencies that make up DHS had traditionally managed their \nown geospatial procurement. But many of the homeland and non-homeland \nsecurity missions of DHS complement each other. Sharing maps and data \nreduces redundancy, provides savings, and ensures better information \nfor disaster response.\n\n  Currently, the DHS Chief Information Officer, CIO, is working to \nbreak down this geospatial stovepiping within the Department by naming \na Geospatial Information Officer. However, there is no single office in \nDHS officially responsible for geospatial management and, therefore, no \ncorresponding budget. In the present structure, the Geospatial \nInformation Officer does not have the authority to compel the five DHS \ndirectorates to cooperate with his efforts. The entire agency should \nmake geospatial coordination a priority.\n  A geospatial management office needs to be created and codified \nwithin DHS. A congressionally mandated office would give the Geospatial \nInformation Officer more authority with which to do this job.\n\n[[Page S10523]]\n\n  The Office of Geospatial Management has the potential to \nsignificantly increase the quality of the resources homeland security \nofficials rely on by reducing redundancy and improving the quality of \ngeospatial procurement. But in order to do this it needs authority and \nfunding.\n  This office would also serve as a mechanism for coordinating with \nState and local authorities. Much of the geospatial information \navailable today is created at the State and local levels. Centralizing \nthis information will make it more widely available to first responders \nand other homeland security officials.\n  In order to facilitate this process, it is also important that local \ngovernments initiate their own coordination efforts. In June 2003, the \ncity of Honolulu conducted a pilot program to foster geospatial \ncoordination and collaboration among public and private stakeholders in \ncritical infrastructure protection. Representatives from local and \nState government, utility companies, and other private organizations \ncame together to identify potential impediments to geospatial \ninformation sharing in Honolulu and to develop a plan to circumvent \nthose impediments. I commend the government of the City and County of \nHonolulu for hosting such an exemplary event. This sort of commitment \nat a local level is crucial to breaking down the geospatial stovepipes \nthat exist at all levels of government. I hope other cities will follow \nsuit.\n  This amendment will help DHS to better coordinate its activities, and \nwill ultimately make our Nation safer and prevent duplicative spending. \nI appreciate my colleagues' endorsement of this important issue, and \nurge that this language be maintained in the final version of the \nintelligence reorganization bill that is sent to the President.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I strongly support the intelligence \nreform bill now before the Senate, and I will vote for it.\n  The 9-11 Commission worked incredibly hard in a bipartisan manner to \nidentify how to better protect our country from terrorism. They have \ngiven us a roadmap to protect our people, and we should move forward \nwith it promptly.\n  In their report, the commissioners said we need clear direction for \nour country's intelligence community. They stressed better coordination \nas a key area where we can make the greatest difference. The bill on \nthe floor does that, it has bipartisan support, and we should move it \nforward.\n  As a member of both the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee \nand the Senate's 9/11 Working Group, I have looked closely at these \nchallenges. And over the past few years, I have worked closely with the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, including the Coast Guard, FBI, TSA, \nBorder Patrol, as well as the National Guard and local law enforcement \nthroughout Washington State. Through our work together, I have learned \nfirst hand the difficulties they face every day in defending our \ncountry.\n  I especially want to commend the September 11 families who bravely \nstood up and spoke out. They forced our government to fully examine the \nterrorist attacks and to find ways to make our people safer. Their \nbrave advocacy has made a difference.\n  Mr. President, this is an important step toward achieving a truly \nintegrated national effort in the global war on terror. I am proud to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S.2845, the \nNational Intelligence Reform Act of 2004. The bill before us today is \nthe result of tireless work by the Government Affairs Committee and its \nable chair and ranking member. It also reflects intensive consideration \nby other committees with jurisdiction over issues addressed in the \nbill, including the Judiciary and Appropriations Committees of which I \nam a member. The bill makes some important changes in the way our \nintelligence community is managed. It is a bipartisan bill which \nstrikes a balance between ensuring that we have a strong national \nintelligence director, on the one hand, and that we meet the \nintelligence needs of the agencies which house our intelligence \ncollection systems, on the other.\n  The 9/11 Commission threw down the gauntlet when it released its \nfinal report, calling on Congress and the President to enact meaningful \nreforms that will help prevent future catastrophic terrorist acts. In \npainstaking detail, the commission made clear how the attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001, took place and how our government struggled to \nrespond. They then made 41 distinct recommendations across a wide range \nof policy areas creating a framework for our efforts. We have a \nresponsibility to enact as many of these recommendations as feasible. \nWith the threat of terrorism still high, we must have the best \nintelligence at our fingertips, a robust law enforcement effort, and an \neffective homeland defense if we are to foil future catastrophic terror \nattacks.\n  S. 2845 is an important first step. I believe the reforms in this \nbill fully implement the commission's recommendations on the need for a \nmore unified intelligence effort. They address the lack of intelligence \nsharing among the 15 agencies which make up our intelligence community. \nRecognizing the limitations of the Director of Central Intelligence, \nwho technically has the authority to manage all our intelligence \nresources, the bill centralizes the management and coordination of \nintelligence agencies by creating a national intelligence director or \nNID who has strong budgetary and personnel powers. The NID will also \nhave the authority to create uniform classification standards and to \nset collection priorities. Yet the bill leaves the intelligence \nresources of each agency within their existing organizations so those \nagencies can effectively and efficiently meet their intelligence \ncollection needs, so military operations and readiness are not \ncompromised, and so we can maintain the diversity of views critical to \nsound intelligence analysis.\n  Beyond a more unified approach to intelligence collection and \nanalysis, the Commission called for a more integrated response to our \nenemies. As the Commission noted, our bulky national security \ninstitutions are still structured to respond to the Cold War. In \nretrospect, it is no surprise that they were unable to respond to a \nnon-state terrorist network. By unifying the intelligence resources \ndispersed across the government, we are striving to create a more \nnimble intelligence apparatus that can lead our response to these non-\ntraditional threats. To that end, this bill enacts the Commission's \nrecommendation to establish a civilian-led joint command for \ncounterterrorism--a National counterterrorism Center--to act on joint \nintelligence by integrating civilian and military counterterrorism \nefforts across the government and to serve as the President's principal \nadvisor on joint operations. The NCTC will help address many of the \noperational shortcomings identified in the 9/11 Commission report.\n  Intelligence reform is an important bulwark in the war on terror but \nit is not our only line of defense. Even if the intelligence reforms in \nthis bill were in place before 9/11, they would not guarantee that the \nevents of that fateful day could have been averted. That is why I \nsupported the McCain transportation security and the Hutchison cargo \nsecurity amendments. These amendments direct TSA to produce a national \ntransportation strategy, to implement a system for comparing names of \nair passengers against the consolidated terrorist watch lists, to \nscreen all air passengers and their carry-on bags for explosives, and \nto set up a system to screen air cargo. And I am pleased that we have \naccepted amendments that address the role of diplomacy, foreign aid, \nand the military in the war on terrorism. The 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations in these areas have not received nearly as much \nattention as the recommendations relating to intelligence reform. I \nhope that we address these recommendations more fully in the next \nCongress. We must act broadly and on many fronts to put an end to the \nthreat posed by al-Qaida and those who subscribe to its ideology.\n  As we work to bolster our national preparedness in areas of border \nsecurity and emergency preparedness, we must balance the privacy and \ncivil liberties of individuals against our national security \nrequirements. While some have suggested otherwise, these principles are \nnot mutually exclusive, and I strongly believe that we can preserve \nboth. S.2485 recognizes the importance of individual rights by creating \na\n\n[[Page S10524]]\n\nPrivacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. By providing the Civil \nLiberties Board with appropriate authority, the legislation ensures \nthat its members will have access to the information they need to \nprovide informed advice to the Executive Branch, Congress, and the \nAmerican public as to how we can best protect privacy without \ncompromising security.\n  As we complete action on this bill, we are reminded of the deep sense \nof urgency that pervades our work. I appreciate that there are some in \nthis body who wish we had taken a slower approach. Last month, the \nSenate Appropriations Committee held hearings on the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations with a particular focus on intelligence reform. \nWitnesses, including Dr. Henry Kissinger, raised concerns, some of \nwhich have been addressed in amendments. The general sentiment of those \nhearings, however, was that we should approach intelligence reform much \nmore gingerly. Unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of time. Many \nof the reforms we enact today are based on recommendations that were \nmade by previous commissions. These are not new ideas that require more \nstudy. The 9/11 Commission did us a tremendous service by creating a \nframework for action and by galvanizing the political will to enact \nthese needed reforms.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to hail the bipartisan spirit in which \nthis bill was crafted. For too long, Congress has ignored the views of \nthe minority at its peril. We have budget resolutions that represent \nthe priorities of just one party and conference committees that do the \nsame. It is impossible to address the problems of the day unless we put \nour differences aside to work on real solutions that have broad \nsupport. This intelligence reform bill is an important reminder of how \nmuch more we could accomplish if we would just work together. I want to \nurge my colleagues who will serve on the conference committee to \nmaintain the bipartisan spirit in which this bill has been considered \nin the Senate. When the final version of this bill comes before the \nSenate, it should not go beyond the recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission in its scope, and it should not include partisan provisions \nthat jeopardize passing meaningful reform in this Congress.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss this body's efforts \nto reform the U.S. intelligence community.\n  My distinguished colleagues from Maine and Connecticut have worked \nhard to develop legislation to address some of the executive branch \nstructural reforms recommended by the 9/11 Commission. To be sure, \nthere is a need to change, the way we do business if we are to \neffectively battle terrorist organizations, like al-Qaida, and protect \nthe American people from another devastating terrorist attack. But I \nbelieve that many provisions of the bill before us are tackling the \nproblem from the wrong angle.\n  I think it is important that we move forward with deliberate speed. \nPast efforts, like the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986, should set an \nexample. That overhaul of the Defense Department took several years \nfrom start to finish. It was a huge undertaking, as is our current \neffort to reform the intelligence community. The 9/11 Commission did a \ngood job of cataloguing and critiquing the failures of 9/11--I believe \nit spent some 18 months on that effort. But it spent far less time \ndeveloping the recommendations to solve the problems. We are now acting \non those recommendations over a period of less than 2 weeks on the \nSenate floor. It is important to ask whether, in the middle of a war, \nit is wise to attempt such a fundamental reorganization with a deadline \nof October 8 for Senate consideration, a conference and then adoption \nof a conference report.\n  Nevertheless, I will support moving this legislation forward, as the \nPresident has strongly urged us to do, so that we may try to resolve \noutstanding issues in the Senate-House conference committee. As \nCongress prepares its final intelligence reform bill to be sent to the \nPresident, we must be especially careful to do no harm. I will continue \nto press the issues about which I am concerned during the conference.\n  Today I plan to discuss: No. 1, how the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations fail to thoroughly address the problems it identified; \nNo. 2, deficiencies in the Governmental Affairs Committee proposal; and \nNo. 3, what I think we should be doing instead--focusing on \nintelligence community reform, instead of just reorganization. I will \nalso touch very briefly on two additional areas in which I had proposed \namendments: visa reform, and tools and resources for fighting terror.\n  Former Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger identified one of the \nkey problems with the 9/11 Commission recommendations:\n\n       [The Commission] has . . . proposed a substantial \n     reorganization of the intelligence community--changes that do \n     not logically flow from the problems that the Commission \n     identified in its narrative.\n\n  The Commission identified four categories of failures by the U.S. \nGovernment that ultimately led to the attacks of September 11, 2001: \nimagination, policy, capabilities, and management. After reviewing the \n9/11 Commission's narrative of these failures and studying its 41 \nrecommendations to prevent future such failures, I am hard pressed to \nsee what most of the recommendations have to do with the problems \nidentified.\n  I will briefly touch on each of these broad problems identified by \nthe Commission and assess how they will be addressed by both the \nCommission and later the Senate's legislation.\n  First, lack of imagination. I agree that this problem was a \nsignificant contributor not only to the failure of intelligence \ncommunity to predict the 9/11 attacks, but also the vast majority of \nthe intelligence failures that have plagued our intelligence community \nover the past 20 years. A lack of imagination is simply an extension of \nthe much broader and more pervasive cultural problems such as risk \naversion, group think and a lack of competitive analysis that continue \nto hamper our intelligence and law enforcement agencies. I will deal \nwith these problems in more detail later; but it is clear that none \nof the Commission's recommendations or this bill's provisions begin to \naddress this culture problem; and, in fact, one recommendation could \nsubstantially increase risk aversion, a problem exacerbated by the \nbill's redundant provisions piling on layers of civil liberties and \nprivacy review.\n\n  The Commission itself notes that ``Imagination is not a gift usually \nassociated with bureaucracies,'' and so it is ironic that Commission \nproposes to create an even more bureaucratic intelligence structure. \nChairman Kean and Vice Chairman Hamilton contend that an empowered NID \nwill foster competitive analysis and quash group think because that \nindividual will draw on the perspectives of all the intelligence \nagencies, rather than just the CIA, as the DCI is now more likely to \ndo.\n  But a convincing case can be made that the creation of national \nintelligence director with budgetary authority over most of the \nintelligence community could actually exacerbate the community's lack \nof imagination. Under such a centralized system, it is far more likely \nthat agencies, like DHS's Information Analysis office, will be inclined \nto provide a commonly accepted view because the NID will control their \nbudgets. As such, they will lack the protection that their previous \npatron--the Department of Homeland Security, in this case--provided \nthem. Risk aversion and group think are, therefore, likely to become \neven more widespread problems.\n  The second failure identified by the Commission is one of policy. \nHere the report faults not the intelligence community, but political \nleaders, including Members of Congress, for failing to act even when \nthere was a clear threat. Terrorists had demonstrated time and time \nagain that they were at war with us: in 1993 at the World Trade Center; \nin 1995 at a U.S. military barracks in Saudi Arabia; in 1998 at the \nU.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania; and in 2000 with the bombing of \nthe USS Cole. Almost a decade of attacks resulted in little more than a \nsingle cruise missile strike that destroyed a pharmaceutical plant.\n  This failure of decisionmaking really calls for a fix that can't be \nlegislated--good leadership.\n  The Commission makes a number of related recommendations on how to \nfight the war on terror, with the goal of making another attack less \nlikely. These range from the obvious, ``make a long-term commitment to \nAfghanistan,'' to the irrelevant and unwise, declassifying the overall \nintelligence\n\n[[Page S10525]]\n\nbudget. On the whole, however, most of recommendations are already \nbeing implemented in some fashion, and have been underway since shortly \nafter the attacks. I commend to my colleagues a fact sheet prepared by \nthe White House detailing its implementation of the majority of the 9/\n11 Commission's recommendation.\n  On a more specific level, one area where not enough work has been \ndone is that of terrorists' travel. The Commission correctly identifies \nthe importance of the problem arguing, ``[f]or terrorists, travel \ndocuments are as important as weapons,'' and I am, therefore, surprised \nthat the Commission and the committee have decided to put that issue on \nthe backburner. I will return to this issue in more detail shortly, but \nit is one area where Congress can make an important contribution to \nU.S. security and we should not abdicate that responsibility.\n  The third failure is one of capabilities. It is here that the 9/11 \nCommission highlights numerous glaring weaknesses in how the \nintelligence community shared information, prepared for potential \nattacks and planned for U.S. responses. The Commission recommends \nimprovements in information sharing and the parts of this legislation \nthat seek to implement these are important.\n  Regardless of how we ultimately decide to organize the intelligence \ncommunity, it is important that we improve and streamline information \nsharing. Congress has already taken some important steps toward that \nobjective. For example, the PATRIOT Act, enacted shortly after the \nSeptember 11 attacks, improved information sharing by breaking \ndown legal barriers between intelligence and law enforcement, but it is \nclear we will not be able to make the Patriot Act provisions permanent \nin this bill.\n\n  Unfortunately, the 9/11 Commission overlooks the fact that solving \nthe capabilities problem requires far more than just improving the \nsharing of information. The problem extends beyond what intelligence is \navailable to an analyst at any given time. The 9/11 Commission, the \nJoint House-Senate Inquiry into the 9/11 attacks, and the recently \ncompleted Senate Select Committee on Intelligence investigation into \npre-war intelligence on Iraq all point to far deeper deficiencies. They \nidentify core cultural problems. Indeed, too often the right \ninformation is not collected due to, among other things, excessive risk \naversion, and analysis of the information is not adequately questioned \nto ensure that group think has not replaced sound judgment.\n  The Commission focused on only one recommendation for fixing a \nlaundry list of problems with the CIA's collection and analysis, and \nonly one recommendation on improvements to the FBI's intelligence \ncapabilities. On the other hand, the Commission devoted three \nrecommendations to protecting civil liberties, though none is designed \nto prevent a future attack.\n  The last failure identified by the Commission is one of management. \nIt is this failure that leads the Commission to recommend the creation \nof the National Intelligence Director. The report highlights the \ninability of then-DCI George Tenet to mobilize the entire intelligence \ncommunity after he issued a memo stating, ``We are at war'' with \nterrorists. However, the 9/11 Commission's report states that the DCI's \nmemo had ``little overall effect on mobilizing the CIA.'' If even the \nCIA, where the Director has complete budgetary and line control, did \nnot respond to the DCI's memo, we should not be confident that simply \nputting someone at the top of a new organizational chart is the panacea \nthat some claim.\n  It warrants noting that the 9/11 Commission details an example, from \nbefore 9/11 and the changes that followed, where the intelligence and \nlaw enforcement communities were able to mobilize, break down \nstovepipes and information was shared ``widely and abundantly.'' This \nexample--termed the ``Millennium Exception'' by the Commission--focuses \non the last weeks of December 1999, when the government ``acted in \nconcert to deal with terrorism.'' The Government's approach to this \nthreat, demonstrate the power of strong leadership and commitment, \ndespite what some call a disjointed intelligence organization.\n  Too often problems of management have less to do with organizational \nstructure, and more to do with the managers themselves. I fear that we \nare rushing to implement sweeping organizational changes because it is \nthe easy thing to do, not because it is necessarily the right thing to \ndo. In the meantime, the hard work of changing the culture of the \ncommunity seems to have been pushed to the side.\n  The Senate is currently considering a reorganization package that \ncontains a number of the 9/11 Commission's 41 recommendations. Among \nthe most significant, the bill establishes a Senate-confirmed national \nintelligence director with strong budget, personnel, security, and \nother authorities; creates a national counterterrorism center, NCTC, to \nintegrate intelligence capabilities and develop joint counterterrorism \nplans; redefines the National Foreign Intelligence Program as the \nNational Intelligence Program--which includes the national collection \nagencies within the Defense Department, NSA, NGA, and NRO; and contains \nprovisions that require the establishment of an information sharing \nnetwork.\n  The bill is called the National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004. But \nit does not reform the intelligence community; it reorganizes it. It \ndoes not get at the fundamental problems in the intelligence community \nidentified by the 9/11 Commission and the other intelligence \ninvestigations and inquiries over the last several years. And, \nunfortunately, in at least one glaring respect, it violates the first \nrule of medicine and legislating in that it does do harm. Moreover, \neven if the reshuffling of bureaucracy can ultimately be made to work, \ndoing so now, while our country is at war, makes it very hard to supply \nour strategists, planners, and warfighters the information they need, \nwhen they need it.\n\n  I have taken under careful advisement the cautious tone of many \nformer and current officials. For example, in his testimony to the \nSenate Armed Services Committee on August 17, 2004, Secretary of \nDefense Donald Rumsfeld stated:\n\n       In pursuit of strengthening our nation's intelligence \n     capabilities, I would offer a cautionary note. It is \n     important that we move with all deliberate speed; however, \n     moving too quickly risks enormous error . . . And we are \n     considering these important matters while waging a war.\n\n  The Center for Strategic and International Studies, CSIS, recently \nreleased a statement, signed by an experienced group of former \nofficials, urging similar caution. The statement was endorsed by: \nformer Senators David Boren, Bill Bradley, Gary Hart, Sam Nunn, and \nWarren Rudman; former Secretaries of Defense Frank Carlucci and William \nCohen; former Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre; former Director \nof Central Intelligence Robert Gates; former Secretary of State and \nNational Security Advisor Henry Kissinger; and former Secretary of \nState George Shultz. It said:\n\n       Rushing in with solutions before we understand all of the \n     problems is a recipe for failure.\n\n  In his testimony, Secretary Rumsfeld discussed in detail his concerns \nabout how intelligence community reorganization could potentially \nadversely affect the Defense Department. He expressed his strong \nreservations about the national collection agencies--the NSA, NGA, and \nNRO--being removed from the Defense Department, where they are now \nlocated, and aligned under the direct leadership of the national \nintelligence director. He stated:\n\n       ``We wouldn't want to place new barriers or filters between \n     the military Combatant Commanders and those agencies when \n     they perform as combat support agencies. It would be a major \n     step to separate these key agencies from the military \n     Combatant Commanders, which are the major users of such \n     capabilities.\n\n  The Defense Department worked tirelessly in the decade after the \nfirst gulf war to ensure that the speed and scope of intelligence \nsupport to military operations would be improved for future conflicts. \nIt was General Schwartz\nkopf's view that the national intelligence support during Desert Storm \nwas not adequate. Now, as we have seen from the success of our military \noperations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the broader War on Terror, ``gaps \nand seams,'' as Secretary Rumsfeld refers to them, have been \ndrastically reduced.\n  General Myers, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also expressed \nhis\n\n[[Page S10526]]\n\nconcerns on the subject during his testimony to the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, stating:\n\n     . . . for the warfighter, from the combatant commander down \n     to the private on patrol, timely, accurate intelligence is \n     literally a life and death matter every day. . . . As we move \n     forward, we cannot create any institutional barriers between \n     intelligence agencies--and of course that would include the \n     National Security Agency, the National Geospacial-\n     Intelligence Agency, and the National Reconnaissance office \n     and the rest of the warfighting team.\n\n  I am concerned that the reorganization package before the Senate \nplaces this effective system in jeopardy.\n  In S. 2485, the NSA, NGA, and NRO remain within DOD; but this is \nsomewhat deceiving. These national collection agencies will also be \nwithin the newly defined National Intelligence Program. The Committee-\nreported bill would essentially remove the Secretary of Defense from \nany meaningful management role over these agencies.\n  First, the national intelligence director would have the authority to \nappoint the heads of these agencies, albeit with the concurrence of the \nSecretary of Defense. What makes this unusual and potentially \nproblematic? Well, consider the fact that the Director of the National \nSecurity Agency, a general officer, is dual-hatted as the Deputy \nCommander for Network Attack, Planning, and Integration at Strategic \nCommand, or that the Director of the National Reconnaissance Office \nalso serves as an Under Secretary of the Air Force. These positions \ntruly support the mission of the Defense Department\n\n  Second, the national intelligence director would have the authority \nto execute the budgets of these agencies. It is one thing to say that \nthe NID should manage the entire budget for the National Intelligence \nProgram, and, therefore, to help develop agencies' budgets and even \nreceive their appropriation. It is quite another to altogether remove \nthe Secretary of Defense from the loop by requiring that the NID \nsuballocate funding directly back to the agencies. This effectively \nremoves the Secretary from the management loop.\n  I have studied the Defense Secretary's testimony to the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, as well as the testimony of other experts. I am \nalso aware that there were some good amendments in the committee markup \nto help preserve the Defense Department's equities. But I am still not \nconvinced that we are doing no harm. As General Myers commented during \nthe course of the Senate Armed Services Committee's discussion on the \nsubject, ``[T]he devil's in the details.''\n  I recognize that during the course of the Senate's debate on this \nbill, several of my colleagues have offered amendments to ensure that \nthe equities of the Defense Department are protected, and I applaud \nthem for their efforts.\n  So, while I am not convinced we are doing no harm--particularly with \nrespect to ensuring our warfighters have the intelligence support they \nneed--I am also not convinced that we are necessarily doing much good. \nAgain, the solutions of the 9/11 Commission, and, in turn, the Senate \nbill, don't seem to match the problems.\n  I would like to discuss an example of what I believe we could do to \nhelp minimize our chances of another catastrophic terrorist attack--by \naddressing cultural problems in the intelligence community, including \nrisk aversion, group think, and a failure of leadership.\n  I was a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee for 8 years and \nparticipated in the first of the post-9/11 evaluations--the joint \nSenate-House inquiry, formally named the Joint Inquiry into \nIntelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist \nAttacks of September 11, 2001. Along with the current Intelligence \nCommittee chairman, I offered additional views to that report which, \nhad I been part of the 9/11 Commission, I would similarly have \nsubmitted. Those additional views describe the core cultural problems \nin the intelligence community that can't simply be solved by \nreorganizing agencies. On this, the Commission report and the bill \nbefore us missed the mark in many respects.\n  First, let's consider risk aversion, which plays out not only in the \nintelligence community, but also in foreign policy decisionmaking, \neconomics, business investments, and so on. There are many potential \nreasons for risk aversion--a particular action might have adverse, \nunintended consequences, might get one into trouble with one's \nsuperiors, or might simply draw unwanted attention, just to name a few. \nWhen an individual or a government acts, there is always a calculation \nof risk; but some governments and some individuals are more willing to \ntake chances than others. This is a product of both leadership and \nenvironment.\n  An aversion to taking risks--even when they should be taken--plagues \nour intelligence community. Indeed, in the course of our congressional \ninquiry on the 9/11 attacks no intelligence or law-enforcement agency \nescaped being described by its own officials as hampered by an aversion \nto thinking critically, exposing their views to others, and being \nwilling to boldly take risks. Time and time again, this has contributed \nto intelligence failures--most recently, of course, 9/11 and the \nintelligence communities' claims about Saddam's stockpiles of weapons \nof mass destruction.\n\n  The 9/11 Commission also addressed the issue of risk aversion within \nthe CIA, noting the net result for that agency pre-9/11: \n\n       . . . an organization capable of attracting extraordinarily \n     motivated people but institutionally averse to risk, with its \n     capacity for covert action atrophied, predisposed to restrict \n     the distribution of information, having difficulty \n     assimilating new types of personnel, and accustomed to \n     presenting descriptive reportage of the latest intelligence.\n\n  One of the most well known examples of the problem of risk aversion \nin the context of the 9/11 attacks was the FBI's failure to respond to \nthe ``Phoenix Memorandum,'' written by a Phoenix special agent who \nwanted to alert his superiors about suspicious individuals seeking \npilot training. The now-famous electronic communication to FBI \nheadquarters recommended that the FBI consider seeking authority to \nobtain visa information from the State Department on individuals who \nobtained visas to attend flight school.\n  The intelligence operations specialists at headquarters who reviewed \nthe memo told the staff of the congressional joint inquiry that they \nhad decided among themselves that seeking that authority raised \nprofiling concerns. These concerns stemmed at least in part from \nprevious public allegations of racial profiling against FBI agents who \nhad questioned two Middle Eastern men acting suspiciously on a flight \nfrom Phoenix to Washington, DC, in 1999.\n  On a broader--not case-specific--level, the intelligence community's \nclandestine service has been seriously hampered by an aversion to \ntaking risks. According to the 9/11 Commission's report, James Pavitt, \nthe head of the CIA's Directorate of Operations, recalled that covert \naction had gotten the clandestine service into trouble in the past, and \nhe had no desire to see it happen again.\n  It is likely that this ``trouble'' was at least in part a result of \ncongressional actions, for example the 1976 Church Committee \ninvestigation, which was set up in the wake of revelations about \nassassination plots organized by the CIA. The investigation resulted in \nsome 183 recommendations, and subsequent legislative proposals and \ndebate that consumed considerable attention over a number of years. In \npart, that debate focused on specific, clearly defined limitations and \nprohibitions on intelligence activities.\n  Obviously, as we move forward with reforming congressional oversight \nof the intelligence community, there will be a need to balance strong \nand effective oversight with not hamstringing the community and \ncreating an even more risk averse environment.\n  The culture of risk aversion in the clandestine service was also \naccentuated by executive branch actions during the Clinton \nadministration. For example, risk aversion in the clandestine service \nwas compounded by the 1995 Deutch Guidelines, CIA guidelines \npromulgated by then-Director of the CIA, John Deutch, which severely \nlimited the ability of CIA case officers to meet with and recruit \nforeign nationals who may have been involved in dubious activities or \nhave blood on their hands. Incidentally, during his tenure, Mr. Deutch \nalso conducted a CIA-wide ``asset scrub,'' which applied an inflexible \nreporting standard to all CIA spies\n\n[[Page S10527]]\n\nthat, if not met, resulted in their automatic firing. How can you \neffectively penetrate an organization or adversarial regime without \ndealing with unsavory characters? Thankfully, the Deutch Guidelines \nwere finally repealed by the DCI in July 2002; but, their repercussions \nhad a lasting effect on the culture of the Directorate of Operations.\n  So, here we have a clandestine service unwilling to take the risks \nthat are, by nature, part of the job. Compound that with the fact that \nthe DO had few resources. Between 1992 and 1998, the Central \nIntelligence Agency closed one-third of its overseas field stations, \nlost one-quarter of its clandestine service case officers, lost 40 \npercent of its recruited spies, and CIA intelligence reports declined \nby nearly one-half.\n\n  The result of this deterioration of a key part of our intelligence \ncommunity was that, before 9/11, we had not one human source inside al-\nQaida's command structure. What did the 9/11 Commission recommend to \ntransform the clandestine service into a unit more effectively able to \npenetrate al-Qaida.\n\n       The CIA Director should emphasize . . . ``(b) transforming \n     the clandestine service by building its human intelligence \n     capabilities; (c) developing a stronger language program, \n     with high standards and sufficient financial incentives; (d) \n     renewing emphasis on recruiting diversity among operations \n     officers so they can blend more easily in foreign cities; (e) \n     ensuring a seamless relationship between human source \n     collection and signals collection at the operational level; \n     and (f) stressing a better balance between unilateral and \n     liaison operations.\n\n  As Reuel Gerecht, American Enterprise Institute scholar, commented in \na recent article in the Weekly Standard, ``That's it. In a 447-page \nreport on the intelligence failings of 9/11, the clandestine service \ngets nine lines. The important bit--`transforming the clandestine \nservice . . .' is a 10-word platitude.'' The intelligence reform bill \nwe are considering this week similarly fails to delve into this central \nproblem. Even if we put the resources back in, we have not figured out \nhow to deal with the mentality now ingrained in our covert officers.\n  Finally, as I previously noted, I believe the bill currently before \nthe Senate will exacerbate the risk aversion problem in at least one \nrespect: its creation of an excessive, redundant bureaucracy to oversee \nthe protection of privacy and civil liberties. Should there be \nprotections and oversight? Yes. But should there be so many layers of \nsuch oversight that intelligence officers are more worried about \ngetting into trouble than about adequately performing their missions? \nCertainly not.\n  The provisions in this bill dealing with privacy and civil liberties \nare quite extensive. In summary, the bill establishes: two officers \nwithin the National Intelligence Authority, one responsible for \nprivacy, the other for civil rights and civil liberties; an Inspector \nGeneral within the National Intelligence Authority, who, in part, \nmonitors and informs the National Intelligence Director of any \nviolations of civil liberties and privacy; an Ombudsman within the \nNational Intelligence Authority to protect against so-called \npoliticization of intelligence; an independent Privacy and Civil \nLiberties Oversight Board with extensive investigative authorities; and \nprivacy and civil liberties officers within the Departments of Justice, \nDefense, State, Treasury, Health and Human Services, and Homeland \nSecurity, the National Intelligence Authority, the Central Intelligence \nAgency, and any other department, agency, or element of the Executive \nBranch designated by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to \nbe appropriate for coverage.\n  These provisions reach far beyond what the 9/11 Commission \nrecommended--an executive branch board to oversee the protection \nprivacy and civil liberties. The President already created such a board \nthrough executive order on August 27.\n  Under the construct offered in the Governmental Affairs Committee \nbill there will simply be too many people performing the same task. It \nwill be inefficient; it will be counterproductive; and it will add yet \nanother legal hurdle for our intelligence officers to overcome. Our \ngoal should be to make it easier for them to do their jobs--to detect \nand prevent future catastrophic terrorist attacks--not more difficult. \nLet's not forget why we are reforming the intelligence community. It is \nto prevent another 9/11. The problem is not that we invaded suspects' \nprivacy, but that we didn't know enough about them to prevent the \nattack.\n  I offered an amendment to S. 2845, which I discussed several times on \nthe floor of the Senate, to eliminate some of this redundant oversight. \nI withdrew that amendment reluctantly, but with the understanding that \nthe issue would be resolved in conference. I plan to continue to press \nmy case on this matter because I believe it is central to ensuring that \nwe do not make worse the already existing problem of risk aversion \nwithin the intelligence community.\n\n  Second, group think. This problem is not unrelated to the problem of \nrisk aversion. The result of analysts' fears of taking risks is often \nthat they are unable to think outside the box, to break free of the \ngenerally-accepted assumptions held by their agency or by the rest of \nthe intelligence community.\n  In his August 16 testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nformer Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger discussed the problem at \nlength, stating:\n\n       Different organizations will drift gravitate towards \n     different ways of organizing reality--based upon their range \n     of responsibilities and, also, their interests in a narrower \n     sense. Most individuals make themselves comfortable in their \n     own organizations by not challenging a prevailing consensus.\n\n  Another cause of group think is simply a lack of imagination. In a \nrecent op-ed in the Washington Post, Henry Kissinger raises some \nimportant questions about the reforms currently being pursued. He \nstates that the basic premise of the ``current emphasis on \ncentralization'' through the creation of a director of national \nintelligence ``seems to be that the cause of most intelligence failures \nis inadequate collection and coordination.'' Kissinger believes, \nhowever, that ``the breakdown usually occurs in the assessment stage.'' \nHe attributes that breakdown to a failure of imagination to connect the \ndots of available knowledge. His op-ed describes in detail how a lack \nof imagination led to the major intelligence failures of the last 4 \ndecades: the 1973 Middle East War, the Indian nuclear test of 1998, the \nSeptember 11 attacks, and the failure to find WMD stockpiles in Iraq.\n  How do we solve this problem? Well, let's take the issue of Iraq's \nweapons. The Senate concluded in its bipartisan report on the \nintelligence community's assessment:\n\n       The presumption that Iraq had active WMD programs was so \n     strong that formalized IC mechanisms to challenge assumptions \n     and ``group think,'' such as ``red teams,'' ``devil \n     advocacy,'' and other types of alternative, or competitive \n     analysis, were not utilized.\n\n  Former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger recommends precisely what \nthe bipartisan report said was lacking. In his testimony, SASC, August \n16, he stated:\n\n       The only solution within an organization is to establish a \n     Devil's Advocacy organization to challenge the prevailing \n     beliefs.\n\n  This is an imperfect solution, as Secretary Schlesinger further \nnotes, but, still, if we had had such mechanisms, we would have had a \nfar greater chance of reaching the truth. Yet, neither the Commission \nnor the Committee recommends such a ``red team'' or ``devil's \nadvocacy'' entity or process. We will have to do it by amendment.\n  This is one place where we can learn from our past successes and \nfailures. Historically speaking, ``red teams,'' have been helpful \ninside and outside of the intelligence community. In the 1970s, for \nexample, the intelligence community persisted in underestimating the \nsize and scale of the Soviet arms build-up. In response, Congress \ncreated a ``red team'' called Team B to review the IC's analysis. Team \nB's report, which documented how far off the intelligence community \nwas, laid the foundation for President Reagan to rebuild the U.S. \nmilitary in the 1980s.\n  More recently, the Rumsfeld Commission on the ballistic missile \nthreat was created to play devil's advocate with the findings of the \nintelligence community. Not surprisingly, the Commission found the \nestimates far off, dramatically underestimating the time it would take \nfor a country to procure or produce a ballistic missile.\n  The chairmen of the 9/11 Commission, Thomas Kean and Lee Hamilton, \nrecognize the group think problem in their\n\n[[Page S10528]]\n\nSeptember 8 Washington Post op-ed, and offer that their proposed \nreforms ``institutionalize information-sharing, thus guaranteeing a \ncompetitive airing of views.'' They further state:\n\n       We don't want dissent quashed by group-think; we want \n     competing analyses to be shared broadly . . .\n\n  But as key experts, like Henry Kissinger and Jim Schlesinger, point \nout, it is valid to question whether centralized intelligence--which we \nare now pursuing--encourages conformity, making the problem of group \nthink worse. At best, that structural change will do nothing to affect \nthe problem.\n  Last, but certainly not least, leadership is a problem that simply \ncannot be solved legislatively. Conversely, good leadership can \npotentially solve the other cultural issues I have identified.\n  Al-Qaida's attack on Washington and New York occurred after a long \nperiod of poor leadership at the highest levels of the U.S. Government \nregarding terrorism. Despite repeated assaults on the United States and \nits interests, the U.S. Government was still unwilling to treat \nterrorism as a true national security issue until after 9/11.\n  This was, of course, partly a failure of political leadership. But \nthe intelligence community is not absolved, either. The problem of \ninadequate allocation of resources in the intelligence community, for \nexample, was at least partly a result of confused leadership in the \ncommunity. In spite of a 1998 declaration of war on al-Qaida by the \nDirector of Central Intelligence, two key organizations--namely, the \nDefense Intelligence Agency and the Federal Aviation Administration--\nwere not allowed, though they offered, to throw their support behind \nthe antiterror effort.\n  Counterterrorism analytic centers were fragmented across the \nadministration at the Pentagon, the CIA, and various FBI locations. \nOnly after 9/11 did various intelligence and law enforcement entities \nbegin to put aside their parochialism and work together in a more \nproductive manner. And certainly reorganization was a partial fix for \nthe problem--in particular, the new Terrorist Threat Integration \nCenter, TTIC, which merges and analyzes all threat information in a \nsingle location under the direction of the DCI, has been beneficial. \nBut, with better leadership of the intelligence community, the \ncondition would not have been so prevalent in the first place. It would \nnot have taken a monumental disaster for these entities to cooperate \nmore effectively with one another.\n  I would now like to briefly discuss visa reform. I am pleased that \nthe Collins-Lieberman bill, with the addition of Kyl amendment No. \n3926, will at least tighten up immigration law to require, in statute, \nthat most temporary visa applicants be personally interviewed by State \nDepartment consular officers during the application process, and that \nall such applicants be required to actually complete their visa \napplications to get a visa. Past misuse of immigration law allowed 15 \nof the 19 September 11 hijackers to enter the United States without \ncompleting their applications or being interviewed.\n  Some might question why such State Department regulations need to be \nincluded as statutory language in the Immigration and Nationality Act. \nSection 214(b) of the INA governs the admission of nonimmigrants to the \nUnited States. It presumes that an alien who applies for a temporary \nvisa actually intends to stay in the United States permanently ``until \nhe establishes to the satisfaction of the consular office'' that he \nintends to stay temporarily. This means that the burden of proof is on \nthe alien to show that he is eligible to receive a visa and that he \nwill not overstay or otherwise violate the terms of the visa. Had the \nState Department required its consular affairs officers to implement \nsection 214(b) correctly, and thus to conduct in-person interviews and \nrequire that visa applications be completely and accurately filled out, \nto meet the burden of proof requirement, the tragedy of 9/11 could have \nbeen prevented.\n  The intent of Section 214(b) was not carried out by the State \nDepartment consular affairs officers who issued visas to the 9/11 \nhijackers. Fifteen of the 19 men who flew hijacked airplanes into the \nWorld Trade Center, the Pentagon, and the Pennsylvania countryside were \nSaudi nationals who should have been denied admission to the United \nStates under section 214(b) because their visa applications contained \ninaccuracies or omissions. These were not trivial mistakes in spelling \nor punctuation. The applications omitted such fundamental information \nas: means of financial support, home address, and destination or \naddress while in the United States. According to an October 28, 2002 \nNational Review article by Joel Mowbray under the title and subtitle \n``Visas for Terrorists: They were ill-prepared. They were laughable. \nThey were approved,'' only one of the 15 applicants listed an actual \ndestination address for inside the United States. The rest listed \nlocations such as ``California,'' ``New York,'' or simply ``Hotel.''\n  Section 214(b) should also have been used to require face-to-face \ninterviews of those applying for nonimmigrant visas. Only two of the 15 \nSaudi hijackers were interviewed by State Department officials. Such \nlaxity by consular officers, however, occurred under guidelines and \npractices put in place by senior State Department officials. According \nto cables and other written notices sent over time by Mary Ryan, who \nwas Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs on September 11, 2001, \nshortening the visa application process wherever possible was a ``very \nworthy goal.''\n  Such top-down guidelines were explored in an October 2002 GAO report, \n``Border Security: Visa Process Should Be Strengthened as Antiterrorism \nTool.'' The report says the State Department's written guidelines and \nresulting practices for visa issuance allowed for ``widespread \ndiscretionary adherence among consular officers in adhering to the \nburden of proof requirements included in section 214(b).'' The GAO \nreport also says the State Department's ``Consular Best Practices \nHandbook'' gave consular managers and staff the discretion to ``waive \npersonal appearance and interviews for certain nonimmigrant visa \napplicants.''\n  The 9/11 Commission was provided detailed information about the State \nDepartment's use of section 214(b) and its contribution, in my opinion, \nto the tragedy of 9/11. In a letter to the 9/11 Commission on April 23, \n2004, I said how important it was that the 9/11 Commission focus on the \nState Department's contribution to the dysfunction of the visa-issuance \nsystem prior to September 11. In a followup letter on May 13, 2004 to \nthe Commission, I stated that correct use of the statutory law \ngoverning nonimmigrant visa issuance could have kept several, if not \nall, of the 9/11 hijackers from entering the country.\n  The amendment that the bill managers have accepted is based on the \nregulations promulgated by the State Department in the Foreign Affairs \nManual it issued after September 11. It requires that all aliens who \napply for a nonimmigrant visa submit to an in-person interview with a \nconsular affairs officer. Although the primary purpose of the in-person \ninterview is to determine whether an applicant will overstay his or her \nvisa, it is also a prime opportunity for a consular affairs officer to \ngauge the intent of the applicant to try to make sure that the \napplicant does not intend to harm the United States. I recognize that \nnot every person may have to be interviewed, so my amendment allows \napplicants under the age of 12, individuals over the age of 65, \ndiplomats, and certain other individuals to be exempt from the in-\nperson interview requirement if the consular affairs officer deems it \nappropriate.\n  My amendment also requires that, even if the nonimmigrant visa \napplicant falls into a category for which an interview is not \nnecessarily required, one will be required if he is not a national of \nthe country in which he is applying for a visa; if he was previously \nrefused a visa; or if he is listed in the Consular Lookout and Support \nSystem. CLASS is the State Department's database that lists all \napplicants about whom the Department has security concerns. Finally, my \namendment requires that all applicants for nonimmigrant visas provide \ncomplete and accurate information in response to every question on the \nnonimmigrant visa application. This is to ensure that the application \nis completely filled out and that the applicant has provided enough \ninformation to meet the burden of proof required by section 214(b) of \nthe INA.\n\n[[Page S10529]]\n\n  The codification of these few provisions will help ensure that \nterrorists are not able to enter the country using legally issued \nvisas. Provisions to that effect ought to be in any piece of \nlegislation aimed at preventing additional terrorist attacks on this \ncountry. I appreciate the willingness of Senators Collins and Lieberman \nto work with me to modify the amendment to make it acceptable.\n  Before I close, I want to note that I have separately discussed \nanother related area in serious need of attention: making sure we have \nthe legal authorities and resources we need to effectively fight \nterror. I had prepared several amendments on this topic, which I \nintended to introduce to this bill, but because some Members \nerroneously believed that these amendments were highly controversial, I \nchose not to pursue them.\n  These amendments, one of which was my Tools for Terrorism, TFTA, bill \nin its entirety, others of which were parts of that bill, should not \nhave been considered controversial. TFTA is not new--it is composed of \nbills that have been pending, have been approved by the Justice \nDepartment, and have been the subject of nine separate hearings. TFTA \nconsists of all or part of 11 bills currently pending in the House and \nSenate. Every provision of the bill previously has either been \nintroduced as a bill in the House or Senate or had a committee hearing. \nEvery provision of the bill has the full support of the Justice \nDepartment. Collectively, the provisions of this bill have been the \nsubject of nine separate hearings before House and Senate committees \nand have been the subject of four separate committee reports. \nFurthermore, collectively, the bills included in TFTA have been pending \nbefore Congress for 13 years.\n  That said, in the interest of allowing the Senate to move forward \nquickly, and noting that some of the provisions of my TFTA bill are \nincluded in the House version of the Intelligence Reform bill, I have \ndecided to continue to try to press my case during the House-Senate \nconference.\n  My intention today was not to create a sense of futility in this \nbody's efforts, but rather to express reservations about the proposed \nsolutions and highlight those areas I know need to be resolved if we \nare to effectively wage the war on terror. A careful reading of the \ncongressional joint inquiry report, the Senate's Iraq intelligence \ninvestigation, and the 9/11 Commission's narrative of the failures that \nled to 9/11 all point to far deeper deficiencies than can be solved by \nbureaucratic reorganization.\n  I plan to vote for this bill, but I do so recognizing that it is \nimperfect, and also with the clear intention of continuing to press my \ncase for various modifications in conference.\n  Finally, while it is true that, if we do reform right, we will be \nable to improve our intelligence, it will never be the case that our \nintelligence is perfect. It is next to impossible to imagine every \npossibly means by which we might be attacked. As Judge Richard Posner \npoints out in his New York Times Book review:\n\n       The [9/11 Commission] narrative points to something \n     different, banal and deeply disturbing; that it is almost \n     impossible to take effective action to prevent something that \n     hasn't occurred previously.\n\n  This does not mean we should not try; it does mean that we have to be \nrealistic about the limitations of intelligence.\n  Those limitations make solid political leadership all the more \nimportant. Intelligence, diplomacy, military, law enforcement--these \nare all tools in our arsenal to fight the war on terror and whatever \nother threats may come our way. Decisionmakers must be willing to use \nthem effectively. That is what will offer our greatest protection \nagainst another devastating attack.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Congress has no more solemn obligation \nthan to ensure our Government can effectively defend the American \npeople. We must put America's security first.\n  The attacks of September 11 exposed serious weaknesses at every level \nof our Government's response to terrorism.\n  Since that awful day, many of us in Congress have resolved to do \neverything possible to understand how a handful of terrorists could \ndefeat the entire U.S. Government's defenses and then adapt those \ndefenses in order to prevent future attacks and make America safer.\n  The bill we are about vote on reflects the lessons of our inquiries.\n  It is thorough, thoughtful, bipartisan, and most important, rooted \nfirmly in the facts behind the greatest failure of American \nintelligence in our lifetime.\n  When enacted, this legislation will improve our Government's ability \nto disrupt and prevent the kind of devastating attacks we witnessed \nthat fateful day 3 years ago. In short, it will make America and \nAmericans more secure.\n  I can think of no more important action this Senate can take in the \nremaining days of this session than to pass this legislation and move \nit to a conference with the House.\n  Immediately following the attack of the World Trade Center and \nPentagon, Congress began a thorough investigation to uncover precisely \nwhat went wrong in the days leading up to September 11.\n  The House and Senate Intelligence Committees conducted a bipartisan \ninquiry.\n  They received thousands of pages of documents, conducted hundreds of \nhours of hearings, and heard from scores of Government and \nnongovernment witnesses who offered meaningful insights into what \nhappened and how.\n  The unanimous, bipartisan recommendations of that report were \navailable in December 2002.\n  Independent of this effort, President Bush had asked GEN Brent \nScowcroft, National Security Advisor to former President Bush, to \nexamine our intelligence community and suggest reforms that could make \nit function more effectively.\n  According to press accounts, the recommendations of that \ninvestigation were available in March 2002.\n  In addition, despite opposition from the White House, a strong \nbipartisan coalition was forged in the Congress to establish an \nindependent, blue ribbon commission to investigate the circumstances \nsurrounding the 9/11 attacks and provide us with a roadmap for how to \nimprove our defenses, specifically those of our intelligence community.\n  The White House eventually gave the Commission its support and its \ncooperation. The unanimous, bipartisan recommendations of that \ncommission were released in July 2004.\n  That is three separate investigations in less than 3 years--three \nseparate investigations that originated in either the Congress or the \nBush administration. Each investigation represented different points of \nview and perspectives. Yet each investigation reached the same \nconclusion: If our intelligence community is to respond quickly and \neffectively to terrorism, there must be a single person in charge with \nthe authority to allocate resources and direct personnel. There must be \na single person responsible for setting the direction of our \nintelligence operations.\n  And there must be a single person accountable for the success or \nfailure of those operations.\n  The legislation before us reflects the lessons learned from these \ninvestigations and it is particularly faithful to the 9/11 Commission's \nrecommendations.\n  Not only does this legislation establish a national intelligence \ndirector with real power, it goes on to make a series of fundamental \nchanges in the intelligence community and related Government agencies.\n  Just as important as what it does, is what it does not do. It does \nnot stray from the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. It avoids \nextraneous issues that would have only brought divisiveness and delay \nto this debate. Time is of the essence.\n  As Governor Kean said when releasing his commission's report:\n\n       Every day that passes is a day of increased risk if we do \n     not make changes.\n\n  America could not wait and the Senate wisely focused on the most \nurgent challenges at hand.\n  I am especially grateful to Senators Collins and Lieberman, the \nmanagers of this important legislation.\n  Shortly after the 9/11 Commission issued its report, Senator Frist \nand I assigned them the difficult task of taking the Commission's \nrecommendations on the executive branch and producing a bill that \nconverts these proposals into legislative language.\n\n[[Page S10530]]\n\n  They have not only done that, they have managed to grasp the details \nof this complicated bill and produce strong bipartisan support for \ntheir bill.\n  As I noted above, Senate passage will get this bill to a conference \nwith the House and their version of this legislation. Unfortunately, it \nappears that some in the other body do not share this goal of swiftly \nenacting the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. They do not believe we \nshould limit our work to the 9/11 Commission's work. Nor do they \nbelieve our top goal should be to defeat terrorists rather than push \npartisan political agendas.\n  Many of the people who are apparently willing to pursue this course \nhave fought real reform efforts from the start. They opposed forming \nthe 9/11 Commission. They opposed cooperating with the 9/11 Commission. \nThey opposed giving the Commission the time and funding it needed to do \nits job. It is not surprising to learn now that they are now opposed to \ngiving the Commission's recommendations a fair hearing.\n  We can't afford to keep kicking this can down the road. It may seem \nobvious, but there are some who seem not to understand that American \nlives are at stake.\n  This is the best--and perhaps last--opportunity to enact meaningful \ncomprehensive reform legislation to make Americans more secure.\n  With today's strong bipartisan vote, the Senate can make a clear \nstatement that we are ready to seize this opportunity to protect \nAmerica and more effectively fight terrorism.\n  I hope our colleagues in the House who have opposed the Commission's \nwork to this point will be able at long last to set aside their \npartisan agenda and follow the bipartisan example of the Senate.\n  The families of the victims of 9/11 and, indeed, all Americans should \nexpect no less from their elected representatives.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to voice my strong support for S. \n2845, the National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004, and to commend my \ncolleagues on the Governmental Affairs Committee for their careful work \nin drafting this important legislation. In producing this bill, \nSenators Collins and Lieberman have managed to combine urgent action \nwith careful deliberation. I hope that this difficult balance can be \nmaintained in conference.\n  While the authors of this bill deserve our thanks, the fact is that \nwe would not be debating desperately needed intelligence reforms today \nhad it not been for the work of the National Commission on Terrorist \nAttacks upon the United States--and for the work of the many concerned \nAmericans, including families of 9/11 victims, who fought to establish \nthe Commission and to protect its independence and authority. The 9/11 \nCommission worked hard to produce a thorough account of the facts \nconcerning what the various elements of the U.S. Government knew, what \naction was taken to address the terrorist threat, and where \ncommunication and coordination broke down. All Americans deserve \nanswers to these questions. And we have a duty to act on the \nCommission's recommendations and to put this country on a firmer, \nsmarter footing to fight the terrorist forces that have attacked this \ncountry and wish to attack us again.\n  At the same time, we know that reorganization for its own sake is \nsimply disruptive and distracting--a smokescreen of busy work and \nchanging flow charts that can obscure serious flaws rather than remedy \nthem. And needlessly trampling on the civil liberties, protected by our \nConstitution and guarded by generations of Americans, in the name of \nreform would be a horrible mistake. Hundreds of thousands of brave men \nand women have died defending our freedoms throughout our history. We \ncannot fail to guard those precious freedoms now.\n  The Senate bill creates a civil liberties board to evaluate new \npolicies and ensure that civil liberties concerns are considered as the \nPresident and executive agencies propose and implement policies to \nprotect the Nation against terrorism. The Commission specifically \nrecommended the creation of such a board within the executive branch \nthat would have as its primary mission the protection of our citizens' \ncivil liberties. I am pleased that Senator Kyl agreed to withdraw an \namendment that would have undermined this provision. The supporters of \nthis amendment suggested that efforts to protect our privacy and civil \nliberties will undermine the work of the intelligence and law \nenforcement community. I respectfully disagree. Americans reasonably \nexpect their Federal Government to protect them from terrorism while \nrespecting their privacy and civil liberties. We can, and must, do \nboth.\n  The Collins-Lieberman bill is the right approach. It is important \nthat the privacy and civil liberties oversight provisions in this bill \nbe included in the final legislation that goes to the President's desk.\n  Similarly, it would be a grave mistake for the conference to add \nextraneous provisions increasing the power of the Government, such as \nthose contained in another amendment offered by Senator Kyl that derive \nfrom the so-called PATRIOT II proposal. We have not had the kind of \nfull and informed debate on these proposals that the 9/11 Commission \ncalled for. For this bill to remain true to the Commission's \nrecommendations, it cannot be used as a way to bypass the very \ndeliberation that the Commission said is essential.\n  Even after we finish work on this bill, our work will be far from \ncomplete. The Commission's intelligence reform proposals have been the \nfocus of most of the media attention surrounding the 9/11 report, and \nthey are at the heart of the legislative efforts in which we are \ncurrently engaged. But the Commission's call for more focused, \neffective ways to attack the terrorists and their organizations, and, \ncritically, to prevent the continued growth of terrorism, deserve \nequally intense examination and action.\n  We need to make a long-term commitment to denying terrorists \nsanctuaries, and to cultivating new generations of partners, not \nenemies, overseas. As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on African \nAffairs, I know that we do not have the intelligence resources or the \ndiplomatic resources that we should around the world. We do not really \nhave any policy at all to deal with Somalia, a failed state in which \nterrorists have operated and found sanctuary. And there is a great deal \nof work to be done to help countries in which we know terrorists have \noperated to improve the basic capacities of border patrols who could \nstop wanted individuals, and customs agents who could help stop weapons \nproliferation and auditors who could freeze terrorist assets. And we \ncan do more to help root out the corruption that undermines these \nsafeguards at every turn.\n  I am pleased that the Senate accepted an amendment that I offered to \nthis bill, which arises from my experience with African affairs. I know \nmany Africanists are concerned about terrorist activity in the Sahel, \nand the U.S. Government is working with partners in that region to \naddress this issue. Some of these same terrorists are based in north \nAfrica, above the Sahel, which various parts of the U.S. Government and \nour own congressional committees consider to be a different region of \nthe world, one usually lumped together with the Middle East rather than \nsub-Saharan Africa. In other words, getting counter-terrorism right in \nMali really requires understanding a number of things about Algeria, \nand getting it right in the Horn of Africa requires an understanding of \nYemen as well as Kenya. But the policymakers who specialize in these \nplaces don't necessarily work together.\n\n  These geographic stovepipes hamper good policy, and cap fragment the \npicture that our intelligence community is able to piece together. And \nit is not just Africa, and it is not just terrorism. Where National \nIntelligence Centers are established with a specific regional focus, \nthe National Intelligence Director needs to ensure that regular contact \nand cooperation among linked centers is institutionalized, not ad hoc. \nMy amendment strengthens information sharing, and signals Congress's \nintent to ensure that the centers that are eventually established are \nas effective as possible.\n  There is also much more to getting our policies right when it comes \nto homeland security and emergency preparedness, and that work will \ncontinue long after we complete work on this bill. We still lack a \ncomprehensive homeland security plan with clear priorities, deadlines, \nand accountability.\n\n[[Page S10531]]\n\nWithout such plans, it is not possible to properly target our homeland \nsecurity dollars to meet our most pressing needs. We are getting on the \nright track, however. The Commission recommended that future \ntransportation security budgets be based on a thorough assessment of \nthreats and vulnerabilities, and I am pleased that the Senate adopted \nmy amendment to the fiscal year 2005 Department of Homeland Security \nbill to require just that. Senator McCain also included a provision to \nrequire a national transportation security strategy, and I was pleased \nto support it. These steps will help, but there is more we must do.\n  I was also pleased to support the amendment offered by Senator \nCollins to coordinate and simplify the homeland security grant process, \nwhich is based on a bill I cosponsored. This important amendment will \nmake it much easier for local first responders to get funding by \nreducing the many, and often redundant, grant application steps. The \namendment also gives local officials far more flexibility in spending \nhomeland security dollars, including paying for overtime costs \nassociated with homeland security tasks and training. Successful \nprograms, such as FIRE Act grants, the COPS program, and the Emergency \nManagement Performance Grant program, are protected in this \nlegislation. The amendment allocates funding based on threat, as \nrecommended by the Commission, but also maintains baseline funding so \nthat States and local officials can have a predictable stream of \nfunding to meet the homeland security needs faced by all jurisdictions. \nThis amendment will help simplify and rationalize the current homeland \nsecurity grant system. However, I agree with Senator Lieberman that \nmore resources must be allocated to meet our homeland security needs.\n  I hope that the conference is able to quickly agree upon a final \nversion of this bill that follows the Senate's approach and does not \ncontain extraneous and controversial provisions. And I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nensure that what we have learned from the 9/11 Commission becomes a \npart of how we do business every day. This intelligence reform bill is \na very good start, not the end, of the efforts we must make to bring \nabout real changes that will enhance our security and the security of \nour children.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, first, let me again thank my colleagues \nfrom Maine and Connecticut for their hard work preparing and bringing \nan intelligence reform bill to the Senate floor. Reforming the \nintelligence community is serious business, and I appreciate the \nprofessional and thoughtful approach taken by the Government Affairs \nCommittee, especially the chairman and ranking member.\n  I rise today to express some of my concerns on S. 2845, the National \nIntelligence Reform Act of 2004.\n  First, it is important to fully understand exactly why we are \ndebating the reformation of our intelligence community in the first \nplace. Our enemy has attacked us in new ways that no one ever thought \nabout or occurred before in the entire history of mankind. The attacks \non 9/11 were made on predominately civilian targets, using commercial \ncivilian airlines, loaded with totally innocent, ordinary citizens. No \none really planned for an attack of this nature because as a God-\nfearing nation, it was hard to imagine that some human beings could be \nso evil, so warped in their interpretation of their own religion that \nthey believe the slaughter of innocent people by the thousands is \nsomehow condoned or even approved by their God. Well, we now know the \nnature of our enemy, and it is dangerous beyond anything we have known \nin the past. And we are reminded of our enemy's evil nature every time \nwe see a video of an innocent person pleading for their life or being \nbeheaded in Iraq. These Islamic terrorists have in effect ``hijacked'' \nthe Muslim faith, distorted it to meet their own twisted philosophy of \nlife, and we must stop them.\n  Let me be absolutely clear on this point: the Islamic terrorists want \nto frighten us, they want to disrupt our economy and our way of life, \nand they want to kill us; they will stop at nothing, including suicide \nattacks to achieve their evil goals. I have said in this chamber many \ntimes that effective intelligence is our first line of defense against \nthis enemy and only good intelligence will prevent them from ever again \nattacking us on our own homeland.\n  That is why we are here today to put more ``teeth'' into our \nintelligence community. We are here to debate and vote on legislation \nthat should provide more security for our citizens.\n  The Collins-Lieberman legislation that we are considering is a good \nbill in many ways, but it only marks the beginning of a process to \nrebuild our intelligence capabilities, not the end.\n  The bill establishes a National Intelligence Director; a position \nthat I view as the ``foundation'' upon which all other intelligence \nreform measures will be built. However, there are some other measures \nrelative to intelligence reform that will require our attention as soon \nas possible.\n  This bill leaves the intelligence community at fifteen members, eight \nof which are in the Department of Defense. As you know, I had a \nbipartisan amendment that was co-sponsored by my colleague from \nNebraska, Senator Ben Nelson, that would create a unified command for \nmilitary intelligence giving the new National Intelligence Director a \nsingle point of contact for military-related intelligence requirements \nand collection capabilities instead of eight. This is a major issue \nthat must be addressed soon; otherwise the National Intelligence \nDirector will have an unrealistically large span of control.\n\n  Collectively, the eight members of the intelligence community that \nthis bill leaves in the Department of Defense are huge, with tens of \nthousands of people and multi-billion dollar budgets. How someone \noutside of the Department of Defense, like the national intelligence \ndirector, could adequately and efficiently manage these vast \nintelligence capabilities by dealing with eight separate military \nmembers is beyond me. Senator Nelson and I are committed to fix this \nshortcoming by introducing a bill to create a unified combatant command \nfor military intelligence this coming January.\n  The Central Intelligence Agency is left intact in this bill, which is \nthe right decision. But the bill does not adequately address the \nimportance of human intelligence, HUMINT, or emphasize rebuilding this \ncritical capability. HUMINT is a dirty and dangerous occupation, and \nit, more than any other intelligence discipline, will be the key to \neliminating al-Qaida and all other terrorist organizations. We really \nowe our HUMINT case officers in the Central Intelligence Agency, the \nDefense Intelligence Agency, and other agencies all our thanks, \nsupport, and the resources necessary to get the job done.\n  The portion of this bill that creates a civil liberties board with \nbroad subpoena power is particularly troubling to me. We need to take \nmore risks in HUMINT and we need to rebuild the morale of our HUMINT \ncollectors. What kind of message are we sending to our intelligence \nagents in the field who are risking their lives to protect us by \ncreating a board designed to look over their shoulders and, which is \nredundant to the President's Board on Safeguarding Americans' Civil \nLiberties? We could create a morale problem throughout our intelligence \ncommunity that might take years to repair and, I hasten to add, at a \ntime when we need HUMINT more than ever to protect our citizens.\n  I am voting for S. 2845, the National Intelligence Reform Act of \n2004, because it does establish the national intelligence director and \ngives statutory authority for the newly created National \nCounterterrorism Center. However, I will continually seek ways to \naddress my concerns with this bill, some of which I have mentioned \nabove. I want to reiterate again, that this bill marks only the \nbeginning of the process to reform our intelligence community, not the \nend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the recommendations of \nthe\n9/11 Commission Report that deal with the integrity of our borders and \nvisitor access to America.\n  In the decade before 9/11, al-Qaida studied how to exploit gaps and \nweaknesses in the passport, visa, and entry systems of the United \nStates and other countries. Al-Qaida actually set up its own passport \noffice in Kandahar and developed working relationships with\n\n[[Page S10532]]\n\ntravel facilitators--travel agents, document forgers, and corrupt \ngovernment officials.\n  Since 9/11, some important steps have been taken to strengthen our \nhomeland security. While these efforts have made us safer, we are not \nsafe enough. A real world example was reported this past Saturday by \nthe Washington Post. Peru and the U.S. intercepted a criminal network \nwith possible al-Qaida links that smuggled Arabs into America after \nreceiving false papers in Lima. Keeping Americans secure means being \ndiligent on all fronts, at home and abroad.\n  The amendment that I am offering ties directly to two important \nrecommendations of the Commission Report prohibiting terrorist travel \nto our country.\n  The first is the Commission recommendation that ``Targeting travel is \nat least as powerful a weapon against terrorists as targeting their \nmoney. . . Better technology and training to detect terrorist travel \ndocuments are the most important immediate steps to reduce America's \nvulnerability to clandestine entry.''\n  Americans need to know that every reasonable step is being taken to \nensure that those who would harm our country and our citizens do not \ntravel freely and easily into the United States. This is a task that \ndeserves our full attention when the vast number of travel documents \nhandled in our embassies, consulates, and border stations is \nconsidered. Specialists must be developed and deployed in consulates \nand at the border to detect terrorists through their travel practices, \nincluding their documents.\n  Last year there were about seven hundred consular officers stationed \noverseas in 211 posts. In addition to processing six million non-\nimmigrant visa applications and nearly 600,000 immigrant visa \napplications, they provided a full range of services to American \ncitizens. Chronic understaffing has led to an over-reliance on foreign \nworkers to screen and review visa applications, jobs that normally \nwould be handled by American officers. This process leaves too many \ngray areas; one mistake or intentional oversight in a foreign nationals \nreview of an application could mean the lives of thousands of \ninnocents. My amendment goes a long way to bolster the visa application \nprocess by mandating that American consular officials review and \napprove each and every immigrant and nonimmigrant visa application.\n  Over the last 2 years the State Department has hired an average of 65 \nnew consular officials. That number has not proven enough. My amendment \nprovides the State Department the authority to increase the number of \nconsular officials by 150 each year for 4 years, ensuring that trusted \nAmerican resources are responsible for reviewing all visa applications.\n  Currently, consular officers only receive an overview in fraudulent \ndocument training. My amendment mandates that these consular officers \nare suitably trained in detecting fraudulent documents and document \nforensics, prior to beginning their service.\n  Our due diligence cannot stop here.\n  The second Commission recommendation that relates to my amendment \nstates that we should ``. . . raise U.S. and border security standards \nfor travel and border crossing over the medium and long term . . .'' \nThe Commission goes on to say that ``It is elemental to border security \nto know who is coming into the country. Today more than 9 million \npeople are in the United States outside the legal immigration system.''\n  Pre-9/11 the INS had only about 2,000 agents for interior enforcement \nand only 9,800 border patrol agents. With the priorities of the agency \nconcentrated on immigration and narcotics, our northern border was \noften neglected and no major counterterrorism effort was underway. \nThese gaps in our security created a weakness that allowed the loss of \nover 3,000 innocent citizens. More robust enforcement of routine \nimmigration laws could have made a difference.\n  We must have the resources to be able to detect and, if need be, \ndetain terrorists who seek entry through our borders. My amendment \nmakes providing the necessary personnel for border security and \nimmigration enforcement a top priority. It provides authority to \nincrease the number of border patrol agents by 1,000 each year for a 5-\nyear period. It also increases the number Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement investigators by 800 per year for a period of 5 years.\n  The Commission found that many of the 19 9/11 hijackers, including \nknown operatives, could have been watchlisted and were vulnerable to \ndetection by border authorities; however, without adequate staff and \ncoordinated efforts, the evildoers were allowed unhampered entry.\n  The world has changed dramatically since 9/11 when the evil doers \nused our open and trusting society against us. We can not allow a \nrepeat of that tragedy. This amendment will allow those who guard our \nfrontiers the tools they need to ensure the safety of the citizens of \nthe United States of America.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr President, I rise to address a very specific but \ninvaluable component of the intelligence reform package before us \ntoday.\n  As many may know, before the release of the 9/11 Commission report \nearlier this year, I introduced stand-alone legislation--cosponsored by \nSenator Mikulski--creating an Inspector General for Intelligence. The \n``Intelligence Community Accountability Act of 2004'' proposed an \nindependent inspector general for the entire intelligence community--\nall fifteen agencies and department members. I introduced this \nlegislation largely as a result of my experience as a member of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee which undertook a year-long investigation \non the pre-war intelligence of Iraq.\n  I commend the efforts and tremendous work of the authors of the \nunderlying bill--they have embraced the concept and spirit of my \nearlier bill and have included language in their legislation creating \nan Inspector General for the National Intelligence Director. I would \nalso like to thank Senators Roberts, Mikulski and Feinstein for their \nsupport in being original cosponsors of an amendment I was prepared to \noffer on this subject. I will not offer that amendment but I want to \nmake clear my intentions to continue working for better and more \ncomprehensive accountability in our intelligence community.\n  In that vein, I want to express my strong opposition to any amendment \nor proposal that would weaken the language on the authorities and \npowers of the NID's inspector general. Any such amendment, if accepted \nor approved, would be a grave step backward in an area that is in \ncritical need of a step forward. . . . I am of course talking about \naccountability in the intelligence community.\n  Any amendment to scale back the IG provisions of the bill would fly \nin the face of the 521-page report that followed the committee's \ninvestigation on Iraq pre-war intelligence and would ignore vital \nproblems of information sharing that have been found throughout the \ncommunity.\n  Any inspector general who is to serve the National Intelligence \nDirector must have the power and authority to access employees and \ninformation in the agencies that lie in the national intelligence \nprogram. How can an IG be effective if his hands are tied because of \nturf battles and arguments over jurisdiction?\n  My preference would be to enhance some of the authorities of the \nNID's inspector general as proposed by the underlying bill, but I would \nrather work to preserve the bill's language as it exists now than to \ngut it through the passage of any proposal that rescinds the abilities \nof the IG to delve into the coordination and communication between and \namong the various entities of the intelligence community.\n  Issues of accountability have often been central to the work we as \nSenators do in seeking to bring better government to our constituents--\nparticularly when matters of national security are at stake.\n  I saw firsthand the consequences of serious inadequacies in \naccountability during my 12 years as a member of the House Foreign \nAffairs International Operations Subcommittee and as Chair of the \nInternational Operations Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. During the 99th Congress, I worked to bring the State \nDepartment Accountability Review Board into fruition as part of the \nOmnibus Diplomatic Security and Anti-Terrorism Act of 1986.\n\n[[Page S10533]]\n\n  Among other issues, it was a lack of accountability that permitted \nthe radical Egyptian Sheik Rahman, the mastermind of the first World \nTrade Center bombing in 1993, to enter and exit the U.S. five times \ntotally unimpeded even after he was put on the State Department's \nLookout List in 1987, and allowed him to get permanent residence status \nby the INS even after the State Department issued a certification of \nvisa revocation. In 1995 and again after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, \nI introduced legislation establishing Terrorist Lookout Committees in \nour embassies and consulates abroad--all in an effort to create more \naccountability in the protection of our homeland.\n  In this same vein, my membership on the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence has allowed me to realize that the need for greater levels \nof accountability in our intelligence community is and must be a \npriority. It is all too evident that in addressing the key concerns and \nproblems seen in the management of our intelligence agencies, \naccountability is an area unquestionably in need of dramatic \nimprovement.\n  I am pleased that as intelligence community reform has gained \nmomentum, the concept of an inspector general has been very much a part \nof the debate. Indeed, an inspector general is included in the broad \nand comprehensive intelligence reform legislation authored by Senator \nFeinstein--legislation that I was proud to co-sponsor earlier this \nyear.\n  An inspector general for the whole intelligence community was also \nincluded in reform legislation offered by Senator Graham, the former \nchairman of the Senate intelligence community. Language creating a \ncommunity-wide inspector general was contained in the proposal \nby current Intelligence Committee Chairman Roberts as well as the \nrecent bill offered by Senators McCain and Lieberman.\n\n  And as I indicated, an inspector general is included in the \nunderlying bill crafted by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. I \ncommend and, once again, thank all of my colleagues for including this \nkey component in their proposals. This bill takes a step forward in \naddressing the key issue of intelligence community accountability and \nit should not be weakened by any additional amendments or \nmodifications.\n  The belief that any new Director of National Intelligence should have \nan independent inspector general is one that few seriously dispute. In \ntestimony before the intelligence committee in July, former Deputy \nSecretary of Defense John Hamre stated that an inspector general ``will \nhelp far more in driving and shaping the quality of outputs from this \ncommunity.'' And Secretary of State Colin Powell called an inspector \ngeneral a ``good idea'' while speaking before the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee.\n  When I first drafted and then introduced my stand-alone legislation \nin early June, I had certainly envisioned that the inspector general \nthe bill would establish would reside within a newly re-organized \nintelligence community. When I introduced my bill, I stated then that \nit was intended to be part of a larger initiative to overhaul the \nentire intelligence community's organizational structure. We have \nreached that point, and I am here today to continue my efforts to \nensure that the final product the Senate approves contains the best \npossible mechanisms to bring accountability to the community.\n  As I indicated earlier, I have participated in this national debate \non bettering our diplomatic, intelligence and national security \nservices on many fronts and for many years. But it was as a member of \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee, which spent a year reviewing the \npre-war intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs, \nthe regime's ties to terrorism, Saddam Hussein's human rights abuses \nand his regime's impact on regional stability that I realized the real \nand dire need for intelligence community change.\n  In looking at the intelligence community, we must remember that it is \nan amorphous entity made of up fifteen agencies, parts of departments, \nand independent bodies all spread out within our Federal Government. \nThey each have their own mission, chain of command, procedures, history \nand institutional paradigms. The necessity for a stronger, independent \nhead of the intelligence community became obvious to me and that \nmeasures must be legislated and instituted to hold the community and \nits amalgamation of agencies more accountable for the failures and \nshortcomings we had discovered.\n  The committee's report on the pre-war intelligence on Iraq revealed \nsystemic flaws in the intelligence community, perhaps, most notably in \nmany instances, a stunning lack of accountability and sound, ``hands-\non'' management practices. These poor management practices contributed \nto the mis-characterization of intelligence reporting on Iraq's WMD \nprograms.\n  I recognize that intelligence analysis is an imprecise art, with \nrarely--if ever--any absolutes; however, our report revealed that many \njudgements regarding Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs and \ncapabilities were based on old assumptions allowed to be carried over \nyear after year, virtually unchecked and unchallenged, without any \ncritical re-examination of the issue.\n  In short, there was a lack of analytic rigor performed on one of the \nmost critical and defining issues spanning more than a decade--that of \nthe preponderance of weapons of mass destruction within Iraq and the \nlooming threat they posed to Iraq's neighbors and to the U.S.\n  Intelligence community managers, collectors and analysts believed \nthat Iraq had WMDs, a notion that dates back to Iraq's pre-1991 efforts \nto retain, build and hide those programs. In many cases, the \ncommittee's report showed that the intelligence community made \nintelligence information fit into its preconceived notions about Iraq's \nWMD programs.\n  From our review, we know the intelligence community relied on sources \nthat supported its predetermined ideas, and we also know that there was \nno alternative analysis or ``red teaming'' performed on such a critical \nissue, allowing assessments to go unchallenged. This loss of \nobjectivity or unbiased approach to intelligence collection and \nanalysis led to erroneous assumptions about Iraq's WMD program.\n  For example, the committee's review showed that analysts minimized \nreporting from a biological weapons source because the source reported \ninformation that did not fit with their beliefs about the existence of \nmobile biological weapons facilities.\n  We also know that the key judgment in the National Intelligence \nEstimate that Iraq was developing an unmanned aerial vehicle ``probably \nintended to deliver biological warfare agents'' overstated what was in \nthe intelligence reporting. This review revealed that some intelligence \ncommunity UAV analysts failed to objectively assess significant \nevidence that clearly indicated that non-biological weapons delivery \nmissions were more likely.\n  In addition, the committee's report revealed that, despite \noverwhelming evidence suggesting that the aluminum tubes Iraq was \ntrying to procure were for artillery rockets, some intelligence \ncommunity analysts rejected information and analysis from experts, \nincluding the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Department of \nEnergy, who refuted the claim that the tubes were being procured for \nuse in Iraq's nuclear weapons program. This information was rejected \nbecause it did not fit into some analysts' notion that Iraq was \nprocuring these tubes as part of its nuclear reconstitution effort.\n\n  Clearly stated, the intelligence community failed to ``think outside \nthe box,'' a phrase often used by the community's analytic cadre to \ndescribe more innovative approaches to examining a problem set.\n  Critical thinking and objectivity are crucial elements in both the \ncollection and analytic trade crafts and ought to be ingrained, by \nappropriate training and effective oversight by management, in every \ncollector and analyst entering the ranks of the intelligence community. \nManagement has the responsibility to ensure analysts are trained to \nproduce--and actually produce--the best, most objective, unvarnished \nassessments, and both management and the analysts and collectors have \nthe responsibility to ensure that their trade-craft is practiced \nproperly.\n  Along this same line of accountability, our report revealed how poor \nleadership and management resulted in the intelligence community's \nfailure to convey the uncertainties in many of\n\n[[Page S10534]]\n\nthe assessments in the National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq's \nContinuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction.\n  For example, the intelligence community assessed that Iraq had mobile \ntransportable facilities for producing biological warfare agents but \nfailed to alert intelligence consumers that this assessment was based \nprimarily on reporting from a single human intelligence source to whom \nthe intelligence community never had direct access and with whom there \nwere credibility problems.\n  In the analysis on Iraq's chemical weapons activities, the \nintelligence community failed to explain that several assessments were \nbased on layers of analysis of a single stream of intelligence \nreporting regarding the presence of a tanker truck that was assessed to \nbe involved in the possible transshipment of chemical munitions.\n  Finally, during coordination sessions with Secretary Powell in \npreparation for his speech before the United Nations in February 2003, \nthe intelligence community was instructed to include in the \npresentation only corroborated, solid intelligence.\n  In fact, from our review we learned that the DCI told a national \nintelligence officer who was also working on the speech to ``back up \nthe material and make sure we had good stuff to support everything.'' \nWhen Secretary Powell spoke before the UN, he said that every statement \nhe was about to make would be ``backed up by sources, solid sources . . \n. based on solid intelligence.''\n  Incredibly, from our review, we know that much of the intelligence \nprovided or cleared by the CIA for inclusion in Secretary Powell's \nspeech was incorrect and uncorroborated. For example, the IC never \nalerted Secretary Powell that most of the intelligence regarding Iraq's \nmobile biological warfare program came from one source with \nquestionable credibility nor did anyone alert Secretary Powell to the \nfact one of the sources cited in his speech was deemed to be a \nfabricator--something known by IC analysts since the May 2002 issuance \nof a ``fabrication notice.''\n  An independent, over-arching community-level inspector general who \ncan delve into the communication between and among agencies, or the \nlack thereof, can assist in bridging the disconnects that lead to such \nfailures. This IG should be properly empowered to reach into and across \nthe bureaucratic and organization lines that separate each community \nagency so that next time, if the Department of Energy's assessments \nabout the intended use of aluminum tubes by a dangerous regime are \nignored or cast aside, someone can be held accountable.\n  There is no question that the intelligence community requires \nsystemic changes. We are here today to do just that. Americans have a \nright to know that their intelligence services are doing the best job \npossible in protecting their security. I say this even while I must \nrecognize the dedication and professionalism of the thousands of \nAmericans who make up our intelligence community.\n  Each day across this country and around the world, they labor, mostly \nwithout recognition, to keep this country safe from harm. Our \nintelligence employees work under very demanding conditions and in \nenvironments that are extremely dangerous and can often shift without \nnotice.\n  It is their vigilance upon which we rely to give us the forewarning \nnecessary to counter the many dangers present in our world. Although it \nis impossible to directly express our deep appreciation for their \nefforts, we have an obligation to express our eternal gratitude to \nthose who serve America so well.\n  Yet, however appreciative we are of the service done by those who \nwork in the fifteen agencies that make up our nation's intelligence \ncommunity, we as a Congress have a responsibility to continue to work \nto find ways to help them do an even better job, and more importantly, \nto ensure that any failures are not repeated and that we learn from \npast mistakes. At the same time, we have an obligation to the people of \nthis country to ensure that both pride and comfort in our intelligence \nservices exist. The people of this Nation, and those of us elected to \nrepresent them, have a right to know that when mistakes are made, \ncorrections soon follow. That is what brings us here today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a chart entitled ``Decades of \nTerrorism'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Decades of Terrorism\n\n       Oct. 23, 1983--Beirut Barracks bombing; Dec. 12, 1983--US \n     Embassy bombing, Kuwait; Sept. 20, 1984--East Beirut bombing; \n     Dec. 3, 1984--Kuwait Airways hijacking; April 12, 1985--\n     Madrid restaurant bombing.\n       June 14, 1985--TWA flight 847 hijacking; Oct. 7, 1985--\n     Achille Lauro attack; Dec. 18, 1985--Rome and Vienna \n     bombings; April 2, 1986--TWA flight 840 bombing; April 5, \n     1986--Germany disco bombing.\n       Dec. 21, 1988--Pan-Am Flight 103 bombing; Feb. 26, 1993--\n     World Trade Center bombing; Nov. 13, 1995--US Military HQ \n     attack, Saudi Arabia; June 5, 1996--Khobar Towers bombing; \n     Aug. 7, 1998--US Embassy bombings in Africa.\n       Oct. 12, 2000--USS Cole attack; Sept. 11, 2001--9/11; May \n     12, 2003--Housing compound bombing in Saudi Arabia; May 29-\n     31, 2004--Saudi oil company attacks; June 11-19, 2004--Paul \n     Johnson kidnaping/execution.\n\n\n                         9/11 Commission Report\n\n       ``The massive departments and agencies that prevailed in \n     the great struggles of the twentieth century must work \n     together in new ways, so that all the instruments of national \n     power can be combined.''\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. This chart beside me illustrates in the starkest of terms, \nwhat we are dealing with. . . ..and what this legislation is all about. \nI call the contents of this chart to the attention of my colleagues to \nserve as a reminder of ``the big picture.'' The goal of this reform \nmovement is and has always been to make sure our intelligence agencies \nare better equipped, organized and managed so that we are in a greater \nposition to detect threats and stop attacks. We want an intelligence \ncommunity that is better prepared to ensure we don't keep adding to \nthis list.\n  I also refer my colleagues to a quote from the preface of the 9/11 \nCommission Report: ``The massive departments and agencies that \nprevailed in the greatest struggles of the twentieth century mush work \ntogether in new ways, so that all the instruments of national power can \nbe combined.'' This bill we are debating today speaks directly to this \ncharge. And it is my view that a strong Inspector general is a vital \ncomponent of that effort.\n  An inspector general will help to enhance the authorities of the \nNational Intelligence Director that we will shortly create, assisting \nthis person in instituting better management accountability, and \nhelping him/her to resolve problems within the intelligence community \nsystematically.\n  Ideally, the inspector general for intelligence should have the \nability to investigate current issues within the intelligence \ncommunity, not just conduct ``lessons learned'' studies. The IG should \nhave the abilities to seek to identify problem areas and identify the \nmost efficient and effective business practices required to ensure that \ncritical deficiencies can be addressed before it is too late, before we \nhave another intelligence failure, before lives are lost.\n  In short, an inspector general for intelligence that can look across \nthe entire intelligence community will help improve management, \ncoordination, cooperation and information sharing among the \nintelligence agencies. A strong, effective IG will help break down the \nbarriers that have perpetuated the parochial, stove-pipe approaches to \nintelligence community management and operations.\n  As I stated earlier, I was prepared to offer an amendment that would \nhave expanded on the language already included in the underlying bill--\nbut let me be clear, there are many positive aspects of the inspector \ngeneral as contained in this bill.\n  I am pleased, for example, that the bill ensures independence of the \nIG by including a separate budget account for his office. I also \nwelcome the language pertaining to staffing, reports, subpoena powers \nand complaint procedures.\n  I have no doubt that the authors of the underlying bill and I share \nthe same goal--an independent IG with proper authorities to assist in \npreventing some of the failures I've detailed here today.\n  As the Chairman of the intelligence committee stated last week on the \nSenate floor, members of the committee received a frightening briefing\n\n[[Page S10535]]\n\nlast week in closed session where we were told that despite the current \nterrorist threat we face, and the high state of alert we live under, \ninformation sharing between the intelligence agencies is still not \ntaking place and no one is holding anyone accountable for their failure \nto do so.\n  Too many incidents of failure to prevent attacks, failure to properly \ncollect the needed intelligence, failure to adequately analyze that \nintelligence and failure to share information within the community beg \nfor better accountability in the entirety of the community. Who better \nto do this than a single IG, who can reach across the community, work \nwith the existing individual agency IG's, and confront any problem with \na macro, overarching view? It is my hope that the new inspector general \nfor the NID, as authorized in this bill, will take great strides to \nguarantee that information sharing and accountability are woven into \nthe fabric of the intelligence community. Mr. President, this is the \nwhole reason we are here today.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thought I would take this moment of \nquiet on the floor--we are just about a half hour away from voting \nfinal passage of this bill--to thank my staff and the staff of Senator \nCollins, which is led by Michael Bopp. My staff is led by Joyce \nRechtschaffen and Kevin Landy, who has been a team leader on this \neffort. It has been a mighty team. They worked very hard to help \nSenator Collins and me put the hearings together on the 9/11 Commission \nReport; to work, many of them, over August in addition to working on \nthe hearings, to draft the legislation I introduced with Senator McCain \nto adopt the nonintelligence parts of the Commission report, and then \nto work in the week and a half--this being the eighth day of \nconsideration on the floor--to see this bill at the point it is now.\n  I am very proud that the committee, in the first instance, and now \nthe Senate itself, has responded to the challenge of the 9/11 \nCommission Report. But, more to the point, it has responded to the \ndeficiencies in our current systems of intelligence and homeland \nsecurity generally and brought forth a bill that I am convinced, if we \ncan hold it through conference, which we certainly intend to do, will \nmake the American people a lot safer in an age of terrorism.\n  I want to list the names of all the members of my staff who have \nworked so hard to bring this legislation to the edge of adoption: Mike \nAlexander, David Barten, Rajesh De, Chistine Healey, Larry Novey, Holly \nIdelson, Beth Grossman, Mary Beth Shultz, Andrew Weinschenk, Fred \nDowney, Kathy Sedden, Donny Williams, Jason Yanussi, Dave Berick, Adam \nSedgewick, Megan Finlayson, Rachel Sotsky, Tim Profeta, William \nBonvillian, Laurie Rubenstein, Leslie Phillips, Chuck Ludlam, and Janet \nBurrell.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the distinguished comanager of the \nbill is on the floor--I am sorry Senator Collins is not on the floor--\non behalf of the whole Senate, we need to extend to you our \ncongratulations. We all applaud and commend the great work done. This \nhas been a very difficult job. While those of us who were home in \nAugust, doing the things we do--having townhall meetings and doing \ncampaign events--you and Susan were here doing work to get us in a \nposition so when we came back here there would be an instrument that \nyou could recommend to the other members of your committee who worked \nwith you during this downtime in August--most of it down. This vehicle \nis now about to be completed. It is a sea change. It is the first part \nof what the 9/11 Commission recommended, and it is good work. The \nSenator from Connecticut and Senator Collins should feel very good \nabout their accomplishment. I think it is not only a significant \nimprovement from what we had, it is a sea change in what we had before. \nThe American people are going to be safer as a result of this. Congress \nis going to be more responsible as a result.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Nevada for his \nkind words. I thank him for his characteristic presence and support on \nthe floor.\n  This has been an extraordinary chapter in my own legislative career \nhere and one that I am very grateful to have had. It has been a real \nhonor to work with Senator Collins. I think from the beginning she and \nI went into this process having had a good relationship working on the \ncommittee as Chair and ranking member. This was a moment where we \nshould be working together without any regard to party liabilities or \nparty caucuses; this was an urgent matter of national security.\n  America was attacked on 9/11, 2001. The 9/11 Commission report was an \nindictment of various parts of our intelligence and security systems--\nborder security, for instance--and an appeal for urgent action to close \nthose gaps, to strengthen where we are vulnerable; again, an enemy to \ncause us harm and death, the likes of which we have never faced before; \nas someone else wrote, ``an enemy who hates us more than they love \ntheir own lives.''\n  Senator Collins and I from the beginning went forward on not only a \nbipartisan basis but on a nonpartisan basis--which turned out to be the \ncase in our committee as well--and with the strong support of the \nbipartisan leadership of Senator Frist and Senator Daschle. That has \nbeen the case on the floor of the Senate.\n  I am proud to say that I believe the proposal came from the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee as a strong proposal. I feel that within \na half hour of moving to final passage it has grown stronger as a \nresult of action taken by the full Senate on the floor.\n  There is work yet to be done. Obviously, passing the Senate doesn't \nmake it law; we have to go to conference and present something to the \nPresident which he can sign. But I think everyone here has caught the \nmoment of urgency and responded to it in the national interest. This is \na great way for us to end this session. I am speaking now apart from \nthe national security implications--just what service in the Senate is \nall about and what message we send to the American people.\n  The message here is not just in the content of this law proposal but \nin the way we have done it, which is we are capable still in an \nincreasingly political or partisan time, particularly prior to a \nnational election, to put all that aside and do what is best for the \nAmerican people.\n  I note the presence on the floor of my friend and colleague from \nArizona. He and I have worked very hard together.\n  We thank our colleagues on both sides. In addition to the core parts \nof the Governmental Affairs Committee bill which adopted the critical \nintelligence recommendations of the 9/11 Commission establishing a \nnational intelligence director, a national counterterrorism center, \nSenator McCain and I offered amendments which accomplish and respond to \nall of the other major recommendations of the 9/11 Commission with \nregard to border security, for instance, and foreign policy; outreach \nto the Muslim world so that this bill, as we are ready to vote on it, \nreally meets the challenges of the 9/11 Commission and responds to the \npleas of the families who lost loved ones on 9/11 to do whatever we \nhumanly could to make sure nothing like 9/11 ever happens again in the \nUnited States of America. I believe the product we are about to vote on \ndoes exactly that.\n  I thank the Chair and note the presence of other colleagues on the \nfloor. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise at this time as we head toward a \nvote on final passage to voice my strong support for this legislation. \nBut equally important, I wish to pay tribute to the work of Senator \nLieberman and Senator Collins in fashioning this legislation in a \nbipartisan way. I am pleased to serve on the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee with both of them.\n  This has been put together in a way that reflects the core \nrecommendations of the September 11 Commission. It takes our \nintelligence-gathering system and creates a strong intelligence \ndirector but gives that director the kind of budget and personnel \nresponsibility that will enable him to be effective as we continue to \nfight a long war on terrorism--a global fight the length of which we \ncan't determine right now but whose priority and importance is \nundisputed. It takes all of the assets of our intelligence-gathering \nnetwork--the assets that serve our national intelligence operation but \nputs them\n\n[[Page S10536]]\n\nunder the national intelligence director--and gives that director the \nauthority and the flexibility that is going to be necessary to be \neffective.\n  It deals with important issues such as border security and \ntransportation today under the responsibility of the Commerce \nCommittee. It creates a counterterrorism center--something that has \nalready been done. But it is important that we authorize the \ncounterterrorism center which is going to be responsible for putting \ntogether all of our efforts in dealing with terrorist threats, \ncollecting and distributing that to law enforcement officials, and \nmaking sure that our objective of identifying threats to this country, \nwhether it is through financing or the movement of personnel and \nmaterials, is done effectively.\n  While this legislation responds to the September 11 Commission \nrecommendations, I think it is also important to recognize that the \nSeptember 11 Commission report dealt with the weaknesses that led to \nthe attacks in New York City and Washington and the downing of the \nplane in Pennsylvania. In order for this legislation to be effective, \nwe need to continue to make sure all of our intelligence assets are \nfocused on the future. There are going to be new threats and new \nchallenges in what will be an evolving fight. The counterterrorism \ncenter is going to have to evolve over time to deal with new threats \nfrom different parts of the world.\n  We are going to have to improve our techniques for information \nsharing. We are going to have to develop new technologies for \ninformation gathering around the world. We will have to continue to \nimprove our human intelligence system--something that was, \nunfortunately, lacking in the years which led up to September 11. This \nis going to be a continuing process of change.\n  I think it is most important that this legislation creates the \ninfrastructure and a culture and a leadership structure that can \nrespond to these changes which can evolve with the times and that can \ndeal with the unexpected.\n  If there is one thing we can be sure of, it is that the fighting of \nterrorism around the world will include many unexpected, unpredictable \nevents. But if we are to succeed, we want to make sure our \nintelligence-gathering operation has all the tools and the support that \nis necessary.\n  This is a very strong piece of legislation. It was put together in a \nbipartisan way, but it is not strong because it is bipartisan. I think \nit is receiving the bipartisan support because it is a strong, \nthoughtful piece of legislation.\n  We have a lot of work left to do. We are going to go to a conference \nwith the House, and that in and of itself will be a long process to \novercome any differences in the legislation. But I hope in the end and \nI believe in the end this will be a bill that makes our intelligence-\ngathering capability and our ability to fight terrorism around the \nworld stronger and which will meet with the core and the thrust of the \nSeptember 11 Commission report.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, later this afternoon the Senate is \nexpected to adopt an amendment by the majority leader that establishes \na national counterproliferation center. Establishing such a center now \nis premature and prejudges the ongoing work of the WMD Commission on \nwhich I have the honor of serving.\n  I am one who said we have to get this done, and have done everything \nunder my power to be of some small assistance to the managers of the \nbill to complete our work on the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. So \nI find myself in kind of an interesting position saying that we ought \nto slow down on this one, but I am saying it because this issue was not \naddressed by the 9/11 Commission.\n  The President asked the WMD Commission to examine whether the U.S. \nGovernment should establish a national counterproliferation center and \nto offer our recommendation. If I may quote from the President's \nremarks on the day that he announced the establishment of the WMD \nCommission:\n\n       Given the growing threat of weapons and missile \n     proliferation in our world, it may also be necessary to \n     create a similar center in our government to bring together \n     our intelligence analysis planning and operations to track \n     and prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. I \n     asked the committee commission headed by Judge Laurence \n     Silberman and Senator Chuck Robb to determine the merits of \n     creating such a center.\n\n  In other words, the WMD Commission has been chartered to determine \nthe creation of such a center. I have to tell my colleagues, as a \nmember of that Commission, we have not yet reached a point where we \ncould either recommend or not recommend. The Commission and its staff \nhave held a number of discussions on the desirability of establishing a \ncounterproliferation center, and we will soon examine the structure and \nresponsibilities that such a center might entail, if it should be \nestablished at all. In response to the President's specific request, we \nwill issue a formal recommendation in our final report in March.\n  This amendment could seriously undermine the work of the WMD \nCommission. The amendment would establish a national \ncounterproliferation center before the Commission has even had a chance \nto fully study the issue. Rather than waiting for an in-depth review of \nthe pros and cons of moving ahead with such a center--a review that \nwill be fully completed in March--this amendment goes ahead and does it \nanyway. The proponents of this amendment, and I understand that, have \nargued that the center would not be established for a year after \nenactment of the underlying bill and the structures and \nresponsibilities could be changed later. But if we are planning to \ndelay establishing the center for a year and if we are open to changes \nwhich would presumably require changes in law, then why are we passing \nthis amendment? Why interrupt the work of the WMD Commission when we \ncould have the benefit of their assessment in a few months?\n  If the WMD Commission concludes no center is needed, or something \ndifferent is more appropriate, then it would be very hard to find an \nopportunity to take this recommendation into account, short of passing \nlegislation that will rescind this amendment if it is enacted.\n  I don't believe we should interfere with the WMD Commission's work. \nWhat we should do is allow all of the facts to be considered and \ndebated, and then we can take the appropriate actions at that time.\n\n  Let's make no mistake, establishing this center would be a very \nsignificant action by the Congress. It cuts to the heart of the \nsecurity issues that we all agree are critical to our Nation. We need \nto make sure that if we are going to do this, we do it right. We should \nawait the WMD Commission's report, hear a variety of opinions, and \nstructure the center, if it is needed, in a way that makes the most \nsense of the task at hand. We should not take the shortcuts on an issue \nof such importance, but I am afraid we are on the verge of doing just \nthat.\n  We owe it to the American people to fully assess the implications of \nbuilding a national counterproliferation center. This will be far \nreaching. I don't believe any Members have had a chance to examine this \nin any detail. The amendment puts the cart before the horse and I \nstrongly oppose it.\n  I repeat again, the 9/11 Commission did not address the issue of \ncounterproliferation. They addressed a broad variety of issues but \ncounterproliferation was not one of them. And weapons of mass \ndestruction, in the sense of the charter of the WMD Commission, was not \npart of their deliberations.\n  I have strongly supported the 9/11 Commission recommendations. I am \nproud of the work Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman have done in \naddressing every single one of the 9/11 Commission recommendations with \nthe exception of two that have to do with the congressional \nreorganization.\n  Having said that, this amendment is out of the purview of the \nSeptember 11 Commission and, frankly, out of the purview of this \npending legislation.\n  The majority leader has assured me there will be language, certain \ncaveats about how it could be changed, et cetera, and I appreciate \nthat. We have had a significant dialog on the issue. But the difference \nI have with the amendment and the majority leader is basically that we \nhave said we are going to establish this national counterproliferation \ncenter, period.\n\n[[Page S10537]]\n\n  This is not an issue of national emergency. I think it does a \ndisservice to the WMD Commission on which I serve, which would report \nout in March their recommendations and conclusions, and we would be \nacting, then, on far firmer ground.\n  Maybe we can talk about it more after this bill is passed. I know the \nWhite House has severe reservations about this amendment. Maybe we \ncould continue a dialog on it and at least make this amendment \nsignificantly more palatable so that the Weapons of Mass Destruction \nCommission recommendations that come out in March can be fully and \ncompletely considered.\n  I thank the majority leader for his commitment to maintaining a \ndialog on this issue. I may not be able to speak again in the Senate, \nbut I again express my profound and deep appreciation to Senator \nCollins and Senator Lieberman who have displayed adequately for all \nAmericans as well as Members of this body that if there is a cause \ngreat enough and people good enough that we will act in a bipartisan \nfashion for the good of this Nation.\n  I have been in this body for only 18 years, but this is one of my \nprouder moments because of the way this entire body has acted in the \nnational interest.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3895, as Further Modified\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the amendment we will \nbe voting on in a bit. It does center on the establishment of a \ncounterproliferation center.\n  I appreciate the comments of my distinguished colleague from Arizona. \nWe have had the opportunity to talk over the course of today about this \namendment and we have a modification. I have talked to the White House \nand, based on that conversation, made further modifications.\n  The reason we should vote on this amendment and it should be a part \nof this package that we can all be very proud of passing here in 10, \n15, or 20 minutes is that the greatest threat facing our country is not \na terrorist. We all know it is not just the terrorists. The greatest \nthreat is a terrorist armed with some sort of weapon of mass \ndestruction.\n  In debate the other night before 60 million people, President Bush \nand Senator Kerry cited the nexus between proliferation and terrorism \nbeing their single greatest concern and the most significant challenge \nour country faces. This whole concept of counterproliferation--talk \nabout a counterproliferation center is not a new idea, but it is a new \ncomponent of U.S. policy and has been looking at the safety and \nsecurity of the American people and an overhaul of our intelligence \ngathering and intelligence system. The counterproliferation is an \nimportant component to be addressed.\n  Counterproliferation is a broad topic and it includes everything the \nUnited States and its allies do to halt, to deter, to stop, to roll \nback the trafficking of weapons of mass destruction, their delivery \nsystems and related materials.\n\n  It means interdicting these dangerous materials before they get into \nthe hands of the world's most dangerous terrorists. It means stopping \nthese items before terrorist groups can assemble them into weapons and \ndeliver them to our homeland.\n  Again, we are talking about counterproliferation, not just \ncounterterrorism. But counterproliferation also means unraveling those \nproliferation networks that supply, sustain, finance, and enable \nproliferation suppliers and customers. They are the linkages and supply \nchains between countries that proliferate, firms that proliferate, \nmiddlemen, and their customers around the globe.\n  The most famous network unraveled by the U.S. and its partners was \nthe AQ Khan network. It was this network that supplied Libya, Iran, and \npossibly others, with nuclear equipment, materials, and know-how. \nCounterproliferation works, but it takes close cooperation, it takes \nclose coordination, and it takes teamwork within the United States, and \nwith our friends and allies around the world.\n  The most famous interdiction of recent times was the stopping of the \nBBC China, a ship that was delivering nuclear parts and components to \nLibya before being interdicted at a friendly port by some of our \nEuropean allies. This interdiction had a major effect on prompting \nColonel Qadhafi to come clean and to give up his programs.\n  With more and more countries possibly pursuing weapons of mass \ndestruction programs, and with those same proliferators skirting \ninternational laws, treaties, and export control regimes, \ncounterproliferation can help fill the gap and slow or stop this \ndangerous trade.\n  The President's Proliferation Security Initiative was a positive step \nin this direction, but there is more that we can do and we should do. \nThis amendment directs what we can and should do.\n  The President's Proliferation Security Initiative is supported by \nover 60 countries, and nearly two dozen are active participants. As we \nexpand globally, however, we, at the same time, need to develop \ninternally. Indeed, the 9/11 Commission called for strengthening the \nProliferation Security Initiative in its report and its \nrecommendations.\n  Establishing a National Counterterrorism Center is necessary. We are \ndoing that. But the National Counterterrorism Center will be focusing \non terrorists and terrorist groups. The Nation needs a similar center \nthat, working closely with the National counterterrorism Center, will \nfocus, clarify, and coordinate our country's counterproliferation \nefforts.\n  In other words, as the counterterrorism center focuses on the \ncustomers, the end users of these dangerous weapons--the terrorists--\nthe national counterproliferation center will be focusing on the \nsuppliers and brokers and distributors of these weapons. This separate \ncenter will endeavor to stop these activities before they ever reach \nthe terrorists, before they ever reach the bad guys.\n  That is what my amendment does. Establishing a national \ncounterproliferation center not only promotes this critical function \ncalled counterproliferation that is so necessary to defend our country, \nit also breaks down the stovepipes that currently exist within the \nexecutive branch.\n  This amendment tracks very closely to the structure, authorities, and \nroles established for the National Counterterrorism Center. Further, we \nhave made changes to this amendment as amendments to the National \nCounterterrorism Center have been offered on the floor.\n\n  This amendment has also been modified to make clear that \ncounterproliferation does not include programs such as the Cooperative \nThreat Reduction Program and other threat reduction programs; that our \ntraditional nonproliferation efforts as they pertain to treaties and \nregimes are not included; and that it does not apply to programs that \nprovide protective gear, clothing, and other items that protect our \ntroops on the battlefield from weapons of mass destruction attacks.\n  Finally, as my distinguished colleague from Arizona said, I am well \naware--we all are--that the President has a Commission studying this \nissue. That is why this amendment sets the parameters for a national \ncounterproliferation center without getting into the explicit detail. \nIt also does not call for any existing agencies or efforts to be \ndisestablished.\n  The amendment is also consistent with the framework and authorities \nfor the NID that have been established in the underlying bill.\n  I have also modified the implementation date so that this center does \nnot have to be established until late next year.\n  All of this gives the President the flexibility to fine-tune the \ncenter based on the findings of his Commission. It also gives him time \nto establish the center, particularly since the administration will be \nbusy in the coming months setting up the counterterrorism center.\n  The bottom line is this: Just as we take the offensive in the global \nwar on terrorism, we must similarly take the offensive in stopping the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Our nonproliferation \nefforts are a good defense, but they are not sufficient. We need a good \noffense, and counterproliferation is just the answer.\n  The role of the national counterproliferation center, therefore, is \nto coordinate, plan, and manage\n\n[[Page S10538]]\n\nthose efforts. It is to break down the stovepipes that exist in this \nnascent effort. It is to deny the terrorists and others access to \nweapons of mass destruction and their materials while the National \nCounterterrorism Center works to dismantle terrorist groups and bring \nterrorists to justice.\n  Mr. President, establishing a national counterproliferation center is \nnot only the smart thing to do, it is something we must do. I encourage \nmy colleagues to give this amendment their full support. Doing so will \nmake the country and the American people much safer.\n  Let me also add, in response to the Senator from Arizona, we have \nreceived input from the White House on how to improve this amendment. \nWe have incorporated their ideas. The White House, at this point, does \nnot oppose this amendment.\n  I am confident this amendment does strike the proper balance between \nestablishing the national counterproliferation center and, at the same \ntime, leaving the President more than sufficient time--a year--and \nflexibility to modify it as he sees fit or as the Commission \nrecommends.\n  This amendment is crafted in a manner so as to leave the whole range \nof details for the President and the Commission to flush out as they \nsee fit.\n  Finally, the modified amendment also includes a provision we worked \non with a number of Senators, including Senator McCain's staff, that \nmakes clear that the intent of this amendment is not to undermine or \noverride the Commission.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and do appreciate the consideration \nof my colleagues in supporting this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3876, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have worked with the distinguished \nmanagers. Like so many things in the course of our legislative process, \nwe have worked out a very large number of items, and they have been \naccepted. One remains and, in my judgment, the various good-faith \nproposals simply do not meet the criteria that I feel has to be \nestablished. So I have two courses of action. One, which I intend to \nfollow, is to withdraw the amendment. The second, of course, would be \nto press this on with a vote. Frankly, given the structure of the \nvote--I don't say this as criticism--it does not allow the time in \nwhich to get sufficient information and viewpoints to my colleagues to \nprevail on such a vote. So I think the better course of action for this \nSenator is to continue to press my concerns in the course of the \nconference.\n  At this time, I call up amendment No. 3876.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask that the amendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. For a little expression of the explanation of the \namendment, I go back to two very important documents. The first is a \nletter dated September 28, 2004, Statement of Administration Policy. I \nask unanimous consent that the following paragraph be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The Administration notes that the Committee bill did not \n     include Section 6 (``Preservation of Authority and \n     Accountability'') of the Administration's proposal; the \n     Administration supports inclusion of this provision in the \n     Senate bill. The legislation should also recognize that its \n     provisions would be executed to the extent consistent with \n     the constitutional authority of the President: to conduct the \n     foreign affairs of the United States; to withhold information \n     the disclosure of which could impair the foreign relations, \n     the national security, deliberative processes of the \n     Executive, or the performanceof the Executive's \n     constitutional duties; to recommend for congressional \n     consideration such measures as the President may judge \n     necessary or expedient; and to supervise the unitary \n     executive.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. That paragraph states that:\n\n       The Administration opposes the Committee's attempt to \n     define in statute programs that should be included in the \n     National Intelligence Program.\n\n  I believe we have to work this out in a clearer fashion. It is also \nmore clear than what is in the amendment structure today, so I will put \nthat aside and then go to the subject of this amendment.\n  The last paragraph of the September 28 letter reads:\n\n       The Administration notes that the Committee did not include \n     Section 6, (``Preservation of Authority and Accountability'') \n     of the Administration's proposal; the Administration supports \n     the inclusion of this provision in the Senate bill.\n\n  That was the basic intent of my amendment; therefore, I will take the \nopportunity to work on that during the course of conference in the \nhopes of achieving that goal.\n  I thank the managers for their effort to work on it, and we will \nhopefully work on it further to achieve this administration goal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the cooperation of \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee. We have incorporated many \nof his suggestions into the bill. I appreciate his advice.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Modification to No. 3807\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify \namendment No. 3807, with the changes at the desk, notwithstanding its \nprior adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The modification is as follows:\n\n     hold driver's licenses and personal identification cards.\n       (4) Negotiated rulemaking.--\n       (A) In general.--Before publishing the proposed regulations \n     required by paragraph (2) to carry out this title, the \n     Secretary of Transportation shall establish a negotiated \n     rulemaking process pursuant to subchapter IV of chapter 5 of \n     title 5, United States Code (5 U.S.C. 561 et seq.).\n       (B) Representation on negotiated rulemaking committee.--Any \n     negotiated rulemaking committee established by the Secretary \n     of Transportation pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall include \n     representatives from--\n       (i) among State offices that issue driver's licenses or \n     personal identification cards;\n       (ii) among State elected officials;\n       (iii) the Department of Homeland Security; and\n       (iv) among interested parties, including organizations with \n     technological and operational expertise in document security \n     and organizations that represent the interests of applicants \n     for such licenses or identification cards.\n       (C) Time requirement.--The process described in \n     subparagraph (A) shall be conducted in a timely manner to \n     ensure that--\n       (i) any recommendation for a proposed rule or report is \n     provided to the Secretary of Transportation not later than 9 \n     months after the date of enactment of this Act; and\n       (ii) a final rule is promulgated not later than 18 months \n     after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Grants to States.--\n       (1) Assistance in meeting federal standards.--Beginning on \n     the date a final regulation is promulgated under subsection \n     (b)(2), the Secretary of Transportation shall award grants to \n     States to assist them in conforming to the minimum standards \n     for driver's licenses and personal identification cards set \n     forth in the regulation.\n       (2) Allocation of grants.--The Secretary of Transportation \n     shall award grants to States under this subsection based on \n     the proportion that the estimated average annual number of \n     driver's licenses and personal identification cards issued by \n     a State applying for a grant bears to the average annual \n     number of such documents issued by all States.\n\n[[Page S10541]]\n\n       (3) Minimum allocation.--Notwithstanding paragraph (2), \n     each State shall receive not less than 0.5 percent of the \n     grant funds made available under this subsection.\n       (d) Extension of Effective Date.--The Secretary of \n     Transportation may extend the date specified under subsection \n     (b)(1)(A) for up to 2 years for driver's licenses issued by a \n     State if the Secretary determines that the State made \n     reasonable efforts to comply with the date under such \n     subsection but was unable to do so.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Secretary of Transportation for \n     each of the fiscal years 2005 through 2009, such sums as may \n     be necessary to carry out this section.\n\n     SEC. __08.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This resolution shall take effect on the convening of the \n     109th Congress.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenator Reid and the majority and Democratic leaders, an amendment to a \nresolution to reform the Senate's oversight of intelligence and \nhomeland security matters. If enacted, it will mark the most \nsignificant changes made in this body since the 1970s relating to the \nway the Senate operates.\n\n[[Page S10545]]\n\n  Let me speak for a moment about why we must make significant reforms. \nThe world did not change on September 11, 2001, only our perception of \nit did. In fact, the world had changed long before that particular \nclear September day. Frankly, we are nearly a decade late realizing it.\n  The first clue the world had changed and that a new enemy lurked in \nthe shadows occurred on February 26, 1993, when Islamic terrorists \nbombed the World Trade Center, killing six and injuring hundreds.\n  These terrorists had ties to al-Qaida, which was busy then building \nits army of terrorists in the Sudan.\n  Four years later, on August 7, 1998, al-Qaida attacked two U.S. \nembassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing hundreds and injuring \nthousands.\n  And on October 12, 2000--nearly 4 years ago today--these same al-\nQaida terrorists attacked the USS Cole while it was in port in Yemen. \nThese terrorists killed 17 soldiers and injured 40 more.\n  And yet it took the carnage of September 11 to awaken America, the \nCongress, our governmental institutions, and our CIA analysts to the \nmagnitude of the threat that Islamic terrorism poses to the American \npeople.\n  It took September 11 to show us how much the world had changed since \nthe days of the Cold War.\n  In the wake of those attacks, Congress and the President swung into \naction--and brought the fight to the enemy.\n  We in Congress passed the PATRIOT Act, which reformed the FBI and \nprovided our law enforcement agencies with greater tools to combat \nterrorism. We fast-tracked the procurement of specialized equipment \nsuch as the Predator unmanned aerial vehicle for our military forces in \nAfghanistan.\n  Congress created the Department of Homeland Security to consolidate \nand coordinate Government activities that protect America, and to solve \nsome of the problems that contributed to the failure to anticipate \nSeptember 11.\n  The administration has issued important executive orders reforming \nthe intelligence community in a way that facilitates coordination of \nessential information.\n  Today, the Senate passed the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004, which \ndramatically reforms our intelligence agencies. These reforms will \nimprove the collection, analysis, and integration of our Nation's most \nvital intelligence, assuring that red flags are no longer ignored.\n  What we have not done, however, is reform ourselves.\n  Congress, as did our intelligence agencies, failed to appreciate the \nthreat prior to September 11. We certainly appreciate it now. And I \nhope we can reform this institution in a way that allows us to better \nmonitor and influence the executive agencies tasked with keeping \nAmerica safe.\n  It is time to put our own house in order.\n  In August, Senator Frist and Senator Daschle--in response to the 9/11 \nCommission recommendations--asked the Senate to do just that. They \ncreated a working group of 22 senior Members of the Senate, and asked \nSenator Reid and me to chair it.\n  We worked closely with these Members to discuss the advantages and \ndisadvantages of the 9/11 Commission recommendations, and also to \nbrainstorm new ideas and improvements to our oversight of the \nintelligence community and Department of Homeland Security.\n  I want to thank these Members for their many good ideas and for their \npatience and willingness to work on a bipartisan basis to do something \nthat is very difficult but also very worthwhile.\n  After convening a number of meetings with our Members, Senator Reid \nand I met frequently to hammer out a list of recommendations that \nbroadly reflects the consensus or majority views of our group.\n  Not every Senator will be happy with each and every recommendation. \nBut such is the nature of compromise. We have endeavored to be honest \nbrokers, and I hope we have achieved that goal.\n  Some Members will complain this reform goes too far. Others will \ncomplain it does not go far enough.\n  I hope most Members will agree with me that it is an appropriate \nbalance of reform that improves our ability to conduct oversight of \nintelligence and homeland security during a very serious time for our \ncountry.\n  Neither Senator Reid, nor I, nor the 20 other members of our working \ngroup have a monopoly on wisdom. And were our recommendations part of \nthe New Testament, they would not be written in red ink.\n  The resolution before us today is not a final product. It is a work \nin progress. And we hope Members who want to improve upon this \nresolution will come to the floor and offer amendments.\n  We would like to accept non-controversial amendments, and to allow \nMembers to vote on amendments that may be a bit more contentious. We \nwant the Senate to work its will.\n  But before ceding control of this resolution to the will of the \nSenate, let me describe the philosophy behind our recommendations, as \nwell as some of the recommendations themselves.\n  The most sweeping change we recommend is to consolidate Congressional \njurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security. If you don't \nthink this is major reform, ask the roughly 25 Senate committee or \nsubcommittee chairmen who currently have jurisdiction over Homeland \nSecurity agencies or programs.\n  Trust me. They have made sure Senator Reid and I know how significant \nthis reform is.\n  The current system of homeland security is broken. These 25 different \nSenate committees or subcomittes can only have a narrow view of part of \nthe department's activities.\n  Congressional oversight is like a team of blindfolded scientists, \neach examining a different part of a horse and trying to describe what \nkind of animal it is. No committee can step back and look at the horse \nas a whole.\n  The Department of Homeland Security deserves its own authorization \ncommittee. We wouldn't divide jurisdiction over the Department of \nDefense by creating an Army committee, a Navy/Marine committee, and an \nAir Force committee. So why have we done so with Homeland Security?\n  The status quo also hampers the Department's ability to do its \nprimary job: protecting the homeland.\n  Currently, the department has to report to 88 House and Senate \ncommittees or subcommittees.\n  This year alone, Secretary Ridge or his subordinates have testified \nat 164 hearings. They have given over 1300 briefings. And the year \nisn't over yet.\n  Mr. President, that's almost 40 briefings a week. In fact, there are \nprobably Homeland Security personnel crawling around Capitol Hill right \nnow, when they should be back in their offices working to keep us safe.\n  We didn't create the Department of Homeland Security so that it can \nprovide us with a gluttony of power point presentations but to keep \nAmerica safe. We should consolidate jurisdiction so that both Congress \nand the Department can do their job more effectively, and more \nefficiently.\n  To do this, we recommend that jurisdiction over the Department be \nintegrated under the Governmental Affairs Committee, which should be \nrenamed the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  There will be exceptions to this jurisdictional consolidation. And we \nencourage Members who are concerned about jurisdictional issues to file \namendments to work with the chairman and ranking member of Governmental \nAffairs to reach agreements about appropriate jurisdictional \narrangements.\n  We welcome amendments and debate on these issues.\n  On Intelligence oversight, the working group believed that our \noversight of intelligence must be strengthened.\n  The task force wanted to work with the committee to help structure it \nso it was comprised of devoted experts who have the time and expertise \nin the intelligence field. The members now serving on the committee \nhave done so with great distinction. But they need better tools and \nfewer competing demands on their time in order to conduct focused and \ncomprehensive oversight.\n  And so we have recommended the status of the committee be raised from \nB to A. This may seem like a minor and arcane detail, but it means a \ngreat deal. On my side of the aisle, Senators can serve on the \ncommittee without having to give up any other assignments. Some Members \nserve on three or four other committees in addition to intelligence.\n\n[[Page S10546]]\n\n  Quite simply, they cannot devote the time necessary to conduct \neffective oversight with so many other obligations.\n  This elevation in status will require Senators interested in \nintelligence to make a choice to serve on the committee. But once on \nthe committee, they will not be term limited, and each member of the \ncommittee will be able to play an integral role in conducting \noversight.\n  The Intelligence Committee is an important committee, and a popular \ncommittee, and I am confident that a good number of members will want \nto serve on it.\n  As I have said, we also have removed term limits, in order to allow \nmembers to develop the expertise needed to conduct effective oversight. \nNo other Committee in the Senate says after you've spent 8 years \nbecoming an expert that you get the boot. Now the Intelligence \nCommittee won't have to say goodbye to its most experienced members.\n  We have allowed members to hire personal designated staff, to give \nthem a trusted representative on the committee. There was strong \nsupport for this recommendation, which will reinstate previous \ncommittee policy.\n  In addition to the 14 suggested improvements to the Select Committee \non Intelligence, we also have recommended the Appropriations Committee \ncreate a Subcommittee on Intelligence.\n  Appropriations jurisdiction over oversight is currently dispersed \nthroughout multiple subcommittees. We propose the creation of an \nIntelligence Subcommittee of Appropriations that would consolidate the \nroughly 80 percent of the intelligence budget that will come under the \njurisdiction of the national intelligence director.\n  This subcommittee will improve the Appropriations Committee's ability \nto live up to its responsibility to exercise oversight over the \nnational intelligence budget. For the same reasons that homeland \nsecurity jurisdiction should be consolidated, so, too, should \nintelligence appropriations jurisdiction.\n  Not all of us agree on this recommendation, and I fully expect that \nSenators will offer an amendment to implement the 9/11 Commission's \nrecommendation to create a combined authorization and appropriations \ncommittee.\n  These recommendations require us to use a different set of muscles in \nour oversight. And some of these reforms are not easy. But few things \nworth doing are.\n  We have a historic opportunity to reform this Chamber for the better, \nand I believe we should not shirk our responsibility to do so. We must \ndo it now in order to do all we can to protect the American people from \nthe next major terrorist attack.\n  This is a partisan body, and we have pointed fingers for 3 years \nabout who was to blame for the failures of our intelligence and \nhomeland security prior to 9/11. Some blamed the Clinton \nAdministration, others blamed the Bush Administration. Some saw fault \nin the FBI, others in the CIA, and still other in the military's \naversion to covert operations. We are good at pointing fingers at \nothers, but we have not pointed them at ourselves.\n  Just as our CIA analysts failed to piece together the clues about al-\nQaida's intention to attack our cities with hijacked airplanes, so, \ntoo, did we fail to question their assessments. We failed to question \ntheir focus on old threats. We failed to challenge them to take risks. \nWe failed to question the lack of CIA operatives in Iraq, or why our \nhuman intelligence capabilities had become so eroded. Despite the \nnumerous attacks on American targets by Islamic radicals, we failed to \nput more money in the intelligence budget to hire Arabic linguists.\n  These are not the faults of the Clinton administration or the Bush \nadministration. They are our fault, too, and we have a chance today to \ncorrect them.\n  I say to my colleagues, I believe we have an opportunity to improve \nour oversight of the arms of Government that keep America safe. Let us \nnot cause some future generation to look back 50 years from this moment \nand ask the question: Why did they not act?\n  Now is our opportunity to do just that, and I encourage my fellow \nSenators to come to the floor and offer amendments so that we can move \nthis package forward as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, about an hour ago, the Senate marked a \nhistorical moment with the passage of S. 2845, the National \nIntelligence Reform Act of 2004. Passage of that act was a major \nmilestone--a major milestone--on the road to the most significant \noverhaul of our intelligence community in over 50 years.\n  The Senate bill includes nearly all of the recommendations made by \nthe 9/11 Commission as they centered on intelligence reform within the \nexecutive branch--39 recommendations.\n  It is important to note, however, the Commission said that \noverhauling the executive branch is not enough and, thus, we are now on \nthe Senate resolution to address the final two recommendations of the \n9/11 Commission, and that is the overhaul of how we do business in \noversight of intelligence functions.\n  The Democratic leader and I were just talking about how pleased we \nwere in the fulfillment of the process we set out at the end of July \nwhere both arms--one being the one we just completed on the Senate \nfloor in the form of the executive branch intelligence jurisdiction, \nand the second arm being the overhaul of our Senate oversight--has \nworked so well to date, but we still have that second arm to address, \nand that is what we are on today.\n  The Democratic leader and I have come to the floor to outline to our \ncolleagues, A, the importance of completing that oversight function \nreform in this body but, B, and equally important, to point out we do \nnot have very much time to address this issue with the range and number \nof other issues we have to address. We have plenty of time to address \nthese issues, but we need to do so in an expeditious way, in a way that \nallows people to have their amendments considered, to have them \ndebated, and to have them voted upon, but we need to do so in a timely \nmanner.\n  We ask our colleagues to bring their amendments to the resolution to \nthe managers so they can be considered.\n  With that, I turn to the Democratic leader, and then I will have \nfurther comments on other legislation we have to address before \ndeparting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of \nthe majority leader. He made note of the fact that this is a historic \nday. This is a day when the Senate, with an overwhelmingly bipartisan \nvote, responded to the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and other \ncommissions that have urged our Government to take action to make us \nsafer. We made a major step today in creating the infrastructure to \nmake America safer.\n  I compliment the majority leader for his efforts and also, of course, \nthe two managers. Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman deserve great \ncredit for the work product we voted on only moments ago. This is \nhistoric not only for its substance, but I would like to think it is \nalso historic for the process that brought us here.\n  As the majority leader has noted, we have an opportunity to replicate \nthe substance and the process with the second piece of our work. I \nthink in an equally bipartisan fashion, Senator McConnell and Senator \nReid have worked hand in glove. They deserve great commendation and \ncredit for the work they have done.\n  They have consulted with every Member of the Senate. They have worked \nparticularly with our chairs and ranking members, and they have now \nbrought us a work product that was amended slightly as a result of that \nconsultative process last night.\n  After working and laying out the work product, they listened, they \nresponded, and we have the response they put into the Record last \nnight. So everybody has had a chance to review their work, and we are \nnow, as the majority leader noted, asking for the\n\n[[Page S10547]]\n\nsame degree of cooperation and bipartisanship on this legislative work \nas we have on the bill.\n  In that context, it will be important for Senators to indicate to us \nas quickly as possible their intent with regard to amendments. I know \nboth cloakrooms are going to be seeking the response of Senators who \nmay wish to offer amendments.\n  Based on that response, because of the time of year, we may be \nrequired to file cloture just so we can accelerate the consideration of \nthis effort. I will support that effort if it may be required, but, \nagain, as we have done each day during the deliberations of the bill, I \nhope we could start the day with somewhat of a status report on where \nwe are and what needs to be done and a reiteration of the importance of \nthis work and our efforts in doing it in the same manner.\n  So I hope we can continue as we have. As I said, this is a historic \nday, but there is much more history to be made and so much more work to \nbe done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, while the Democratic leader and I are both \non the floor, because it reflects the discussions we have had over the \ncourse of today, there is other business that we will be conducting \nover the course of the week. There has been huge progress made today on \na bill in conference, the FSC/ETI manufacturing jobs bill. We expect to \naddress that hopefully very soon--I believe the House will be \naddressing it tomorrow--maybe tomorrow night or late tomorrow \nafternoon. It is a bill we are both committed to addressing before we \nleave.\n  As everyone knows, we had planned to leave on Friday, October 8. It \nis a bill that also has been handled in an admirable way in conference \nby Chairman Grassley, and Chairman Thomas from the House, with a very \nopen discussion, open debate, and votes in the conference. We plan on \naddressing that bill as soon as it is available and the plans will be \nto complete that as well before we depart.\n  Homeland Security appropriations is currently in conference and we \nexpect to be able to address that as well.\n  I mention all of those bills because tonight is Wednesday and we have \nThursday and Friday. Although our shared goal is that we leave Friday, \nif it requires being here Saturday or later, it means that we would \nhave to do just that. It should not. The way these bills have been \nhandled over the last several weeks, it simply should not require going \ninto Saturday, but if necessary, we may just have to do that.\n  I will comment briefly on the resolution as well because I have not \nhad the opportunity to do so. I know the managers want to be able to \nproceed directly, but I just wanted to outline that in mid-August \nSenator Daschle and I did assemble a task force of 22 Members to look \nat the recommendations proposed by the 9/11 Commission that deal with \nreform of the Congress. We charged this task force to look at the range \nof issues and possibilities and to present the Democratic and \nRepublican leaders with a proposal and their recommendations.\n\n  To reflect the leadership's commitment to the importance of this \nissue of congressional reform, we asked our respective assistant \nleaders, Senator McConnell and Senator Reid, who are managing the bill \nnow, to chair this task force. Over the past several weeks, Senators \nMcConnell and Reid have held a series of meetings, collectively and \nindividually. As Senator Daschle has said and as I have also said, we \nhave had the opportunity to meet as conferences and caucuses to address \nthese issues.\n  The managers of the bill have also consulted with the 9/11 Commission \nand others to solicit their ideas and their reflections and \nrecommendations. The product of their efforts is captured in the Senate \nresolution today and the amendment that has just been introduced.\n  Right now, as we talk, the amendment may or may not be a perfect \nproduct--it is probably not a perfect product--but it is a very good \nand very solid product. It does reflect the majority view of the task \nforce as they looked at a whole range of options and alternatives, \nindividual items to improve Senate oversight of intelligence, which is \nthe objective, and that is what will be achieved by this resolution.\n  There are a number of contentious issues that have not been fully \naddressed, that we expect to be addressed tonight on the Senate floor.\n  When the Democratic leader said we are reaching out to people to \nbring those potential amendments forward, that is exactly what we mean. \nIt was Senator McConnell's and Senator Reid's recommendation, rightly I \nbelieve, to have the Members decide through debate and through the \noffering of amendments on the floor how we might make that proposal \nbetter. That is about as open and transparent a process as one can \nhave, but it does require Members to come forward and participate in \nthat floor debate.\n  I will close by saying that I personally thank Senators McConnell and \nReid for their efforts and to the other Members of the leadership task \nforce and to all the Members for their cooperation and their \nparticipation in, once again, a nonpartisan manner.\n  I reiterate that it is the leadership's desire on both sides of the \naisle to complete this before we depart.\n  I close where I began, and that is, without Senate reform of the way \nwe conduct oversight of intelligence and homeland security, our efforts \nto overhaul the executive branch, which we took a major step forward \njust an hour ago in this body, will be incomplete, inadequate, and \nreally inconsistent with our obligations to the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I, first, extend my appreciation to Senator \nMcConnell. Senator McConnell and I were given a task and we have done \nthe best we can. I have served in the Congress now for 22 years. This \nis one of the hardest things I have ever had to do, if not the hardest. \nIt has been a very difficult 3 or 4 weeks that Senator McConnell and I \nhave spent working with Members.\n  I have known Mitch McConnell for many years, the senior Senator from \nKentucky, but as happens when one is thrown into a situation of stress, \nworking closely together, one develops a different relationship, and \nthe bond Senator Mitch McConnell and I have formed over this last month \nis one that will be with us forever.\n  I appreciate his willingness to allow me to drop in his office \nunannounced and call on him all times of the night and day. He has a \nfine staff and he has worked extremely well with my staff. Without \nbelaboring the point, I appreciate all he has done to get us to this \npoint. Without him, we could not be where we are now.\n\n  I have five children. My oldest child is a girl. I have one girl, my \ndaughter Lana. I can remember as if it were yesterday, my little girl \nwas going away to school, to college. I can still remember I cried that \nday, I felt so sad that my little girl was going to go away. I still \nfeel some emotion when I think about it.\n  The reason I mention that is my daughter leaving to go to college is \nonly an example of how difficult change is. Why did I feel bad? Because \nof change. I had been with my little girl for 18 years, and suddenly \nshe was going to leave. Change in our lives is always very difficult. \nChange in the life of the Senate is difficult. What Senator McConnell \nand I have brought before the Senate is a change. I repeat, I only give \nthe example of my daughter for illustrative purposes. But change here \nfor 98 Senators with whom we have been working is difficult. It is not \nthe same as sending a daughter to school, but it is still a change. Any \ntime you change, it is difficult. That is what this has been about.\n  We have been considering ways to reform the executive branch of \nGovernment for 2 weeks. It is now done. Now it is time to turn the \nfocus on reform of the Senate. A lot of change is taking place here in \nthe waning days of this Congress, important changes brought about as a \nresult of more than 3,000 Americans being killed through a terrorist \nact. That is why we are doing this.\n  A commission was appointed, led by long-time Congressman Lee Hamilton \nand former Governor of New Jersey Thomas Kean. They had members who \nworked very hard for a year. They had 80 full-time staff. They came to \nus with recommendations as to how we had to change the executive branch \nof Government. We have done the best we can in\n\n[[Page S10548]]\n\nthat regard. We have changed, as far as the Senate sees it, the \nexecutive branch of Government. It has been painful. It has been \npainful for a lot of Senators. But we did it because we had to do it.\n  I will elaborate on that a little bit later, but the Commission said \ndoing one without the other is doing nothing. If we walked away from \nthis body now, as some have suggested, and said we have done our job, \nwe have done the executive improvement, we may not have done \neverything, but we have done all we have time to do--we cannot leave \nhere without having done this.\n  What we do tonight and tomorrow is nothing the President has to sign. \nThe bill that passed here earlier this evening by a vote of 96 to 2 is \nsomething the President has to sign. He does not have to sign this. \nThis is something the Senate is doing on its own. We are doing it \nbecause the Commission said you cannot have one without the other.\n  As I said, some have said, Why do this? Some have said, Maybe the \nHouse isn't going to do anything; why does the Senate have to tackle \nthis issue?\n  We can't maintain the status quo after 9/11. We have to look at every \nfacet of our Government. We did this: The homeland security functions, \nour intelligence functions, and our congressional oversight.\n  I extend my appreciation to Senators Roberts and Rockefeller. They \nhave, during the most difficult times in the history of the \nIntelligence Committee, been asked to guide this country through these \nperilous times, and they did it without having much to do it with. The \nIntelligence Committee, as indicated by the 9/11 Commission, is weak \nand toothless. So I appreciate very much the work of these two very \nwise men. Being able to work together--it wasn't easy. They had a \ndifficult time. The members of the Intelligence Committee also worked \nwell.\n\n  But, as the 9/11 Commission indicated, we need to give the \nIntelligence Committee more authority and power. That is what we are in \nthe process of doing. We, in effect, said, Can we do better? Can we do \nbetter for Rockefeller and Roberts and others, not only today but in \nthe years to come? We have found, under the leadership of the 9/11 \nCommission, that oversight of the intelligence community is not strong \nenough--not enough power, not enough resources, not enough muscle.\n  As my friend Senator McConnell has indicated, the homeland security \noversight is now splintered among 88 committees and subcommittees--not \n8 in the Senate, not 8 in the House--Governor Ridge and I came together \nin 1982, each as a Member of Congress. I don't know the exact number of \ntimes he has come here, but I think it was 164 times so far this year. \nThink about it. We can do better.\n  We do not need these weak and fractionalized subcommittees and \ncommittees, all wanting a piece of the Secretary of Homeland Security. \nWe are not going to make a tweak here and a tweak there. As the 9/11 \nCommission found:\n\n       Tinkering with the existing committee structure is not \n     sufficient. The United States needs a strong, stable and \n     capable committee structure to give America's national \n     intelligence agencies oversight, support and leadership.\n\n  We can't make all these changes in the executive branch which we did \nin this bill we just passed and not put our own house in order. The 9/\n11 Commission made that point very clear:\n\n       The other reforms suggested, such as the National \n     Counterterrorism Center and a National Intelligence Director, \n     will not work if Congressional oversight does not change too.\n\n  It has not been easy. We have taken 10 standing committees and taken \njurisdiction from each of the 10 and given them to this new committee \nthat will be formed from the Governmental Affairs Committee. It will \nnow be the Homeland Security/Governmental Affairs.\n  People have had to give things up. Some have given them up \ngraciously. Some have given them up kicking and screaming. There will \nbe amendments offered here to reverse some of the changes we have \nrecommended in the amendment that is now before the Senate. Senator \nMcConnell and I recognize that should be a fair, open process. We are \nnot infallible. Maybe we made some mistakes, but we certainly tried not \nto.\n  The Commission made the point clear that it will not work if \ncongressional oversight does not change also. So here we are, with a \nresolution encompassing some of the most important recommendations of \nthe 9/11 Commission--no doubt the most difficult. Obviously we would \nnot be here without the fine work of the 9/11 Commission that I boasted \nabout more than once, and without the urging of many brave families \nwhose lives were shaken by the tragedy of 9/11.\n  I served in the House of Representatives with Lee Hamilton. I served \nunder his leadership on the Foreign Affairs Committee in the House of \nRepresentatives. He is a fine man. He was a mentor to me. He and \nGovernor Kean have made their mark upon the country with their \nexcellent report. We are also here on the verge of landmark reform \nbecause of the strong partisan interest of our colleagues in reforming \nthis institution. There may be different opinions about some of the \ndetails, but I believe the consensus is very strong about bringing \nmuch-needed reform to the intelligence and homeland security functions.\n  As I started my statement using an example of my dear daughter Lana, \nI said change is hard. I understand that. I am a member of committees. \nThe committees on which I serve have given up things to make this work.\n  I also want to extend my grudging appreciation to the two leaders, \nSenators Daschle and Frist. The next time they have one of these nice \nthings to pass out, they will think of someone else. This has been very \nhard for Senator McConnell and me, but they have stood with us. They \nare fine leaders. And if we get this done--and I am hopeful and \nconfident we will--it all goes directly to their leadership. Both of \nthese men are so busy that they look to their assistants. I am the \nassistant Democratic leader, the whip. Senator McConnell is the \nassistant Republican leader, the whip. We have done our best \nrepresenting our caucuses. We run separate and apart from our two \nleaders. I run elected on my own, as does Senator McConnell. But we \nbelieve this was the time when without any question the two leaders \nwere doing absolutely the right thing. That is why we have spent so \nmuch of our time, energy, and effort in carrying out what they have \ndirected us to do.\n\n  I jokingly said I grudgingly send my appreciation. I really don't do \nthat. I am happy Senator Daschle had enough confidence in me to allow \nme to go forward on this noble experiment.\n  I have spoken to members of the 9/11 Commission on quite a few \noccasions in conference calls and personal meetings, and I appreciate \ntheir time. The time is up for this Commission, but they are still \ndevoting large blocks of time to people like me who come to them for \ndirection, guidance, and understanding. They wanted first of all to \nknow what we were doing was nonpartisan. I think Senator McConnell and \nI proved to them time and time again that it was.\n  Let us talk about the specifics.\n  The so-called task force recommended that the Senate inplement \nvirtually all of the congressional reform recommendations made by the \n9/11 Commission. I will go over what we have done. There are three \nbasic areas we looked at. One is to reform the Intelligence Committee \nprocess. The other is to create a different, new committee on homeland \nsecurity, which I have talked about, and the other is to make sure the \nappropriations process was part of this.\n  What we have done to strengthen collection of intelligence is \neliminate term limits. We have to ensure that the majority has no more \nthan a one-member advantage. This came directly from the 9/11 \nCommission. We maintain apportioned slots for these committees. The \nchairman and ranking member of Armed Services. I will offer an \namendment because I heard directly from the Intelligence Committee \nitself that they also wanted in addition to the Armed Services \nCommittee members of the Foreign Relations Committee doing that. In \nthis instance, it will be Senator Lugar, chairman of the committee, and \nSenator Biden, ranking member, who will serve as ex officio members. I \nwill offer an amendment at a subsequent time, and elevate the status, \nas I heard Senator McConnell talk about, from B to A.\n\n[[Page S10549]]\n\n  We have maintained the majority and minority leaders' ability to \nappoint all committee members. Members not appointed will serve without \nterm limits.\n  This is so important. Frankly, this is not anything that the 9/11 \nCommission recommended, but it came from Senator Warner in meetings we \nhad with Senator McConnell and me. Senator Warner has been here a long \ntime. I have served with him from the day after I came here as a member \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee. He has been so easy to \nwork with. If there were ever a stereotype of a southern gentleman, it \nis John Warner. And John Warner in his typical gentlemanly fashion \nsuggested to us that for a committee which is important, the chairman \nand ranking member should serve at the pleasure of the two leaders.\n\n  The reason for this is what I refer to as the ``Wilbur Mills \nproblem.'' Wilbur Mills was a long-time Member of Congress and became \nchairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee. This was a man who \nnever had a problem in the world as far as anything dealing with ethics \nand morality. Suddenly, for whatever reason, Wilbur Mills--this \ndistinguished Member of Congress who served 30 years--started doing a \nlot of things very publicly that were an embarrassment to this \ninstitution. He was there based on seniority and there was no way he \ncould be disposed of. We don't want that. It is something that probably \nwould never happen, but we need that protection. The people who are \nrepresenting and leading this Intelligence Committee have to be above \nreproach ethically and morally. The two leaders should have the ability \nto do that.\n  That is why Senator McConnell and I, along with Senator Warner--that \nis where this came from. We believe that committees around here are too \nlarge. One of the things we set out to do was not have more committees. \nWe wanted to do what we could to make the committees smaller. We did \nthis. We reduced the size of the committee from 17 to 15. That may not \nsound like much, but it was a step forward. We have followed our \nphilosophy and reduced the size of the committee. This is something the \n9/11 Commission recommended. The staff positions for each member--\nmaintain nonpartisan professional staff, give the Intelligence \nCommittee a stronger role in reviewing civilian intelligence nominees. \nThis is something else the 9/11 Commission recommended.\n  That is one of the things they recommended in intelligence. We have \ndone that. But we have gone a step further, and said not only that but \nthe Intelligence Committee should be able to form whatever subcommittee \nthey feel would help that committee perform the functions they have for \nthe country.\n  Maintain committee subpoena authority; require the committee to make \nregular reports to the full Senate.\n  For the purpose of showing how much we did related to the \nrecommendations of the of 9/11 Commission, all we have to do is look \nright here. We have done what they have recommended, and more.\n  If you look here, the committee conducts ongoing oversight, checked \noff; create subcommittee dedicated to oversight, another check; ensure \ncommittee has subpoena authority, check that off; ensure majority has \nnot more than one-member advantage, check that off; ensure apportioned \nmembers slots for Armed Services, Appropriations, Foreign Relations and \nJudiciary; one-year term limit; reduce the size of the Intelligence \nCommittee; ensure the Intelligence Committee has a nonpartisan \nprofessional staff.\n  I think we have done that. It is good work. It was not easy, but \ngood.\n  We have talked about the operations committee, which recommended 14 \nspecific measures to give the committee greater stature and power.\n  We believe the proposed measures such as elevating the committee from \nB to A, ending term limits, and creating a subcommittee on oversight \nwill give the committee muscle and that will be oversight of the \nintelligence agencies.\n  I have talked about the need for the Appropriations subcommittee to \nfocus on investigations. We have done that.\n  What I have not talked about is Senator Bob Graham. Bob Graham was \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee, ranking member, served in a \nvery good way, former Governor of Florida, served in the Senate for 18 \nyears. He is leaving now. He is retiring. When someone suggested to him \nthat you should put the function of the appropriations and \nauthorization all in one committee, he said it would concentrate power \nin too small a number of people and it would be devastatingly wrong for \nthe intelligence community. So what we came up with, we feel, is \nsomething better than that; that is, as one distinguished Senator said, \nif we can have an Appropriations subcommittee for the District of \nColumbia, for agriculture, and the legislative branch of Government, we \nought to have one for intelligence. It is simply too important, and we \nagree. Senator McConnell and I agree.\n  Therefore, we have now merged the Military Construction Subcommittee, \nwhich I chaired for a Congress or two, with Defense--again, we don't \nwant to create more subcommittees or more committees--leaving 12 \nsubcommittees for Appropriations. We have created another one on \nintelligence.\n  There has been a lot of complaints that the monetary function of the \nIntelligence Committee was hidden in the Defense Subcommittee on \nAppropriations. That won't be the case anymore. It will have chairmen \nselected based on seniority. I am sure it will be one of the senior \nmembers of the Senate. That is about all you have on the Appropriations \nCommittee, and I think it would do well. This is a significant \ndevelopment.\n\n  We will increase the number of members and staff who oversee the \nintelligence community spending and finally shed light on programs that \nhave been tucked away far too long.\n  Governor Kean was asked at a recent Select Committee on Intelligence \nhearing about the creation of an appropriations subcommittee on \nintelligence. Governor Kean said:\n\n       I think [an intelligence appropriations subcommittee] would \n     be very much in my mind, be within the spirit of our \n     recommendations.\n\n  I have spoken to Congressman Hamilton and indicated to him what we \nwere going to do. He feels the same as Governor Kean about this.\n  Now, an appropriations subcommittee on intelligence is exactly the \nkind of conforming change that is required now that we have passed the \nCollins-Lieberman bill, where centralization and coordination of the \nintelligence community is achieved through the establishment of a \nnational intelligence director.\n  Some Members suggest a joint authorizing and appropriating committee, \nbut there are very strong feelings that creates too much power and too \nmuch secrecy for a handful of members, so it actually results in fewer \nchecks and balances and much weaker oversight.\n  There was a broad consensus to consolidate the oversight of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Without any question, we should not \nhave to have the director or his assistants appear before 88 committees \nand subcommittees of the Congress. We ought to have a single homeland \nsecurity authorizing committee. This would match the Homeland Security \nAppropriations Subcommittee we created last year.\n  With this we achieve the much-needed consolidation by replacing \nhomeland security oversight in the Governmental Affairs Committee and \nrenaming the committee Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  What we have now before the Senate is significant and sweeping \nreform. This resolution with the amendment we placed therein, though it \nmight not be perfect, and Senator McConnell and I would never say it \nwas, is extremely powerful and makes the required structural changes at \nthe same time it sends a clear message to the American people that the \nSenate understands the problems, and we are ready to make changes that \nwill help keep our country safe.\n  Let's end what the Commission calls a ``dysfunctional'' oversight \nprocess. It is the right thing to do. This is the right time to do it.\n  We welcome anyone who wants to offer amendments. We do recognize, \nhowever, as the two leaders mentioned earlier, that it is almost 7 \no'clock tonight, and we are supposed to leave Friday. We need to finish \nthis legislation. People cannot wait us out. If\n\n[[Page S10550]]\n\nMembers do not come tonight and tomorrow to offer amendments, we are \ngoing to go to third reading. We are not going to wait around while \npeople do other things. This is not January or March or April or May or \nSeptember. It is just a few days until the leaders have said we are \ngoing to go home. At the very best, it will be difficult to get out of \nhere late Friday or even Saturday.\n  The two leaders are absolutely right in saying we want everyone to \nhave an opportunity to review this resolution. The amendment was filed \nlast night, and everyone has had more than 24 hours to read it, to \nstudy it, to prepare their amendments. It is not a 400-page amendment. \nIt is a few pages in length, very simple and direct, and is something \nwe are doing to change this body. It is a significant change, and we \nrecognize that, but a most important change.\n\n  Members offering extraneous matters on this--and that is always \npossible--should understand they are doing it in the face of what the \n9/11 Commission said: we have to do this. I hope Members would not come \nand offer amendments relating to extraneous matters.\n  If there is something wrong with the amendment Senator McConnell and \nI sent to the desk, let us know. We have worked with a lot of folks. \nBut we cannot go back to the way things were before. We cannot have a \ncommittee called the Department of Homeland Security and not have \nanything that deals with homeland security. We have to have a committee \non homeland security that has the ability to oversee what is going on \nand have more homeland security for our country.\n  The time is here. It seems logical that there will not be any votes \ntonight, but that is up to the leaders to announce. I repeat: This \ncannot go on forever. There has to come a time when people offer \namendments. I hope that would happen before too long. We are here for \nbusiness, Senator McConnell and I.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Little Rock Central High\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for something they \nhave done not just for me or even for the city of Little Rock or the \nState of Arkansas but for the country. They are trying to help on a \nproject we are working on, Little Rock Central High School.\n  In 1957, the two biggest stories in the world that year were Sputnik \nand Little Rock Central High School because Little Rock was the first \nmajor southern school district to try to integrate their schools to try \nto follow the law as laid out in Brown v. Board of Education, Topeka, \nKS, and to try with all deliberate speed to integrate their schools.\n  They took that charge seriously and, as we all know, the situation \nthere got chaotic and very difficult. There has been a lot written \nabout it. It is one of the major milestones in the history of the \nstruggle for civil rights in this country.\n  In September of 2007, Little Rock Central will celebrate the 50th \nanniversary of the desegregation crisis at Little Rock Central High. We \nall know the story of the Little Rock Nine--Ernest Green, Elizabeth \nEckford, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Carlotta Walls LaNier, Minnijean Brown \nTrickey, Terrence Roberts, Jefferson Thomas, Thelma Mothershed Wair, \nand Melba Pattillo Beals.\n  We all know the story of these brave children who went into the \nlion's den, so to speak, to strike a blow against the old system of \n``separate but equal'' that was not working, and was fair. That was not \nright.\n  They showed tremendous courage not just for themselves and their \npersonal safety, but they led by example. It is very important we as a \nNation honor them and honor Little Rock for making the effort, and \nhonor the school for all the progress they made since 1957.\n  Little Rock Central High School now is considered one of the best \nhigh schools in America. It has been an amazing success story. It shows \nhow things can work when the community pulls together and tries to put \ndifficulties of the past behind them.\n  I could talk on and on about how proud I am of the Little Rock Nine \nand the way Little Rock has handled the situation, but today I thank \nMembers of this Senate for their support of S. 420. It is critical to \nacknowledge what happened at Little Rock 47 years ago.\n  I thank two Members of this body specifically who really helped get \nthis on track: first, Conrad Burns, who is the Interior Subcommittee \nchairman; and then the ranking member on that subcommittee, Byron \nDorgan. They have both been fantastic. Their staffs have helped. They \nhave made arrangements for us to get $733,000 in this Interior \nappropriations bill in order to do the design phase of the new visitor \ncenter at Little Rock Central High School.\n\n  Our goal is to try to have the visitor center completed and totally \nconstructed and up and running by the September 2007 anniversary. But \nwe could not have done this without Senator Burns and Senator Dorgan \nbecause they have shown a great deal of leadership. Also, I must say, \nBruce Evans, Ric Molen, and Peter Kiefhaber, on their staffs, have been \ngreat to work with.\n  Another group that Senator Lincoln and I both want to thank is the \nCongressional Black Caucus over on the House side. They have been \nfantastic. In fact, they have entered a sister resolution to this, and \nall 38 members of the Black Caucus signed on to the resolution. They \nhave been great. Chairman Elijah Cummings has shown some great \nleadership on this issue, and it has brought hope to the civil rights \ncommunity for this hopefully very positive celebration they will have \nin 2007.\n  The last person I want to thank, who is always there working behind \nthe scenes trying to get things done for his congressional district, is \nCongressman Vic Snyder. Vic Snyder has shown great leadership in this \nmatter, as he does consistently in everything he does. He has worked \nbehind the scenes and he has worked with all sides. He is doing \neverything he can to make sure this becomes a reality, again not just \nfor his district or the State but really for the Nation.\n  So, Mr. President, again, I thank everyone for their help and their \nsupport in what we are trying to do at Little Rock Central High School. \nI happen to have gone there. I am very proud of that school. It is a \ngreat landmark in the struggle for civil rights. The people in Arkansas \ndecided to make Little Rock Central not stand for a negative but stand \nfor a positive, stand for progress. It is something that certainly the \ncommunity but also the State has rallied around. We are very proud of \nwhat they have done at Little Rock.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the pending \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate the pending \n     amendment on S. Res. 445, a resolution to eliminate certain \n     restrictions on service of a Senator on the Senate Select \n     Committee on Intelligence.\n         Bill Frist, Mitch McConnell, Harry Reid, John Cornyn, \n           Craig Thomas, Jim Inhofe, Mike Crapo, Conrad Burns, \n           Norm Coleman, Tom Daschle, Lamar Alexander, Jim Talent, \n           Wayne Allard, Gordon Smith, Larry Craig, Robert F. \n           Bennett, Pete Domenici, Susan Collins.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have hotlined in both cloakrooms all \noffices asking for an indication of how many amendments might be \noffered to the underlying resolution. Regretfully, it is roughly 50.\n  I am authorized to say on behalf of the majority leader, it is our \nintention to wrap up business this week. We have\n\n[[Page S10551]]\n\nno intention of trying to shut out any Senators who want to offer \namendments. We had hoped some might come over tonight and offer them. \nWe will certainly have all day tomorrow to deal with any and all \namendments that Senators feel strongly about and on which they would \nlike to have votes. But we really must move the process along, and that \nis the reason the majority leader wished to file a cloture motion \ntonight.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes, I yield to my friend and colleague from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, around here, we do not often see cloture \nmotions signed by all four leaders. This cloture motion does have four \nleaders. We are serious about completing this bill at the earliest \npossible date. It would be a travesty if, having just completed a very \nsignificant piece of legislation led by Senators Collins and Lieberman, \nwe not do our share of the legislative reform that needs to be done.\n  The cloture motion was filed with reluctance. No one wanted to do it. \nBut with the 8th of October staring us in the face literally, we have \nno choice but to do this. I hope people tomorrow will recognize there \nwill be an effort made to offer these amendments. At 1 o'clock \ntomorrow, all first-degree amendments must be filed. That is the rule.\n  I hope people will come and discuss with us what problems they see \nwith this amendment. We will be happy to work with them, but I think \npeople should be ready to offer their amendments.\n  We have taken what we thought needed to be done from the 10 \ncommittees to give this committee, the homeland security committee, \nsome strength. We hope people recognize that.\n  I understand how people are concerned about maintaining the \njurisdiction of what they have, but this is a time when people have to \ngive up a little bit for the good of the country and for the good of \nthe Senate.\n  I totally support the cloture petition that was filed by the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky on behalf of the two leaders \nbecause that is basically what happened.\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send a second cloture motion to the \nresolution to the desk as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on S. Res. 445, a \n     resolution to eliminate certain restrictions on service of a \n     Senator on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\n  Bill Frist, Mitch McConnell, Harry Reid, John Cornyn, Craig Thomas, \nJim Inhofe, Mike Crapo, Conrad Burns, Norm Coleman, Tom Daschle, Lamar \nAlexander, James Talent, Wayne Allard, Gordon Smith, Larry Craig, \nRobert F. Bennett, Pete Domenici, Susan Collins.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as my good friend from Nevada has \nindicated, we hope to process all of the amendments that Members of the \nSenate feel strongly about. We will be open for business on this \nresolution all day tomorrow, and there should be ample time to deal \nwith all of the amendments that our colleagues feel strongly about and \nwish to offer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think everyone within the sound of our \nvoices should understand the majority leader and minority leader were \non the Senate floor and they both said we are going to stay here until \nwe finish this, the Homeland Security conference report and the FSC tax \nbill. Those matters are going to be finished. If we can finish on \nFriday, we will be out of here. If we are finished on Saturday, we will \nbe out of here. But the two leaders have said we are going to work to \nfinish this legislation.\n  We are dealing with Senators who know all the rules just as we do, \nbut I will indicate that this is a little different time. We are trying \nto bring Congress to a close, at least this part of it. Everyone should \nunderstand the determination of the two leaders to move this matter \nforward and the other things that are going to come before the Senate.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the assistant Democratic leader has \nclearly outlined what the goal of the two leaders, both Republican and \nDemocrat, are for the balance of this session before we adjourn for the \nelection. We are hoping to complete all of those items no later than \nFriday.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/06/senate-section/article/S10551-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I appreciate those comments. I actually \nwould not be here asking to do this if it were not for the earlier \ncomments of the Senator from Pennsylvania, speaking as in morning \nbusiness, as it relates to Senator Kerry's health care plan. I felt in \nfairness, as someone who works extensively on health care, that it was \nimportant to come down and speak to the errors that were presented \nearlier as my colleague spoke on the other side of the aisle.\n  First, it is important to know that it does not matter who we talk to \ntoday, it does not matter who comes into my office or what conversation \nI have with people throughout the great State of Michigan, the issue of \nhealth care always comes up.\n  Right now the big three automakers, struggling to compete \ninternationally with their business competitors around the world, are \ntalking about the need to address the high cost of health care. They \nhave indicated to me on more than one occasion that this needs to be \none of our top priorities of the Congress and the President of the \nUnited States: to tackle the explosion in health care costs.\n  We also know that half of those costs is the explosion in \nprescription drug prices, and that specifically needs to be addressed. \nWe have proposals we have been consistently bringing to this body and \nbringing to the President of the United States that will bring prices \ndown. So when we talk to our manufacturers in Michigan, this is a huge \nissue. If I talk to the workers who work for our manufacturers, it is a \nhuge issue for them. They are being asked to pay more copays, more \npremiums, to take pay cuts, in some cases layoffs, as a result of the \nhigh cost of health care and the fact that there has been no action to \naddress this while premiums and costs continue to go up faster and \nfaster.\n  I could talk to a group of seniors in Michigan and certainly talk \nabout medicine and the fact that the bill that passed this last year \nfor Medicare is more about helping the prescription drug industry than \nit is about helping our seniors in this country. They know what we need \nto be doing. They want to see the pharmacists be able to do business \nwith pharmacists in Canada, be able to bring prices down, cut them in \nhalf or, in some cases, 70 percent.\n  Seniors understand we have a crisis as it relates to the cost of \nmedicine and health care in this country, and they certainly know when \nwe look at the fact that this administration has announced the largest \nMedicare premium increase--17\\1/2\\ percent--in the history of the \nprogram since 1965 when it was instituted even though it is estimated \nthat Social Security will go up possibly only as much as 3 percent. I \nhave a bill that has been introduced with colleagues of mine to cap \nthat Medicare increase at the cost of Social Security increases, and up \nto now we have not been able to get a vote on this. Yet this will be \ntaking effect in January and taking more out of the pockets of our \nseniors.\n  We know that one of the major reasons for the increase--it is not \njust\n\n[[Page S10552]]\n\nnormal inflation--is because of the costs that are being rolled into \nthe premium increases relating to privatization that was part of the \nprescription drug bill. We were told privatization would save money. \nThe reality is, we have the highest Medicare increases in the history \nof the program.\n  So we can talk to seniors. We can talk to families who are struggling \nevery day and seeing their costs go up. We see the real household \nincome in 2000 has gone down $1,535. Family health care premiums have \ngone up, $3,000 on average, to $3,599. This is not what ought to be \nhappening. We have a crisis going on in our country.\n  I can talk to young people getting out of college who find themselves \nno longer eligible to be on their parents' insurance, who now go into \ntheir first job and maybe do not have health insurance on their first \njob. This is a very real story for me in my own family. Young people \nare hoping and praying they remain healthy, that nothing happens to \nthem until they can get into a job that has some health care.\n  We know that the majority of people, about 80 percent of the people \nwho do not have health insurance in this country, are working. We are \nnot talking about people who are not working; we are talking about \npeople who are working one job, two jobs, three jobs, working for small \nbusinesses. I can go to any small business in Michigan and, I would \nguess, across our great country, and they want to talk to me about what \nis happening in health care and health insurance, an explosion in \npricing. The average premium for small businesses has more than doubled \nin the last 5 years.\n  This is a crisis, and I am proud of the fact that John Kerry and John \nEdwards are stepping up to say this will be one of our highest \npriorities, to address this crisis. Everybody knows we have it. \nEverybody, from manufacturers to small businesses to seniors to workers \nto young families to students right out of college, everybody \nunderstands that we have a crisis in this country. I believe it is one \nof the major moral issues of our time. In the last 4 years we have seen \nthis over and over again. Whenever it was a choice between the \npharmaceutical lobby and the people of our country, the pharmaceutical \nlobby has won. Whenever it was a choice between the insurance industry \nand the people of this country, the insurance industries have won, the \nHMOs have won.\n\n  Frankly, on behalf of the people of my great State, we want somebody \nfighting for us, for the people of our country. The proposals that are \nput forward by Senator Kerry and Senator Edwards address the costs of \nhealth care and the access to health care. It is overdue for families. \nAgain, this chart shows incomes going down, family health care premiums \ngoing up. We can do something about this. A big piece of this is the \ncost of prescription drugs. Frankly, the rest of the premiums that we \nsee going up are because of folks who do not have insurance.\n  Our Secretary of Health and Human Services said, when asked about \nwhy--I believe it was in the context of why our Government is \nsupporting the development of a health care system in Iraq with \nAmerican tax dollars, but why we did not see the administration having \nthe same sense of passion and urgency about Americans and health care. \nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services said: Well, we kind of have \nuniversal health care coverage in our country because if someone is \nsick and goes into an emergency room, they get treated.\n  Well, that is true. When folks go into the emergency room and they go \nin sicker than they should be, go in instead of going to the doctor or \ninstead of getting preventive care, they get treated. And what happens? \nThe hospital then is forced to turn around and put those costs back on \nfolks with insurance, resulting in family health care premiums \nskyrocketing.\n  This is not by accident. Part of this is a result of the fact that we \nhave folks walking into the emergency room sicker than they should be \nor inappropriately getting care that should be in a doctor's office, \nthat should be on the front end where it is more effective, more \nefficient, costs less.\n  In Michigan alone, last year my hospitals tell me that they spent \nover $1 billion in uncompensated care for folks walking into the \nemergency room. We now see it materializing in requests to expand \nemergency rooms. I have all kinds of requests from hospitals that are \nbulging at the seams to expand their emergency rooms. So we are paying \nfor this on the back end. Families are paying through family health \ncare premiums rising more. We all pay because of emergency rooms being \nexpanded. Businesses are paying in loss of competitiveness. Seniors are \npaying.\n  What John Kerry and John Edwards are saying is we need to face that, \nwe can do better than that, and we need to tackle it on the front end. \nSo what are they suggesting? Well, I will mention just a few things. \nFirst, half of the premium increases are prescription drugs. It is very \nsimple. They say Medicare, first, ought to be able to negotiate group \ndiscounts. Everybody else can. The VA can on behalf of veterans. Any \nother insurance system negotiates group discounts, but Medicare is \nprohibited under the new bill. We know why. The insurance lobby did \ntheir job. The prescription drug lobby did their job. So they are going \nto go back and change that. We negotiate group discounts. We can \nactually close the gap in coverage so it is a better benefit.\n  We also have seen from both John Kerry and John Edwards a complete \ncommitment to allow us to do, on a bipartisan basis, what we have the \nvotes to do in the Senate if we could ever get this up for a vote, and \nthat is to open the border to Canada and to other countries where it is \nsafe, under strict FDA rules and regulations, to allow our pharmacists \nto do business with pharmacists in Canada and in other countries to \nbring back prescription drugs to the local pharmacy at half the price.\n  I am tired of putting seniors on a bus. Just a week ago I was \ninvolved, again with AARP, out at the Ambassador Bridge in Detroit. We \nhad people at the other two bridges in Michigan, talking about and \ndemonstrating the difference in prices. I am, frankly, tired of seeing \nin my State people who have to drive across the bridge or through the \ntunnel in order to be able to demonstrate lower prices or be able to \npurchase at lower prices. The Kerry-Edwards administration will bring \nback those prices to the local pharmacy. It will make a major \ndifference.\n  What else are they suggesting? I hear this all the time. We know one \nof the major problems right now under the insurance system is, \nparticularly for a small business, for example, a small business may \nhave 10 employees, and they may have low rates. Then one person gets \nvery ill--gets cancer, has a car accident, something else happens--and \nthey have a tremendous amount of costs for their care. That one case \nthrows the insurance rates of the business up dramatically. What the \nKerry-Edwards administration is talking about is having the Federal \nGovernment come in and, when the costs exceed $50,000 for an \nindividual, the Federal Government would serve as reinsurance, to cover \nthose few cases that are very expensive and throw the entire cost off \nfor the business. It makes sense. We can do that.\n  We have also indicated we need to make a commitment to cover all \nchildren in our country--and we do. This is a moral obligation. It is \nall about priorities. It is always about priorities. It is always about \nour values and priorities. If we make the right choices, we can make \nsure every child has the health care they need.\n  Then they have also said that every person in this country ought to \nhave the same ability to buy into the Federal employee health care \nsystem as we do. In our country we have the employer, meaning taxpayers \nor American citizens, who have less health care than the employees--us \nor other Federal employees. They want to change that. They can do that \nthrough an umbrella, allow people to buy in, businesses to buy in. They \ncan choose either traditional programs or HMOs, but they would have the \nbenefit of sharing administrative costs and bulk purchasing and sharing \nother efficiencies to bring costs down.\n  They have a number of very specific proposals that will allow greater \naccess, that will allow costs to come down, and will directly tackle \nthe stranglehold that has been occurring in this country, where a few \nspecial interests have been able to stop this body and this \nadministration and others from making choices about what is best for \nAmerican families.\n\n[[Page S10553]]\n\n  We know there are folks who benefit by the current system. The \npharmaceutical industry and insurance industry do well. They control \nwhat the price will be, what the access will be, and they don't want to \nchange. They and their spokespeople will come forward and scare people, \nthat somehow to do any change at all means some big, bureaucratic, top-\ndown government system and socialized medicine, and they use all these \nother words, but it is used to scare people and to stop us from moving \ntogether and doing what needs to be done.\n  We need to be working together, partnering with business, with \ncommunities, with local governments and State and Federal Government to \ncreate a system where we make better decisions, provide health care to \npeople on the front end rather than when they are very sick and walking \ninto an emergency room, and bringing prices down by designing a system \nthat works for us.\n\n  There is no doubt in my mind that we are capable of doing that. If we \nhave the will, the political will and the right leadership in this \ncountry, there is no question that we cannot sit down, figure out a \nsystem that provides and maintains the best of what is great about \nAmerican medicine and American health care, and also create some new \nopportunities to benefit from what is the best and yet create a better \nsystem for everyone.\n  We can do that. But first we have to have the right leadership, which \nis why I am supporting John Kerry and John Edwards. They understand. \nSenator Kerry has said his first initiative to come forward to the \nCongress as President of the United States will be on health care. My \nbiggest concern since coming here, related to health care, has been \nthere is not the sense of urgency we need to sit down and get this \ndone. We need the political will to stand up to folks, the special \ninterests with a lot of money who benefit from the way the system is \ntoday. We need to have the courage and the leadership to be able to \ndesign a system and tackle this in a way that makes sense for people.\n  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this can be done. There \nis also absolutely no doubt in my mind that it must be done. If our \nbusinesses are going to survive in a global economy, if our families \nare going to survive, in terms of providing health care for their \nchildren and moms and dads and grandpas and grandmas, if we are going \nto survive in terms of older care and care for the disabled in this \ncountry, if we are going to continue to have the quality of life \nAmericans need and deserve, we have to tackle the health care issue and \nhave more than just slogans and scare tactics for people.\n  We have to do better than the last 4 years. Real household income is \ndown. Family health care premiums are up. This is the wrong direction. \nWe can do better and with a change in administrations, working together \nin a bipartisan way, we will do better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/06/senate-section/article/S10553-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, I wish to announce that in accordance with \nTitle V of the Rules of Procedure of the Senate Committee on Rules and \nAdministration, the Committee has updated the Senate Public \nTransportation Subsidy regulations effective October 1, 2004.\n  Based on the Committee's review of the 1992 regulations which \nauthorize the issuance of tax free ``de minimis fringe benefit'': \ntransit fare media, and a review of the Transportation Equity Act for \nthe 21st Century (P.L. 105-78), the Committee has concluded that its \nregulations should be updated to reflect statutory changes in the \ndollar amount allowed to be issued as a ``de minimis fringe benefit.'' \nIn addition, the Committee has streamlined the process for office \nparticipation in this program.\n\n               Public Transportation Subsidy Regulations\n\n     Sec. 1. Policy\n       It is the policy of the Senate to encourage employees to \n     use public mass transportation in commuting to and from \n     Senate offices.\n     Sec. 2. Authority\n       The Tax Reform Act of 1986, as amended by the \n     Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (P.L. 105-78) \n     allows employers to give employees as a tax free ``de minimis \n     fringe benefit'' transit fare media of a value not exceeding \n     $100 per month. The Fiscal Year 1991 Treasury-Postal \n     Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 101-509) allows Federal agencies \n     to participate in state or local government transit programs \n     that encourage employees to use public transportation.\n     Sec. 3.

For purposes of these regulations, an employee in \n     the Office of the President pro tempore, Deputy President pro \n     tempore, Majority Leader, Minority Leader, Majority Whip, \n     Minority Whip, Secretary of the Conference of the Majority, \n     or Secretary of the Conference of the Minority shall be \n     considered to be an employee, whose appointing authority is \n     the Senator holding such position.\n       (d) Qualified Employee--An individual employed in a Senate \n     office whose salary is disbursed by the Secretary of the \n     Senate, whose salary is within the limit set by his or her \n     appointing authority for participation in a transit program \n     under these regulations, and who is not a member of a car \n     pool or the holder of any Senate parking privilege.\n       (e) Qualified program refers to the program of a public \n     mass transportation system that encourages employees to use \n     public transportation in accordance with the requirements of \n     Pub. L. 101-509 whose participation in the Senate program in \n     accordance with these regulations has been approved by the \n     Committee on Rules and Administration.\n     Sec. 4. Program requirements\n       (a) Each office within the Senate is authorized to provide \n     to qualified employees under its supervision a de minimis \n     fringe employment benefit of transit fare media of a value \n     not to exceed the amount authorized by statute currently not \n     to exceed $100 per month.\n       (b) Each appointing authority may establish a salary limit \n     for participation in this program by his or her employees. If \n     such salary limit is established, all staff paid at or below \n     that limit, and who meet the other criteria established in \n     these regulations, must be permitted to participate in this \n     program.\n       (c) For purposes of these regulations, an individual \n     employed for a partial month in an office shall be considered \n     employed for the full month in that office.\n       (d) The fare media purchased by participating offices under \n     this program shall only be used by qualified employees for \n     travel to and from their official duty station.\n       (e) Any fare media purchased under this program may not be \n     sold or exchanged although exchanges of Metro Card Media for \n     transportation on the Virginia Railway Express (VRE) or the \n     Maryland Transit Administration's MARC trains are \n     permissible.\n       (f) In addition to any criminal liability, any person \n     misusing, selling, exchanging or obtaining or using a fare \n     media in violation of these regulations shall be required to \n     reimburse the office for the full amount of the fare media \n     involved and may be disqualified from further participation \n     in this program.\n     Sec. 5. Office administration of program\n       Each office electing to participate in this program shall \n     be responsible for its administration in accordance with \n     these regulations, shall designate an individual to manage \n     its program, and may adopt rules for its participation \n     consistent with these regulations.\n       An employee who wishes to participate in this program shall \n     make application with his or her office on a form which shall \n     include a\n\n[[Page S10554]]\n\n     certification that such person is not a member of a motor \n     pool, does not have any Senate parking privilege (or has \n     relinquished same as a condition of participation), will \n     use the fare media personally for traveling to and from \n     his or her duty station, and will not exchange or sell the \n     fare media provided under this program. The application \n     shall include the following statement:\n       This certification concerns a matter within the \n     jurisdiction of an agency of the United States and making a \n     false, fictitious, or fraudulent certification may render the \n     maker subject to criminal prosecution under 18 \n     U.S.C.Sec. 1001.\n       Safekeeping and distribution of fare media purchased for an \n     office is the responsibility of the program manager in that \n     office. Participating offices may not refund or replace any \n     damaged, misplaced, lost, or stolen fare media.\n     Sec. 6. Senate stationery room responsibilities\n       The only program currently available in the Washington, DC \n     metropolitan area at this time is ``Metro Pool,'' a program \n     established through Metro by the District of Columbia. \n     Transit benefits will be provided through Metro Pool for \n     participating offices in the Washington, D. C. area. The \n     Committee on Rules and Administration shall enter into an \n     agreement with Metro Pool for purchase of fare media by the \n     Senate Stationery Room as required by participating offices \n     on a monthly basis.\n       A participating office shall purchase the fare media with \n     its authorized appropriated funds from the Senate Stationery \n     Room through its stationery account pursuant to 2 \n     U.S.C.Sec. 119.\n       Each office shall present to the Senate Stationery Room \n     [two copies of] the certification referred to in section 7 of \n     these regulations. A new certification shall be submitted \n     when an employer is added to or deleted from the program. The \n     Stationery Room shall make available to the Senate Rules \n     Committee Audit Section a monthly summary of office \n     participation in this program. In addition, the Stationery \n     Room may not refund or replace any damaged, misplaced, lost, \n     or stolen fare media that has been purchased through the \n     office's stationery account.\n     Sec. 7. Certification\n       The certification required by section 6 shall be approved \n     by the appointing authority and shall include the name, and \n     social security number of each participating employee within \n     that office, and the following statements:\n       (a) Each person included on the list is currently a \n     qualified employee as defined in Section 3.\n       (b) No person included on the list has any current Senate \n     parking privilege and that no parking privileges will be \n     restored to any person on the list during the period for \n     which the fare media is purchased.\n       (c) That each month's fare media for each participating \n     employee does not exceed the maximum dollar amount specified \n     in statute (currently $100).\n     Sec. 8. Other participating programs\n       Section 6 provides for procedures for participation by \n     Washington offices in the Metro Pool program established \n     through Metro by the District of Columbia. Additional \n     programs in the Washington, D. C. metropolitan area, or \n     programs offered in other locations where Members have \n     offices that meet the requirements of the law and these \n     regulations, may be used for qualified employees, subject \n     to the following requirements:\n       (A) Authorization--The public transit system shall submit \n     information to the Committee on Rules and Administration that \n     it participates in an established state or local government \n     program to encourage the use of public transportation for \n     employees in accordance with the provisions of Pub. L. 101-\n     509 and these regulations. If the program meets the \n     requirements of the statute and these regulations and is \n     approved by the Committee on Rules and Administration, any \n     Senate office served by such transit system may provide \n     benefits to its employees pursuant to these regulations.\n       (B) Procedures--\n       (1) A qualified program operating in the Washington, D.C. \n     metropolitan area that permits purchase arrangements similar \n     to those provided by the Metro Pool program shall participate \n     in the Senate program in accordance with the procedures set \n     forth in Section 6.\n       (2) A qualified program operating in the Washington, D. C. \n     metropolitan area that does not have purchase arrangements \n     similar to Metro Pool, or a qualified program located outside \n     that metropolitan area, that permits purchases directly by an \n     office, may make arrangements for purchase of media directly \n     with a participating office. Such an office may provide for \n     direct payment to that system and shall submit the \n     certification in accordance with Section 7.\n       (3) In the case of a qualified program that does not permit \n     purchase arrangements as provided in paragraphs (1) or (2) \n     above, an office may provide for reimbursement to a qualified \n     employee and shall submit a certification in accordance with \n     Section 7.\n       (C) Documentation--The following documentation must \n     accompany a voucher submitted under paragraph 8(B)(2) or (3):\n       (1) A copy of the Rules Committee approval, in accordance \n     with section 8(A), with the first voucher submitted for that \n     transit program, provided subsequent vouchers identify the \n     transit program.\n       (2) The certification.\n       (3) Proof of purchase of the fare media.\n       (D) Voucher Guidance--In the case of a Senator's state \n     office, reimbursement for payment to either a qualified \n     transit system, or a qualified employee shall be from the \n     Senators' Official Personnel and Office Expense Account (SOP& \n     OEA) as a home state office expense on a seven part voucher. \n     In the Washington, DC metropolitan area, reimbursement for \n     payment to either a qualified transit system, or a qualified \n     employee shall be as follows:\n       (1) in the case of a Senator's office from the SOP & OEA as \n     an ``other official expense'' (discretionary expense).\n       (2) in the case of a Senate committee or administrative \n     office as an ``Other'' expense.\n     Sec. 9. Special circumstances\n       Any circumstances not covered under these regulations shall \n     be considered on application to the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration.\n     Sec. 10. Effective date\n       These regulations shall take effect on the first day of the \n     month following date of approval.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/06/senate-section/article/S10554-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10554-S10555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  Lance Corporal Michael Allred, USMC\n\n                  Lance Corporal Quinn A.

Mr. President, in the Bush economy, minimum wage workers \nare falling farther and farther behind. But every time Democrats in \nCongress have tried to raise the minimum wage, the Republican \nleadership has refused even to allow a vote on it. Three times in the \n108th Congress, the Republican leadership has brought down a bill \nrather than allow an up-or-down vote on the minimum wage first on the \nState Department bill, then on the welfare bill, and, finally, on the \nclass action bill.\n  Now, 562 prominent economists including four Nobel Prize winners in \neconomics and seven past presidents of the American Economic \nAssociation have endorsed the increase to $7 an hour. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of their letter be printed in the Record, following \nmy statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In today's economy, corporate profits are surging, but \nworkers' wages are stagnant. Minimum wage workers are hardest hit, \nbecause they haven't had an increase in the minimum wage for 7 long \nyears. That is why so many of us continue to fight for the Fair Minimum \nWage Act, which will raise the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7 in three \nmoderate steps to $5.85 60 days after enactment; $6.45 1-year later; to \n$7 1-year after that.\n  It is long past time for Congress to approve an increase in the \nminimum wage. No one who works for a living should have to live in \npoverty.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                         IT'S TIME FOR A Raise\n\n         Hundreds of economists support a minimum wage increase\n\n       The minimum wage has been an important part of our nation's \n     economy for 65 years. It is based on the principle of valuing \n     work by establishing an hourly wage floor beneath which \n     employers cannot pay their workers. In so doing, the minimum \n     wage helps to equalize the imbalance in bargaining power that \n     low-wage workers face in the labor market. The minimum wage \n     is also an important tool in fighting poverty.\n       The value of the 1997 increase in the federal minimum wage \n     has been fully eroded. The real value of today's federal \n     minimum wage is less than it has been in 46 out of the last \n     48 years. Moreover, the ratio of the minimum wage to the \n     average hourly wage of non-supervisory workers is 33%, its \n     lowest level in 55 years. This decline is causing hardship \n     for low-wage workers and their families.\n       We believe that a modest increase in the minimum wage would \n     improve the well-being of low-wage workers and would not have \n     the adverse effects that critics have claimed. In particular, \n     we share the view the Council of Economic Advisers expressed \n     in the 1999 Economic Report of the President that ``the \n     weight of the evidence suggests that modest increases in the \n     minimum wage have had very little or no effect on \n     employment.'' While controversy about the precise employment \n     effects of the minimum wage continues, research has shown \n     that most of the beneficiaries are adults, most are female, \n     and the vast majority are members of low-income working \n     families.\n       As economists who are concerned about the problems facing \n     low-wage workers, we believe the Fair Minimum Wage Act of \n     2004's proposed phased-in increase in the federal minimum \n     wage to $7.00 falls well within the range of options where \n     the benefits to the labor market, workers, and the overall \n     economy would be positive.\n       Twelve states and the District of Columbia have set their \n     minimum wages above the federal level. Additional states, \n     including Florida, Nevada, and New York, are considering \n     similar measures. As with a federal increase, modest \n     increases in state minimum wages in the range of $1.00 to \n     $2.00 can significantly improve the lives of low-income \n     workers and their families, without the adverse effects that \n     critics have claimed.\n       Henry Aaron, The Brookings Institution; Rebecca Blank, \n     University of Michigan; Ronald G.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my appreciation \nfor the outstanding service of Brian Green to me and to my fellow \nmembers on the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  Brian Green has been a professional staff member and staff lead for \nthe Strategic Forces Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee for over 3 years. As the chairman of the Strategic Forces \nSubcommittee for much of that time, I have had the opportunity to \nclosely observe Brian. I can honestly tell you that Brian is an \nexceptional staffer and a tremendous human being.\n  As the staff lead for the subcommittee, Brian has helped me and the \nother members of subcommittee fulfill our responsibilities pertaining \nto the oversight of Department of Defense strategic, ballistic missile \ndefense, and military space programs. His expertise and recommendations \nhave proved critical time and time again during the Senate Armed \nServices Committee consideration of the annual defense authorization \nbill.\n  I can personally attest to numerous occasions when Brian provided the \nneed information and proposals that made the difference in achieving \nthe subcommittee's objectives. I cannot stress enough how much of a \nrelief it was to know that Brian was always available to advance the \nsubcommittee's policy goals and on guard to protect the subcommittee's \ninterests.\n  During his time in the Senate, Brian also helped promote and protect \nour Nation's effort to develop and deploy a ballistic missile defense \nsystem. He played a lead role in coordinating the opposition to \nproposed budget cuts to the program. Brian's ability to work with \nmultiple offices, the National Security Council, and the White House \nwas pivotal in the debate and eventually led to the restoration of \nfunding.\n  Brian came to the to the Senate after serving 4 years as a \nprofessional staff member on the House Armed Services Committee. While \nin the House, Brian played a crucial role in developing the House-\nversion of the National Missile Defense Act of 1999 and the creation of \nthe National Nuclear Security Administration in the Department of \nEnergy.\n  It is not just his achievements that cause Brian to stand out. He has \nbeen utterly committed to his job. Brian works until the job is \ncompleted and completed well. He has an innate ability to find \nsolutions to difficult problems, including those that might have \nconsiderable political implications. Perhaps most significantly, Brian \nis a team player and approaches his job without pretense. Members and \nstaff alike have always appreciated Brian's willingness to work with \nthem on even the most minute policy or budget issue.\n  It is disappointing to lose Brian to the private sector. We will miss \nhis diligence, his integrity and his expertise. At the same time, I am \ngrateful that Brian was able to serve the Senate for so long and so \nfaithfully. I congratulate Brian on his new position and wish him the \nbest in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/06/senate-section/article/S10560-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CERTIFIED REGISTERED NURSE ANESTHETISTS\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I commend military certified registered \nnurse anesthetists, CRNAs. CRNAs are advanced practice nurses who \nadminister anesthesia. Today, CRNAs administer approximately 65 percent \nof the anesthetics given to patients each year for all types of \nsurgical cases in the United States.\n  Nurse anesthetists have been the principal anesthesia providers in \ncombat areas in every war in which the United States has been engaged \nsince World War I. In World War II, there were 17 nurse anesthetists to \nevery 1 physician anesthetist. In Vietnam, the ratio of CRNAs to \nphysician anesthetists was approximately 3 to 1. During the Panama \nstrike authorized in 1989, only CRNAs were sent with the fighting \nforces. In addition, the vast majority of anesthesia providers deployed \nfor Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom has been \nCRNAs. Nurse anesthetists are again carrying the load by providing 80 \npercent of the anesthesia requirements in Iraq and Afghanistan. We rely \nheavily on CRNAs to accomplish wartime missions and our need for their \nservices will only increase in the future.\n  In all of the uniformed services, maintaining adequate numbers of \nActive Duty and Reserve CRNAs is of utmost concern. For several years, \nthe number of CRNAs serving on active duty has fallen somewhat short of \nthe number authorized by the Department of Defense. This lag in \nrecruitment has been further exacerbated by a strong demand for CRNAs \nin both the public and private sectors. One reason the military has \ndifficulty retaining CRNAs is that a large pay gap exists between \nannual civilian salaries and military pay.\n  I am deeply concerned about retention of these CRNAs, particularly in \nthe Army Nurse Corps. It has come to my attention that within the next \n3 years, the Army Nurse Corps could lose up to 50 percent of its \ncurrent complement of CRNAs. A recent survey of Army CRNAs revealed \nthat despite overall satisfaction with their anesthesia practice, \ndissatisfaction with pay and frequent deployments are the primary \nreasons for leaving active duty.\n  One strategy that is proving effective in increasing overall \nsatisfaction is the Army Surgeon General's 180-day rotation policy. I \nurge continuation of this policy. However, this is not enough to ensure \nthat we meet our mission. I am quite certain that another remedy to \nprevent further losses would be an across-the-board increase in \nincentive speciality pay for all CRNAs, regardless of Active-Duty \nservice obligation. I trust that the Department of Defense is also \nconcerned and actively pursuing measures to address this very important \nissue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/06/senate-section/article/S10560-3", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10560-S10561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PARDONING ``JACK'' JOHNSON\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President. I rise to express my support for S. \nRes. 447, which asks the President to pardon posthumously John Arthur \n\"Jack\" Johnson for Mr. Johnson's racially-motivated 1913 conviction.\n  As a huge fan of the sport of boxing, I admire the great achievements \nof Mr. Johnson in his too short career. But I feel a greater need to \nrecognize and pardon Mr. Johnson for the great injustice he suffered. \nAlthough it is too late to properly rectify what was done to Jack \nJohnson, I hope in some small way we can call attention to his \nremarkable achievements and repair his good name.\n  Jack Johnson was the first African-American boxer to win the \nheavyweight title. While this was a landmark achievement for African-\nAmericans, Johnson's achievements unfortunately had the effect of \nescalating racial tensions and his subsequent victories provoked racial \nrioting. The effort to dethrone him brought about the search for the \n\"Great White Hope\" during his 1908-1915 reign as heavyweight champion.\n  The consensus is that while Johnson was not defeated in the boxing \nring he could be stopped by trumped-up criminal charges. In 1913, \nJohnson was found guilty of violating the \"white-slavery\" Mann Act for \ntaking his future wife\n\n[[Page S10561]]\n\nout of State. Johnson was convicted and he tried to appeal his \nsentence. Before the ruling on his appeal, Johnson fled the country and \nwas a fugitive for 7 years before he returned to the United States in \n1920. Johnson turned himself over to Federal authorities and served 10 \nmonths in Ft. Leavenworth, KS.\n  Mr. Johnson went on to continue fighting but never returned to the \nsame glory. He was killed in a car accident in 1946 at the age of 68. \nEight years later, he became a charter member of the Boxing Hall of \nFame.\n  I am hopeful that the President will accept this petition and issue a \nposthumous Presidential pardon for Jack Johnson. Mr. Johnson defied the \nracist standards of his day to become a world champion. He was a hero \nand example to a greatly oppressed people who had too few public heroes \nto look to emulate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/06/senate-section/article/S10561-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           KINSHIP CAREGIVERS\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the important \nwork of kinship caregivers across the Nation and to commend the \nEdgewood Center for Children and Families in San Francisco, CA, for its \nlong-spanning commitment to caring for children.\n  Kinship caregivers are making a real difference in the lives of \nchildren all across our country. According to the Census, more than 6 \nmillion children--1 in 12--live in households headed by grandparents or \nother relatives. Similarly, a study conducted by the American \nAssociation of Retired Persons found that the number of children living \nin grandparent-headed households increased by 30 percent between 1990 \nand 2000. Unfortunately, while grandparents and other relatives have \nstepped forward to provide safe and loving homes for the children in \ntheir care, they also often face great difficulties in achieving \nemotional and financial stability.\n  With millions of children still in need of loving, permanent homes \nand countless grandparents and relatives willing to raise these \nchildren who need our support, there is more work to be done. The \nEdgewood Center for Children and Families is the oldest children's \ncharity in the western United States serving children and families that \nprovides a national model for keeping families intact. Edgewood \nCenter's Kinship Support Network is the first program in the nation to \nprovide comprehensive, private-sector support services to relative \ncaregiver families. This program uses mentoring, support groups, and \ntraining to prepare grandparents and relatives for parenting, while \nproviding tutoring, independent living skills, and mental health care \nfor adopted children. Last year, as many as 95.5 percent of the \nchildren in Edgewood's program either remained with their kinship \nfamilies or were reunited with their parents, and less than 2 percent \nhad to be moved into foster care. This is an enormous success \nconsidering that only 78 percent of Kinship families remained stable in \nthe years prior to the inception of Edgewood's programs.\n  In July, I introduced the Kinship Caregiver Support Act, S. 2706, to \nestablish community ``kinship navigator'' programs with services \nsimilar to the Edgewood's Kinship Support Networks. My legislation \nwould also help ease the financial burden of kinship caregivers so that \nthese families receive the financial support they need. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues in the Senate to ensure passage of the \nKinship Caregiver Support Act so that we help strengthen kinship \nfamilies all across America.\n  Again, I commend the Edgewood Center for Children and Families for \nits tradition of excellence in providing services to kinship caregivers \nand extend my best wishes for continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/06/senate-section/article/S10561-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10561-S10563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING FAVORITE TEACHERS\n\n  Mr. DAYTON.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the Childcare \nMeans Parents in Schools Act. I am pleased to join Senator Dodd and \nSenator Snowe as a cosponsor of the measure. This bill would amend the \nCCAMPIS Program authorized under Higher Education Act to better \nfacilitate the higher education of those students with children.\n  For college students who are parents, a safe, nurturing environment \nfor one's children is integral to degree attainment. Nearly 40 percent \nof students at higher education institutions are over 25 years old and \nalmost 30 percent of undergraduates have children. Most American \nfamilies utilize childcare: 75 percent of children under 5 are in some \ntype of childcare. And for most families, childcare is the second \nlargest expense in their budget after rent or mortgage.\n  The Dodd-Snowe bill will modify the definition of ``low income \nstudent'' to extend childcare services to graduate students, \ninternational students and other students who would not qualify under \nthe present language but may need childcare assistance. This bill also \nincreases the program authorization to a level that could fund about \none-quarter of the 4,000 colleges and universities eligible to apply. \nThe amount of the minimum grant would be raised in order to make the \ngrant process more cost-effective for applying institutions.\n  Good childcare is often recognized as a first step to school success. \nIt also can be an essential part of the process of being a good \nstudent. The peace of mind afforded by the security of knowing one's \nchild is well cared for frees higher education students to pursue their \nown studies with a more focused determination. Without that foundation, \na college education may not be attained.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill and further extend the \nopportunity of higher education to parents across America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/06/senate-section/article/S10563-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10563-S10564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SATELLITE HOME VIEWER ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the other body just \npassed their version of the Satellite Home Viewer Act under suspension \nof the rules. H.R. 4518, the W.J. (Billy) Tauzin Satellite Television \nAct of 2004, is a strong bill.\n  During this process, I have heard from many Vermonters who are \nconcerned about not being able to receive Vermont stations over \nsatellite. Others have been concerned about possibly having their \nability to receive certain stations terminated. One reason for these \nstrong concerns is that Vermont has the highest percentage in the \nNation of TV owners who receive programming using satellite dishes. One \nreason for this is our beautiful mountains and valleys which make it \nmore difficult to receive TV signals using regular antennas.\n  The Hatch-Leahy Satellite Homer Viewer Extension Act of 2004 was \napproved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in June. All the members of \nthe Judiciary Committee supported that bill.\n  In the other body, members of both the Judiciary Committee and the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee worked together in a bipartisan fashion \nto craft a comprehensive bill which will be good for consumers and for \nthe affected industries. That bill, if enacted, will be a boon to \npublic television, the satellite industry, the movie, music and \ntelevision industries, and to satellite dish owners throughout America.\n  I am especially pleased that it contains a provision which I worked \non with my colleagues from New Hampshire, Senator Sununu and Senator \nGregg. We, along with Senator Jeffords, introduced legislation to \nensure that satellite dish owners in every county in each of our States \nwould be able to receive signals, via satellite, from our respective \nin-State television stations. While our two States represent a small \ntelevision market as compared to some of the major population markets, \nnonetheless this provision is very important to residents in six of our \ncollective counties--two in Vermont and four counties in New Hampshire. \nThe Senate bill, S. 2013, as reported in June by the Judiciary \nCommittee also contained this provision just included in H.R. 4518.\n  In Vermont this will mean that satellite dish owners in Bennington \nand Windham Counties will be able to receive all Vermont network \nstations in addition to the out-of-State network stations they now \nreceive.\n  It is very important that in the waning days of this Congress that \nthe Senate enact this satellite legislation. In 1998 and 1999 over 2 \nmillion families were faced with the prospect of losing the ability to \nreceive one or more of their satellite television network stations. \nBack then, Congress acted and not only protected access to those \nstations but also expanded consumer opportunities to receive more \nprogramming options.\n  Families who own satellite dishes may end up being the big losers if \nprovisions of that act are not extended. Many Midwestern and Rocky \nMountain States have vast areas where satellite dish owners receive \nimported network stations such as ABC, NBC, CBS or Fox. Thousands of \nthese families do not have any other choices. They do not have access \nto TV stations over-the-air because of mountain terrain or distance \nfrom the broadcast towers. They do not have access to cable because of \nthe rough terrain or the lack of population density which makes it \neconomically impossible for cable companies to invest. Without access \nto network stations via satellite, over-the-air, or cable, those \nfamilies will no longer be able to receive national news programming or \nother network TV programming.\n  If Congress does not reauthorize provisions of current law by \nDecember 31, 2004, hundreds of thousands of households will lose \nsatellite access to network TV stations. Since information about \nsubscribers is proprietary it is difficult for me to tell you exactly \nhow many families will be affected by this, but I assure you it is not \na small number.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee got its job done in June. We reported \na great bill out of committee without a single amendment and without a \nsingle nay vote. That bill was introduced on January 21, 2004, by \nChairman Hatch and was cosponsored by myself and Senators DeWine and \nKohl. When the bill was reported out of committee on June 17, 2004, I \nnoted that the bill does far more than just protect satellite dish \nowners from losing signals. I pointed out that the new satellite bill \n``protects subscribers in every state, expands viewing choices for most \ndish owners, promotes access to local programming, and increases \ndirect, head-to-head, competition between cable and satellite \nproviders.''\n  I continued by saying that ``easily, this bill will benefit 21 \nmillion satellite television dish owners throughout the nation, and I \nam happy to note that over 85,000 of those subscribers are in \nVermont.''\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee-reported bill, and the recently passed \nbill H.R. 4518, go far beyond protecting what current subscribers \nreceive. The bills allow additional programming via satellite through \nadoption of the so-called ``significantly viewed'' test now used for \ncable, but not satellite subscribers. That test means that, in general, \nif a person in a cable service area that historically received over-\nthe-air TV reception from ``nearby'' stations outside that area, those \ncable operators could offer those station signals in\n\n[[Page S10564]]\n\nthat person's cable service area. In other words, if you were in an \narea in which most families in the past had received TV signals using a \nregular rooftop antenna then you could be offered that same signal TV \nvia cable. By having similar rules, satellite carriers will be able to \ndirectly compete with cable providers who already operate under the \nsignificantly viewed test. This gives home dish owners more choices of \nprogramming.\n  In the past, Congress got the job done. Congress worked well together \nin 1998 and 1999 when we developed a major satellite law that \ntransformed the industry by allowing local television stations to be \ncarried by satellite and beamed back down to the local communities \nserved by those stations. This marked the first time that thousands of \nTV owners were able to get the full complement of local network \nstations. In 1997 we found a way to avoid cutoffs of satellite TV \nservice to millions of homes and to protect the local affiliate \nbroadcast system. The following year we forged an alliance behind a \nstrong satellite bill to permit local stations to be offered by \nsatellite, thus increasing competition between cable and satellite \nproviders.\n  We also worked with the Public Broadcasting System so they could \noffer a national feed as they transitioned to having their local \nprogramming beamed up to satellites and then beamed back down to much \nlarger audiences.\n  Because of those efforts, in Vermont and most other States, dish \nowners are able to watch their local stations instead of getting \nsignals from distant stations. Such a service allows television \nwatchers to be more easily connected to their communities as well as \nproviding access to necessary emergency signals, news and broadcasts.\n  I hope we are able to work together to finish this important \nsatellite television bill in the few remaining days of this Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/06/senate-section/article/S10564-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nconference report accompanying those appropriations bills which, \nbecause of our pending adjournment, have been included as an omnibus \npackage.\n  I intend to vote for this omnibus bill knowing full well that, like \nall bills, it is not perfect in every Senator's eyes.\n  I want to thank Chairman Stevens and Ranking Member Senator Byrd as \nwell as the chairman and ranking members of the Subcommittees for \nincluding my requests which are vital to Colorado. As America's third \nfastest growing State, our burgeoning population has placed great \nstress on our schools, hospitals, universities and transportation. \nFederal monies, which I have sought to earmark as an appropriation for \nColorado, are extremely important.\n  In this omnibus conference report over $175 million will be flowing \ninto Colorado.\n  Having said this, there is one section in the bill that concerns me. \nPartially because it affects my State, but more so because it was never \nconsidered in the committee of jurisdiction. Neither was it discussed \nin the conference committee on Wednesday, November 19 as we worked out \nthe final House and Senate disagreements.\n  I did not know of the language as the bill came to the floor just \nbefore we adjourned for the year. In fact, in a multi-hundred page bill \nI was not aware of it until after it passed. But, as I understand it, \nthis language is in keeping with a long standing practice of satisfying \nNative American land claims.\n  Let me give some historical perspective to this issue as I understand \nit. In 1971, the U.S. Congress passed a bill which was signed into law \ncalled the ``Native American Claims Settlement Act''. This was an \neffort to bring a degree of fairness to native tribes of America's \nnewest State--Alaska--who had lost much of the use of their aboriginal \nland through the encroachment and settlement of non-natives.\n  As part of the settlement, the native peoples were given use of 44 \nmillion acres and a percentage of the royalties from oil and gas \nproduction thereon. They shared these royalties with State government \nand for the purposes of administering their tribal governments and \nrevenues. Alaska natives and tribes became shareholders of Native \nAlaskan corporations. They also retained the same rights that tribes in \nthe lower 48 States and as they pertained to the ``trust \nresponsibility'' of the Federal Government.\n  As I understand the 1971 act, however, these tribal corporations \naround the city of Anchorage were not considered land based tribes and \nwere treated differently in terms of rights and benefits they would \nhave accrued had they been in control of aboriginal land. These native \ngroups (corporations) were allowed to use their portion of the \naccumulated revenue, in the form of ``bidding credits'', to purchase \neither Federal or private land in Alaska or other States. I only know \nof four States where land was actually purchased. Alaska, California, \nHawaii and Colorado are the four I am aware of, although there may have \nbeen others. I have never been able to find a comprehensive list of \nland purchased, if it even exists.\n  The Native Alaskan corporations were authorized in the 1971 act to \n``partner'' with tribes in the lower 48 on business ventures. So, in \neffect, the lower 48 tribes became recipients of badly needed \ninvestment capital provided by the Native Alaskan corporations while \ntheir ``partner'' could petition the Federal Government to put the land \ninto trust status.\n  One such purchase was in downtown Denver. It had been a piece of \nFederal land, adjacent to the Federal courthouse and was being used as \na parking lot for court employees. That lot was not put into trust, but \nwas owned by the Native Alaskan Corporation.\n  There were, at the time, some preliminary discussions between one of \nthe Colorado land based Ute Indian tribes and one Native Alaskan \ncorporation on how best to use this ``native'' land for economic \ndevelopment purposes.\n  These purposes were limited by a variety of other laws such as the \n1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which did not allow tribes to have \ncasino gaming unless they reached a negotiated agreement called a \n``gaming compact'' with the State in which they were located. In turn, \ncourt decisions further complicated the picture. An example of this was \nin the Seminole vs. the State of Florida case. In 1996, the Supreme \nCourt ruled that States cannot be ``forced'' to negotiate a compact \nwith tribes as required by the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.\n  At the time, I voided the discussions concerning the downtown piece \nof property about which I have spoken by implementing a suggestion from \nthe Federal courts to submit a line item request to appropriate funds \nto purchase that parking lot back from the Native Alaska corporation. I \ndid so and through subsequent appropriations secured the money to build \na new Byron White Federal Court complex on that site.\n  Since I was not in the U.S. Senate in 1971, I can only give you my \nview of how that act affected this language in question. I don't know \nif it violates any existing statute, if my constituency would support \nor oppose it or if it is in keeping with the Native American Claims \nSettlement Act. This probably could have been flushed out through the \nhearing process had we seen it in bill form.\n  So, in closing Mr. President, because I was not aware of the language \nof this final conference report until about 2 hours ago and do not know \nthe effect it would have on Colorado, I do not support that section. \nSince it is, however, included in a non-amendable conference report \nand, recognizing the importance of the money in this report to the \nState of Colorado, I will vote for the final report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/06/senate-section/article/S10564-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10564-S10565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE YMCA OF GREATER INDIANAPOLIS\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to call to the \nattention of my colleagues a signal anniversary that has occurred in my \nhome State of Indiana, the 150th anniversary of the YMCA of Greater \nIndianapolis.\n  Since 1854, the YMCA of Greater Indianapolis has been committed not \nonly to providing Hoosiers with an outlet\n\n[[Page S10565]]\n\nfor social, mental, and physical development, but also has maintained a \nconsistent adherence to community service. As one of the first 50 YMCAs \nchartered in North America, this institution, whose humble beginnings \noriginated in the basement of the Second Presbyterian Church on \nMonument Circle, has grown to tremendous proportions. Currently serving \nmore than 140,000 Hoosiers, the YMCA of Greater Indianapolis has \npartnered with over 120 churches, schools and other community groups to \nreach out to both the urban community along with the surrounding \ncounties. In 2003, 4,688 volunteers, under the direction of the YMCA of \nGreater Indianapolis, donated their valuable time and energy to provide \nnearly 98,000 hours of service. Additionally, YMCA branches in \nIndianapolis presented almost $4 million for scholarships, program \nsubsidies and varied community services.\n  I am pleased to take a moment to acknowledge the outstanding efforts \nthe YMCA of Greater Indianapolis has afforded for the past century and \na half, and I look forward to their future leadership in building \nstronger families and a stronger community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/06/senate-section/article/S10565-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RETIREMENT OF GENERAL ED EBERHART\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I would like to praise a man \nwho for more than 36 years has served his country with honor and \ndistinction. General Ralph E. Eberhart, or Ed his friends call him, \nwill soon be retiring from the United States Air Force. He embodies \nthat which we most value in our military leaders--visionary leadership, \nunwavering dedication, and mission accomplishment.\n  I would like to personally thank General Eberhart for his service to \nour great Nation. Not only do I remember our many discussions \npertaining to national security, but I fondly recall sharing stories \nabout Colorado. You see, General Eberhart started his long journey at \nthe Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. As fate would have it, he \nwill soon be finishing his career where he started--in the great state \nof Colorado.\n  In the Spring of 1968, Ed Eberhart was sworn in as a Second \nLieutenant in the United States Air Force. Since that day, General \nEberhart has successfully mastered nine aircraft and totaled more than \n5,000 flying hours in the cockpit. His service spanned tours of duty in \nVietnam, Germany, Japan, and perhaps the toughest, at the Pentagon. \nGeneral Eberhart's career was highlighted with numerous awards and \ndecorations, and he has successfully attained four stars in the United \nStates Air Force. In every job that the General has held, he has \nsuccessfully fulfilled his obligations and made the advancements only a \nselect few of his peers have made.\n  In February 2000, General Eberhart's success awarded him the honor of \nleading a combatant command for the United States, and he was soon \nconfirmed as a triple-hatted commander. He was given the awesome \nresponsibility of commanding not only the North American Aerospace \nDefense Command, or NORAD, but also U.S. Space Command and Air Force \nSpace Command.\n  During his tenure as Commander of U.S. Space and Air Force Space \nCommand, General Eberhart successfully led military space into a new \nera. The United States relies upon our space superiority and without \nit, we cannot maintain dominance of the battlefield. General Eberhart \nguided our spacelift operations to a 100 percent success rate, thus \nmaintaining our assured access to space. Additionally, when he took \ncommand of U.S. Space Command, the United States had just begun to \nappreciate the value that space-based capabilities bring to the fight--\nespecially after our air campaign in Kosovo. Because of General \nEberhart's direction in the space arena--specifically regarding \nprecision guided weapons--we were able to increase the effectiveness of \nour present capabilities by further integrating space capabilities with \nair, maritime and land assets. U.S. Space Command's contributions were \nlater seen as the hallmarks of Operation Enduring Freedom in \nAfghanistan, which traces directly back to General Eberhart and his \nvision for the full integration of space and terrestrial units.\n\n  The general was also at the focus of our post-September 11 world \nwhile in command of NORAD. In 2001, Operation Noble Eagle saw NORAD go \nfrom having 14 military aircraft on alert around the Nation to more \nthan 100 in a very short period of time. The response was necessary to \nprotect our skies from internal threats that had manifested themselves \nin the most horrible of weapons--airliners filled with unsuspecting \ntravelers. General Eberhart soon saw himself having to support \ncontinuous combat air patrols, including all the supporting logistics \nsuch as tankers and integrating NATO AWACS into that mission.\n  Ultimately, that fateful day of September 11 triggered not only a \nchange in the focus of NORAD missions, but also showed the need for a \nunified command that focused on protecting our homeland. And who did \nthe President of the United States trust to lead this new command? \nGeneral Ed Eberhart. So again, Colorado was fortunate enough to be \ncalled home by General Eberhart as he began the challenge of building \nNorthern Command while continuing to lead NORAD. As the combatant \ncommand charged with the defense of the homeland, Northern Command \nreached full operational capability ahead of schedule. Under General \nEberhart's leadership, we have seen this unified command continue to \nfulfill its duties of protecting the American homeland.\n  It is apparent that while leading these commands, General Ed Eberhart \nexemplified visionary thinking. He tackled transformation in the space \narena by stressing joint integration of space capabilities and then \ntransformed the way the U.S. military defends our borders and supports \ncivilian agencies with Northern Command.\n  I cannot express enough gratitude to General Eberhart for his service \nto our country while in the United States Air Force. We in Colorado \nwere proud to host him as a cadet at the Academy, and continue to be \nproud when he took command in our great State nearly 30 years later. It \nwas in these roles that I was thankfully given the opportunity to know \nEd Eberhart on a personal and professional basis. As General Eberhart \nprepares to fly off into the wild blue yonder of retirement, I would \nagain like to thank him for his 36 years of blood, sweat, and tears to \nour Nation, and I wish him and his wife, Karen, the very best in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/06/senate-section/article/S10565-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10565-S10566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RICHARD D. ``DICK'' LLOYD\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, there is a standing joke among longtime \nAlaskans that visitors who come to Anchorage to view our glittering \nskyline, set off against the grandeur of the Chugach Mountains and the \nplacid beauty of the Cook Inlet, haven't seen the ``real Alaska.''\n  Whether one agrees with this observation or not, all will agree that \none does not have to travel far from Anchorage to experience our unique \nnatural beauty and abundant wildlife. About 45 minutes from downtown \nAnchorage, easily accessible on paved roads, there is an oasis in \nChugach State Park called the ``Eagle River Nature Center.''\n  The Eagle River Nature Center nestled in the Chugach Mountains is \nhome to interpretive programs all year around. It is the starting point \nfor miles of well-groomed hiking trails from which one can view moose \nand occasionally encounter bear. It has been described in terms like \n``glorious, enchanting and captivating.'' A place to view snow covered \nmountains in hues of pink and orange illuminated by the alpenglow \nsunset. It is a place where John Muir and Theodore Roosevelt would feel \nright at home.\n  Born as the Chugach State Park Visitor Center, the facility was in \ndanger of being lost to budget cuts. By 1996, the budget had dwindled \nto a mere $14,000 from $185,000 in 1981. The center needed a savior.\n  Then along came a remarkable individual, Richard D. ``Dick'' Lloyd. \nDick recognized that volunteers can accomplish things that government \nagencies cannot and organized the existing volunteers into a non-profit \norganization to operate the facility. Dick and his wife Carole and Asta \nSpurgis formed the Friends of the Nature Center which took over and \nrevitalized the visitor center and turned it into the world-class \nnature center it is today.\n  I have the sad duty of informing the Senate that Dick Lloyd passed \naway on\n\n[[Page S10566]]\n\nAugust 22, 2004 from pancreatic cancer at the age of 60. Dick's death \nwas not sudden. He learned of his condition just before Christmas of \n2002 when doctors predicted that he would have a few months to live.\n  But Dick didn't view this diagnosis as an excuse to slow down. Much \nto the contrary, he devoted his remaining days to the nature center he \nloved, sledding down the hills adjacent to the center in the winter, \ngiving encouragement to young people maintaining the trails in the \nsummer perched on a lawn chair because he was too weak to offer \nphysical help. Some twenty days before his death he was promoting the \nnature center's hike-a-thon event called the ``Coyote Crawl''. In the \nwords of his beloved wife Carole, ``That was Dick. He was taking care \nof his baby to the end.''\n  As Chief Executive Officer, Executive Director and co-founder of the \nFriends of Eagle River Nature Center, Dick's hard work, vision and \nstamina led the way in transforming the center into a model for public-\nprivate partnership in managing public parklands. Today, through his \ndedication and leadership, it is a centerpiece of Chugach State Park, \nproviding unparalleled educational, economic and outdoor opportunities \non a year-round basis.\n  For local students, it provides hands-on learning experiences with \nclasses on natural sciences and the environment. For the Eagle River \ncommunity, it generates significant economic activity by attracting \ntens of thousands of visitors each year from around the area and around \nthe world. And for those who simply share Dick's love of Alaska's wild \noutdoors, it offers countless camping, hiking and other recreational \nopportunities.\n  Through the legacy of the Eagle River Nature Center, generations to \ncome will share in the legacy of Richard D. Lloyd, a man with the \nvision to have a dream, the courage to pursue it and the strength to \nmake it a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/06/senate-section/article/S10566-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/06/senate-section/article/S10566-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination and a withdrawal which were referred to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/06/senate-section/article/S10566-3", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:30 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills and joint resolution, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 918.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na special resources study to evaluate resources along the coastal \nregion of the State of Delaware and to determine the suitability and \nfeasibility of establishing 1 or more units of the National Park System \nin Delaware, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, a few minutes ago, I was recognized and I \nspoke about the first State. The first State is Delaware. Delaware \nbecame the first State December 7th, 1787, when we ratified the \nConstitution. For 1 week, Delaware was the entire United States of \nAmerica. We opened things up for the rest of the country, and \nPennsylvania came in, New Jersey, and others. For the most part, we are \npleased the way it turned out.\n  It is ironic that the State that helped start this country, the State \nwhose history is part of the fabric of this country's history, has no \nnational park to celebrate our place in the founding of this country \nand the growth of this country over the last 200-some years.\n  A couple of years ago, my family and I were planning a vacation. We \nwere trying to decide where to go. We were thinking about going to \nAlaska. We actually got on the National Park Service Web site to see \nabout the national parks in Alaska. They have terrific national parks. \nWe went up there and had a wonderful visit. Before we did that, we \nlooked at that National Park Service Web site to see what other \nattractions there are in the other 49 States. There is a unit of the \nNational Park Service in 49 States in this country, but we found \nnothing for Delaware.\n  For years gone by and for the immediate future when families like \nours are deciding where they are going to go on their summer vacation \nin 2005 or 2006, they will have the same choices as they had in 2004 \nand the years before this, businesses, one of the most enduring \nbusinesses, large or small, in the United States.\n  There are other attractions. The Underground Railroad literally runs \nthe length and breadth of our State. Many slaves found their freedom \ncrossing the Christina River into northern Delaware not far from where \nthe first Swedes landed just down the river.\n  A second hub would be located in the southern part of New Castle \nCounty along the Delaware River. Not far from where the hub would be is \nFort Delaware. During the Confederate war, tens of thousands of \nConfederate soldiers were held prisoner at Fort Delaware, in the middle \nof the Delaware River. From that hub, Port Penn, along the Delaware \nRiver, will emanate to the spokes that lead to attractions, including \nFort Delaware.\n  A third hub is Kent County, DE. Kent County, DE, is home of the \nGolden Fleece Tavern. On December 7, 1787, a band of several dozen men \ndecided, after studying and debating the Constitution that had been \nsent out from Philadelphia, from the Constitutional Convention, they \ndecided to ratify at the Golden Fleece Tavern on that cold December \nmorning.\n  Not far from that is a place called John Dickinson Mansion. That \nmansion was home of a Delawarean who participated in the Constitutional \nConvention. At that Constitutional Convention, he worked with folks \nfrom Connecticut to develop the compromise that makes it clear that \nevery State gets two Senators today and that all the States have \nrepresentatives in the House of Representatives right down that hall in \ncoordination with the size of the population of that State. That is \njust one of the many and those choices will not include a national park \nin Delaware or a unit of National Park in our State.\n  Senator Biden, a couple of years ago, tried to address this problem. \nFor a while, the idea of creating a national park gave some thought to \ncreating a national park in the Great Cyprus Swamp in the southeast \ncorner. Those familiar with Bethany, Rehoboth, and Lewes may or may not \nknow there is a huge swamp where the last of the bald cyprus in North \nAmerica are. We thought of designating the Great Cyprus Swamp as a \nnational park. The idea ran into some disfavor in southern Delaware and \nwas abandoned.\n  I am delighted Senator Biden has joined in introducing today our \nlegislation to call on the Department of the Interior to conduct a \nfeasibility study to see if what we think is a great idea developed by \nour park committee in Delaware, led by Dr. Jim Soles over the last \nyear, might find favor with the Department of the Interior, the \nCongress, and with the President.\n  The committee has envisioned four wheels, four hubs, starting in the \nnorthern part of our State in Wilmington, DE, where the first Swedes\n\n[[Page S10571]]\n\nand Finns came in 1638. They landed at Port Christina and established \nthe colony of New Sweden. That hub will serve as a gateway through \nwhich visitors might come.\n  Think of a hub as a bicycle wheel with spokes emanating from the \nhubs, and the spokes would lead to attractions throughout the northern \npart of our State. One is the Hagley Museum, where the first powder \nmills were built along the banks of the Brandywine River providing \nsupport for what became the DuPont Company that has endured for over \n200 attractions that would lead from the hub down to the spokes that \npeople who come to the central part of our State might visit.\n  Further south in our State is a place called Lewes. It was settled by \nthe Dutch back in the 1600s. It is a place that had been literally \nraided, attacked by Indians, wiped out, and came back to be a thriving, \nprosperous community. The history of early Lewes is captured in the \nSwaanendael Museum. Not far away is a beautiful State park, Cape \nHenlopen State Park, which a lot of people visit every year.\n  We have wildlife refuges in the southern and northern part of the \nState. There are tens of millions of birds that stop and feed on the \nway either to the southern hemisphere in the winter or on the way back \nup North in the spring.\n  Our State has a lot to offer. Our heritage is one that is rich and \nreflects the tapestry of our country we have had on the coastal regions \nof our State over the last 200 years. We do not want to keep it just to \nourselves but share it with the rest of the country and the rest of the \nworld.\n  We are excited to work with the Department of the Interior, our \ncolleagues, and the administration, present or future, to establish a \ncoastal heritage park for the State of Delaware so a year or two from \nnow, when people sit with their families, turn on their computers, and \ngo to the National Park Service Web site to see what is available \naround the country to visit, they will find a lot of good things about \nthe other 49 States, but they will find some very special things in \nDelaware, too.\n  I thank Senators for the time to introduce this with my colleague, \nSenator Joe Biden.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Delaware \nNational Coastal Special Resources Study Act. I am pleased to be joined \nin introducing this bill by Senator Biden. This bill authorizes the \nSecretary of the Interior to study the feasibility of establishing a \nNational Park Service unit in Delaware.\n  Delaware is first in so many ways. Yet we are the only State without \na National Park. Last year, I wondered whether Delawareans agreed with \nme that we should have a unit of the National Park Service. Through \nsurveys and town meetings, I polled Delawareans on this question in \n2003. The answer was a resounding and nearly unanimous ``yes.''\n  However, folks were less unanimous on where the park should be \nlocated and which aspect of Delaware it should feature. So I formed a \n12-member committee representing communities throughout the State. They \ndiscussed many fine ideas, and narrowed them down to four proposals \nwith a common thread. In one way or another, each proposal related to \nDelaware's coastal region.\n  The committee recommended joining these proposals. The result would \nbe a national park highlighting America's history, cultural heritage, \ncommercial progress and natural beauty. The Delaware National Coastal \nHeritage Park will reveal that the various threads that together make \nup the fabric of Delaware are an ideal microcosm for the tapestry of \nAmerica.\n  To understand our proposal, first let me ask you to stop thinking \nabout Yosemite or Yellowstone or Shenandoah. This proposal is not like \nthose big, traditional national parks. Ours is a different, more \ninnovative and creative way of thinking about a park. Delaware's \ncoastal region is rich in historical sites, museums, parks, and \nwildlife areas. Together, these sites highlight the threads of history, \nheritage, commerce, and nature.\n  A series of four gateway hubs, or interpretive centers, located along \nthe coast will guide visitors to the many existing attractions in the \ncoastal communities that underlie the park. Connecting these \nattractions through the National Park Service will allow us to tell our \nunique story to the Nation.\n  And, as I'd like to demonstrate for you, our story is worth telling.\n  The history of America, beginning well before the first European \nsettlers, is seen in the Lenni Lenape and Nanticoke Native American \ntribes. They settled and prospered in the area in and around Delaware \nthousands of years before the first European settlement in the early \n1600s. Members of the modern Nanticoke Indian Association and the \nLenape Tribe of Delaware trace their ancestry to the earliest \ninhabitants of Delaware's coastline. A visit to the Nanticoke Museum \nbrings our early history to life.\n  Delaware's shores were explored by the Swedes, Dutch and English. Our \nsmall State was the subject of competing claims for its territory from \nthe beginning of European settlement. The earliest colonial settlement \nin Delaware, known as Swaanendael, was established in 1631 in what is \npresent day Lewes. The settlement ended in tragedy when it was wiped \nout in a clash with the local Native American population. The \nSwaanendael Museum in Lewes illustrates Delaware's Dutch roots.\n  The Swedes established the first permanent European settlement in the \nDelaware Valley. The Kalmar Nyckel, a replica of the ship that carried \nSwedes to our shores, is docked in Wilmington and currently hosts \nvisitors from around the world.\n  Founded in Wilmington in 1638, Fort Christina was the earliest \nlasting bastion in the region. However, as a main line for coastal \ndefense in America, Delaware boasts forts throughout the State. Forts \ndisplaying various methods and philosophies of coastal defense can be \nfound along the Delaware River from Fort Delaware and Fort Dupont in \nNew Castle County to Fort Miles in Sussex County. Delaware was the site \nof military action in both the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. \nAnd at the onset of World War II, the U.S. Army established a military \nbase at Cape Henlopen. You can still see the bunkers and gun \nemplacements that were camouflaged among the dunes along with the \nconcrete observation towers that were built to spot enemy ships.\n  Delaware's pivotal role in America's fight for independence \nculminated in Caesar Rodney's legendary ride to Philadelphia to sign \nthe Declaration of Independence. The Golden Fleece Tavern in Kent \nCounty was the meeting place where, on December 7, 1787, it was \nunanimously decided that Delaware would ratify the Constitution, giving \nus the distinction of being the First State.\n  Transportation was dominated by water. New Castle thrived as a port \ntown, second only to Philadelphia. Additional ports in Wilmington and \nLewes provided harbor for ocean-going vessels in the export trade. A \nwalk through old New Castle is like stepping back in time.\n  Delaware historically holds the distinction of being one of America's \nmost prosperous industrial, economic and commercial centers. Some of \nthe Nation's leading ship and rail building establishments were located \nin the State, as were textile and papermaking companies. Frenchman \nEleuthere lrenee duPont founded a gunpowder mill on the banks of the \nBrandywine River near Wilmington. The history of the DuPont Company is \ncaptured at the scenic Hagley Museum.\n  Delaware's role in the Underground Railroad is too important not to \ntell. There are documented Underground Railroad sites all over the \nState. Underground Railroad historians believe that Harriet Tubman made \nnumerous trips through Delaware after her own daring escape. Tubman-\nGarrett Park in Wilmington overlooks the spot where escaping slaves \nswam across the Christina River as part of their journey. Wilmington \nand Camden in Kent County were considered safe stations on the way to \nfreedom. Through the Delaware National Coastal Heritage Park, more \nAmericans could come to understand the historic road to freedom \ntraveled by thousands of enslaved Africans.\n  Delaware is not only rich in history. It is also famed for its \nnatural refuges and conservatories. William Penn proclaimed that Cape \nHenlopen and its natural resources were for the common\n\n[[Page S10572]]\n\nusage, thus establishing some of the Nation's first ``public lands.'' \nSome of America's earliest beach resorts sprouted up along the Delaware \nBay and coastline during the mid-to-late 19th century. They remain in \nuse to this day. The Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge is an \nimportant link in the Atlantic Flyway, a trail of wildlife refuges used \nby migrating birds each year. This makes Bombay Hook a must-see for \nbird watchers and nature lovers. The Little Creek Wildlife area is a \n4,500 acre mecca for crabbers and fishermen.\n  This is just a taste of the scenic beauty, ethnic heritage, and \nhistorical significance that greet visitors to Delaware's coastal \nshores. The national park selection committee realized that these \nevents and places are threads of human and natural activity that create \nthe very fabric of our society. And the committee realized that a park \nunit that helped local residents and visitors alike recognize and \nunderstand these threads would be a very appropriate and fitting \naddition to the National Park system. Our national park would \ndemonstrate that coastal regions like those found in Delaware are a \nvital part of America's past, present, and future.\n  But the committee also felt that the park itself should be very \ndifferent from traditional parks. Instead of a large landmass, the park \nwill be structured much like a series of four bicycle wheels, each with \na hub and spokes. The hubs will be interpretive centers located \nstrategically along the coastline. Local residents and tourists would \nlearn about how our coastline has contributed to the development of our \nState and our Nation. These centers would provide information and \nguidance about the many, many existing historic sites, natural areas, \nrecreational opportunities and other attractions that are part of our \ncoastal region. The spokes will be the multitude of attractions and \nsites that demonstrate the threads of America's history and scenic \nbeauty.\n  The gateway hub will be located at the 7th Street Peninsula at the \nsite of the original Fort Christina. There are various attractions \nwithin a short walking distance related to the coastal theme of the \npark. This site would also provide information, advice and directions \nabout other sites in the Wilmington area. It might also include a \nvisitor's center, park headquarters, perhaps a replica of the original \nFort Christina.\n  A second hub would be located along the Delaware River in southern \nNew Castle County. It would provide information on attractions such as \nFort Delaware on Pea Patch Island, Fort DuPont and the renowned \nhistoric district in the old city of New Castle as well other related \nattractions in New Castle County.\n  The third hub would be located in Kent County, also along the coast \nof the Delaware River. It would provide information on the existing \npreserved natural areas and on the myriad other attractions in Kent \nCounty including the John Dickinson Mansion, Dover's historic Green and \nothers.\n  A Sussex County hub would be located in the Lewes area and would \nprovide information on the numerous historic sites and natural areas \nthat have made Sussex County's coastal region so pivotal to Delaware.\n  Together, these four interpretive centers would direct visitors to \nthe many existing attractions that would help our guests understand and \nappreciate the many threads of Delaware's Coastal Region--threads that \nhelp make up the fabric of America.\n  Every year, millions of Americans plan their vacations around our \nNation's national park system. They log onto the Park Service website \nand search for ideas for their family vacations. Right now, that search \nwill turn up nothing for Delaware. With a national park unit here in \nDelaware, that will change.\n  In the future, those families will be considering a trip to Delaware \nto visit our Coastal Heritage Park. Those trips will be a significant \nboost to our economy--they will create jobs and economic activity that \ncan only be good for our State.\n  Just as important--or maybe even more important--these additional \nvisitors will bring more attention to our existing historic sites and \nother attractions. That additional attention will help guarantee they \nare preserved for future generations.\n  By encouraging more Delawareans themselves to visit these wonderful \nplaces, a National Park unit will help enrich our own understanding of \nour own history.\n  I have described to you today a vision resulting from the hard work \nof many dedicated Delawareans. Today, I take the next step in making \ntheir vision a reality.\n  The bill I've introduced today--the Delaware National Coastal Special \nResources Study Act--authorizes the National Park Service to conduct a \n``Special Resource Study'' to make recommendations as to the \nfeasibility of this proposal. The study itself would take from 1 to 2 \nyears to complete and would include estimated costs of implementing the \nproposal.\n  I believe this is an exciting proposal and one that, when \nincorporated into the National Park System, will become an important \nelement in preserving the wonderful human and natural history presented \nby our coastal region.\n  l ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2899\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Delaware National Coastal \n     Special Resources Study Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. STUDY.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior (referred to \n     in this Act as the ``Secretary'') shall conduct a special \n     resources study of the national significance, feasibility of \n     long-term preservation, and public use of sites in the \n     coastal region of the State of Delaware.\n       (b) Inclusion of Sites in the National Park System.--The \n     study under subsection (a) shall include an analysis and any \n     recommendations of the Secretary concerning the suitability \n     and feasibility of--\n       (1) designating 1 or more of the sites along the Delaware \n     coast as units of the National Park System that relate to the \n     themes described in section 3; or\n       (2) establishing a national heritage area that incorporates \n     the sites along the Delaware coast that relate to the themes \n     described in section 3.\n       (c) Study Guidelines.--In conducting the study authorized \n     under subsection (a), the Secretary shall use the criteria \n     for the study of areas for potential inclusion in the \n     National Park System contained in section 8 of Public Law 91-\n     383 (16 U.S.C. 1a-5).\n       (d) Consultation.--In preparing and conducting the study \n     under subsection (a), the Secretary shall consult with--\n       (1) the State of Delaware;\n       (2) the coastal region communities; and\n       (3) the general public.\n\n     SEC. 3.

REPORT.\n\n       Not later than 1 year after funds are made available to \n     carry out this Act under section 5, the Secretary shall \n     submit to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of \n     the Senate and the Committee on Resources of the House of \n     Representatives a report containing the findings, \n     conclusions, and recommendations of the study conducted under \n     section 2.\n\n[[Page S10573]]\n\n     SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I rise in support of the Delaware \nNational Coastal Special Resources Study Act and join my colleague, \nSenator Carper, in asking this body to support our efforts to construct \nthe Delaware National Coastal Heritage Park. Delaware is the only State \nnot to have a national park and we feel strongly that the time has \ncome. Today, through this legislation, we are asking the Secretary of \nthe Interior to study the feasibility of establishing a National Park \nService unit in the State of Delaware.\n  As I stand before you, I know what most of you are thinking. Do we \nhave an area worthy of such designation? Do we have picturesque \nmountains like the Grand Tetons or the Great Smokey Mountains? Are \npeople drawn to our coasts to find the spirituality of JoshuaTree? Do \nwe possess landscape on par with the beauty and serenity of Acadia \nNational Park? Well, in a word, yes. A little of all of the \nmagnificence found in some of our Nation's most famous parks can be \nfound in our State of Delaware and that is why the proposal presented \nby Senator Carper is so unique and worthy of the next step.\n  I have to commend my colleague. Senator Carper brought together a \ncommittee of dedicated Delawareans to analyze the validity of a \nnational park in the State of Delaware. After much deliberation, the \ncommittee suggested a series of four interpretive centers, scattered \nthroughout the state, to highlight the many treasures of our state. \nWhile there are numerous sites identified in the proposal, I would just \nlike to take a moment to speak to several that have been especially \nclose to me in my years in the Senate.\n  Pea Patch Island is a 228-acre park located off the coast of Delaware \nCity, Delaware that houses Fort Delaware, one of our country's oldest \nCivil War-era fortifications and Delaware's oldest State Park. The \nisland, with its fort, seawall and other archeological remains, is \nlisted on the National Registry of Historic Places. The island also \nhouses a State nature preserve, providing critical habitat to thousands \nof wading birds. It is also the largest heronry north of Florida.\n  Delaware also played a special role in the Underground Railroad and \nthe proposal will highlight the 18 sites in Delaware including a \nhideout at the Governor's mansion, the court house where abolitionist \nThomas Garrett was tried, the Mother African Church in Wilmington where \nan African American Festival founded in 1814 was used as a cover to \nhelp slaves escape is still celebrated, and numerous other sites \nutilized by the principal Underground Railroad conductor, Harriet \nTubman.\n  Finally, I would like to mention our coastline, our beaches. Now into \nOctober, we have said goodbye to another fantastic beach season with \nmillions of people visiting our shores. The historic sites and wildlife \nrefuges that dot our coastline are unique to the area and to the \nNation.\n  These links to Delaware's past are important to our Nation's future \nand I am proud to join my colleague in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Campbell, and Mr. \n        Inouye):\n  S. 2900. A bill to authorize the President to posthumously award a \ngold medal on behalf of Congress to Elizabeth Wanamaker Peratrovich and \nRoy Peratrovich in recognition of their outstanding and enduring \ncontributions to civil rights and dignity of the Native peoples of \nAlaska and the Nation; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I was proud to join with my colleagues \nand tens of thousands of America's first peoples, including a \nsubstantial contingent of Alaska Natives, in participating in the \nopening ceremonies for the National Museum of the American Indian. I \ndon't have to tell you what a special week this was for the first \npeoples of America and particularly for my Alaska Native people. We \ntake pride in our new National Museum of the American Indian and all \nthat it represents. First and foremost, it represents a commitment on \nthe part of the American people that the substantial contributions of \nAmerican Indians, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians be preserved in \nperpetuity in a prominent location adjacent to the U.S. Capitol. It \nrepresents a commitment that the Native experience will not be lost to \nhistory.\n  Today, I want to share with the Senate a piece of Native history that \nis very significant to the Native people of Alaska and indeed, the \nfirst peoples of our entire Nation. It is the story of a Tlingit \ncouple, Roy and Elizabeth Peratrovich. Roy and Elizabeth are to the \nNative peoples of Alaska what Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rosa \nParks are to African Americans. Everybody knows about Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr. and Rosa Parks, but hardly anyone outside the State of Alaska \nknows about Roy and Elizabeth Peratrovich. That is going to change \ntoday.\n  Elizabeth was born in 1911, about 17 years before Dr. King. She was \nborn in Petersburg, AK. After college she married Roy Peratrovich, a \nTlingit from Klawock, AK; and the couple had three children. Roy and \nElizabeth moved to Juneau. They were excited about buying a new home. \nBut they could not buy the house that they wanted because they were \nNative. They could not enter the stores or restaurants they wanted. \nOutside some of these stores and restaurants there were signs that read \n``No Natives Allowed.'' History has also recorded a sign that read ``No \nDogs or Indians Allowed.''\n  On December 30, 1941, following the invasion of Pearl Harbor, \nElizabeth and Roy wrote to Alaska's Territorial Governor:\n\n       In the present emergency our Native boys are being called \n     upon to defend our beloved country. There are no distinctions \n     being made there. Yet when we patronized good business \n     establishments we are told in most cases that Natives are not \n     allowed.\n       The proprietor of one business, an inn, does not seem to \n     realize that our Native boys are just as willing to lay down \n     their lives to protect the freedom he enjoys. Instead he \n     shows his appreciation by having a `No Natives Allowed' sign \n     on his door.\n\n  In that letter Elizabeth and Roy noted:\n\n       We were shocked when the Jews were discriminated against in \n     Germany. Stories were told of public places having signs, \n     ``No Jews Allowed.'' All freedom loving people were horrified \n     at what was being practiced in Germany, yet it is being \n     practiced in our own country.\n\n  In 1943, the Alaska Legislature, at the behest of Roy and Elizabeth \nconsidered an anti-discrimination law. It was defeated. But Roy and \nElizabeth were not defeated. Two years later, in 1945, the anti-\ndiscrimination measure was back before the Alaska Legislature. It \npassed the lower house, but met with stiff opposition in the Alaska \nSenate.\n  One by one Senators took to the floor to argue against the mixing of \nthe races. A church leader testified that it would take thirty to one \nhundred years before Alaska Natives would reach the equality of the \nwhite man.\n  Elizabeth Peratrovich rose from the gallery and said she would like \nto be heard. She was recognized, as was the custom of the day. In a \nquiet, dignified and steady voice she said, ``I would not have expected \nthat I, who am barely out of savagery, would have to remind gentleman \nwith five thousand years of recorded history behind them of our Bill of \nRights.'' She was asked by a Senator if she thought the proposed bill \nwould eliminate discrimination, Elizabeth Peratrovich queried in \nrebuttal, ``Do your laws against larceny and even murder prevent these \ncrimes? No law will eliminate crimes but at least you legislators can \nassert to the world that you recognize the evil of the present \nsituation and speak your intent to help us overcome discrimination.''\n  When she finished, there was a wild burst of applause from the \ngallery and the Senate floor alike. The territorial Senate passed the \nbill by a vote of eleven to five. On February 16, 1945, Alaska had an \nanti-discrimination law that provided all citizens of the territory of \nAlaska are entitled to full and equal enjoyment of public \naccommodations. Following passage of the anti-discrimination law, Roy \nand Elizabeth could be seen dancing at the Baranof Hotel, one of \nJuneau's finest. They danced among people they didn't know. They danced \nin a place where the day before they were not welcome.\n  There is an important lesson to be learned from the battles of \nElizabeth and Roy Peratrovich. Even in defeat, they knew that change \nwould come\n\n[[Page S10574]]\n\nfrom their participation in our political system. They were not \ndiscouraged by their defeat in 1943. They came back fighting and \nenjoyed the fruits of their victory two years later.\n  Nineteen years before the United States Congress prohibited \ndiscrimination in public accommodations in the Civil Rights Act of \n1964; eighteen years before Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. spoke of his \ndream on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial--Alaska had a civil rights \nlaw. Elizabeth would not live to see the United States adopt the same \nlaw she brought to Alaska in 1945. She passed away in 1958 at the age \nof 47.\n\n  The State of Alaska has acknowledged Elizabeth Peratrovich's \ncontribution to history by designating February 16 of each year as \nElizabeth Peratrovich Day. It has also designated one of the public \ngalleries in the Alaska House of Representatives as the Elizabeth \nPeratrovich Gallery.\n  But what about Roy? Why has his role not been recognized? Roy \nPeratrovich passed away in 1989 at age 81. He died 9 days before the \nfirst Elizabeth Peratrovich Day was observed in the State of Alaska. \nPerhaps it was because Roy was still alive at the time this honor was \nbestowed; it is Elizabeth that has gotten all the credit for passage of \nthe anti-discrimination law.\n  Members of the Peratrovich family tell me that this is not entirely \nunjustified because without Elizabeth's stirring speech the anti-\ndiscrimination law would not have passed. But they also point out, as \ndoes the historical record, that Elizabeth and Roy were a focused and \neffective team. History should recognize that the anti-discrimination \nlaw was enacted due to the joint efforts of Roy and Elizabeth \nPeratrovich. I rise today to do my part toward that end.\n  Joined by my colleague, the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska, \nMr. Stevens, the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Committee on \nIndian Affairs, Mr. Campbell and the distinguished Vice Chairman of \nthat committee, Mr. Inouye, I offer legislation to recognize the \ncontributions of Roy and Elizabeth Peratrovich with a Congressional \nGold Medal. Congressional Gold Medals have been awarded to a number of \nAfrican- Americans who have made contributions to the cause of civil \nrights, among them, Rosa Parks, Roy Wilkins, Dorothy Height, the nine \nbrave individuals who desegregated the schools of Little Rock, Arkansas \nand others involved in the effort to desegregate public education.\n  As our Nation focuses on the many contributions of our first people \nand the challenges they have faced throughout our Nation's history with \nthe opening of the National Museum of the American Indian, it is high \ntime that we also acknowledge the work of American Indians, Alaska \nNatives and Native Hawaiians in the struggle for civil rights and \nsocial justice. Honoring Elizabeth and Roy Peratrovich's substantial \ncontribution with a Congressional Gold Medal is a fine start.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2900\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Elizabeth Wanamaker, a Tlingit Indian, was born on July \n     4, 1911, in Petersburg, Alaska.\n       (2) Elizabeth married Roy Peratrovich, a Tlingit Indian \n     from Klawock Alaska, on December 15, 1931.\n       (3) In 1941, the couple moved to Juneau, Alaska.\n       (4) Roy and Elizabeth Peratrovich discovered that they \n     could not purchase a home in the section of Juneau in which \n     they desired to live due to discrimination against Alaska \n     Natives.\n       (5) In the early 1940s, there were reports that some \n     businesses in Southeast Alaska posted signs reading ``No \n     Natives Allowed''.\n       (6) Roy, as Grand President of the Alaska Native \n     Brotherhood and Elizabeth, as Grand President of the Alaska \n     Native Sisterhood, petitioned the Territorial Governor and \n     the Territorial Legislature to enact a law prohibiting \n     discrimination against Alaska Natives in public \n     accommodations.\n       (7) Rebuffed by the Territorial Legislature in 1943, they \n     again sought passage of an antidiscrimination law in 1945.\n       (8) On February 8, 1945, as the Alaska Territorial Senate \n     debated the anti-discrimination law, Elizabeth, who was \n     sitting in the visitor's gallery of the Senate, was \n     recognized to present her views on the measure.\n       (9) The eloquent and dignified testimony given by Elizabeth \n     that day is widely credited for passage of the \n     antidiscrimination law.\n       (10) On February 16, 1945, Territorial Governor Ernest \n     Gruening signed into law an act prohibiting discrimination \n     against all citizens within the jurisdiction of the Territory \n     of Alaska in access to public accommodations and imposing a \n     penalty on any person who shall display any printed or \n     written sign indicating discrimination on racial grounds of \n     such full and equal enjoyment.\n       (11) Nineteen years before Congress enacted the Civil \n     Rights Act of 1964, and 18 years before the Reverend Dr. \n     Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his ``I have a Dream'' \n     speech, one of America's first antidiscrimination laws was \n     enacted in the Territory of Alaska, thanks to the efforts of \n     Elizabeth and Roy Peratrovich.\n       (12) Since 1989, the State of Alaska has observed Elizabeth \n     Peratrovich Day on February 16 of each year and a visitor's \n     gallery of the Alaska House of Representatives in the Alaska \n     State Capitol has been named for Elizabeth Peratrovich.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The President is authorized, \n     on behalf of the Congress, to posthumously award a gold medal \n     of appropriate design to Elizabeth Wanamaker Peratrovich and \n     Roy Peratrovich, in recognition of their outstanding and \n     enduring contributions to the civil rights and dignity of the \n     Native peoples of Alaska and the Nation.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For the purpose of the \n     presentation referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of \n     the Treasury (in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') \n     shall strike a gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and \n     inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n       The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of \n     the gold medal struck pursuant to section 2 under such \n     regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, and at a price \n     sufficient to cover the cost thereof, including labor, \n     materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses, and \n     the cost of the gold medal.\n\n     SEC. 4. NATIONAL MEDALS.\n\n       The medals struck under this Act are national medals for \n     purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 5. FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Authority To Use Fund Amounts.--There is authorized to \n     be charged against the United States Mint Public Enterprise \n     Fund such sum as may be appropriated to pay for the cost of \n     the medals authorized by this Act.\n       (b) Proceeds of Sale.--Amounts received from the sale of \n     duplicate bronze medals under section 3 shall be deposited in \n     the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 2901.

A bill to ensure an abundant and affordable supply of highly \nnutritious fruits, vegetables, and other specialty crops for American \nconsumers and international markets by enhancing the competitiveness of \nUnited States-grown specialty crops; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Specialty \nCrop Competitiveness Act of 2004.'' This bipartisan legislation co-\nsponsored by the distinguished Senator from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, \nincreases the focus on the contribution that specialty crops add to the \nUnited States agricultural economy. This bill specifically provides the \nproper and necessary attention to many challenges faced throughout each \nsegment of the industry.\n  Most do not realize the significance of specialty crops and their \nvalue to the U.S. economy and the health of U.S. citizens. According to \nthe United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service, \nfruits and vegetables alone added $29.9 billion to the U.S. economy in \n2002. This figure does not even include the contribution of nursery and \nother ornamental plant production.\n  The specialty crop industry also accounts for more than $53 billion \nin cash receipts for U.S. producers, which is close to fifty-four \npercent of the total cash receipts for all crops. A surprising fact to \nsome is that my State of Idaho is the Nation's fourth largest producer \nof specialty crops. Idaho proudly boasts production of cherries, table \ngrapes, apples, onions, carrots, several varieties of seed crops and of \ncourse one of our most notable specialty crops, potatoes.\n  Maintaining a viable and sustainable specialty crop industry also \nbenefits the health of America's citizens. Obesity continues to plague \nmillions of people today and is a very serious and deepening threat not \nonly to personal health and well-being, but to the resources of the \neconomy as well. This issue is now receiving the necessary attention at \nthe highest levels, and specialty crops will continue to play a \nprominent role in reversing the obesity trend.\n  The ``Specialty Crop Competitiveness Act'' will also provide a \nstronger position for the U.S. industry in the global market arena. \nThis legislation promotes initiatives that will combat diseases both \nnative and foreign that continue to be used as non-tariff barriers to \nU.S. exports by foreign governments. Additionally, provisions in this \nbill seek improvements to Federal regulations and resources that impede \ntimely consideration of industry sanitary and phytosanitary petitions. \nThis bill does not provide direct subsidies to producers like other \nprograms. This legislation takes a major step forward to highlight the \nsignificance of this industry to the agriculture economy, the benefits \nto the health of U.S. citizens, and the need for a stable, affordable, \ndiverse, and secure supply of food.\n  Although we near the end of the 108th Congress. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues and the Administration now to consider this \ncomprehensive and necessary legislation.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague Senator \nCraig in introducing The Specialty Crop Competitiveness Act of 2004. \nThis legislation would help increase the production and consumption of \nfruits and vegetables in the United States. I would like to thank my \ncolleague Senator Craig for his hard work and leadership on this \nlegislation, and his outstanding commitment to the specialty crop \ncommunity.\n  Fruits and vegetables are vital to good health, and far too many \nAmericans do not consume enough of the fresh fruits and vegetables that \nthey desperately need. Increased consumption of fresh produce will \nprovide tremendous health and economic benefits to consumers and \ngrowers.\n  For far too long, specialty crops have been ignored by the United \nStates Department of Agriculture. The majority of crops grown in \nAmerica, from apples, pears, and cherries, to tomatoes, carrots, \ncucumbers, and nursery plants do not receive the same subsidies or USDA \nconsideration as program crops. All of our farmers work hard and take a \ngreat gamble every year to produce and receive a return on their crops. \nThey gamble against heat, drought, frost, storms, and more recently a \nflood of foreign produce to our markets.\n  I represent a diverse agricultural State, and I want American farmers \nto understand that this legislation is in no way designed to take away \nfunding from program crops, but rather to bring specialty crops up to \nthe status of program crops. This legislation would address a number of \nissues critical to our nation's specialty crop growers. First, it would \ncreate a specialty crop block grant to state agriculture departments to \nsupport production-related research, commodity production, nutrition, \nfood safety and inspection and other competitiveness enhancing \nprograms.\n  The legislation would also improve our growers' access to foreign \nmarkets. Thus far, many of our trade agreements have failed to open new \nmarkets to our growers, but rather have created new headaches. Our \nmarkets have faced problems from new invasive species, currency \nmanipulation, and a flood of products, such as apple juice concentrate, \nwhich have invaded hurt our Nation's growers. Therefore, this \nlegislation would require the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service \n(APHIS) to create a division that would handle industry petitions on \nsanitary and phytosanitary barriers to specialty crop exports. It would \nincrease the technical assistance funding for specialty crop and study \nthe effects of recent trade agreements and propose a strategy for \nspecialty crop producers to more effectively benefit from international \ntrade opportunities. In order to benefit our farmers, we must ensure \nthat free trade is fair trade.\n\n  Also important to my home State of Michigan is the Tree Assistance \nProgram (TAP), which is designed to provide financial relief to growers \nwho lose trees and vines due to natural causes. This past summer in \nMichigan, a number of our fruit growers suffered damage from hail \nstorms on the western side of our State. TAP funds will be critical to \nrestoring trees and vines damaged in the storms. However, it take a \nnumber of years to obtain a return on new fruit trees. Because of the \nhigh per acre cost of establishing perennial crops, our legislation \nwould increase the limitation on assistance under the TAP from $75,000 \nto $150,000 for each eligible farm.\n  In addition, this legislation would correct a two year old \nmisinterpretation by the USDA. The 2002 Farm Bill states that at least \n$200 million must be spent annually on the purchase of specialty crops. \nThe Farm Bill Conference Report emphasizes that the allocated $200 \nmillion is to be used for additional purchases, over and above the \npurchases made under current law. For example in 2001, the USDA \npurchased $243 million in fresh fruits and vegetables; therefore the \nnew total under the Farm Bill should be $443 million in purchases.\n  Unfortunately, the USDA is not complying with this provision. Instead \nof adding the $200 million on top of baseline spending for school lunch \nand senior programs, USDA has eliminated the baseline spending so there \nis no guarantee of any new spending on fruits and vegetables for our \nchildren. In fact, in 2002 USDA did not even meet the minimum purchase \nrequirement; only $181 million in fresh fruits and vegetables were \npurchased. The Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act will correct this \ndiscrepancy and provide our Nation's children with much needed fruits \nand vegetables.\n  Supporting our Nation's specialty crop growers and providing \nnutritious fruits and vegetables to our nation's consumers is vital to \nensuring our own health and the health of our economy. I am proud to \nintroduce this legislation and I hope that my colleagues will join me \nin its support.\n\n[[Page S10576]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 2903. A bill to provide immunity for nonprofit athletic \norganizations in lawsuits arising from claims of ordinary negligence \nrelating to passage or adoption of rules for athletic competitions and \npractices; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today in order to express my support \nfor the Nonprofit Athletic Organization Protection Act of 2004.\n  Our country has invested a tremendous number of resources in \nproviding our children with the ability to play sports. In every town \nin America, you will find boys and girls playing America's most popular \nsports: baseball, soccer, football and, of course, basketball. A recent \nstudy by the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association showed that in \n2000 at least 36 million American children played on at least one team \nsport. Of those 36 million, 26 million children between the ages of 6-\n17, played on an organized team in an organized league. A study by \nStatistical Research, Inc. for the Amateur Athletic Foundation and ESPN \nfound that 94 percent of American children play some sport during the \nyear.\n  The ability for children to participate in sporting events provides \nour society many benefits that government cannot provide. Studies have \nshown that these benefits include betterment to a child's health, \nacademic performance, social development and safety.\n  It is no wonder that the most obvious benefit of organized sports is \nphysical fitness. The National Institute of Health Care Maintenance has \nidentified physical activity such as sports as a key factor in the \nmaintenance of a healthy body. Lack of physical activity, along with \nunhealthy eating habits, has been identified as the leading cause of \nobesity in children. The center notes: ``Physical activity provides \nnumerous mental and physical benefits to health, including reduction in \nthe risk of premature mortality, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, \ndiabetes, depression, and cancers.'' The Washington Times reported on \nMay 14th of this year that a Cooper Institute for Aerobics Research \nstudy indicated, ``Low fitness outranks fatness as a risk factor for \nmortality.'' By encouraging our children to participate in organized \nsports, we increase physical fitness and fight obesity.\n  A second benefit in the participation of organized sports is an \nincrease in academic performance. The National Institute of Health Care \nMaintenance has highlighted ``a recent largescale analysis reported by \nthe California Department of Education [has shown] that the level of \nphysical fitness attained by students was directly related to their \nperformance on standardized achievement measures.'' When we encourage \nour children to participate in organized sports, we increase the \nability for them to achieve academically.\n  A third benefit for young people who participate in organized sports \nis that they learn positive social development. Organized sports teach \nvalues of teamwork, fair play, and friendly competition. Success in \norganized sports is also a vital self-esteem builder in many children.\n  These three benefits have been widely discussed on the floor of the \nSenate and we have acted to implement several programs designed to \nreduce obesity and increase fitness, educational standards and the \nsocial well-being of our children.\n  The fourth benefit to participation in organized youth sports, \nproviding a safe place to play, is a topic that has not received as \nmuch attention as the first three. Nonetheless, it is no less \nimportant. Fewer kids are simply going outside to play, due to the \nattraction of TV, video games, and the Internet, combined with parents' \nsafety concerns about letting children run around outside unsupervised. \nAs a result, organized sports teams are an increasingly important \nsource of safe physical activity in children. The American Academy of \nPediatrics has stated, ``In contrast to unstructured or free play, \nparticipation in organized sports provides a greater opportunity to \ndevelop rules specifically designed for health and safety.''\n  One primary reason why organized sports provide such an opportunity \nfor safe play is that non-profit, volunteer organizations establish \nrules to provide a safe place to play. These organizations are made up \nof professional people who are in the business of providing children a \nfun and safe avenue for athletic exercise. Organizations like the Boys \nand Girls Club, the National Council of Youth Sports, the National \nFederation of State High School Associations and others exist largely \nto establish rules in order to minimize the risk of injury our children \nface while participating in sports. No matter how well these \norganizations perform their work, however, boys and girls will be \ninjured.\n  Over the last several years, more and more of these rule making \nbodies have become targets for lawsuits seeking to prove that the rule \nmaker was negligent in making the rules of play. These lawsuits claim \nthat had a different rule been in place, the injury would not have \nhappened. Indeed, these suits place rule makers into a Catch-22. A \nchild can be injured in almost any situation no matter how a rule is \nwritten. The result has been to have more and more lawsuits.\n  As a consequence, the insurance premiums of these organizations have \nrisen dramatically over the past several years. In his testimony before \nthe House Judiciary Committee this past July, Robert Kanaby the \nExecutive Director of the National Federation of State High School \nAssociations testified that: ``Over the last three years, the annual \nliability insurance premiums for the National High School Federation \nhave increased three-fold to about $1,000,000. We have been advised by \nexperts that given our claims experience and the reluctance of insurers \nto offer such coverage to an organization `serving 7,000,000 potential \nclaimants,' the premiums will likely increase significantly in years to \ncome. Since we operate on a total budget of about $9,000,000, such an \nincrease would be, to put it mildly, problematical.'' The costs have \nincreased to the point where it is possible that these organizations \nwill cease from providing age appropriate rules and the safety of youth \nsports will decline.\n  Because of this problem, I am introducing today the Nonprofit \nAthletic Organization Protection Act of 2004. This legislation will \neliminate lawsuits based on claims that a non-profit rulemaking body is \nliable for the physical injury when the rule was made by a properly \nlicensed rulemaking body that has acted within the scope of its \nauthority. Lawsuits may be maintained if the rule maker was grossly \nnegligent or engaged in criminal or reckless misconduct. This \nreasonable legislation will help sports rule makers to do their job. If \nwe do not pass this legislation, it is likely that rule makers will \neventually close their doors since they will be unable to afford the \ninsurance needed to provide a safe sporting environment.\n\n  No one who has participated in the debate surrounding this problem \nhas disagreed that the current lawsuit culture needs reform. Instead, \ntwo concerns have arisen regarding the scope of the legislative remedy: \nfirst, that the remedy was overly broad preventing law suits against \nrule makers on other issues; second, that this legislation would \nprevent lawsuits against rule makers who are negligent.\n  To remedy these concerns, the legislation introduced today contains a \nprovision that explicitly says that lawsuits involving ``antitrust, \nlabor, environmental, defamation, tortuous interference of contract law \nor civil rights law, or any other federal, state, or local law \nproviding protection from discrimination'' are not barred by this bill.\n  The additional provision would also provide no legal immunity from \nlawsuit if the rule maker has authority to determine coach eligibility. \nAdditionally, the PROTECT Act passed last year, we authorized a pilot \nprogram that enabled the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren to do background checks on coaches who participate in certain \nprograms. This program has been successful, weeding out many who would \npotentially harm our children. So much so that last Friday, by \nunanimous consent, Senators Hatch and Biden shepherded through an \nextension of this program for an additional 18 months with an aim of \neventually making this program permanent.\n  As my colleagues know, I am a runner. I enjoy the activity and the \npositive effect that running and athletics have played in my life. I \nwould hope\n\n[[Page S10577]]\n\nthat my nine grandchildren will be able to have an opportunity to \nparticipate in organized sports and that lawsuits against rule makers \nfor allegedly faulty rules will not prevent these organizations from \nfunctioning properly. I encourage my colleagues to support passage of \nthis legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 2904. A bill to authorize the exchange of certain land in the \nState of Colorado; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am today introducing legislation to \ncomplete a small land exchange between the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau \nof Land Management and Pitkin County at the Ashcroft Townsite near \nAspen, CO. This exchange is long overdue, as it has been over a decade \nsince work on this proposal began.\n  I am very pleased to assist this particular land exchange because it \nwill result in the Forest Service acquiring a piece of land known as \nthe ``Ryan Property'', which is one of the most scenic properties in \nthe entire Aspen area . . . and that's saying a lot!\n  I am personally familiar with the Ryan Property and its truly \nspectacular scenery, and would like to note that the Ryan Property was \nthe training ground for the U.S. Army's famous 10th Mountain Division \nduring World War II before the more well-known Camp Hale was built near \nLeadville.\n  The Ryan Property also has a series of extremely popular cross \ncountry skiing trails, which connect the trails on adjacent Forest \nService lands, and lie adjacent to the heavily-used Cathedral Lake \nTrail and trailhead. This is a truly magnificent piece of land that my \nbill will convey into permanent public ownership.\n  The acquisition of these lands by the Forest Service will complete \nthe Ashcroft Preservation Project, initiated by the Forest Service in \n1980 to protect the scenic and historic beauty of the Ashcroft area.\n  As I indicated earlier, completion of this land exchange has not been \nwithout difficulty. Indeed, the exchange was first suggested by the \nForest Service in 1992. In the year 2000, Pitkin County and the Aspen \nValley Land Trust purchased the property, at the request of the Forest \nService, to keep it from development until a land exchange could be \ncompleted.\n  Unfortunately, since that time, procedural difficulties, personnel \nchanges, and changing priorities have hindered completion of the \nexchange. As well, various alternative exchange land packages have been \ndiscussed and agreed upon by the parties involved over the years.\n  Finally, this year, an agreement was reached between the Forest \nService, BLM, and Pitkin County to go forward with a three-party \nexchange, and it is my intention to help them finish it. While this \nexchange will follow according to existing regulations, with my bill \nCongress will direct that it occur, so that the types of problems which \nhave prevented its completion thus far will not delay it further.\n  Additionally, with the special provisions written into this \nlegislation, upon completion of the exchange the County and Land Trust \nwill actually be donating land value to the United States, which is a \ngreat benefit for the public.\n  Accordingly, I am introducing my legislation today in the hopes that \nit still might be able to see some action this fall. I note that the \nexchange has the support of a broad array of governmental and non-\nprofit entities including Pitkin County, the City of Aspen, the Aspen \nValley Land Trust, the Aspen Skiing Company, the Roaring Fork \nConservancy, Ashcroft Ski Touring, Wilderness Workshop, Conservation \nFund, and many others.\n  It is my feeling that this is exactly the type of consensus land \nconservation effort we should all be supporting, and hope for swift and \nsuccessful passage of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2904\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect members of the Armed Forces from \nunscrupulous practices regarding sales of insurance, financial, and \ninvestment products; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from New York \nto introduce legislation to stop the sale of questionable financial \nproducts through hard sales tactics to our military personnel and their \nfamilies. Over the course of recent months, it has become increasingly \nclear that the lack of clear lines in the oversight of insurance and \nsecurities sales on military bases has allowed certain individuals to \npush high cost financial products on unknowing military personnel. This \npractice must be stopped now. Our soldiers and their families deserve \nmuch better than that especially since they are putting themselves on \nthe front line day after day for our freedom.\n  The bill that we introduce today will halt completely the sale of a \nmutual fund-like product that charges a 50-percent sales commission \nagainst the first year of contributions by a military family. \nCurrently, there are hundreds of mutual fund products available on the \nmarket that charge less than 6 percent. The excessive sales charges of \nthese contractually based financial products make them susceptible to \nabusive and misleading sales practices. Unfortunately, a small group of \nindividuals target these products almost entirely to military families.\n  In addition, certain life insurance products are being offered to our \nservice members disguised and marketed as investment products. These \nproducts provide very low death benefits while charging very high \npremiums, especially in the first few years. Many of these products are \nunsuitable for the insurance and investment needs of military families.\n  One of the major problems with the sales of insurance products on \nmilitary bases is whether State insurance regulators or military base \ncommanders are responsible for the oversight of sales agents. \nTypically, military base commanders will bar certain sales agents from \na military base only to have the sales agents show up at other military \nfacilities. Since there is no record of the bar, State insurance \nregulators have been unable to have adequate oversight of the \nindividuals. The bill that we introduce today will rectify that \nproblem. It will state clearly that State insurance regulators have \njurisdiction of the sale of insurance products on military bases.\n  In addition, the bill will urge State insurance regulators to work \nwith the Department of Defense to develop life insurance product \nstandards and disclosures. The Department of Defense also will keep at \nlist of individuals who are barred or banned from military bases due to \nabuse or unscrupulous sales tactics and to share that list with Federal \nand State insurance, securities and other relevant regulators.\n  Finally, the bill that we are introducing today will protect our \nmilitary families by preventing investment companies to issue periodic \npayment plan certificates, the mutual fund-like investment product with \nextremely high first-year costs. This type of financial instrument has \nbeen criticized by securities regulators since the late 1960s.\n  We believe that this legislation is but the first step in helping our \nmilitary families. Last year, I worked with Senators Shelby, Sarbanes, \nAkaka and Stabenow to develop financial literacy initiatives for the \nFederal Government and for students. My colleague from New York and I \nwill be working next year to strengthen the financial literacy programs \nfor military personnel. By providing military families with the tools \nto analyze and compare financial products, we will give them an \nadvantage over sales agents who attempt to sell high cost financial and \ninsurance products ill-suited to military life.\n  It should be noted that there are many upstanding financial and \ninsurance companies that sell very worthwhile investment and insurance \nproducts to military families. They should be applauded for the fine \njob that they do in helping our families. This bill is targeted at the \nfew who abuse the system and prey upon our military in times when our \ncountry needs them the most.\n  Last night, a similar bipartisan bill passed the House of \nRepresentatives by\n\n[[Page S10579]]\n\nan overwhelming vote of 396-2. Congress is fully aware of the dangers \nfaced by our military personnel in keeping our country safe from harm. \nLikewise, we must do all that we can to arm our soldiers when they face \nthe dangers of planning for their financial futures.\n  I urge my colleagues to take up this bill immediately so that we can \nhelp our men and women in the military and their families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Graham of \n        Florida, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 2906. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for reductions in the medicare part B premium through \nelimination of certain overpayments to Medicare Advantage \norganizations; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, on a late Friday afternoon back on \nSeptember 3, 2004, the Bush Administration announced, just before the \nLabor Day holiday weekend, that there will be a 17.4 percent increase \nin the Medicare Part B premium for seniors and people with \ndisabilities. The increase would raise premiums for seniors and people \nwith disabilities from $66.60 per month to $78.20 per month and \nrepresents the largest dollar increase in the history of the Medicare \nprogram.\n  In fairness, the premium is set in statute to reflect 25 percent of \nMedicare Part B spending. However, a large share of the increase is due \ndirectly to provisions that were included in the Medicare prescription \ndrug bill that passed last year that did far more to help HMOs, \ninsurance companies, and drug companies than it did for Medicare \nbeneficiaries. In fact, because of this formula, the dramatic increase \nin payments made to HMOs and insurance companies also has the very \nunfortunate effect of increasing the Medicare premium, even for seniors \nand people with disabilities that either do not have access to an HMO \nor choose not to enroll in an HMO.\n  As a result, today I am introducing legislation, the ``Affordability \nin Medicare Premiums Act,'' with Senators Mikulski, Graham of Florida, \nCorzine, Harkin, Durbin, Feingold, Rockefeller, and Kohl, that would \nreduce the 17.4 percent premium increase announced by the \nAdministration and instill greater fairness in the Medicare premium in \nthe future. It would do so in three ways.\n  First, the bill recognizes that one of the contributing factors in \nthe dramatic increase in the Medicare premium was the enactment of \nprovider and managed care plan payment increases in the Medicare drug \nbill. In the case of payments targeted exclusively to managed care \nplans, the Congressional Research Service has estimated that payments \nto HMOs will increase by 17.4 percent between 2004 and 2005. The CMS \nOffice of the Actuary estimates that the vast majority of the increase \ncomes from payments to HMOs over and above that made to traditional \nMedicare for either preventive services or in the physician payment \nadjustment.\n  As a result of these targeted increases in payments just to HMOs, Dr. \nBrian Biles, with George Washington University and the Commonwealth \nFund, has estimated that HMOs will be paid $2.7 billion, or 7.8 \npercent, in excess of traditional, fee-for-service Medicare in 2005. \nMoreover, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, or MedPAC, has \nfound that in almost one-third of the counties in the United States \nwill have payments to HMOs that will exceed that of traditional \nMedicare by more than 20 percent.\n  I voted against the Medicare prescription drug bill, in part due to \nthe overpayments made to HMOs in that legislation. If the rhetoric \nbehind private insurance plans is that they will modernize and save \nMedicare money, it certainly makes little sense to overpay them by what \nthe CMS Office of the Actuary estimates to be $50 billion over the next \n10 years. That is why I have cosponsored legislation to eliminate that \noverpayment.\n  In the meantime, for the 89 percent of Medicare enrollees that choose \nnot to enroll or do not even have access to a Medicare HMO, they \ncertainly should not have to pay 25 percent of the Part B costs of the \noverpayment or excessive subsidies to managed care plans through what \nis now called the Medicare Advantage program, as they are required to \nnow.\n  Consequently, our legislation, the ``Affordability in Medicare \nPremiums Act,'' would eliminate that part of the Medicare premium that \nis attributable to the costs associated with these overpayments to \nHMOs. Just as somebody should not have to pay the premium of another \nfor choosing a more costly health plan, our Nation's senior citizens or \npeople with disabilities should not have to pay higher premiums because \nthe Administration and Congress choose to overpay HMOs in the Medicare \nprogram.\n  Unfortunately, as it works now, if more Medicare beneficiaries \ndecided this year to enroll in Medicare HMOs, then Medicare spending \nincreases, on average, by at least 8.4 percent for each new managed \ncare enrollee. With that increased cost, all Medicare beneficiaries, \neven those that neither have access to nor choose not to enroll in an \nHMO must pay higher premiums.\n  Second, the bill recognizes that HMOs are also overpaid by Medicare \neven further due to the Administration's decision to not appropriately \n``risk adjust'' payments to health plans. As MedPAC explained in its \nMarch 2004 Report to the Congress, ``From the time plans were first \npaid based on capitation, the program has adjusted the capitation rates \nto reflect expected health care spending differences among plans based \non the characteristics of their enrollees.'' In 1997, Congress required \nthe Secretary to improve the risk adjustment system. However, in \nimplementation of the new system, which is phased in to cushion the \nimpact on health plans, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \nor CMS, went further by estimating the impact of the new system on \naggregate plan payments and has restored the difference.\n  MedPAC has argued against this and points out that without accurate \nadjustments it results in even further inequity between traditional \nMedicaid and private health plans. As MedPAC says, ``If plans in \ngeneral attract healthier-than-average beneficiaries, the Medicare \nprogram pays more than these same beneficiaries would cost in the [fee-\nfor-service] program.''\n  Dr. Biles estimates that the CMS policy will add another $1.4 \nbillion, or 4.0 percent, to health plan overpayments. The CMS Office of \nthe Actuary estimates that if this policy continues over the next 10 \nyears that it will cost the Medicare program an additional $54 billion \nin overpayments. HMOs should not reap a significant financial windfall \nby avoiding serving Medicare beneficiaries who have greater health care \nneeds than average. Moreover, once again, those that do not have access \nto or choose not to enroll in a Medicare HMO should not be required to \npay higher premiums for these overpayments.\n\n  Therefore, the legislation requires CMS to risk adjust health plan \npayments and dictates that these Part B savings be redirected into \nreducing the Medicare Part B premiums for all Medicare beneficiaries. \nFurthermore, Part A savings would be applied to reduce the federal \ndeficit and extend the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund.\n  And finally, our bill repeals the $10 billion that was established in \nthe Medicare drug bill to allow the Secretary to pay health plans for \nwhat is called a ``health plan stabilization fund.'' This fund truly \nserves no other purpose than to further increase overpayments and \nsubsidies to health plans. Savings in Medicare Part B from the repeal \nof the provision are also redirected into reducing Medicare premiums \nfor all Medicare beneficiaries. Once again, Part A savings would be \napplied to reduce the federal deficit and further extend the solvency \nof the Medicare Trust Fund.\n  If nothing is done in the next two months, this premium increase will \nresult in a cumulative increase in premiums of 56.4 percent between \n2001 and 2005. That is unacceptable to our nation's senior citizens and \ndisabled citizens who often live on fixed incomes. Rather than hiding \nthis fact, as the Administration has sought to do, we urge them to do \nsomething about it by supporting this critical and urgent legislation.\n  The ``Affordability in Medicare Premiums Act'' is all about \npriorities. For\n\n[[Page S10580]]\n\nthe 89 percent of Medicare beneficiaries that are not enrolled in an \nHMO, they should not have to pay added premiums as a result of an \nestimated $114 billion in overpayments to HMOs over the next 10 years. \nWe have chosen to help senior citizens and people with disabilities \nliving on fixed incomes over HMOs. It is a matter of simple fairness.\n  Dr. Biles estimates that the average premium would decline for \nMedicare beneficiaries by at least $5 per month if our legislation is \npassed.\n  I would also underscore that by requiring risk adjustment and \nrepealing the $10 billion PPO fund, about half of those savings would \nbe Medicare Trust Fund or Part A dollars. As a result, the legislation \nhas the effect of both extending the solvency of the Medicare Trust \nFund and also saving taxpayers over $30 billion in coming years.\n  And finally, the Medicaid program would also save hundreds of \nmillions of dollars over the next ten years due to the fact that \nMedicaid pays the cost-sharing and premiums for low-income senior \ncitizens and the disabled who are both enrolled in Medicare and \nMedicaid. The Federal Funds Information for States, or FFIS, has \nestimated that the Medicare Part B premium increase will cost the \nMedicaid program over $800 million in 2005. By reducing the Medicare \npremium, the Medicaid program--and thereby, both federal and state \ngovernments and taxpayers--will see spending decline in this area.\n  I would like to thank Senators Mikulski, Graham of Florida, Corzine, \nHarkin, Durbin, Feingold, Rockefeller, and Kohl for working with me on \nintroducing this important legislation on behalf of our nation's \nseniors and disabled enrolled in Medicare.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that the Fact Sheet supporting the \nlegislation and the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 AFFORDABILITY IN MEDICARE PREMIUMS ACT\n\n       Senators Jeff Bingaman, Barbara Mikulski, Bob Graham, Jon \n     Corzine, Tom Harkin, Russ Feingold, Jay Rockefeller, and Herb \n     Kohl are introducing legislation entitled the ``Affordability \n     in Medicare Premiums Act.'' The bill would substantially \n     reduce the growth in the Medicare Part B premium scheduled to \n     take place in 2005 and instill greater fairness in the \n     Medicare Part B premium in the future. It would do so in a \n     fiscally responsible manner while also managing to extend the \n     solvency of the Medicare Part A Trust Fund and reduce the \n     Federal deficit.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       On September 3, 2004, the Bush Administration announced \n     that the Medicare Part B premium will rise from $66.60 per \n     month in 2004 to $78.20 per month in 2005--a 17.4 percent \n     increase. This $11.60 monthly or $138 a year increase for \n     Medicare enrollees represents the single largest in the \n     history of the Medicare program.\n       One of the major factors contributing to the dramatic \n     increase was the enactment of provider and managed care plan \n     payment increases in the Medicare Modernization Act. In the \n     case of payments to managed care plans, the Centers for \n     Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Office of the Actuary \n     estimates that payments will increase by 14.4 percent between \n     2004 and 2005. This will occur on a base payment to HMOs that \n     was already estimated by the Commonwealth Fund to exceed fee-\n     for-service costs by 8.4 percent or $552 per Medicare \n     Advantage plan enrollee in 2004.\n       Since the increase in payments to Medicare Advantage health \n     plans attributable to Part B spending is paid for by \n     increased premiums for all Medicare beneficiaries, the result \n     is that senior citizens and people with disabilities that are \n     not enrolled in Medicare HMOs have been and will increasingly \n     be cross-subsidizing overpayments to these Medicare HMOs.\n\n\n  Reduces Part B Premiums for the 89 Percent of Those Not Enrolled in \n                             Medicare HMOs\n\n       The legislation would eliminate this cross-subsidization by \n     making sure that the 89 percent of Medicare enrollees that \n     currently choose not to enroll or do not have access to a \n     Medicare HMO are no longer paying for the overpayments to \n     these plans. The legislation would achieve this by requiring \n     CMS to estimate the Part B premium for Medicare beneficiaries \n     at what the cost would be if HMOs were paid at 100% of the \n     cost of traditional Medicare fee-for-service.\n       In short, rather than subsidizing HMOs, the legislation \n     allows seniors and people with disabilities--many on fixed \n     incomes and with large out-of-pocket costs (an estimated \n     $3,455 for senior citizens enrolled in Medicare)--to have \n     their Part B premium reduced to use these dollars on their \n     own health care rather than for overpayments to HMOs that \n     they have chosen not to enroll in or to which they do not \n     even have access.\n       For example, according to the Congressional Research \n     Service (CRS), as of March 2003, the following states had \n     either no enrollment or less than 5 percent of their Medicare \n     beneficiaries enrolled in managed care plans: Montana, \n     Wyoming, Utah, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, \n     Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Arkansas, \n     Mississippi, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, West \n     Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, New Hampshire, \n     Vermont, Maine, and Alaska.\n       As the Commonwealth Fund has found, ``Over 40 percent of \n     Medicare beneficiaries, particularly those living in rural \n     areas, do not have access to a Medicare Advantage plan. Nor \n     do all Medicare beneficiaries in urban areas have their \n     physicians in Medicare Advantage plan networks.'' As a \n     result, virtually all of the Medicare beneficiaries in \n     these states, often with no access to a Medicare HMO at \n     all, are paying for the overpayment to managed care plans \n     operating in other areas in the country.\n       Furthermore, even for states with larger enrollment in \n     Medicare HMOs, such as California, Massachusetts, New York, \n     New Mexico, or Rhode Island, it makes little sense for those \n     not enrolled in managed care plans to pay the rapidly growing \n     Part B premium due to HMO overpayments that were already \n     occurring in Medicare but are now scheduled to increase much \n     more rapidly as a result of the Medicare Modernization Act.\n\n\n  Improves Health Plan Payments and Further Reducing Premiums for All \n                           Medicare Enrollees\n\n       The bill further recognizes that HMOs are overpaid by \n     Medicare in two ways--first, by the direct overpayment in \n     legislation, and second, by the failure of the Bush \n     Administration to appropriately ``risk adjust'' payments to \n     health plans based on the fact that health plans attract, on \n     average, healthier people than those in traditional Medicare. \n     Congress passed legislation in 1997 as part of the Balanced \n     Budget Act that required payments to plans to be adjusted or \n     ``risk adjusted'' based on the health of their enrollees. \n     However, CMS has interpreted the law to allow it to risk \n     adjust payments in a ``budget neutral'' manner by \n     redistributing plan overpayments among all plans.\n       The CMS Office of the Actuary estimates that the Bush \n     Administration's failure to adjust for the health of plan \n     enrollees led to an overpayment of $3 billion in 2004 and \n     would lead to another $54 billion in overpayments if payments \n     are not risk adjusted through 2014.\n       Therefore, the legislation requires CMS to risk adjust \n     health plan payments in a manner that saves the Medicare \n     program these funds. Furthermore, those savings will be \n     further plowed back into reducing the Medicare Part B premium \n     for all Medicare beneficiaries, including those enrolled in \n     Medicare Advantage plans.\n       And finally, it repeals the $10 billion that was \n     established in the Medicare Modernization Act that allows the \n     Secretary to pay PPOs for what is called a ``health plan \n     stabilization fund.''

Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nintroducing the Affordability in Medicare Premiums Act of 2004. This \nbill would protect seniors against the outrageous increases in their \nMedicare costs. It does this by preventing HMOs from taking money out \nof the pockets of seniors.\n  Health care costs are skyrocketing, and seniors are paying a greater \nshare out of their pockets each year. Medicare premiums are on the \nrise. Prescription drug costs are shooting through the roof. Seniors \nare facing higher co-pays and deductibles for doctor visits, and \nhospital and skilled nursing home visits. While seniors are paying more \nand more, the administration has just announced the largest increase in \nMedicare premiums in the history of Medicare.\n  Just last year this administration supported a Medicare benefit that \nprovides seniors only a hollow promise for a prescription drug benefit. \nThis new benefit will force over 2 million seniors to lose their drug \ncoverage, coerce seniors into HMOs, while doing nothing to stop the \nsoaring cost of prescription drugs.\n  Now this administration announces a 17.4 percent increase in Part B \npremiums. That's an extra $11.60 out of a seniors pocket each month. \nSeniors are falling further and further behind, while their Medicare \npremiums are getting larger, and their Social Security barely keeps up \nwith inflation. Our seniors are struggling to buy the basics like food, \nclothing and other simple necessities. And that's not okay.\n  I ran the numbers and here's what I found. Medicare Part B insurance \npremiums are rising faster and faster every year. In 2003, they rose \n8.7 percent. This year, Medicare Part B premiums rose by 13.5 percent. \nNext year these premiums will rise by 17.4 percent, which is the \nbiggest increase in Medicare history.\n  In contrast, Social Security cost of living adjustments (COLA's) rose \nby a mere 1.4 percent in 2003; and 2.1 percent in 2004; and are \nprojected to rise only about 3 percent for 2005. So, there's less and \nless of a senior's Social Security check to make ends meet.\n  Medicare provides health insurance coverage to 41 million seniors and \ndisabled. Roughly 570,000 Marylanders rely on Medicare. These benefits \nneed to be stable and secure. That's what I'm fighting for.\n  I believe honor thy mother and father is not just a good commandment \nto live by, it is good public policy to govern by. This bill would \neliminate the 17.4 percent increase in premiums, which saves seniors \n$11.60/month. This bill would also lower premiums paid by seniors below \ntoday's rate of $66.00/per month by using the savings from stopping \nsubsidies to HMO's. My bill is fully paid for by stopping the \noverpayments to HMOs. I do not believe that HMO's should not get higher \nreimbursements to serve seniors than traditional Medicare. My bill \nwould also eliminate the $10 billion HMO slush fund for insurance \ncompanies to participate in the new Medicare drug plan. This would save \na senior at least $115 next year to a senior on a fixed income. This is \na small fortune.\n  This bill is not an answer to skyrocketing health care costs, but it \nis a stopgap measure. It will give seniors a little breathing room.\n  I am working hard on several bills to fix the Prescription Drug \nBenefit that was passed last year, including legislation that protects \nseniors Social Security COLA's; legislation that provides a real drug \nbenefit for seniors; and, legislation that allow the government to \nnegotiate with drug companies to lower the cost of prescription drugs. \nI am fighting to end the giveaways to insurance companies, and use \nthose savings to improve Medicare.\n  Congress created Medicare to provide a safety net for seniors. It is \ntime to stop putting money in the pockets of HMOs and use that money to \nprovide quality care for seniors. This bill is a good first step down \nthat road, but a you can see, it is not the only step. Seniors cannot \nafford 17 percent increases in their Medicare premiums.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in expressing support for this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 2907. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve the \nquality and efficiency of health care delivery through improvements in \nhealth care information technology, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to announce the \nintroduction of the Information Technology for Health Care Quality Act. \nLet me thank Senator Kennedy for joining me in introducing this bill. \nBy encouraging health care providers to invest in information \ntechnology (IT), this legislation has the potential to bring \nskyrocketing health care costs under control and improve the overall \nquality of care in our nation.\n  We are facing a health care crisis in our country. The Census Bureau \nrecently released a report showing that 45 million Americans were \nwithout health insurance in 2003--an increase of 1.4 million over 2002. \nIn many respects, we have the greatest health system in the world, but \nfar too many Americans are unable to take advantage of this system.\n  The number of uninsured continues to rise because the cost of health \ncare continues to soar. Year after year, health care costs increase by \ndouble-digit percentages. The cost of employer-sponsored coverage \nincreased by 11 percent this year, after a 14 percent increase in 2003. \nEmployers are dropping health care coverage because they can no longer \nafford to foot the bill.\n  One of the ways to provide health care coverage to every American is \nto reign in health care costs. And expanding the use of IT in health \ncare is the best tool we have to control costs. Studies have shown that \nas much as one-third of health care spending is for redundant or \ninappropriate care. Estimates suggest that up to 14 percent of \nlaboratory tests and 11 percent of medication usage are unnecessary. \nFinally, and perhaps most disturbingly,\n\n[[Page S10582]]\n\nwe know that it takes, on average, 17 years for evidence to be \nincorporated into clinical practice. Along these same lines, a recent \nstudy showed that patients receive the best evidence-based treatment \nonly about half the time.\n  Significant cost-savings will undoubtedly be realized simply by \nmoving away from a paper-based system, where patient charts and test \nresults are easily lost or misplaced, to an electronic system where \ndata is easily stored, transferred from location to location, and \nretrieved at any time. With health IT, physicians will have their \npatients' medical information, at their fingertips. A physician will no \nlonger have to take another set of X-Rays because the first set was \nmisplaced, or order a test that the patient had six months ago in \nanother hospital because she is unaware that the test ever took place. \nThe potential for cost-savings from simply eliminating redundancies and \nunnecessary tests, and reducing administrative and transaction costs, \nis substantial.\n  Of course, when we consider the improved quality of care and patient \nsafety that will result from wider adoption of health IT, the impact on \ncost is even greater. For example, IT can provide decision support to \nensure that physicians are aware of the most up-to-date, evidence-\nbased best practices regarding a specific disease or condition, which \nwill reduce expensive hospitalizations. Given all of these benefits, \nestimates suggest that Electronic Health Records (EHRs) alone could \nsave more than $100 billion each year. The full benefits of IT could be \nmultiple hundreds of billions annually. Such a significant reduction in \nhealth care costs would allow us to provide coverage to millions of \nuninsured Americans.\n\n  The benefits of IT go beyond economics. I am sure that all of my \ncolleagues are familiar with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) estimate \nthat up to 98,000 Americans die each year as a result of medical \nerrors. A RAND Corporation study from last year showed that, on \naverage, patients receive the recommended care for certain widespread \nchronic conditions only half of the time. That is an astonishing \nfigure. To put it in a slightly different way, for many of the health \nconditions with which physicians should be most familiar, half of all \npatients are essentially being treated incorrectly.\n  Most experts in the field of patient safety and health care quality, \nincluding the IOM, agree that improving IT is one of the crucial steps \ntowards safer and better health care. By providing physicians with \naccess to patients' complete medical history, as well as electronic \ncues to help them make the correct treatment decisions, IT has the \npotential to significantly impact the care that Americans receive. It \nis impossible to put a value on the potential savings in human lives \nthat would undoubtedly result from a nationwide investment in health \ncare information technology.\n  It might seem counterintuitive that we can realize tremendous cost \nsavings while, at the same time improving care for patients. But in \nfact, improving patient care is essential to reducing costs. IT is the \nkey to unlocking the door--it has the potential to lead to improvements \nin care and efficiency that will save patients' lives, reduce costs, \nand reduce the number of uninsured.\n  Unfortunately, despite the impact that IT can have on cost, \nefficiency, patient safety, and health care quality, most health care \nproviders have not yet begun to invest in new technologies. The use of \nIT in most hospitals and doctors' offices lags far behind almost every \nother sphere of society. The vast majority of written work, such as \npatient charts and prescriptions, is still done using pen and paper. \nThis leads to mistakes, higher costs, reduced quality of care, and in \nthe most tragic cases, death.\n  There is no question in my mind that the Federal government has a \nsignificant role to play in expanding investment in health IT. The \nlegislation that I am introducing today defines that role. First, this \nbill would establish Federal leadership in defining a National Health \nInformation Infrastructure (NHII) and adopting health IT standards. \nWhile I am pleased that the administration has already appointed a \nNational Coordinator for Health Information Technology, I believe that \nthe authority given to the Coordinator and the resources at his \ndisposal are not equal to the enormity of his task. That is why my \nlegislation creates an office in the White House, the Office of Health \nInformation Technology, to oversee all of the Federal \nGovernment's activities in the area of health IT, and to create and \nimplement a national strategy to expand the adoption of IT in health \ncare.\n\n  This office would also be responsible for leading a collaborative \neffort between the public and private sectors to develop technical \nstandards for health IT. These standards will ensure that health care \ninformation can be shared between providers, so that a family moving \nfrom Connecticut to California will not have to leave their medical \nhistory behind. At the same time, this bill would ensure that the \nadopted standards protect the privacy of patient records. While the \ncreation of portable electronic health records is an important goal, \nprivacy and confidentiality must not be sacrificed.\n  This legislation would also provide financial assistance to \nindividual health care providers to stimulate investment in IT, and to \ncommunities to help them set up interoperable IT infrastructures at the \nlocal level, often referred to as Local Health Information \nInfrastructures--LHIIs. IT requires a huge capital investment. Many \nproviders, especially small doctors offices, and safety-net and rural \nhospitals and health centers, simply cannot afford to make the type of \ninvestment that is needed.\n  Finally, this legislation would provide for the development of a \nstandard set of health care quality measures. The creation of these \nmeasures is critical to better understanding how our health care system \nis performing, and where we need to focus our efforts to improve the \nquality of care. IT has the potential to drastically improve our \nability to capture these quality measures. All recipients of Federal \nfunding under this bill would be required to regularly report on these \nmeasures, as well as the impact that IT is having on health care \nquality, efficiency, and cost savings.\n  The establishment of standard quality measures is also the first step \nin moving our nation towards a system where payment for health care is \nmore appropriately aligned--a system in which health care providers are \npaid not simply for the volume of patients that they treat, but for the \nquality of care that they deliver. To this end, my legislation would \nrequire the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to \nCongress on possible changes to Federal reimbursement and payment \nstructures that would encourage the adoption of IT to improve health \ncare quality and patient safety.\n  It is time for our country to make a concerted effort to bring the \nhealth care sector into the 21st century. We must invest in health IT \nsystems, and we must begin to do so immediately. The number of \nuninsured, the skyrocketing cost of care, and the number of medical \nerrors should all serve as a wake-up call. We have a tool at our \ndisposal to address all of these problems, and there is no more time to \nwaste. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Ensign, Ms. \n        Cantwell, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2908. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to strengthen \nprohibitions against animal fighting, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to introduce the \n``Animal Fighting Protection Enforcement Act of 2004'' with my \ncolleagues Senators Feinstein, Ensign, Cantwell, DeWine and Leahy.\n  The bipartisan bill we are introducing today is very similar to S. \n736 with the same title, introduced by Senator Ensign and currently \ncosponsored by fifty-one Senators including me. This new bill is \nidentical to another bill, H.R. 4264, pending in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Specifically, this bill provides felony penalties by authorizing jail \ntime of up to two years for violations of Federal animal fighting law, \nrather than the misdemeanor penalty (up to one year) under current law. \nMost States have felony-level penalties for animal fighting violations, \nbut federal prosecutors are reluctant to pursue animal fighting\n\n[[Page S10583]]\n\ncases without felony-level penalties. Both the Senate and House \nincluded this felony provision in their farm bills in 2002, with \nidentical wording, but the provision was dropped in conference. The \nSenate also passed this as an amendment to the ``Healthy Forests'' \nbill, but it was again removed in conference.\n  The bill also outlaws cockfighting implements by prohibiting \ninterstate and foreign commerce of the razor-sharp knives and ice pick-\nlike gaffs are strapped onto birds' legs during cockfighting combat. \nThese devices are specially designed for cockfighting and have no other \nknown purpose.\n  H.R. 4264 tracks language in Section 26 of the Animal Welfare Act (7 \nU.S.C. 2156) that prohibits interstate and foreign commerce of animals \nfor fighting purposes. This covers dog fighting, cockfighting, and \nother fights between animals ``conducted for purposes of sport, \nwagering, or entertainment,'' with an explicit exemption for an \nactivity ``the primary purpose of which involves the use of one or more \nanimals in hunting another animal or animals, such as waterfowl, bird, \nraccoon, or fox hunting.''\n  Under current law, it already is illegal to: 1. Sponsor or exhibit an \nanimal in an animal fighting venture if the person knows that any \nanimal was bought, sold, delivered, transported, or received in \ninterstate or foreign commerce for participation in the fighting \nventure. 2. Knowingly sell, buy, transport, deliver, or receive an \nanimal in interstate or foreign commerce for purposes of participation \nin a fighting venture, regardless of the law in the destination State, \ndog fighting is illegal in all 50 States; cockfighting is illegal in 48 \nStates. 3. Knowingly use the Postal Service or any interstate \ninstrumentality to promote an animal fighting venture in the U.S., \ne.g., through advertisement, unless the venture involves birds and the \nfight is to take place in a State that allows cockfighting. As \nexplained on USDA's website explaining the Federal animal fighting law, \n``In no event may the Postal Service or other interstate \ninstrumentality be used to transport an animal for purposes of having \nthe animal participate in a fighting venture, even if such fighting is \nallowed in the destination state''.\n  The efforts to pass further Federal animal fighting prohibitions have \nbeen endorsed by more than 150 local police and sheriffs departments \nacross the country, as well as The Humane Society of the United States, \nthe National Chicken Council, representing 95 percent of U.S. chicken \nproducers/processors, the American Veterinary Medical Association, and \nmany other organizations. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to \ncosponsor this bill and support its quick passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 2909. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to allow \nthe Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation to increase the diameter of a \nnatural gas pipeline located in the Delaware Water Gap National \nRecreation Area; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to introduce a bill to \nauthorize the Secretary of the Interior to modify existing right-of-way \nagreements to allow an increase in the diameter of an existing natural \ngas pipeline in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area in Pike \nCounty, Pennsylvania.\n  In 1947, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation installed a 14-inch \ndiameter pipeline, known as Line 1278, that included construction in \nthe then rural areas of Pike, Northampton and Monroe counties. This \nsystem has become an important part of the energy delivery system to \nkey eastern markets.\n  The United States Department of Transportation (DOT) directed \nColumbia in 2002 and 2003 to take actions going forward with Line 1278, \nincluding additional testing, additional cathodic, corrosion, \nprotection and replacement of portions of the pipeline. DOT ordered \nthat the replacement must be completed by 2007. To comply with the DOT \ninstructions, Columbia in December 2003 filed an application with the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission to replace about 43 miles of this \npipeline, including 3.5 miles of the line that now lie within the \nDelaware Water Gap National Recreation Area.\n  At issue are two right-of-way agreements affecting property now \nwithin the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area that do not \nallow Columbia to increase the diameter of the pipeline. The Recreation \nArea was formed in 1965 through the acquisition of many tracts of \nprivate property. Columbia's Line 1278 runs through 14 of these tracts \nunder the terms of right-of-way agreements obtained from landowners \nprior to the Recreation Area's creation. Agreements affecting 12 of the \n14 tracts include language allowing Columbia to increase the diameter \nof the pipeline. However, two of the agreements, representing about 890 \nfeet of the pipeline, do not include such authorization.\n  Under current law, the Secretary of the Interior lacks legislative \nauthorization to enter into an agreement to grant a pipeline easement \nthat will allow an increase in the diameter of Line 1278. To complete \nthe planned upgrade to improve energy reliability in the region, \nenabling legislation is required.\n  This bill would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to enter into \nan agreement with Columbia to grant a pipeline easement to allow an \nincrease in the diameter of Line 1278 from 14 inches to 20 inches in \ndiameter. Timely enactment will allow the replacement to be performed \nefficiently in conjunction with the overall replacement project, and \nthe uniform size will facilitate the use of ``smart pigging'' \ntechnology to utilize inspection vehicles inside pipelines to help \nassure long-term safety and reliability of this important energy \ninfrastructure.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation for this important \nproject.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/06/senate-section/article/S10583-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10583-S10587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 448--DESIGNATING THE FIRST DAY OF APRIL 2005 AS \n                  ``NATIONAL ASBESTOS AWARENESS DAY''\n\n  Mr. REID submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 448\n\n       Whereas deadly asbestos fibers are invisible and cannot be \n     smelled or tasted;\n       Whereas when airborne fibers are inhaled or swallowed, the \n     damage is permanent and irreversible;\n       Whereas these fibers can cause mesothelioma, asbestosis, \n     lung cancer, and pleural diseases;\n       Whereas asbestos-related diseases can take 10 to 50 years \n     to present themselves;\n       Whereas the expected survival rate of those diagnosed with \n     mesothelioma is between 6 and 24 months;\n       Whereas little is known about late stage treatment and \n     there is no cure for asbestos-related diseases;\n       Whereas early detection of asbestos-related diseases would \n     give patients increased treatment options and often improve \n     their prognosis;\n       Whereas asbestos is a toxic and dangerous substance and \n     must be disposed of properly;\n       Whereas nearly half of the more than 1,000 screened \n     firefighters, police officers, rescue workers, and volunteers \n     who responded to the World Trade Center attacks on September \n     11, 2001, have new and persistent respiratory problems;\n       Whereas the industry groups with the highest incidence \n     rates of asbestos-related diseases, based on 2000 to 2002 \n     figures, were shipyard workers, vehicle body builders \n     (including rail vehicles), pipefitters, carpenters and \n     electricians, construction (including insulation work and \n     stripping), extraction, energy and water supply, and \n     manufacturing;\n       Whereas the United States imports more than 30,000,000 \n     pounds of asbestos used in products throughout the Nation;\n       Whereas asbestos-related diseases kill 10,000 people in the \n     United States each year, and the numbers are increasing;\n       Whereas asbestos exposure is responsible for 1 in every 125 \n     deaths of men over the age of 50;\n       Whereas safety and prevention will reduce asbestos exposure \n     and asbestos-related diseases;\n       Whereas asbestos has been the largest single cause of \n     occupational cancer;\n       Whereas asbestos is still a hazard for 1,300,000 workers in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas asbestos-related deaths have greatly increased in \n     the last 20 years and are expected to continue to increase;\n       Whereas 30 percent of all asbestos-related disease victims \n     were exposed to asbestos on naval ships and in shipyards;\n       Whereas asbestos was used in the construction of virtually \n     all office buildings, public schools, and homes built before \n     1975; and\n       Whereas the establishment of a ``National Asbestos \n     Awareness Day'' would raise public awareness about the \n     prevalence of asbestos-related diseases and the dangers of \n     asbestos exposure: Now, therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S10584]]\n\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates the first day of April \n     2005 as ``National Asbestos Awareness Day''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Alan Reinstein was diagnosed with \nmesothelioma on June 16, 2003 and underwent radical surgery to remove \nhis affected lung, diaphragm, and other parts of his body. Today, Alan \ncontinues his courageous battle with this terrible illness.\n  I received a phone call last week from by brother Don, indicating \nthat a long-time family friend, Harold Hansen, had died from \nmesothelioma.\n  I am submitting a resolution today to designate the first day of \nApril of next year as National Asbestos Awareness Day.\n  Harold Hansen was a family friend, such a wonderful man. In fact, my \nbrother called me a short time ago and said: Harold is sick. He has \nmesothelioma.\n  I said: Did he ever work around asbestos. And he said not that he \nremembers.\n  I knew a lawyer who might be able to help him and referred him to the \nlawyer. Now Harold is dead.\n  This is a terribly difficult problem in America. I talked about Alan; \nhis wife Linda could not just sit back and watch her husband suffer. \nKnowing others were also suffering, she helped create the Asbestos \nDisease Awareness Organization to unite asbestos victims. One goal of \nthe organization is to educate the public and the medical community \nabout asbestos-caused diseases. The occurrence of asbestos-related \ndiseases, including mesothelioma, asbestosis, and lung cancer is \ngrowing.\n  Over the next decade, it is estimated that 100,000 victims in the \nUnited States alone will die of asbestos-related disease. About 30 a \nday will die from this condition.\n  I received many letters from Nevadans with asbestos-related diseases \nin their families.\n  Eleanor Shook from Searchlight, NV, where I was born and reared, lost \nher husband Chuck to this dread condition 2 years ago. They found that \nChuck was sick, and 2 months later he died--no cure, no treatment, no \nreprieve. He had been repeatedly exposed to asbestos during all the \nyears he was working to raise his family.\n  I also got a letter from Jack Holmes, a former teacher from Las \nVegas, who wrote:\n  I am dying. I have malignant mesothelioma . . . I can expect extreme \npain and suffering before I die.\n  I also heard from Robert Wright of Henderson, who was exposed to \nasbestos in the Navy and now suffers from asbestosis.\n  These are just a few of the hundreds of Nevadans who are suffering \ntoday from asbestos-related diseases. Every one of these stories is a \ntragedy because they all could have been prevented. Asbestos-related \ndiseases are uncurable, and they are deadly. They can be prevented with \ngreater awareness and education.\n  Most Americans think asbestos was banned a long time ago. But \ncompanies use asbestos every day in their water pipes, as insulation, \nand in building materials and other substances. Asbestos kills, and \nkills invisibly. Asbestos cannot be smelled, tasted, or seen, and moves \nthrough the air in tiny particles and embeds itself in the lining of \nthe lungs once it is inhaled. It stays there for up to 50 years, \ndamaging tissue and eventually causing disease. Inhalation of asbestos \nis permanent and irreversible. Simply walking by a recently demolished \nbuilding that contains asbestos can be enough to breathe in a deadly \namount.\n  I was in New York and a New York police officer was with me. He was \npart of an undercover unit that had New York City policemen dressed in \nconstruction clothes. They were running a construction business. That \nwas part of what they were undercover doing. One of the reasons they \ndid it is because there are people in this country so evil, so \nmalignant that they are willing to take asbestos that these people said \nthey had--it really wasn't asbestos--and they would take it and dispose \nof it. They would dispose of it in school grounds, and they had no \nconcern where they disposed of what they thought was asbestos. Of \ncourse, they were arrested. But asbestos is a terrible problem. It is \nsuch a difficult problem in New York City alone where they remove \nasbestos. They are setting up these undercover operations to catch some \nof the people who are trying to make money on the disposal of asbestos.\n  Exposure to asbestos has had numerous consequences for victims and \ntheir families. Better awareness and education can help to eliminate \nfuture exposure. Early detection can give patients increased treatment \noptions and often improves their prognosis. For these reasons, I am \nintroducing a resolution to designate the first day of April as \nAsbestos Awareness Day. Asbestos awareness will lead to prevention, \nearly diagnosis, new treatments, and a cure.\n  Just as the victims of families of asbestos-related disease joined \ntogether in founding the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization, the \nSenate must unite in and pay tribute to victims by observing April 1 as \nAsbestos Awareness Day. I hope all Senators will join me in this \neffort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 449--ENCOURAGING THE PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS OF \n                                REFUGEES\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Brownback, and Mr. Leahy) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S. Res. 449\n\n       Whereas the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees \n     dated July 28, 1951 (189 UST 150) (hereinafter referred to as \n     the ``Convention'') and the Protocol Relating to the Status \n     of Refugees done at New York January 31, 1967 (19 UST 6223) \n     (hereinafter referred to as the ``Protocol'') provide that \n     individuals who flee a country to avoid persecution deserve \n     international protection;\n       Whereas such protection includes freedom from forcible \n     return and the basic rights necessary for a refugee to live a \n     free, dignified, self-reliant life, even while in exile;\n       Whereas such rights, as recognized in the Convention, \n     include the right to earn a livelihood, including the right \n     to engage in wage-employment or self-employment, practice a \n     profession, own property, freedom of movement and residence, \n     and receive travel documents;\n       Whereas such rights are applicable to a refugee independent \n     of whether a solution is available that would permit the \n     refugee to return to the country that the refugee fled;\n       Whereas such rights are part of the core protection mandate \n     of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees;\n       Whereas more than 50 percent of the refugees in the world \n     are effectively ``warehoused'', which means such refugees \n     have been confined to a camp or segregated settlement or \n     otherwise deprived of their basic rights in a situation that \n     has existed for at least 10 years;\n       Whereas donor countries, including the United States, have \n     typically offered less developed countries hosting refugees \n     assistance if they keep refugees warehoused in camps or \n     segregated settlements but have not provided adequate \n     assistance to host countries that permit refugees to live and \n     work among the local population; and\n       Whereas warehousing refugees not only violates the rights \n     of the refugees but also debilitates their humanity, often \n     reducing the refugees to enforced idleness, dependency, \n     disempowerment, and despair: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the United States Senate--\n       (1) denounces the practice of warehousing refugees, which \n     is the confinement of refugees to a camp or segregated \n     settlement or other deprivation of the refugees' basic rights \n     in a situation that has lasted 10 years or more, as a denial \n     of basic human rights and a squandering of human potential;\n       (2) urges the Secretary of State to actively pursue models \n     of refugee assistance that permit refugees to enjoy all the \n     rights recognized in the Convention Relating to the Status of \n     Refugees dated July 28, 1951 (189 UST 150) (hereinafter \n     referred to as the ``Convention'') and the Protocol Relating \n     to the Status of Refugees done at New York January 31, 1967 \n     (19 UST 6223) (hereinafter referred to as the ``Protocol'');\n       (3) urges the Secretary of State to encourage other donor \n     nations and other members of the Executive Committee of the \n     United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' Programme to \n     shift the incentive structure of refugee assistance and to \n     build mechanisms into relief and development assistance to \n     encourage the greater enjoyment by refugees of their rights \n     under the Convention;\n       (4) encourages the international community, including donor \n     countries, host countries, and members of the Executive \n     Committee of the United Nations High Commissioner for \n     Refugees' Programme, to denounce resolutely the practice of \n     warehousing refugees in favor of allowing refugees to \n     exercise their rights under the Convention;\n       (5) calls upon the United Nations High Commissioner for \n     Refugees to monitor refugee situations more effectively for \n     the realization of all the rights of refugees under the \n     Convention, including those related to freedom of movement \n     and the right to earn a livelihood;\n       (6) encourages those countries that have not yet ratified \n     the Convention or the Protocol to do so;\n\n[[Page S10585]]\n\n       (7) encourages those countries that have ratified the \n     Convention or the Protocol but have done so with reservations \n     on key articles pertaining to the right to work and freedom \n     of movement to remove such reservations; and\n       (8) encourages all countries to enact legislation or \n     promulgate policies to provide for the legal enjoyment of the \n     basic rights of refugees as outlined in the Convention.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues, \nSenator Brownback and Senator Leahy, in submitting a resolution to call \nattention to the plight of the large number of refugees throughout the \nworld confined to refugee camps or segregated settlements for extended \nperiods of time. In the vast majority of cases, these refugees are \nbeing ``warehoused,'' often for years, and in violation of their basic \nrights under the Refugee Convention adopted over half a century ago.\n  We know of 300,000 Angolans in Zambia, Congo-Kinshasa, and Namibia, \ntwo million Afghans in Iran and Pakistan, 100,000 Bhutanese in Nepal, \nand 500,000 refugees from Sudan who have lived in refugee camps in \nvarious countries for 20 years. Shamefully, of the world's nearly 12 \nmillion more than 7 million have been restricted to refugee camps or \nsegregated settlements for a decade or even longer.\n  These tragic statistics aren't front page news. Refugees seldom \ndominate the headlines. But the reality is that the troubles of our \ntime are exacting a heavy toll on people fleeing from conflicts and \noppression. Throughout the world, men, woman and children are on the \nmove, silent witnesses to the cruelties that plague our age.\n  Refugee camps are often created quickly, to address a crisis. But the \nsolution sometimes creates a greater problem when temporary refugee \ncamps turn into long-term places of detention and confinement, often \nunder extreme conditions with little attention paid to the growing \nnumber of refugees that find themselves in endless and harmful \nsituations.\n  Under the Refugee Convention of 1951, refugees have rights, including \nthe right to earn a livelihood, to engage in wage-employment or self-\nemployment, to practice a profession, to own property, and to have \nfreedom of movement and residence. ``Warehoused'' refugees can do none \nof these things. Unable to work, travel, own property or obtain an \neducation, they live unlived lives, without the basic freedoms they are \nentitled to have under the Convention of 1951.\n  Without the chance to obtain an education or earn a living, refugees \nbecomes easy recruitment targets for terrorist groups. We can be \nvigilant against terrorism, and we can do so without abandoning the \nbasic humanity of refugees and squandering their lives in squalid \nwarehouses.\n  The resolution we are offering denounces the practice of warehousing \nrefugees and urges all nations to grant refugees their basic rights \nunder the Refugee Convention.\n  America has a proud history as a haven for refugees, especially since \nthe end of World War II. Assistance to refugees has been a conspicuous \naspect of our leadership in the world. As a leader in this area, we \nneed to say to the world that the widespread practice of warehousing \nrefugees violates international law. As members of the world community, \nwe have a responsibility to ensure that refugees are able to exercise \nthe basic rights granted to them under the Refugee Convention.\n  Over 100 international organizations support the end of warehousing, \nincluding more than twenty U.S.-based agencies. Nobel laureates have \ncondemned this practice, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South \nAfrica, and worldwide support continues to grow.\n  Last year, the United States was the largest global contributor to \nagencies assisting refugees. But, there is far more to do. We must \nstrengthen our own commitment, and work with other countries to meet \nthe worldwide challenge. To do too little will only add to the \ninjustice endured by millions of refugees around the world, jeopardize \nour own national security, and ignore incalculable human potential that \nis being lost.\n  I urge our colleagues to join us in supporting this resolution, and \nhelp us to give new priority to ending this inhumane practice that has \nbeen festering too long in so many parts of the world.\n  I ask unanimous consent that editorials from the New York Times and \nWashington Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n               [From The New York Times, Sept. 28, 2004]\n\n                        Warehouses for Refugees\n\n       The starvation and disease stalking the refugee camps near \n     the Darfur region of Sudan are a reminder that for many \n     refugees, conditions where they land are not much better than \n     the conditions they flee. The world has 12 million refugees, \n     and 7.4 million of them have been living in camps or \n     settlements for more than 10 years. Many are prohibited from \n     traveling or working, confined to crowded, squalid tents, at \n     the mercy of marauding gangs, and utterly dependent on \n     handouts of food insufficient to ward off hunger and on \n     health care that does not prevent cholera and dysentery. Some \n     people have lived in such camps for generations.\n       Half a million refugees from Myanmar, for example, have \n     lived in camps in neighboring countries for 20 years, with no \n     right to work or travel. The same is true of about 140,000 \n     Somalis, who have lived since 1991 in closed camps in \n     northern Kenya.\n       The camps are often established quickly to deal with \n     refugee emergencies and never get dismantled. The original \n     goal--allowing refugees to return home when conditions \n     improve--has had the perverse effect of preventing them from \n     establishing new lives in a new country. Countries like \n     Pakistan, Zambia and Chad, which end up accepting the vast \n     majority of refugees from troubled countries on their \n     borders, would rather quarantine them than integrate them \n     into their societies.\n       It is time to rethink warehousing, and refugee groups and \n     the United Nations high commissioner for refugees have \n     recently begun to explore how to help refugees become more \n     self-reliant. Refugees who learn skills or earn money can be \n     an asset to their war-torn homelands when they return. \n     Moreover, there are ways to open up refugee camps without \n     angering host populations. Zambia, for example, has given \n     Angolan refugees land to farm. The food they grow has turned \n     sleepy villages into trading centers, fueling local commerce.\n       Wealthy countries need to absorb more people for permanent \n     resettlement. Europe, shamefully, accepts only a handful. The \n     United States has become far less welcoming over the last 10 \n     years, and particularly since the terrorist acts of Sept. 11, \n     2001. In 1992, the United States accepted 132,531 refugees; \n     last year it was 28,422, although this year that number will \n     almost double.\n       The security concerns about accepting refugees from the \n     camps are unfounded. No terrorist would want to spend years \n     in squalid camps and then undergo a long and uncertain \n     vetting process simply to infiltrate the United States.\n       Indeed, the security threat comes from the camps' \n     concentration of idle, frustrated, resentful young men. \n     Warehousing itself can breed terrorism; Afghanistan's Taliban \n     movement was born in the refugee camps of Pakistan.\n       Initially, reducing warehousing will require commitment \n     from wealthy countries with the wherewithal to provide land, \n     training and microcredit. That will cost more than doling out \n     a weekly ration of rice and cooking oil. But it could reduce \n     costs later, and it is a way to create a more promising \n     future for millions.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Washington Times, Sept. 10, 2004]\n\n                         Unwarehousing Refugees\n\n                          (By Arthur E. Dewey)\n\n       Long-staying refugees in rural camps or urban ghettos are \n     not commodities in a sad state of storage, but vibrant human \n     beings carving out lives for themselves in exile.\n       That said, where they lack the right to work legally or \n     integrate into the community, they can languish in dependency \n     and lose hope for the future. Refugee ``warehousing'' is an \n     issue that demands attention--and is getting it.\n       The U.S. Committee for Refugees has made this issue a \n     centerpiece of its current advocacy campaign. Meanwhile, the \n     State Department, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner \n     for Refugees, UNHCR, and other partner agencies are taking \n     dramatic steps to address the warehousing problem.\n       The key step is facilitating voluntary repatriation. Tens \n     of thousands of long-staying refugees have returned to Sierra \n     Leone, Angola and Liberia from neighboring countries. More \n     than 80,000 Iraqis have gone home since the fall of Saddam. \n     But the biggest success story is Afghanistan, where more than \n     3 million have returned from long stays in Pakistan and Iran.\n       This continuing repatriation represents one of the largest \n     refugee solutions in modern times, and the number of refugees \n     caught in these dead-end situations has decreased remarkably.\n       While ``de-warehousing'' refugees--through repatriation, \n     local integration, or resettlement--is an important first \n     step, it is not enough. Sustaining repatriation requires \n     commitment from the international donor community over the \n     long haul. Returnees need long-term transitional help and \n     employment opportunities to restore their dignity and self \n     reliance.\n       To that end, the U.S. started an employment program called \n     the Afghan Conservation Corps, ACC. Already, 750,000 \n     seedlings\n\n[[Page S10586]]\n\n     have been planted on the dusty hillsides around Kabul by \n     thousands of returning refugees, internally displaced \n     persons, demilitarized militias, and Afghan women.\n       Ultimately, hundreds of thousands will join them in working \n     on similar projects. The ACC is a model for how to make de-\n     warehousing irreversible.\n       There are still critics who charge we are not doing enough \n     to bring to the United States needy refugees who can't be \n     repatriated. I say, ``Watch what we are doing.'' Watch, for \n     example, the rapid response to an unexpected opening in \n     Thailand to interview 15,000 Lao Hmong stranded for more than \n     a decade in Wat Tham Krabok. By year's end, most will be \n     resettled in the U.S. Watch also our admitting Meshketian \n     Turks from Russia who had been rootless for decades.\n       Resettlement is costly and labor-intensive, but we have \n     spared no expense or effort to resettle refugees in the \n     United States, when that is the most appropriate solution.\n       We know there remain vulnerable people--especially women \n     and children--who have waited for years or even decades for \n     rescue. This administration is committed to overcoming the \n     obstacles in the way of such a rescue.\n       We urge other countries to be more generous in giving aid, \n     admitting refugees and facilitating local integration where \n     appropriate. As Secretary of State Colin Powell said during \n     World Refugee Day commemorations in June: ``We join other \n     nations in easing the plight of all those who will close \n     their eyes tonight in a strange land to dream of the home \n     they were forced to flee. It's up to all of us to defend the \n     non-negotiable demands of human dignity. It's up to all of us \n     to help the world's refugees feel at home again.''\n       It takes a home, not a warehouse, to make these dreams come \n     true.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 450--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY AND REPRESENTATION IN \n                 UNITED STATES V.

Con. Res. 141\n\n       Whereas the Energy Information Administration in the \n     Department of Energy estimates that by 2025 the United States \n     will need more than 300,000 megawatts of new electricity-\n     generating capacity to maintain its current levels of growth \n     and standards of living;\n       Whereas Vision 2020, the nuclear energy industry's plan to \n     increase the use of nuclear energy through the year 2020 to \n     meet the projected growth in the demand for electricity, \n     calls for maintaining the Nation's nonemitting electricity \n     generation at 30 percent, which would require 50,000 \n     megawatts of new nuclear power to be generated;\n       Whereas meeting the increasing demand for continuous and \n     reliable, or baseload, electricity is essential for \n     supporting the economic growth which is necessary to maintain \n     the Nation's standard of living;\n       Whereas even the aggressive implementation of energy-\n     efficiency initiatives cannot replace the need for new \n     electricity-generating capacity;\n       Whereas nuclear power generated by the 103 commercial \n     nuclear power plants operating in the United States provides \n     the electricity for 20 percent of the United States;\n       Whereas consumers of nuclear power enjoy a higher level of \n     price stability compared to consumers of other energy \n     sources;\n       Whereas nuclear power plants do not produce harmful \n     emissions or greenhouse gases and can provide States, and the \n     Nation as a whole, with flexibility in meeting goals for \n     clean air and economic growth at lower costs than other \n     sources of power;\n       Whereas increasing nuclear power generation will require \n     designing and building new plants as well as operating the \n     new facilities, which together will create thousands of new \n     jobs;\n       Whereas the nuclear power industry, the Department of \n     Energy, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission are working \n     together to demonstrate the effectiveness of a new licensing \n     process for nuclear power plants, which allows full public \n     participation in decisions about the designs and sites of new \n     nuclear power plants without causing delays in construction \n     or commercial operation;\n       Whereas nuclear energy, science, and technology \n     applications are vital in the diagnosis and treatment of \n     disease, food and mail safety, space exploration, structural \n     inspection, and other important applications;\n       Whereas for decades, commercial nuclear power generating \n     facilities have had an unmatched safety record;\n       Whereas nuclear power plants in the United States use \n     excess material from Russian weapons programs to generate \n     power, which is a vital component of United States \n     nonproliferation policy;\n       Whereas many countries intend to build new nuclear power \n     plants, with 29 new plants currently under construction \n     worldwide and more than twice that many being planned, and \n     the United States must continue to play a leadership role \n     both in domestic nuclear power production and in encouraging \n     the use of nuclear power in other countries; and\n       Whereas the United States continues to lead the world in \n     the development, use, and control of nuclear technology: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the essential role of nuclear power in the \n     national energy policy of the United States; and\n       (2) supports the increased use of nuclear power and the \n     construction and development of new and improved nuclear \n     power generating plants as a means of contributing to \n     national energy independence and maintaining a clean \n     environment.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution \nrecognizing the essential role that nuclear power plays in our national \nenergy policy and to voice support for this remarkable technology. \nAmerica's nuclear power reactors supply electricity for one in five \nhomes and businesses in the United States and do so affordably, \nreliably and without producing any emissions. To ensure that nuclear \nenergy's important contribution to our nation continues, we must \ndevelop and build new nuclear power plants based on advanced technology \nand safety features.\n  Our Nation will require 40 percent more energy by 2020, requiring the \nuse of all available energy sources--wind, solar, hydro, natural gas, \ncoal and nuclear energy. Even the most aggressive conservation and \nenergy efficient programs will not satisfy all of our increasing energy \nneeds. We will require significant additional electric generating \ncapacity to meet this rising demand--electricity generation that is \nabsolutely necessary to keep our economy growing. And we must provide \nthis new power while protecting our environment.\n  America's 103 nuclear power reactors provide safe, clean and \nreliable, baseload electricity around the clock. Over the past 50 \nyears, America's nuclear power plants have posted a safety\n\n[[Page S10587]]\n\nrecord that is unrivalled. In addition, nuclear plants produce \nelectricity without producing harmful emissions or greenhouse gases. \nNuclear energy is the only major energy source that is both emission-\nfree and expandable.\n  The use of nuclear energy also reduces our dependence on foreign \nsources of energy. Protecting our Nation's energy independence must \nremain at the forefront of our energy policy decisions.\n  Since scientists first harnessed the power of the atom for the \nbenefit of mankind, the United States has led the world in the \ndevelopment of nuclear science and technology. With some 29 nuclear \nreactors under construction in other countries, the United State's \nleadership role in commercial nuclear power could be diminished. Our \nscientists, engineers and technicians must research, develop and build \nnew nuclear facilities to keep their skills sharp and further their \nknowledge. In addition, new plant project also will mean more jobs for \nthose scientists, engineers and technicians, as well as many other \ntrades.\n  America's nuclear power plants contribute to nonproliferation \nefforts. Through the public-private ``Megatons to Megawatts'' program, \nwhich this body has strongly supported, 50 percent of the fuel used in \nour commercial reactors comes from converted Russian warheads.\n  Nuclear energy also is one of the most efficient means of producing \nhydrogen, another key to our energy future. Hydrogen will help reduce \nour dependence on imported petroleum in the transportation sector, and, \nlike nuclear energy, is a clean air energy.\n  Therefore, I call upon my colleagues to join me in support of this \nresolution recognizing nuclear energy's important contributions to our \nNation, such as maintaining our energy independence and protecting our \nenvironment. And I urge all of you to join me in supporting research, \ndevelopment and construction of new nuclear power plants today, so that \nnuclear energy can continue providing these benefits in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/06/senate-section/article/S10587-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3975.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Windstorm Impact \n     Reduction Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, and \n     thunderstorms can cause significant loss of life, injury, \n     destruction of property, and economic and social disruption. \n     All States and regions are vulnerable to these hazards.\n       (2) The United States currently sustains several billion \n     dollars in economic damages each year due to these \n     windstorms. In recent decades, rapid development and \n     population growth in high-risk areas has greatly increased \n     overall vulnerability to windstorms.\n       (3) Improved windstorm impact reduction measures have the \n     potential to reduce these losses through--\n       (A) cost-effective and affordable design and construction \n     methods and practices;\n       (B) effective mitigation programs at the local, State, and \n     national level;\n       (C) improved data collection and analysis and impact \n     prediction methodologies;\n       (D) engineering research on improving new structures and \n     retrofitting existing ones to better withstand windstorms, \n     atmospheric-related research to better understand the \n     behavior and impact of windstorms on the built environment, \n     and subsequent application of those research results; and\n       (E) public education and outreach.\n       (4) There is an appropriate role for the Federal Government \n     in supporting windstorm impact reduction. An effective \n     Federal program in windstorm impact reduction will require \n     interagency coordination, and input from individuals, \n     academia, the private sector, and other interested non-\n     Federal entities.\n\n     SEC. 203. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of \n     the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n       (2) Program.--The term ``Program'' means the National \n     Windstorm Impact Reduction Program established by section \n     204(a).\n       (3) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the States of \n     the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth \n     of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, \n     American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands, and any other territory or possession of the United \n     States.\n       (4) Windstorm.--The term ``windstorm'' means any storm with \n     a damaging or destructive wind component, such as a \n     hurricane, tropical storm, tornado, or thunderstorm.\n\n     SEC. 204.

NATIONAL SURVEY ON DRUG USE AND HEALTH.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall ensure that the National Survey on Drug Use and Health \n     includes questions concerning the use of anabolic steroids.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section, $1,000,000 for \n     each of fiscal years 2005 through 2010.\n\n\n                          dietary supplements\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. The purpose of S. 2195, The Anabolic Steroid Control Act \nof 2004, is to address the abuse of steroids by athletes and, \nespecially, by youngsters and teenagers. Some substances marketed as \ndietary supplements, such as androstenedione, will be anabolic steroids \nunder this bill. That means that they will be regulated as controlled \nsubstances and not as dietary supplements. As such, there will be \nsignificant controls on their distribution and use, including \nsubstantial criminal penalties.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to commend the senior Senator from Delaware \nand the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the senior Senator from \nUtah, for their leadership on this important legislation. I would also \nlike to ask the distinguished Senator from Delaware to elaborate on how \nthis bill affects DHEA, a hormone precursor that is sometimes marketed \nas a dietary supplement.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the senior Senator from Illinois for his question, \nand for working with us to clarify this issue in the bill. We do not \nintend this bill to stop the use of substances that are legitimately \nmarketed as dietary supplements, or to limit access to substances that \nare not abused as steroids by athletes or children. With respect to \nDHEA, this legislation does not make it a controlled substance, and the \nlegislation should mean that legitimate users of DHEA would continue to \nhave access to it if it is lawfully marketed.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will.\n  Mr. HATCH. I too would like to thank the senior Senator from Illinois \nfor working with the senior Senator from Delaware and with me on this \nlegislation. I would also like to clarify, however, that the \nlegislation does provide that, if the Drug Enforcement Administration \nshould find that DHEA is being abused by athletes, by youngsters, or by \nteenagers, DEA can schedule it as a controlled substance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I commend the senior Senator from Utah, as well as the \nsenior Senator from Delaware, for their leadership on this legislation, \nand for working with me and the senior Senator from Illinois to address \nthe issue of DHEA. Could the Senator explain to me how the Drug \nEnforcement Administration would go about scheduling DHEA?\n  Mr. HATCH. Certainly. The legislation clarifies that DEA may schedule \nDHEA by applying the standards in section 201 of the Controlled \nSubstances Act, including the standard eight factors listed in section \n201(c) of that Act.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the distinguished Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator please explain whether the Drug \nEnforcement Administration will need to consider that DHEA meets each \nof the eight factors in section 201(c) to schedule it?\n  Mr. HATCH. The DEA need not find that DHEA meets each of the eight \nfactors before it can be scheduled. For example, if DEA considers that \nDHEA\n\n[[Page S10609]]\n\nhas no or minimal psychic or physiological dependence liability, DEA \nmay nonetheless schedule DHEA if DEA concludes, after consideration of \nthe facts and relative importance of other of the factors such as the \nactual or relative potential for abuse; the history and current pattern \nof abuse; or the scope, duration, and significance of abuse, that it \nshould be scheduled. Karen P. Tandy, the administrator of the DEA, has \nwritten me a letter stating that the presence of each of the eight \nfactors is not a mandatory prerequisite to scheduling. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the letter dated May 20, 2004, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                              Drug Enforcement Administration,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 20, 2004.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to respond to questions \n     your staff posed regarding consideration of certain statutory \n     factors incident to scheduling substances under the \n     Controlled Substances Act.\n       The relevant statutory provision, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 811(c), \n     requires consideration of eight specific factors as one of \n     the prerequisites to whether a substance should be scheduled. \n     The presence of each individual factor or specific findings \n     with respect to each individual factor are not a mandatory \n     prerequisite to scheduling. These statutory factors are: (1) \n     The drug's actual or relative potential for abuse; (2) \n     Scientific evidence of the drug's pharmacological effects; \n     (3) The state of current scientific knowledge regarding the \n     subject; (4) Its history and current pattern of abuse; (5) \n     The scope, duration, and significance of abuse; (6) What, if \n     any, risk there is to the public health; (7) The drug's \n     psychic or physiological dependence liability and; (8) \n     Whether a substance is an immediate precursor of a substance \n     already controlled.\n       You should be aware that evaluation of these eight factors \n     is not solely determinative and is part of a more extensive \n     scheduling process. The entire process for scheduling \n     substances to which these eight factors apply includes: \n     consideration of additional statutory criteria relevant to \n     each specific schedule [21 U.S.C. Sec. 811(b)]; an evaluation \n     and recommendation by the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services; and then a formal rulemaking.\n       I appreciate the opportunity to clarify this matter, and \n     please let me know if I may answer any further questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Karen P. Tandy,\n                                                    Administrator.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will my good friend from Utah yield for a further \nquestion?\n  Mr. HATCH. Certainly.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If DHEA becomes an abuse problem by athletes or by \nyoungsters or teenagers, and DEA fails to act, can the Senator assure \nme and the senior Senator from Illinois that the Judiciary Committee \nwill act accordingly?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, I am committed to stepping in to change the law to \nprotect the public health if abuse of DHEA by athletes or by youngsters \nor teenagers is a problem and DEA fails to take effective action with \nthe authority we have given it. I must add for the record that at the \npresent time I am not aware of sufficient evidence of DHEA abuse among \nathletes or young people to warrant it being categorized as an anabolic \nsteroid at this time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I, too, am committed to acting whenever any substance, \nwhether it is DHEA or another steroid substance, becomes an abuse \nproblem.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the technical amendment \nat the desk be agreed to; the committee-reported amendment, as amended, \nbe agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, \nthe motions to reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3982) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       In section 4(c) in the matter proposed to be inserted, \n     strike ``primarily''.\n\n  The committee amendment, in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 2195), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/06/senate-section/article/S10609-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10609-S10610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2005, AND FOR \n                   OTHER PURPOSES--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on the bill (H.R. 4850), and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     4850), making appropriations for the government of the \n     District of Columbia and other activities chargeable in whole \n     or in part against the revenues of said District for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2005, and for other \n     purposes, having met, have agreed that the House recede from \n     its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, and agree to \n     the same with an amendment, signed by a majority of the \n     conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  (The conference report is printed in the proceedings of the House in \nthe Record of Tuesday, October 5, 2004.)\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join Chairman \nDeWine while the Senate considers passage of the fiscal year 2005 \nDistrict of Columbia appropriations conference report. The bill totals \n$560 million, which is an increase of $18.3 million from fiscal year \n2004. The conference agreement represents a concerted effort of the \nHouse and Senate members to complete a bi-partisan bill only 6 days \ninto the new fiscal year. This is a true win for the District of \nColumbia, whose budget has been delayed in Congress past December and \nJanuary in recent years.\n  During our 3-year term as chairman and ranking member of the D.C. \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Senator DeWine and I have met many \nchallenges to stay in our allocation and deal appropriately with \ncontroversial issues. Above it all we have remained great friends. The \nconference report meets the District's current needs in security, \ncriminal justice, education, and child welfare.\n  The conference report funds the three criminal justice functions \ntransferred to the Federal Government for funding and oversight in the \nNational Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of \n1997. These functions, the courts, offender supervision, and defender \nservices, are funded at a level which will meet the needs of FY 2005, \nthough it was necessary to reduce funding in order to support other \npriorities of the Mayor and Council of the District.\n  The conferees recommend $190.8 million for the D.C. Courts, of which \n$56 million is for capital improvements which we believe will be \nsufficient to continue restoration of the historic Old Courthouse and \nplanning for the new Family Court facility. I was pleased to attend the \nribbon cutting just a few weeks ago for the renovated interim space of \nthe Family Court, which we funded last year. The courts have done a \ntremendous job of improving how the court operates, as well as \nimproving the points where residents interact with the court--the \ntraining of their staff and the aesthetic of space. It is so important, \nespecially for children visiting the court, to have a space that \nwelcomes them and enables confidence in the justice system. The courts \nare to be commended for doing so much with small increases and we have \nconfidence they will be able to continue this year.\n  In addition, $180 million is included for the Court Services and \nOffender Supervision Agency which is responsible for all adult \noffenders reentering the community from prison. This agency has a \ncritical role in public safety in the District and we have worked to \nensure they have the tools needed to do their job. Chairman DeWine \nchampioned an initiative to lower the caseload ratios for special \npopulation offenders and expand use of technology to ensure offenders \nare meeting their parole requirements. The conference also includes \n$38.5 million for defender services which represents indigent \ndefendants in the District. It is our intention this level will enable \nthe courts to increase the pay of lawyers from $50 to $60 per hour, an \nincrease which was started 3 years ago.\n  Outside of the Congress' responsibility for the main criminal justice \nfunctions in the District, the bill also funds several key initiatives \nwhich the House and Senate have launched to contribute to improving \neducation and the welfare of children in the District. I want to \nrecognize Senator DeWine's commitment to abused and neglected children \nin this city, including $5 million for early intervention services,\n\n[[Page S10610]]\n\nmental health services, and to support foster parents. Through Senator \nDeWine's commitment the status of children in the child welfare system \nhas improved greatly, and with his sure hand I am confident it will \ncontinue to improve. There is much work to be done. In addition, $6 \nmillion was included in the conference report on behalf of the House \nChairman Rodney Frelinghuysen to renovate school libraries in the \nDistrict of Columbia public schools which will enable many more of the \n65,000 student in the system to enjoy books and technology.\n  Great communities need great schools. This bill includes $26 million \nfor public education in support of the committee's goal to improve \neducation in the District, evenly divided between traditional public \nschools and public charter schools. A new superintendent has been hired \nfor the D.C. Public School system, Dr. Clifford Janey, and we are \nexcited about his energy to reform and improve and want to support his \nefforts as strongly as possible. This bill includes certain tools to \ncontribute to Dr. Janey's work.\n  In our public schools we must recognize and reward excellence. We \nmust acknowledge and eliminate failure. This bill directs a total of $4 \nmillion for a new incentive grant program for public education \nimprovement in both traditional public schools and public charter \nschools. These grants will be awarded to the principal of high-\nperforming or significantly improved public schools to reward their \ngood work. A reward is a powerful incentive to build on success and \nmeet some of the areas which can make their school thrive. I want to \ntake this opportunity to recognize the House chairman and ranking \nmember for their support of this new program which will contribute to \nreinvigorating our public schools.\n  The second prong of the School Improvement Fund, $13 million for \npublic charter schools, is a contribution to strengthen the chartering \nsystem. With 42 charters granted to date, the highest number of charter \nschools per capita, is a leader in the effort to use charter schools to \nspur system-wide improvement from within our system of public \neducation. Senator DeWine and I maintain our commitment to serve as a \nfull and equal partner in this endeavor.\n  Strengthening charter schools, which were created in the District by \nCongress in the 1995 School Reform Act, is a primary tenet of our work \nto improve education. Pursuant to Section 120 of P.L. 106-522, the FY \n01 DC Appropriations Act, the local government is prohibited from \namending the School Reform Act. Therefore, Congress has continued our \noversight responsibility of the charter school law this year. The bill \nfortifies the environment where strong, accountable, academically \nexcellent charter schools flourish.\n  Finally, the conference report begins a new investment in the \nadministration of justice in the District by contributing $8 million to \nthe construction of a new forensics lab, a top priority for the Mayor \nand council. This laboratory will alleviate contract pressure D.C. \nimposes on other Federal agencies, such as the FBI, to complete local \nforensic work and ensure timely processing of lab work, such as DNA \ntests. The bill also contributes to security and emergency preparedness \nin the Nation's capital with $21 million to bolster the police and \nfirst responders. This includes the annual payment of $15 million for \nsecurity of Federal installations in the city and to enable the police \npresence now required. The conferees also provide $6 million to \ncomplete the Unified Communications Center which will coordinate all \nfirst-responders in the capital region. In addition to all of the \nimportant investments in the District, there is $7.8 million for \ncleaning up the Anacostia River and providing recreation for the entire \nregion and $2.5 million for transportation improvements.\n  I would like to close by thanking the Mayor of the District of \nColumbia, Anthony Williams, the entire Council, particularly the Chair \nLinda Cropp, and the D.C. Delegate to Congress Eleanor Holmes Norton \nfor their many contributions and advice in developing this bill. The \nD.C. Appropriations Subcommittee has a unique role to fund certain \naspects of the city government and we could not do that well without \nthe guidance of the elected representative of the city's residents. \nThey are great partners for Chairman DeWine and I to ensure the bill \nmeets the needs of the District. I am especially pleased this year that \nwe are passing the final budget so early in the fiscal year, because \nthe city's local budget, nearly $8 billion, of locally-generated tax \ndollars, must be approved as part of this bill.\n  I appreciate the chairman's consideration and our ability to work \ntogether so well. And finally, no bill could be completed without the \ndiligent work of our staff, Mary Dietrich for Senator DeWine and Kate \nEltrich and Kathleen Strottman on my staff. This year has been blessed \nby a comity not often observed in the Congress in regards to our \nCapital City, and I thank all my colleagues for their commitment to a \npositive year and a first-rate bill for the District.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, was that the reading of the DC \nconference report?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 4850, the \nDC appropriations bill, provided that the conference report be adopted, \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 450, which was \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 450) to authorize testimony and \n     representation of the United States v. Daniel Bayly, et al.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for \ntestimony and representation in a criminal case arising out of the \nEnron debacle. The Justice Department's Enron Task Force has brought a \ncase in Federal court in Texas against six individuals formerly \nassociated with the Enron Corporation and Merrill Lynch. The indictment \nalleges conspiracy, false statements, obstruction of justice, and \nperjury relating to transactions involving offshore power barges. The \nGovernment alleges that Enron in essence parked assets with Merrill \nLynch to enhance fraudulently Enron's financial statements.\n  The transactions at the center of this case were the subject of \nextensive investigation and a hearing by the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations of the Committee on Government Affairs during the last \nCongress. In the course of the subcommittee's investigation, \nsubcommittee staff interviewed two of the individuals who are now on \ntrial, about these transactions.\n  Last Congress the Senate agreed to Senate Resolution 317, authorizing \nthe Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to cooperate with requests \nfrom law enforcement agencies for access to subcommittee records from \nits Enron investigation. In June of this year, the Senate agreed to \nSenate Resolution 394, authorizing a former subcommittee counsel and a \nsubcommittee detailee who interviewed the defendants to testify at this \ntrial.\n  The trial of this case began on September 20, 2004, in Houston. One \nof the defendants has now additionally subpoenaed a former subcommittee \nemployee and a former detailee to testify about the same events. \nAccordingly, this resolution would authorize the former subcommittee \nstaff to testify at this trial with representation by the Senate Legal \nCounsel.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee \nbe discharged from further consideration of S. 2864, and the Senate \nproceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2864) to extend for eighteen months the period \n     for which chapter 12 of title 11, United States Code, is \n     reenacted.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is passing \nlegislation to renew and extend family farmer bankruptcy protection \nthrough June 30, 2005.\n  Senator Grassley and I introduced the Family Farmer Bankruptcy Relief \nAct, S. 2864, to retroactively renew and temporarily extend these \nprotections that our farmers have come to rely upon because Chapter 12 \nof the Bankruptcy Code expired on January 1, 2004. Representative Tammy \nBaldwin and Representative Nick Smith have introduced companion \nlegislation in the House of Representatives.\n  But our bipartisan legislation is just a short-term fix. We need to \nstop playing politics and permanently reauthorize the Chapter 12 family \nfarmer protections.\n  Too many family farmers have been left in legal limbo in bankruptcy \ncourts across the country because Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code is \nstill a temporary measure. This is the eleventh time that Congress must \nact to restore or extend basic bankruptcy safeguards for family farmers \nbecause Chapter 12 is still a temporary provision despite its first \npassage into law in 1986. Our family farmers do not deserve these \nlapses in bankruptcy law that could mean the difference between \nforeclosure and farming.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from many \nrepresentatives of family farmers that underscores the need for \nrenewing the Chapter 12 bankruptcy protections be printed in the Record \nat the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is time to end this absurdity and make these bankruptcy \nprotections permanent. Everyone agrees that Chapter 12 has worked. It \nis time for Congress to make Chapter 12 a permanent part of the \nBankruptcy Code to provide a stable safety net for our Nation's family \nfarmers.\n  I will continue to work with Senator Grassley, Senator Feingold, \nRepresentative Baldwin, Representative Nick Smith and others on both \nsides of the aisle to pass legislation that once and for all assures \nour farmers of permanent bankruptcy protections to help them keep their \nfarms. In the meantime, the House of Representatives should quickly \npass the Family Farmer Bankruptcy Relief Act and end the current lapse \nin basic bankruptcy protections for our family farmers.\n                                                  October 6, 2004.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The undersigned organizations urge \n     immediate passage of S. 2864 that reinstates Chapter 12 \n     bankruptcy provisions of our nation's family farmers. Since \n     January 1, 2004 farmers facing serious financial problems \n     resulting from low commodity prices, increasing production \n     costs, and natural disasters have not been able to consider \n     filing a Chapter 12 bankruptcy.\n       The need for a separate bankruptcy code that enables \n     farmers to stay on the land while reorganizing their debt is \n     as urgent now as it was in 1986 when initially enacted by \n     Congress. This lapse in coverage results in farmers having to \n     face foreclosure and liquidation. Instead, Chapter 12 would \n     offer farmers the opportunity to negotiate with their \n     creditors. This benefits the farm family, their creditors and \n     rural businesses.\n       Please act quickly. Every day that Congress delays on \n     Chapter 12 has a direct cost to our nation's family farmers \n     and rural communities.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Corn Growers Association.\n       Association of Chapter 12 Trustees.\n       Community Food Security Coalition.\n       Family Farm Defenders.\n       Farm Aid.\n       Farm Wives United (New York).\n       Federation of Southern Cooperatives.\n       Livestock Marketing Association.\n       National Bankruptcy Conference.\n       National Catholic Rural Life Conference.\n       National Family Farm Coalition.\n       National Farmers Union.\n       New York Sustainable Agriculture Working Group (NYSAWG).\n       Northeast States Association for Agricultural Stewardship \n     (NSAAS).\n       Rural Advancement Foundation International (RAFI-USA).\n       Rural Coalition/Coalicion Rural.\n       Southern Sustainable Agriculture Working Group (SSAWG).\n       Soybean Producers of America.\n       Women, Food, and Agriculture.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 771, H.R. 2608.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2608) to reauthorize the National Earthquake \n     Hazards Reduction Program, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to speak in relation to the H.R. \n2608, the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization \nAct,\n\n[[Page S10612]]\n\nwhich passed with a substitute amendment by unanimous consent.\n  Earthquakes are some of the world's most dangerous natural hazards. \nThey can seem to strike with sudden unpredictability, and can affect a \nlarge area causing damage miles away from the epicenter. The National \nEarthquake Hazards Reduction Program, NEHRP, was created in 1977 to \nconduct basic research about earthquakes and develop strategies, such \nas stricter building codes, to mitigate the effects of them. The NEHRP \nprogram is composed of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, \nin the Department of Homeland Security's Emergency Preparedness and \nResponse, EP, Directorate; the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology, NIST; the U.S. Geological Survey, USGS; and the National \nScience Foundation, NSF.\n  The 6.0 magnitude earthquake that struck Parkfield, California last \nweek demonstrated both the dangers of earthquakes and the success of \nthe NEHRP program. Because of the strong building codes and \npreparations developed by NEHRP and taken by the people of Parkfield, \nthere were no fatalities.\n  This bill would authorize the NEHRP program from Fiscal Year, FY, \n2005 through FY 2009. In addition, it would make a number of reforms to \nthe program, including designating NIST as the program's lead agency \nand establishing an Interagency Coordinating Committee and an Advisory \nCommittee on Earthquake Hazards Reduction to improve the program's \ncoordination and implementation.\n  This bill also would require the Director of the Office of Science \nand Technology Policy to establish a National Windstorm Impact \nReduction Program consisting of representatives from NIST, NSF, FEMA, \nand the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA. The \npurpose of this program would be to improve our understanding of \nwindstorms and how they affect our communities. We recently witnessed \nthe devastation to Florida by Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and \nJeanne. Congress should recognize the importance of windstorm research \nto develop ways to reduce future damage from hurricanes, tornadoes, and \nother such phenomena.\n  Finally, the bill would authorize funding for the Federal Aviation \nAdministration's Office of Commercial Space Transportation from FY 2005 \nthrough FY 2009. SpaceShipOne demonstrated yesterday that we are at the \nbeginning of a new age in space travel, in which private citizens will \nbe able to finance, operate, and travel in their own vehicles. It is \nvital that this office be adequately funded to ensure that the \ngovernment plays an appropriate oversight role in this promising field.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their support of this \nlegislation, and ask unanimous consent that my statement be printed in \nthe Record.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nsubstitute amendment to H.R. 2608, the National Earthquake Hazards \nReduction Program Reauthorization Act. I fully support this amendment. \nThe first two titles in this substitute amendment were distinct bills, \neach extremely important to fighting the respective hazard. I want to \nthank Senator Bill Nelson and Senator Hutchison for their work in bring \nthe wind title to the committee's attention.\n  Earthquakes are deadly natural hazards that arrive without warning \nand can claim thousands of lives. For example, a 6.6 magnitude \nearthquake in Iran last year killed 30,000 people, while a similar \nmagnitude quake in California killed two people. Thousands of lives \nhave been saved as a result of the fine research conducted through the \nNational Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program. I support the earthquake \ntitle of the substitute amendment, but I want to reiterate that the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology needs greater funding if \nit is to fulfill its new role as the lead agency in this program. I \nhope that my colleagues will see to it that this excellent agency has \nthe resources it needs to continue to develop standards that protect \nthe public.\n  Building codes work. The hurricanes we've seen in the past month \nprove that. According to the St. Petersburg Times, houses built before \nthe building codes were revised in 1992, as a result of Hurricane \nAndrew, were blown off their foundations. Houses built after new \nbuilding codes were in place are still standing. These disasters cost \nthe country several billion dollars in damage each year. By \nestablishing a national program to improve design and engineering to \nprotect against windstorms, we can save not only money, but more \nimportantly lives.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nwindstorm impact reduction bill, a bill included in the earthquake bill \nbefore the Senate for consideration today. The windstorm bill, \nsupported in the Senate by me and Senator Hutchison and by \nRepresentatives Moore and Neugebauer in the House, sets up a national \nprogram to reduce the loss of life and property due to windstorms.\n  It is an understatement to say that the four hurricanes that hit \nFlorida--Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne--in the last 6 \nweeks demonstrate the great need for this legislation. More than 70 \nlives were lost, and homes, businesses, roads and bridges were \ndevastated by the hurricanes. It is estimated that the losses from \nthese hurricanes will surpass the $20 billion in losses from Hurricane \nAndrew in 1992, the costliest hurricane ever.\n  It is imperative that the amount of destruction suffered by the State \nof Florida never be repeated again. This bill will give us the tools to \nprotect our communities from future material losses and to reduce human \nsuffering. An interagency working group consisting of representatives \nof the National Science Foundation, the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology and the Federal Emergency Management Agency will be \nresponsible for planning and managing this program.\n  The program will have three goals: No. 1, improved understanding of \nwindstorms; No. 2, windstorm impact assessment; and No. 3, windstorm \nimpact reduction. We will achieve these goals through data collection \nand analysis, outreach, technology transfer, and research and \ndevelopment.\n  As a result of this program, we will translate existing and future \ninformation and research findings into cost-effective and affordable \npractices for design and construction professionals, and State and \nlocal officials. And this Interagency group will provide biennial \nupdates of their progress to Congress so we know what progress has been \nmade and what more needs to be done.\n  We'll also get a broad cross-section of interests involved through an \nadvisory committee--so that real life issues are addressed and on-site \nexpertise is utilized. Any my hope is that the devastation of \nHurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne will never be experienced \nagain in my State of Florida or in any other State.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the McCain \nsubstitute amendment which is at the desk be agreed to; the bill, as \namended, be read a third time and passed; the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; and that any \nstatements related to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3983) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The bill (H.R. 2608), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/06/senate-section/article/S10612-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10612-S10613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BELARUS DEMOCRACY ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, also I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 854 which is at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 854) to provide for the promotion of \n     democracy, human rights and rule of law in the Republic of \n     Belarus, and for the consolidation and strengthening of \n     Belarus sovereignty and independence.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am today in support of H.R. 854, the \nBelarus Democracy Act. Alexander Lukashenka, President of Belarus, is \nthe last remaining dictator in Europe. After orchestrating an illegal \nand unconstitutional referendum in November 1996, enabling him to \nimpose a new\n\n[[Page S10613]]\n\nconstitution, abolish the duly-elected parliament, and install a \nlargely powerless national assembly, he has progressively abolished the \npreviously existing democracy in that country.\n  Belarusian authorities under Lukashenka's control have mounted a \nmajor systematic crackdown on civil society through the closure, \nharassment, and repression of non-governmental organizations and \nindependent trade unions. Three leaders of the democratic forces in \nBelarus--Victor Gonchar, Anatoly Krasovsky, and Yuri Zakharenka--and \none critical journalist, Dmitry Zavadsky, have disappeared and are \npresumed dead. Former Belarus Government officials have made credible \nallegations, with evidence, that officials of the Lukashenka regime \nwere involved in the disappearances. Lukashenka's administration has \nrepressed freedom of speech and expression, has reversed the revival of \nBelarusian language and culture, and has harassed religious groups.\n  The Government of Belarus has made no substantive progress in \naddressing criteria established in 2000 by the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe to end repression and the climate of \nfear, permit functioning independent media, ensure transparency of the \nelection process, and strengthen the functions of parliament. The \ncampaign for the parliamentary elections to be held October 17 has not \nbeen fair. Lukashenka has also added a referendum to the ballot to \neliminate term-limits for the presidency so that he can run again in \n2006.\n  H.R. 854, the Belarus Democracy Act, authorizes funds to assist in \nthe observation of elections and the promotion of free and fair \nelectoral processes; the development of democratic political parties; \nradio and television broadcasting to and within Belarus; the \ndevelopment of non-governmental organizations promoting democracy and \nsupporting human rights; the development of independent media within \nBelarus and from outside the country; international exchanges and \nprofessional training programs for leaders and members of the \ndemocratic forces; and other activities consistent with the purposes of \nthe Act.\n  Like most other legislation, this bill is not perfect. I would have \npreferred even stronger legislation. In fact, I had prepared such \nlegislation, which I planned to introduce in the form of an amendment \nto the State Department Authorization legislation if it had reached the \nSenate floor. My bill would have authorized, with specific numbers, \nincreased funding for the activities described above; would have \nstreamlined and tightened controls on exports to Belarus; and would \nhave imposed visa bans on Lukashenka and his inner circle.\n  Unfortunately, for unrelated reasons, the State Department \nAuthorization bill has not been brought up, and there is no time in the \nclosing days of the 108th Congress to introduce my legislation as a \nfree-standing bill.\n  Nonetheless, I strongly support H.R. 854. It makes unmistakably clear \nto President Lukashenka and his cohorts that the United States strongly \ndisapproves of his brutal authoritarian rule and that we intend to \ncontinue to oppose him. Lukashenka is an anachronism in twenty-first \ncentury Europe and is surely destined for the ash-heap of history. The \nBelarus Democracy Act may hasten this process. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport H.R. 854.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 854) was read the third time and passed.\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}]
