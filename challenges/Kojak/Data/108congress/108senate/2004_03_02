Mr. President, Senator McCain is not in the Chamber. We are \nready to proceed on our side. I think we should do the time \nproportionately, so that it will be equal, proponents and opponents of \nthe legislation, when going into a quorum call.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without objection, the \ntime will be equally charged.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2636\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk. I ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona, [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Reed, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Corzine, Mr. \n     Dodd, and Mr. Durbin, proposes an amendment numbered 2636.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as a strong defender of law-abiding \nAmericans' second amendments rights, today I join my colleagues, \nSenators Reed, DeWine, Lieberman, Chafee, and Dodd to offer a \nbipartisan compromise amendment to address what has become known as the \ngun show loophole.\n  Currently an individual can walk into a gun show and purchase a \nfirearm from either a federally licensed dealer or an unlicensed \ndealer. A background check is only performed on that individual if he \nor she buys a gun from a licensed dealer. There is no requirement--I \nrepeat, no requirement--for a background check of any kind when \npurchasing a firearm from an unlicensed dealer. This is a very \ndangerous loophole in the law and we are doing a disservice to the \nAmerican people if we allow it to remain open.\n  This amendment would close this dangerous loophole in our gun safety \nlaws in a way that is respectful of the rights of gunshop operators, \ngun show vendors, and gun show enthusiasts. It defines gun shows in a \nreasonable manner to cover only public events where at least 75 \nfirearms are offered for sale. It specifically exempts from regulation \nany private sale from the home, such as yard sales or estate sales. \nAdditionally, it exempts sales between members of hunt clubs, an \nexception that I know is important to a number of our colleagues who \nrepresent hunting and sporting clubs that occasionally sell, trade, or \nraffle firearms between club members.\n  The amendment would also create a new category of licensees who can \nbecome deputized to perform background checks for unlicensed sellers at \ngun shows. This licensee, who could even be a gun show employee, would \nenable any unlicensed vendor to conveniently have an instant \nbackground check performed when selling a firearm. In addition, this \namendment would allow States to graduate to an even faster instant \ncheck once they have sufficiently automated the records necessary to \nensure that a faster check does not sacrifice accuracy.\n\n  Why do we need this amendment? Some might point to tragedies such as \nColumbine, but as horrific as the massacre at Columbine was, where 11 \nyoung people needlessly lost their lives, that is not what drives the \nneed to close the gun show loophole. We need this amendment because \ncriminals and terrorists have exploited and are exploiting this very \nobvious loophole in our gun safety laws. We need this amendment because \nour second amendment rights do not extend to criminals who violate our \nlaws and terrorists who hate this country.\n  We need this amendment because, according to the NRA, ``hundreds of \nthousands'' of unlicensed firearms sales occur at gun shows each year. \nWe need this amendment because ATF has identified gun shows as the \nsecond leading source of firearms recovered from illegal gun \ntrafficking investigations.\n  We also need this amendment because my law-abiding constituents who \nattend gun shows in Arizona should not have to rub shoulders with the \nscum of the Earth who use this loophole to evade background checks to \nbuy firearms to peddle to God knows who. We need this because every one \nof the 15 leading gun trafficking States in America has not taken \naction to close the gun show loophole. Conversely, 11 of the 15 States \nwith the lowest level of interstate gun trafficking have taken action \nto close the gun show loophole.\n  When discussing the topic of gun safety, I often hear my colleagues \nsay things such as, let's enforce existing law before we make new ones. \nI completely agree and that is exactly what we are seeking to do today. \nWe are seeking to strengthen existing laws by closing an enormous, \ndangerous loophole.\n  I offer this amendment as one who counts himself as a strong \nsupporter of the underlying legislation to protect the gun industry \nfrom frivolous lawsuits. I plan to vote for the underlying bill because \nit is fundamentally unfair to blame a firearms manufacturer when a \ncriminal misuses a gun. But it is also unfair to the American people to \nknowingly leave open a gaping hole in our gun safety laws that \ncriminals and terrorists can and do easily exploit.\n  The last time the Senate considered similar legislation was in 1999, \nfollowing the school shootings at Columbine High School. Two amendments \nwere proposed to close the gun show loophole. One amendment received 51 \nvotes with then-Vice President Gore casting his deciding vote. I \nopposed that amendment because, frankly, I thought it defined gun shows \ntoo broadly, covering certain private sales from the home, at yard \nsales, estate sales, and between members of private hunt clubs, places \nthat obviously are not gun shows.\n  The second amendment which I supported also passed the Senate. \nUnfortunately, opponents of that amendment said it weakened the Brady \nlaw for licensed dealers and created new loopholes.\n  Today we offer a compromise proposal that is a reasonable, \nresponsible consensus. I urge this body not to let this opportunity \nslip by.\n  Opponents of today's amendment will make several arguments. I would \nlike to take a few moments to address them head on. It is important to \npoint out that this amendment is a modification of the legislation we \nintroduced last fall. This amendment contains none of the vendor \nnotification requirements contained in that bill. The vender \nnotification requirements in this amendment are the same as those that \npassed the Senate in 1999. Let me state that again for clarity. This \namendment does not contain the vendor notification provisions contained \nin S. 1807. They are gone.\n\n  We still hear that criminals don't obtain guns from gun shows and we \nwill\n\n[[Page S1949]]\n\nhear about a survey of State and Federal inmates conducted by the \nJustice Department showing that about 3 percent of prisoners obtained \ntheir guns from gun shows. Let me make a couple of points.\n  First, the survey was conducted in 1997. The gun show loophole didn't \nexist until December of 1993, so any criminal in prison for more than 3 \nyears or any criminal who had a firearm for at least 3 years would not \nhave had a reason to exploit this loophole.\n  Second, let's be clear to quote ATF field agent Jeff Fulton: ``Crime \nguns do originate at gun shows. That's been documented.'' In fact, the \nATF says gun shows are the second leading source of guns recovered in \nillegal trafficking investigations.\n  Some opponents of this amendment will say that background checks take \ntoo long for weekend gun shows. That may have been the case in 1999, \nbut today, thanks to the diligence of the Department of Justice, 91 \npercent of criminal background checks are completed within several \nminutes and over 95 percent of background checks are completed within 2 \nhours.\n  For 19 out of 20 background checks, instant check has lived up to its \nname. For the 1 out of 20 checks that take more than 2 hours, these \napplicants are 20 times more likely to be unlawful than the rest of the \napplicants. Additionally, this amendment encourages States to improve \ntheir records, making them eligible for even faster background checks.\n  I point out again that 91 percent of criminal background checks are \ncompleted within several minutes; 95 percent, within 2 hours.\n  Opponents say the background check requirements would put gun shows \nout of business. That is not true. According to the Krause Gun/Knife \nShow Calendar, the definitive source of gun show information in the \nNation, in 2003, the 17 States that have closed the gun show loophole \nhave hosted, on average, more gun shows than the 33 States that have \nnot closed the loophole.\n  I repeat, the 17 States that have taken action to close the gun show \nloophole hosted, on average, 45 gun shows in 2003. The other 33 States, \non average, 41 gun shows.\n  I am a gun show supporter. Arizona is a big gun show State. This \namendment will have zero effect on legitimate gun show businesses.\n  This amendment has been endorsed by the International Association of \nChiefs of Police, Major Cities Chiefs of Police, the Conference Of \nMayors--the list goes on and on with those who have to deal with the \nresults of guns obtained illegally.\n  Let me say that the administration has said they want a ``clean \nbill.'' The administration has supported closing the gun show loophole \nbut now they want a ``clean bill.'' Wink-wink, nod-nod. It is \nremarkable. It is remarkable. This loophole needs to be closed. The \nadministration has had the position that it needs to be closed. We all \nknow it needs to be closed.\n  There were two State referendums in the 2002 election, in Colorado, \nnot notoriously a liberal State, and Oregon, not notoriously a \nconservative State. Both of those ballot initiatives carried \noverwhelmingly when taken to the people instead of the incredible \ninfluence of the NRA over this process.\n  I hope my friends will stand with the police chiefs and mayors and \nthose who are required to enforce the law and vote for this amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Rhode Island has agreed to \ngive 2 minutes to Senator Lautenberg, and on the time I control I will \ngive him 2 minutes for a total of 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized \nfor 4 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues on both sides \nwho support this gun show loophole amendment.\n  We have just heard Senator McCain make a case to close this loophole. \nThere doesn't seem to be any reason on Earth that this loophole should \nexist. We are talking about allowing felons, criminals generally, and \nterrorists to buy guns without any identification. It is hard to \nunderstand why something such as this can occur.\n  Back in 1999, I authored the original gun show loophole closure to \nrequire that sales at gun shows require the same background checks that \nlicensed gun dealers are required to perform under the Brady law. The \nbill passed in 1999 after Vice President Gore cast the deciding vote to \nbreak a 50-50 vote on the measure. Unfortunately, those who want to buy \nguns--who might be criminals, and again terrorists--decided to kill \nthis bill in conference. This loophole has continued to exist.\n  I am sure the American people will not be able to understand in \ngeneral what this loophole is about. Why do we want to protect the \nrights of those who would evade the law to get guns? As long as this \nloophole is around, our other gun laws mean virtually nothing. Does it \nmatter if there are background checks by licensed gun dealers if the \nconvicted felon can walk into a gun show and get a weapon with no \nquestions asked? Right now, gun shows are cash and carry for firearms. \nTerrorists, criminals, and the mentally unstable can get anything they \nwant at a gun show from one of these unlicensed dealers. It has to \nstop. For the life of me, I cannot understand why those who want to see \nguns generally available under their interpretation of what the second \namendment means would resist this. It is not understandable by any \nmeasure.\n  We know the people who got the guns for the Columbine massacre got a \nweapon which was a measure of an assault weapon illegally from a \nnonlicensed dealer.\n  When firearms are available to terrorists with instructions from \ntheir headquarters in Afghanistan to go to the United States; you can \nbuy guns at a gun show; never tell who you are and never identify \nyourself, doesn't make any sense at all.\n  I hope my colleagues will take a second look at this and say: OK, \nthis one we have got to patch up. But we do not hear that from those \nwho would defend this arcane and ridiculous process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this bipartisan \namendment to close the gun show loophole.\n  Americans overwhelmingly favor responsible gun safety measures. They \nwant effective background checks for firearm purchases, whether the \npurchases take place at a gun store, a gun show, or any other large \ngathering.\n  The gun show loophole allows firearms to be purchased illegally at \ngun shows--no questions asked. The result has been the sale of massive \nnumbers of firearms to terrorists, criminals, juveniles, and other \nprohibited purchasers without background checks.\n  In 2001, Attorney General Ashcroft appeared at an oversight hearing \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee. He held up an al-Qaida terrorist \nmanual, to make the point that terrorists were being trained on ``how \nto use America's freedom as a weapon against us.''\n  When I questioned the Attorney General at the hearing, I held up a \ndifferent terrorist training manual entitled, ``How Can I Train Myself \nfor Jihad,'' which had been found in a house in Afghanistan that \nNovember. As the manual stated:\n\n       In other countries, e.g. some states of USA . . . it is \n     perfectly legal for members of the public to own certain \n     types of firearms. If you live in such a country, obtain an \n     assault rifle legally . . . learn how to use it properly and \n     go and practice in the areas allowed for such training.\n\n  There is a long list of examples of terrorists exploiting weaknesses \nand loopholes in the Nation's gun laws. In 2000, a member of the \nterrorist group Hezbollah in the Middle East was convicted in Detroit \non weapons charges and conspiracy to ship weapons and ammunition to \nLebanon. He had bought many of those weapons at gun shows in Michigan.\n  In 1999, only a lack of cash prevented two persons from purchasing a \ngrenade launcher at a gun show, in a plot to blow up two large propane \ntanks in suburban Sacramento.\n  Enough is enough. Since the atrocities of September 11, Congress has \nacted with strong bipartisan support to win the war on terrorism and \nprotect the country from future attacks. We have improved the security \nof our airports and borders. We have strengthened our defenses against \nbioterrorism. We have given law enforcement new powers to investigate \nand prevent terrorism.\n\n[[Page S1950]]\n\n  Clearly, we need to strengthen our defenses against gun violence. The \nbest way to start is by closing the gaping loopholes in our gun laws \nthat allow rogue gun dealers to sell guns to criminals, terrorists, and \nother prohibited purchasers. According to the ATF, gun shows are now \nthe second leading source of firearms confiscated in illegal gun \ntrafficking investigations. Gun shows accounted for nearly 31 percent \nof the 84,000 guns illegally diverted during one 30-month period. Even \nthe strongest opponents of gun control understand the need to confront \nthis rampant law-breaking. Closing the gun show loophole will \nstrengthen the safety and security of all Americans.\n  This amendment will not shut down gun shows. It will not prevent gun \nenthusiasts and other lawful purchasers from buying and selling guns.\n  Instead, it requires background checks to take place at any event \nwhere more than 75 guns are offered for sale. These checks can be \nconducted by licensed sellers or by gun show operators or their \nemployees who have been certified by the Justice Department. This this \ncertification option, background checks can be completed quickly and \naccurately.\n  Since its enactment in 1994, the Brady law's background check system \nhas truly become an ``instant'' check system. According to the Attorney \nGeneral, 91 percent of background checks are completed in 3 minutes or \nless. A 3-minute wait is not a significant inconvenience for a gun \npurchase. And 95 percent of all background checks are completed within \n2 hours. The maximum amount a buyer can be forced to wait is 3 business \ndays. Under this amendment, the period will be reduced to 24 hours for \nStates with sufficiently automated background check records.\n  I commend my colleagues, Senator McCain, Senator Reed, Senator \nDeWine, and Senator Lieberman, for their leadership on this important \nissue, and I urge all my colleagues to do now what we should have done \nyears ago. It is time to put the interest of law enforcement and public \nsafety above the interests of the gun lobby. Let's close the gun show \nloophole, once and for all.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am very proud to join Senators \nMcCain, Reed, DeWine and our other cosponsors in proposing and \nsupporting this critical amendment. Too often gun legislation has \ndivided Members of Congress. This is a proposal that should not do \nthat. This is a proposal that builds on common values we all share as \nAmericans. As citizens of this great Republic, we all recognize that we \nhave rights and we have responsibilities. Among our rights is the right \nto own guns. Among our responsibilities are the responsibilities to use \nthose guns safely and to make sure that those who are neither law-\nabiding nor peaceful are permitted access to deadly force.\n  For several decades, our Nation has had a clear policy against \nallowing convicted felons to buy guns, because we know that mixing \ncriminals and firearms far too often yields violent results. That same \ninsight has caused us to agree that it causes too great a risk to \nsociety for a number of other groups of people to buy guns--those under \nfelony indictments, who are fugitives from justice, who are subject to \nrestraining orders and who are convicted spouse abusers.\n  Through the Brady law, we established what seems like an obvious \ncorollary to that policy a requirement that those selling guns first \ndetermine whether someone trying to buy a firearm isn't supposed to get \none. The Brady law has been an enormous success. Since its enactment, \nbackground checks have stopped almost one million gun sales to those \nwho by law aren't allowed to own guns. The majority of stopped sales \ninvolve convicted criminals or those under felony indictment. Stopping \nthese nearly one million transactions has saved an untold number of our \ncitizens from the violence, injury or death the sale of many of these \nguns would have brought.\n  Importantly, this life-saving legislation has brought its benefits \nwith the most minimal of impact on the law-abiding citizens who have \nthe right to buy guns. Over 90 percent of background checks are \ncompleted immediately; 95 percent within 2 hours. In other words, the \nvast, vast majority of those seeking to buy guns suffer no \ninconvenience whatsoever from these virtually instant background \nchecks. But, again, the benefits to the rest of us, to those who have \nbeen saved from the violence that could have resulted from just a \nfraction of those nearly one million sales stopped by the Brady law--\nthose benefits are incalculable.\n  Unfortunately, the Brady law contained a loophole that has since been \nexploited to allow criminals and others who aren't legally allowed to \nbuy guns to evade the background check requirement by buying their guns \nat gun shows. The problem is that Brady applies only to Federal \nFirearms Licensees, so-called FFLs--people who are in the business of \nselling guns. Brady explicitly exempts from the background check \nrequirement anyone ``who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or \npurchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or \nfor a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of \nfirearms.'' As a result, any person selling guns as a hobby or only \noccasionally, whether at a gun show, flea market or elsewhere, need not \nobtain a Federal license and therefore has no obligation to conduct a \nbackground check. This means that any person wanting to avoid a \nbackground check can go to a gun show, find out which vendors are not \nFFLs, and buy a gun. This situation is dangerous not only because it \nallows convicted felons and other prohibited persons to buy guns, but \nalso because--in contrast to FFLs--non-FFLs have no obligation to keep \nrecords of the transaction, thereby depriving law enforcement of the \nability to trace the gun if it later turns up at a crime scene.\n  Now I know that some argue that there is no gun show loophole, or \nthat if there is one, it has little or no consequence. That's just \nwrong. But don't just believe me on this--listen to a report by the \ngovernment agency charged with investigating gun trafficking. In June \n2000, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms issued a report in \nwhich they stated: ``The access to anonymous sales and large numbers of \nsecondhand firearms makes gun shows attractive to criminals. . . . \n[G]unshows were associated with the diversion of approximately 26,000 \nfirearms.'' The report went on to describe an ATF review of gun show \ninvestigations, which it said:\n\n     shows that prohibited persons, such as convicted felons and \n     juveniles, do personally buy firearms at gun shows and gun \n     shows are sources of firearms that are trafficked to such \n     prohibited persons. The gun show review found that firearms \n     were diverted at and through gun shows by straw purchasers, \n     unregulated private sellers, and licensed dealers. Felons \n     were associated with selling or purchasing firearms in 46 \n     percent of the gun show investigations. Firearms that were \n     illegally diverted at or through gun shows were recovered in \n     subsequent crimes, including homicide and robbery, in more \n     than a third of the gun show investigations.\n\n  Our amendment will change that. We will make sure that no one will be \nable to buy a gun at a gun show without it first being determined \nwhether that person is a convicted felon, a spouse abuser or a member \nof one of the other categories of people we all agree should not be \nallowed to buy guns.\n  Our bill does this, though, by respecting the rights of law-abiding \ngun owners and taking into account some of the concerns that were \nexpressed about previous efforts to close this loophole. At the outset, \nlet me emphasize that background checks at gun shows will be no more \nburdensome than those that so successfully and efficiently have been \nconducted over the past decade, with minimal intrusion on the rights of \nlaw abiding citizens. Again, over 90 percent of checks produce \nimmediate answers and 95 percent yield results in under two hours. Just \nas importantly, there's nothing in the experience of those states that \nhave already closed the gun show loophole to suggest that gun \nshows will suffer as a result of closing this dangerous loophole. \nAccording to the Americans for Gun Safety, gun shows are thriving in \nthe States where background checks are required. Pennsylvania, which \nclosed the loophole in 1995, hosts the second most gun shows of any \nState in the country. And of the top 5 gun show States, three \nPennsylvania, Illinois and California--require background checks or a \nfirearms ID card for gun purchases.\n\n  But we understand the concerns some have expressed--that a bill \nclosing the\n\n[[Page S1951]]\n\ngun show loophole will somehow extend beyond gun shows into small \nprivate sales from someone's home or will create a barrier so high that \ngun shows won't be able to operate. We've made sure that won't happen. \nFirst, our bill has a simple definition of a gun show--an event where \n75 or more guns are offered or exhibited for sale--and we make clear \nthat that definition doesn't include sales from a private collection by \nnonlicensed sellers out of their homes.\n  Second, to respond to the argument that previous proposals made it \ntoo difficult for nonlicensed sellers to fulfill the background check \nrequirement, our bill makes sure that nonlicensed sellers will have \neasy access to someone who can initiate background checks for them, by \ncreating a new class of licensee whose sole purpose will be to initiate \nbackground checks at gun shows.\n  Third, we have tried to respond to those who say that a three-day \ncheck is too long for gun shows, because those events only last a \ncouple of days. It is worth noting yet again that the length allowed \nfor the check doesn't affect the overwhelming majority of gun \npurchasers, because over 90 percent of checks are completed almost \ninstantly. But to allay the concerns that have been expressed, we have \ncome up with a compromise that authorizes a State to move to a 24-hour \ncheck for nonlicensed dealers at gun shows when the State can prove \nthat a 24-hour check is feasible. A State can prove that by showing \nthat 95 percent of the records that would disqualify people in that \nState from buying guns are computerized and searchable by the NICS \nsystem. And, because of the particular need to keep guns out of the \nhands of spouse abusers, the bill specifically provides that a State \nmust have computerized 95 percent of its domestic violence misdemeanor \nand restraining order records dating back 30 years before it is \neligible to go to a 24-hour check at gun shows.\n  Putting all of these provisions together, I frankly cannot understand \nwhy reasonable people would oppose this amendment. If we all agree that \ncriminals, spouse abusers and the like shouldn't be able to buy guns, \nwhy in the world aren't we doing a very simple thing and saying that \njust like the person who sells at a gun store has to do a background \ncheck, the person who sells at a gun show does too. All this bill does \nis make sure that we have an effective means to implement something \nupon which there has been a national consensus for decades--that \ncriminals and other people we all agree shouldn't own guns can't buy \nthem.\n  Now I know that there are many who argue that what we need to solve \nthe gun violence problem are not new laws, but the enforcement of \nexisting ones. I agree with part of that statement, and firmly support \nefforts to crack down on those who violate our gun laws. But I believe \nwe must go farther than that, because we will never be able to enforce \nexisting laws unless we close the loopholes in them that criminals \nexploit. And we all know that there is a big loophole in the provision \nsaying that felons and spouse abusers aren't supposed to buy guns, and \nthat is that criminals know that if they go to a gun show, they will be \nable to avoid the background check that was set up to keep them from \ngetting guns.\n  Gun crime remains a critical public safety problem. For too long, \ndifferences over finding a solution to that problem have unnecessarily \ndivided the Congress, and the American people have been left to suffer \nthe violent consequences. But the reality is that most of us agree on \nmost of the critical questions. We agree that the laws on the books \nshould be enforced, that the rights of law-abiding gun owners should be \nprotected, and that convicted felons and spouse abusers shouldn't be \nable to get guns. Again, I believe law abiding citizens have every \nright to own guns, but we also all share in the responsibility of \nkeeping our society safe and keeping guns out of the hands of those who \nshouldn't have them. This amendment would write those principles into \nlaw. I hope all of my colleagues support it.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senator from California is now on the \nfloor to offer her amendment. So we can expedite matters, under the \nunanimous consent agreement, the McCain-Reed amendment is to be set \naside for the purposes of the introduction of an amendment by the \nSenator from California.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2637\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself, \n     Mr. Warner, Mr. Schumer, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Levin, Mr. Chafee, \n     Mr. Dodd, Mr. Jeffords, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Reed, \n     Mr. Lautenberg, and Ms. Mikulski, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2637.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for a 10-year extension of the assault weapons \n                                  ban)\n\n       On page 11, after line 19, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 5. ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN REAUTHORIZATION.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Assault Weapons Ban Reauthorization Act of 2004''.\n       (b) 10-Year Extension of Assault Weapons Ban.--Section \n     110105 of the Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use \n     Protection Act (18 U.S.C. 921 note) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 110105. SUNSET PROVISION.\n\n       ``This subtitle and the amendments made by this subtitle \n     are repealed September 13, 2014.''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that I have 10 \nminutes to speak on the amendment. I ask the Chair to alert me when 5 \nminutes have passed. I will then cede time to Senator Warner for 2 \nminutes and to Senator Schumer for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this amendment is offered on behalf of \nSenators Warner, Schumer, DeWine, Levin, Chafee, Dodd, Jeffords, Boxer, \nClinton, Reed, Lautenberg, and Mikulski.\n  This is an ad from this morning's Washington Post. It says:\n\n       Senators, if police officers sat in your seats today, do \n     you think they'd vote to put Uzi's and AK-47's back on the \n     streets?\n\n  That clearly is the question before the Senate this morning.\n  It is going to be a very close vote. However, that is the issue. That \nwill be the result, if this legislation is not reauthorized for another \n10 years.\n  The legislation has the support of 77 percent of the American people, \nand 66 percent of gun owners. It does not remove a legal gun owner from \nhis weapon, and it has reduced traces of assault weapons to crimes by \ntwo-thirds in the last 10 years. I stand by those figures.\n  We believe the assault weapons legislation should be reauthorized. It \nwas enacted in 1994 for 10 years. That 10 years is up on September 13.\n  There is a broad coalition of organizations including every single \nlaw enforcement organization in this country supporting it, from the \nInternational Chiefs of Police to the Fraternal Order of Police, to \nvirtually every civic group supporting reauthorization of this \nlegislation.\n  I very much hope the votes are present in the Senate this morning.\n  Another interesting note is that on the one hand we are accused, \nwell, it is just cosmetic; it doesn't work. If it is just cosmetic and \nit doesn't work, then why this enormous effort to prevent the bill from \nbeing reauthorized?\n  Additionally, the legislation contains a written exemption by name \nfor 670 weapons. So no one in the United States who legally possessed \none of these assault weapons has had those assault weapons taken away. \nBut what we believe is the legislation which stops the manufacture and \nthe sale of semiautomatic assault weapons has been effective. It also \nstops the domestic manufacture of clips, drums, or strips of more than \n10 bullets. No hunter needs more than 10 bullets. No person for defense \nneeds more.\n  I am very hopeful this morning we will in a sense look to the law \nenforcement community and sustain a vote to reauthorize the assault \nweapons legislation for another 10 years.\n  I now yield 2 minutes of my time to the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Virginia, Mr. John Warner.\n\n[[Page S1952]]\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague from \nCalifornia. I salute her leadership on this measure.\n  I am very hopeful we can persuade the Senate this morning to continue \nthis legislation.\n  Might I say that when first introduced, it was somewhat different \nthan what the President indicated he would support. At my request, the \nSenator conformed her bill so it is precisely the legislative measure \nto which the President of the United States has indicated he would lend \nhis support.\n  I could say many things about this bill. But in the time constraints \nwe have, law enforcement was the pivotal decision which switched me \nfrom 10 years ago voting against this measure, to today not only \nstanding here to vote for it but joining in the leadership of the \nSenator from California to get it passed. Law enforcement has shown it \nhas reduced the use of these weapons in crime.\n  My words pale in significance to the law enforcement officers from \nthe four corners of the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n  The sheriff of Amherst County, the chief of police of Blacksburg, the \nchief of police of the town of Vienna, the chief of police of \nWaynesboro, the acting chief of police of Fairfax County, the sheriff \nof the city of Alexandria, the chief of police of Roanoke, the chief of \npolice of Virginia Beach, the chief of police of Chesapeake, the chief \nof police of Portsmouth, the sheriff of Roanoke City, the chief of \npolice of Newport News, the chief of police of Winchester, the chief of \npolice of the city of Alexandria, the chief of police of Arlington \nCounty, the chief of police of Staunton, the chief of police of Salem, \nthe sheriff of Rockingham County, and the chief of police of Norfolk--\nthe four corners of the Commonwealth of Virginia. These law enforcement \nofficers come forward to support this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The Senator has used 2 minutes of \nthe time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished Senator from Virginia for \nhis leadership on this issue. We are delighted he is a major sponsor of \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, inadvertently the name of the Senator from Illinois, \nMr. Durbin, was left off the bill as a cosponsor. I ask unanimous \nconsent it be added.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield 2 minutes of my time to the distinguished \nSenator from New York, Mr. Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Schumer is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I, too, salute both my colleagues for their superb \nleadership on this issue. This bill, the assault weapons ban, is \nhanging by a thread. There is no good reason on God's green Earth why. \nIt has been a success in preventing crimes. It has not hurt a single \nlaw-abiding gun owner. Yet we are here today at the eleventh hour \nworrying and wondering whether this legislation will be renewed. If it \nis not renewed, it is a giant step backwards, I say to my colleagues.\n  How can we take it in the light of 10 years of experience which shows \nhow successful the legislation is? The number of guns, assault weapons, \n19 banned weapons, used in crimes has dramatically declined--by 300 \npercent. The number of individuals who have been hurt by this--hunters, \nsmall businesspeople, homeowners who want to protect themselves by \nhaving a gun--have not been hurt at all.\n  These are weapons of war. They are designed to kill a whole lot of \npeople quickly. They are not designed for hunting. They are not \ndesigned for self-defense of a homeowner or a store owner. The only \nreason we are here today is politics.\n  I plead with our President--he has said he is for the legislation \nafter the modification the good Senator from California made, so it is \nexactly the same as the bill we have had in effect--I plead to not just \nsimply state once or twice he is for this. One phone call, Mr. \nPresident, can pass this bill. Please, we need this legislation. I urge \nmy colleagues to reach into their consciences and pass it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this bipartisan \namendment to continue the Federal ban on assault weapons. The ban is \nnow scheduled to expire on September 13, 2004.\n  The fact that this common-sense and necessary ban requires any debate \nat all shows how misplaced and misguided our priorities on domestic \nsafety and security have become.\n  Even before 9/11, renewal of the assault weapons ban should have been \na no-brainer. After 9/11, to even consider letting the ban expire is \nabsurd.\n  Semi-automatic assault weapons are killing machines--nothing more, \nnothing less. They are intentionally designed to maximize their killing \npower by a rapid rate of fire. They are intended to be spray-fired from \nthe hip, so that the killer can fire many rounds in rapid succession.\n  Civilians have no need whatever for such military-style killing \nmachines. They are of no use for hunting, unless the goal is to \nobliterate the duck or deer being hunted. They are unnecessary and \nimpractical for self-defense, and they have no recreational value.\n  The purpose of these weapons is to facilitate crime. By the late \n1980s, assault weapons had become the weapon of choice for drug \ntraffickers, gangs, and other criminal organizations. Their high \nfirepower and ability to penetrate body armor exposed the police \nofficers to increased danger, and innocent bystanders were killed in \nindiscriminate assault-weapon shoot-outs in the streets.\n  Assault weapons have been used in a series of massacres:\n  In 1989, in an attack at Cleveland Elementary School in Stockton, CA, \nPatrick Purdy used an assault weapon to kill five small children and \nwound 29 others. Purdy fired off 106 rounds in less than two minutes.\n  In 1993, two CIA employees were killed outside the entrance to CIA \nheadquarters by a Pakistani national using an AK-47 assault rifle \nequipped with a 30-round magazine.\n  Also in 1993, eight persons were killed and six others were wounded \nat a San Francisco law firm by an assailant using two assault pistols \nwith 50-round magazines.\n  That's the kind of world we'll return to if Congress allows the \ncurrent ban on assault weapons to expire.\n  In fact, the ban contributed to a dramatic decrease in violent crime \nin the 1990s. Many of us remember the dire ``juvenile superpredator'' \npredictions that were in vogue before that reduction took place. In \n1996, William Bennett and John Walters had written that America was a \n``ticking crime bomb,'' faced with the ``youngest, biggest, and baddest \ngeneration'' of juvenile offenders that our country had ever known.\n  Fortunately, these predictions were wrong. From 1993 to 2001, arrest \nrates for violent juvenile crime declined by more than two-thirds. \nWe're still enjoying the benefits of this low crime rate today.\n  The decrease in crime is explained in large part by the sensible \nmeasures that Congress took on gun safety in the early 1990s, including \nthe ban on assault weapons. In 1999, the National Center for Juvenile \nJustice concluded that all of the increase in homicides by juveniles \nbetween the mid-1980s and mid-1990s was firearm-related. The U.S. \nSurgeon General concluded that guns were responsible for both the \nepidemic in juvenile violence in the late 1980s and the decrease in \nviolence after 1993. ``It is now clear,'' the Surgeon General wrote, \n``that the violence epidemic was caused largely by an upsurge in the \nuse of firearms by young people. . . . Today's youth violence is less \nlethal, largely because of a decline in the use of firearms.''\n  After Congress passed the assault weapons ban in 1994, fewer \ncriminals used assault weapons to kill and commit other crimes. \nAccording to the National Institute of Justice, requests to trace \nassault weapons--one of the best indicators of gun use in crimes--\ndeclined 20 percent in the first calendar year after the ban took \neffect. In 1995 and 1996, the number of assault weapons used in crime \nin Boston declined by 24 percent. In St. Louis, it declined by 29 \npercent.\n  With these proven results, why would anyone vote against \nreauthorization of the current assault weapons ban?\n  It's no surprise that the law enforcement community strongly supports \nthe\n\n[[Page S1953]]\n\nban. The amendment now before us is supported by: The International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police; the National Association of Police \nOrganizations; the National Organization of Black Police Officials; the \nInternational Brotherhood of Police Officers; the Hispanic American \nPolice Command Officers Association; the American Probation and Parole \nAssociation; the United States Conference of Mayors; and countless \nother religious, public health, and domestic violence organizations.\n  Congress needs to do more than renew the ban on assault weapons now \nin effect. We should make clear that the definition of assault weapons \nincludes ``copycat'' guns made by the gun industry with devious \ncosmetic changes to evade the 1994 law. We should ban parts kits that \ncan be bought through the mail and used to build assault weapons. We \nshould regulate the transfer of ``grandfathered'' assault weapons and \nfacilitate their tracing. We should ban high-capacity ammunition \nmagazines, and prohibit juveniles from buying or possessing assault \nrifles and shotguns. Senator Lautenberg has introduced a bill that \nwould do all of these things, and I commend him for his leadership.\n  What we absolutely cannot do is let the current ban on assault \nweapons expire. Such a failure would drastically undermine the safety \nof our streets, neighborhoods, and schools, and strengthen the hand of \nterrorists and other criminals.\n  We know that terrorists are now exploiting the weaknesses and \nloopholes in our gun laws. A terrorist training manual discovered by \nAmerican soldiers in Afghanistan in 2001 advised al Qaeda operatives to \nbuy assault weapons in the United States and use them against us. \nTerrorists are bent on exploiting weaknesses in our gun laws. Americans \nwill be at much greater risk if Congress fails to renew the ban on \nassault weapons.\n  We can't let that happen. I urge my colleagues to vote for this \nessential protection against crime and terrorism.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I strongly support the extension of the \nassault weapons ban. I want to commend Senators Feinstein and Schumer \nfor championing this important legislation for many years.\n  We need to close a number of loopholes in the current assault weapons \nban that have allowed gun manufacturers to make minor design changes to \nevade the law. One gun maker in my State has skirted the ban by \nreplacing the prohibited flash suppressor on one of its assault weapons \nwith non-prohibited muzzle breaks or compensators, which ironically \nreduce ``muzzle climb'' during rapid firing.\n  The actual functional elements of this assault weapon, however, have \nremained the same. The gun still fires a high volume of bullets over a \nlarge area. Such loopholes need to be closed, and I am pleased to co-\nsponsor legislation authored by Senator Launtenberg to further \nstrengthen the existing assault weapons ban.\n  The current assault weapons ban will expire in September. There are \nmany powerful reasons why extending the assault weapons ban must be a \ntop priority for the Congress this year.\n  First, assault weapon bans do work. According to the Department of \nJustice, the proportion of assault weapons traced to crimes has dropped \nby nearly two-thirds since 1995, the first year that the Federal ban \nwent into effect.\n  Between 1988 and 1991, assault weapons accounted for nearly 8 percent \nof guns used in crimes. In 1995, it plummeted to 3.6 percent. In 2002, \nit dropped even further to 1.2 percent. The ban on assault weapons is \ntherefore clearly making a difference in reducing crime and saving \nlives.\n  Second, assault weapons have a devastating impact on people's lives \nand on the safety of their communities. These aren't hunting weapons we \nare talking about. Nor are they for recreational or sporting use. We \nhave heard it said before that one does not need an AK-47 or an Uzi for \nduck hunting.\n  Quite simply, assault weapons are weapons of war. They are designed \nwith one purpose in mind--for slaughtering human beings over a wide \narea. They belong on a faraway battlefield, not on our Nation's \nstreets. However one feels about the Second Amendment, assault weapons \nhave no place in a civilized society.\n  If assault weapons end up in the wrong hands, the results can be \nhorrific. The increased firepower of these weapons has a particularly \ndevastating impact on its victims, who often suffer multiple gunshot \nwounds and severe penetrating trauma. It often takes longer for victims \nto recover from such injuries, placing significant burdens on scarce \nmedical resources.\n  Law enforcement officers are particularly vulnerable to assault \nweapons fire, since they are on the front lines protecting our \ncommunities from those gangs, drug traffickers, and even terrorist \ngroups who have made such firearms their weapons of choice. In the \nyears leading up to the enactment of the Federal ban, assault weapons \naccounted for 8 percent of all guns traced to crime, although they \ncomprised only 1 percent of privately owned guns in America.\n  Even with the Federal ban in place over the last decade, assault \nweapons have been implicated in the death of one in five police \nofficers killed in the line of duty between 1998 and 2001. It is no \ncoincidence then that numerous law enforcement organizations, including \ngroups devoted to protecting children's rights and stopping domestic \nviolence, support extending the ban on these deadly weapons.\n  In fact, it is really a matter of homeland security that these \nweapons must be taken out of the hands of criminals. A May 2003 \neditorial in The San Antonio Express News had it right when it said \nthat just as it is a priority for allied officials in Iraq to get AK-\n47s out of the hands of Iraqi civilians, Congress shouldn't let such \nmilitary-type weapons back on the streets of American cities by failing \nto extend the assault weapons ban. If terrorists can turn a jet \naircraft into instruments to kill Americans, does anyone think they \nwould hesitate for even one second to use an assault weapon for the \nsame purposes?\n  In addition to police officers being vulnerable to assault weapons, \nso are our children. These firearms were used to kill 5 children and \nwound 29 others in a Stockton, CA, schoolyard in 1989. The AK-47 used \nin this incident held a staggering 75 bullets. A TEC-9 assault weapon \nwas also used in the 1999 killing of a teacher, 12 students, and the \nwounding of more than 20 others at Columbine High School.\n\n  Connecticut was the fourth State in the Nation to ban assault \nweapons, after California, New Jersey and Hawaii. The National Rifle \nAssociation challenged the ban in Connecticut State court and it was \nupheld as constitutional in 1994. Federal courts have upheld the \nconstitutionality of the Federal ban on assault weapons as well. \nExtending the ban for another 10 years will save lives, prevent serious \ninjuries and make our communities safer from the tragic consequences of \ngun violence. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  One more point, one of the most surprising things I have learned in \nthis debate is that firearms, which are responsible for 29,000 deaths a \nyear, are specifically exempt from regulation under the Consumer \nProduct Safety Act.\n  Section 3(a)(1)(E) of the Act exempts firearms and ammunitions from \nthe definition of ``consumer products.'' This provision was inserted \ninto the Act in 1972 at the behest of the gun lobby. As a result, guns \nare among the only consumer products, along with tobacco, exempt from \nFederal health and safety regulations.\n  This fact is shocking. Even more shocking is the fact that firearms \ncause more deaths a year than the 15,000 consumer products regulated \nunder the Act combined.\n  Other potentially dangerous products--from cars to lawnmowers to \nhousehold products to medicines--are regulated to protect the health of \nthe American public. The fact that guns are already specifically exempt \nfrom the oversight of the Consumer Product Safety Commission is reason \nenough why we cannot afford to grant the firearm industry legal \nimmunity.\n  Strangely enough, toy guns are more heavily regulated than real guns, \ndespite the fact that toy guns do not kill or maim. There are over 140 \npages in the Code of Federal Regulations that apply to toys, but only \none paragraph devoted to guns, and that paragraph exempts guns from the \nConsumer Product Safety Act.\n\n[[Page S1954]]\n\n  Under the Act, toy guns fall under the standard for toys. At least \nfour types of Federal safety standards cover toys: if they have sharp \nedges and points, small parts, contain hazardous materials, and are \nflammable. The regulations even say that toy guns should have a bright \norange tip at the end of the barrel to distinguish them from real guns.\n  The lack of Federal health and safety regulations for guns has a \nnumber of serious consequences. It means that there is no way to recall \ndefective firearms. Guns that are manufactured poorly and pose a \nserious threat to gun owners and the public would remain in \ncirculation, with the government essentially unable to do anything \nabout it.\n  The lack of Federal regulation of firearms also means that there is \nno way to mandate the use of safety devices. And it means that there is \nno detailed data collection on deaths and injuries from guns.\n  Gun violence has a devastating impact on people's lives and their \ncommunities. The fact that toy guns are regulated and real guns are not \nmakes little sense, and I urge the Senate to eventually rectify it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 1 minute 10 \nseconds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator reserves her time and yields the \nfloor.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent request, this \namendment currently before the Senate, the Feinstein amendment, would \nbe set aside for the purposes of the introduction by our leader, \nSenator Frist, of the DC gun ban repeal. That amendment will not be \noffered today, so we are now on full debate for the balance of time \nuntil votes start at 11:30 on the two issues before the Senate and the \nbalance of the whole bill.\n  Certainly, there are other amendments besides the assault weapons ban \nintroduced by the Senator from California, the gun show loophole by \nSenators Reed and McCain. Also, we will have votes today, and it is \ncritical for Senators who want to debate on armor piercing by Kennedy \nand the Frist-Craig alternative, also on conceal and carry, offered in \nbehalf of Senator Ben Campbell, that some have debated.\n  For a few moments, let me debate one general topic. The clock has \nstarted for all of us on the 2-hour balance of time equally divided \nbetween us on this issue.\n  For a moment today, I will talk about attitudes of the American \npublic as it relates to the second amendment in the Senate today. The \nSenator from New York talked about why we are at the eleventh hour \ndebating the gun show loophole. We are because he and his colleagues \nintroduced it, obviously, believing it was a timely topic to debate at \na time when we have a very narrowly prescribed bill to deal with the \nlegitimacy of law-abiding citizens in the manufacture of firearms. He \nhas decided to add or attempt to add this to the bill. Our President \nhas asked for a clean bill.\n  Let me talk about where the American people are. Once again, we find \nourselves in a political season. And once again, we find ourselves \ndebating and arguing about gun ownership in America. The second \namendment is clear. Many who are strong advocates of that amendment \nbelieve it is extremely clear.\n  We have heard over the last several days Senators with honest \ndifferences of opinion take to the Senate floor and claim their vows to \nrepresent the folks back in their home States.\n  Let's take a few minutes to look at some of the relevant research \nfrom respected polling from the firm Zogby International. Zogby \nrecently surveyed 1,200 voters nationwide on firearms issues. As a \nconservative, I don't view Zogby as a conservative pollster; some call \nhim middle of the road, some call him middle left. I guess what I am \nsaying is Zogby and his polling are largely respected by many across \nthe country. The Zogby International group, working with the John \nGoodwin Tower Center for political science at Southern Methodist \nUniversity, looked at and decided to poll in a unique way. They said: \nLet's examine the difference between the George Bush States in 2000, \nthe red States, and the Al Gore States, the blue States. For the \nbalance of my comment, think red and think blue and remember that map \nwe saw after the last Presidential election when the vast majority of \nAmerica was red except for a few blue strips along the west coast line \nand the east coast line.\n  Here were the questions asked of 1,200 voters--not citizens, voters; \nthose who said they voted in the last election--as to the attitude of \nAmericans on firearms. They asked: Do you agree or disagree that \nAmerican firearm manufacturers that sell a legal product which is not \ndefective--meaning a quality product used for the intent of its \nmanufacture--should be allowed to be sued if a criminal used their \nproduct in a crime.\n\n  What are the answers? The answers are, there were enough laws on the \nbooks. In the Bush States, 69 percent agreed they should not be sued; \nin the Gore States, 63 percent agreed they should not be sued and they \nought not be sued; military people in those States, 70 percent; \nveterans, 71 percent; nonmilitary, on the average 66 percent. A very \nstrong majority of the American people made it very clear. The answer \ncame back loudly, from every demographic group opposed to these kinds \nof lawsuits.\n  That is why we have S. 1805 before the Senate. American minds are \nmade up. These are junk and frivolous lawsuits. They ought not be \nfiled. They also said a manufacturer of a product ought to be held \nliable if that product is defective, if it malfunctions, and if that \ndefectiveness or that malfunction might create an injury. That is \nexactly what we continue to allow to happen.\n  Opposition in the Bush States on that issue, 74 percent; while 72 \npercent of the voters in the Al Gore States voiced opposition. \nInterestingly, across the board those most strongly opposed to these \nlawsuits against the firearms industry are current members of the \nmilitary and their family. Their opposition collectively measured at 83 \npercent. This is not from a conservative right-wing pollster. This is \nfrom Zogby himself.\n  When certain gun organizations heard about this, they called the \nZogby polling group and asked, Are these valid? The answer from Zogby: \nYes, we ran them again. We were not so sure, and we believe they are \naccurate and valid.\n  Which of the following two statements regarding gun control comes \ncloser to your own opinion? Of course, those were the figures we showed \nin the first chart. There needs to be new and tougher gun law \nlegislation to help fight against crime. That is what we are debating \nnow in the Senate. That was question A: There are enough laws on the \nbooks. What is needed is better law enforcement of current laws \nregarding gun control, by a better than 2 to 1, 66 to 31.\n  In essence, the American people are saying no new gun laws; we have \nplenty of them on the books. That is not about laws but going after \ncriminals. That is common sense in America, and we never want to doubt \nthe common sense of the average American when they are well informed \nabout an issue or when they just suggest that somebody is playing \npolitics with an issue and it really does not make any sense.\n\n  Sixty-nine percent in the Bush States; 63 percent in the Gore States; \nand those numbers are extremely strong.\n  So what are we saying? We are saying that moderates solidly favor \nbetter law enforcement--62 percent to 34 percent. They are saying: \nLeave the gun owner alone. Gun control laws do not work.\n  Somehow, the American people have settled into understanding what \nmost people understand, with common sense: If you do not use the laws \nto go after the criminal element in our country, if you try to blame \ntheir problem on somebody else or their malfunctioning in society, and \nyou try to reach through and sue somebody else, the American people are \nsaying: No, we don't go there anymore and we won't tolerate that.\n  Those are the issues at hand. That is the underlying purpose for why \nwe are here today debating S. 1805. We think it is fundamental to the \nAmerican people to allow them to speak and say: Enough is enough; 30-\nplus lawsuits by\n\n[[Page S1955]]\n\nmunicipalities or political jurisdictions, and 21 of them already \nthrown out of the courts. Our courts are now full of many of these. \nHundreds of millions of dollars have been spent in defense of law-\nabiding manufacturers and licensed firearms dealers. It is time we say, \nno, if that third party is trying to be held unaccountable by going \nafter somebody else who is a law-abiding, legitimate citizen. Let's \nreturn to old, historic, fundamental tort law. It is the individual who \nis responsible for their actions, not someone else.\n  I think we were all taught that as a child. If we were not taught \nthat by our parents, then I guess I have to say shame on our parents \nbecause that is pretty fundamental. You are responsible for your \nactions. If you misact, you might be punished for it. In society, if \nyou misuse a gun, you ought to be punished for it instead of trying to \npass it on to somebody else who is a law-abiding citizen playing by the \nrules that society has laid down and of which our Constitution so \nclearly speaks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware, Mr. Carper.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Most Senators have already made up their minds on how they are going \nto vote on the proposal by Senator McCain and Senator Reed on closing \nthe gun show loophole. A few have not. What I would like to do is \ndirect my comments to them.\n  During my first term as Governor of Delaware, I remember a meeting I \nhad with law enforcement officers who came to see me. They wanted to \ntalk with me about something called the gun show loopholes.\n  As they went through their explanation, I said: Do I understand \ncorrectly, that if I happen to be a licensed gun dealer at a gun show \nin my State, and let's say Senator Reed over here is an unlicensed gun \ndealer at the same gun show, that I have to do an instant background \ncheck on the folks who want to buy a weapon from me, and if they do not \npass that instant background check, they can go over and buy the same \nweapon from my competitor?\n  They said: That's right.\n  For the life of me, at that time that made no sense, and for the life \nof me, it still does not make any sense.\n  I mentioned yesterday on the floor that my dad, who is now deceased, \nwas a gun collector. He had rifles and shotguns, a musket or two, \npistols of all kinds. He would buy weapons from guys he would hunt \nwith. They had an informal hunt club. He would buy weapons from \nrelatives, members of our family. He might go to a yard sale in the \nneighborhood where they lived in Florida and buy a weapon. He ought to \nhave been able to do that, and under the law, under this amendment that \nis offered today, he could still do those things, were he alive.\n  Let me close with this: Technology is going to help us solve this \nproblem. Technology can be a great way to solve this problem. Instant \nbackground checks make feasible what 10 years ago was not feasible and \nthe right thing to do.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields the floor.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nfrom my time.\n  I rise to support the McCain-Reed amendment and also the Feinstein \namendment. I am a cosponsor, obviously, of both amendments.\n  I wish to talk, for a moment, about the gun show loophole. It is \nclear and obvious to anyone--at least I believe it is--that we should \nnot have two different standards at a public gun show. We should not \nhave a situation where you can approach one seller who is a licensed \nfirearms dealer and in that transaction have to undergo a background \ncheck, and then, 5 feet away, have an unlicensed seller and be able to \npurchase a weapon without any type of background check.\n  These are public functions. Thousands of people stream through these \ngun shows. This is not a private sale where the seller and the buyer \nknow each other, have an association to each other, and essentially do \nnot need any kind of a background check. In order to prevent these gun \nshows from being exploited by criminals and terrorists, there has to be \na common standard. Every transaction should be governed by a background \ncheck at a public gun show.\n  We know these unlicensed dealers and these gun shows have been \nexploited by criminals. I have mentioned, over the course of the last \nseveral days of debate, numerous examples. Let me return to one.\n  Nigel Bostic and two accomplices were arrested for buying 239 \nfirearms at 11 Ohio gun shows and reselling them to criminals in \nBuffalo, NY.\n  It is a very obvious scheme. You go to a place, if you are a felon or \na criminal, that requires no background checks, that are publicly \nadvertised, that are easily accessible, you buy the weapons, take them \nto another State that has very tough laws, and you sell them to \ncriminals.\n  One of these weapons was recovered in a homicide. It has been \nreported that Bostic purchased 45 firearms at one of these sales; his \naccomplices, 85 guns.\n  These are the examples that will continue to take place unless we \nclose this gun show loophole. Indeed, it is obvious to gun owners it \nshould be closed. More than 80 percent of gun owners surveyed indicated \nthey support closing the gun show loophole. President Bush repeatedly, \nin the campaign of 2000, said he was for closing the gun show loophole.\n  The legislation that we present imposes no great burden on any \nparticipant at a gun show. Because of the National Instant Check \nSystem, 91 percent of these background checks are accomplished in less \nthan 5 minutes; 95 percent are accomplished in less than 2 hours. The \nremaining checks reveal, in many cases, prohibitive purchases. That is \nthe purpose of the check.\n  I think we can do something logical that is supported by the broad \nmajority of Americans, including gun owners, by closing this gun show \nloophole. I hope we can do it today.\n  But let me, before I conclude, make a general comment on the \nunderlying bill. We have heard the proponents of the bill talk a lot \nabout responsibility, that we have all been taught as children that if \nwe misuse a gun, we should be responsible for that.\n  Well, the underlying legislation is a license for irresponsibility. \nThe most salient example is Bull's Eye Shooter Supply gun store up in \nWashington State, the source of the weapons for the snipers who were \nplaguing this Washington metropolitan area.\n  There, the individual gun dealer apparently let weapons lay around. \nHe could not account for over 238 weapons. He did not inventory his \nweapons. That is what I call a misuse of a weapon. People were harmed \nby that misuse, but we are insulating that individual from any serious \nliability because there is no Federal law--and my colleagues on the \nother side are not likely to propose it--for strict control of the \nsecurity of weapons.\n  I am amazed about the statistics my colleague from Idaho cited about \nthe military support for no new weapons, et cetera. I tell you what. I \nserved for 12 years in the U.S. Army. If you told an Army officer there \nwas someone with hundreds of weapons, unsecured, lying around, subject \nto being shoplifted by teenagers, they would be appalled. Because the \nfirst thing you learn in the military is that you better secure those \nweapons, you better lock them up, you better inventory them, and do all \nthe things you have to do, not only to protect yourself but to ensure \nthose weapons do not fall into the wrong hands. This legislation, if \npassed, will be a license for irresponsible behavior, unconstrained by \nany civil suit that could not only compensate the victims but suggest a \nhigher level of care. So I hope that not only we support these \namendments but look seriously at the underlying bill.\n\n  I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the gun show loophole bill now being \nintroduced by Senator McCain and Senator Reed is before us for full \ndebate at this moment. Let me talk for a few moments about this issue \nand what it is\n\n[[Page S1956]]\n\nand what it is not, and what has been done and what has not been done.\n  I believe some of the language used on the floor deserves to be \nclarified for the Members who might be looking in. The Senator from \nRhode Island said yesterday that a good many States have already closed \nthe loophole. I think he meant that 15 States have preexisting \nprocesses. Long before you go to a gun show, if in fact you are in the \nmarket to purchase a gun, you pick up a permit by which to purchase. \nStates do backgrounds and have backgrounds and do that kind of thing.\n  He did mention, though, North Carolina and spoke greatly about how \nNorth Carolina had closed the loophole, and then gun shows flourished. \nWell, numbers are not any different in the number of gun shows. North \nCarolina requires a handgun permit to purchase a handgun. So they do a \ncheck, a normal check, the kind you would normally do. You have to have \nthat going in or coming out of a gun show to acquire from any activity, \nother than a one-on-one private sale. So to examine all of those \nissues, none of the States have the kind of regulatory structure that \nis being asked to be imposed on all gun shows in all States by the \nMcCain-Reed gun show amendment. Clearly, what we have is an effort to \ncreate a blanket Federal policy across 1,000 gun shows, attended by \nmillions of people annually, which is legal, responsible commerce.\n  Well, it has also been argued that gun shows are now the venue by \nwhich terrorists acquire firearms. It is interesting that the reason \nthey suggest that is because the terrorists who acquired a firearm \nthrough a gun show, or through a straw dealer who bought a firearm at a \ngun show, are arrested and in jail. Somehow the law must have worked. \nIt did work because if you are an illegal alien in this country, you \ncannot acquire a firearm. If you are a felon, you cannot acquire a \nfirearm. It catches up with you if you are a law breaker.\n  In this instance, those they know of are three. There were three they \ncan talk about. Does a purchase of three make the gun show venue a wide \nopen market for terrorist activities? Absolutely not. It never has and \nit never will.\n  What we know, what the statistics show from the Department of \nJustice, is that the reality would suggest there are possibly a couple \nof percentage points, 1.5, 2 percentage points, that we can actually \nunderstand as it relates to firearms obtained through gun shows, used \nin criminal activity.\n  The Bureau of Justice Statistics is, I believe, by far the most \nreputable accumulator of this kind of information. They suggest that it \nhas been a constant, all the way through, possibly about 1 percent. So \nthat is the reality we deal with on this issue.\n  Let me put forth another scenario. This is a question they cannot \nanswer because they have set up a major, new tripwire for an \nindividual.\n  Let's say an individual goes to a gun show. He or she looks around \nand they find a particular gun in which they are interested. It is not \nbeing offered by a licensed Federal firearms dealer; it is being \noffered by a collector or an individual who bought a table and has two \nor three firearms to sell. He likes it. The dealer or the person says, \ntake my card.\n\n  So he takes his or her card and he goes home and talks to his spouse; \nthe spouse says, you have enough guns, you don't need another gun. That \nconversation goes on for quite a while. Finally, they agree that maybe \nfor the collection, or for whatever purpose this citizen would want to \nown that gun, that they will buy it. They call the fellow on the \nbusiness card. The purchase goes about.\n  Now, has that gun been purchased illegally? I do believe under the \nReed-McCain amendment you have set up a major new tripwire for \ninnocent, law-abiding citizens who, after the fact of a gun show, \npurchase the gun.\n  It can be argued that it was outside the gun show, but the point of \ncontact was inside the room, inside the organized gun show.\n  What if 2 or 3 years later you realize that particular collector, who \nyou met at the gun show and visited with and you saw his particular \ncollection at the gun show, has that one firearm that you want to add \nto your collection? Does that point of contact, therefore, require, \nunder Reed-McCain, a background check? I believe it is a phenomenally \ngray area and a critical area for an awful lot of law-abiding citizens \nwho, once again, out of a desire to put up a law that doesn't work, \nwhen you create a Federal bureaucracy, you throw them into the middle \nof the bureaucracy when they in every way have been law-abiding \ncitizens. I believe that is a phenomenal risk to place on our citizens, \nand that is exactly what we are doing--placing a risk on a citizen when \nwe have never before said that this was a problem.\n  The ATF did research a few years ago and found out that less than 2 \npercent--1.7 percent--of firearms involved in criminal activity came \nfrom a gun show and they said, oh, there is a loophole. If there is a \nloophole in a gun show, there is one outside of a gun show. The laws \nthat pertain to every citizen outside the gun show today pertain inside \nthe gun show as well.\n  Yet McCain-Reed says that is not good enough. This is a special \nactivity--1,000 legal activities that go on across our Nation a year, \nand millions of people attend them not just to acquire a gun but to get \ninformation, to collect, do all kinds of things you do at normal shows.\n  So our Federal Government is going to decide to regulate one more \nactivity of commerce out there in the free marketplace. Why? To set up \na charade that hasn't worked and won't work any differently than it has \noutside the gun show.\n  Let's stay with the laws we have. Let's go after the criminal \nelement. Let's keep S. 1805 a clean bill so we can get it to the \nPresident for his signature.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nColorado. He has worked with us and has the concealed-carry bill we \nwill be voting on later today.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, before I make some comments on the amendment, No. \n2623, which we discussed Thursday, listening to the Senator's comments \nabout the so-called gun show loopholes and the point of contact, I \nmight ask, what if a person goes to a gun show and sees something he \nmight like and forgets about it and months later he sees it in a \nclassified ad of a newspaper and buys it through the classified ad in \nthe paper from the man who originally had it at a gun show the year \nbefore? Does that make the person liable who had the booth at a gun \nshow? I think this amendment complicates things rather than answers \nthings.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I think the Senator sees it clearly, as I see it. That has \nestablished a very big gray area. Of course, if that weapon fell into \nthe hands of a criminal who misused it, and if that trace came back, \nthat is a field day for a lawyer inside a court saying, you bet, that \ncontact was made, that sale was initiated at a gun show, when the \nscenario could have been just as the Senator explained it.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise to comment on amendment No. 2623 \nof S. 1805, the Protection of Lawful Commerce and Arms Act, which was \noffered on my behalf by my colleague and friend Senator Craig from \nIdaho last Thursday.\n  This amendment is based on a bill I worked on for a number of years. \nI am pleased to say it has the broad bipartisan support of my \ncolleagues. In fact, it has 67 cosponsors. It enjoys the support of \nnumerous local law enforcement agencies, including the Fraternal Order \nof Police. I am delighted to have Senators Hatch, Leahy, and Reed \njoining me as original cosponsors of this amendment.\n  I was particularly pleased that last Thursday, a second-degree \namendment was adopted naming this bill to honor Steve Young, the \nrecently retired president of the 300,000-member Fraternal Order of \nPolice.\n  This amendment, which is identical to my bill which was introduced as \nS. 253 and was reported out of the Judiciary Committee in March 2003, \nwould permit qualified former and current law enforcement officers who \nare employed by or retired from a local, State, or Federal law \nenforcement agency to carry concealed weapons across jurisdictions.\n  A ``qualified law enforcement officer'' is any individual who has \nretired\n\n[[Page S1957]]\n\nin good standing from service of a government agency as a law \nenforcement officer for a total of 15 years or more. The only exception \nis if the officer was separated from duty by a duty-related injury. \nOfficers will be required to carry photographic identification issued \nby the agency for which they are or were employed. It is an extremely \nimportant measure.\n  With specific regard to retired officers, this amendment requires \nthem to meet annually and at their own expense the very same standards \nthat active officers must meet in the State where they reside. Thus, \nthere should be no question as to the qualifications of either active \nor retired officers.\n  There are several important benefits to this amendment. First, the \nAmerican public will undoubtedly be safer as off-duty and retired law \nenforcement officers are allowed to carry concealed weapons as they \ntravel across jurisdictions. If enacted into law, the basic net effect \nwill be thousands of additional police officers on the streets at zero \ntaxpayer expense. Criminals and terrorists certainly will not be happy \nwhen this bill is passed. They would not be sure whether or not \nseemingly average citizens are actually off-duty or retired law \nenforcement officers who are armed, trained, and ready to deal with \nwhatever situation may arise. I certainly believe that this type of \nknowledge should act as a major deterrent for anyone dumb enough to be \ncontemplating crime.\n  Now there may be some who question whether or not this is a States \nrights issue. Let me address that for a moment. In this instance, it is \nexactly the wide and vast variety of different State gun laws that make \nthis type of Federal legislation necessary. The result is this amazing \nmaze of different laws in the States and other jurisdictions which \nresults in a paradox for officers, and sometimes places them in extreme \njeopardy.\n  Congress has the authority, under the ``full faith and credit'' \nclause of the Constitution, to extend full faith and credit to \nqualified active and retired officers who have met the criteria to \ncarry firearms set by one State, and make those credentials applicable \nand recognized in the States and territories of the United States. My \nlegislation maintains the State's power to set these requirements and \ndetermine whether or not an active or retired office is qualified to \nuse the firearm, and it would only allow this vary narrow group of \npeople to carry their firearms when traveling outside their immediate \njurisdiction.\n  In the most simplistic terms, it is like a driver's license. Each \nState issues their own version and gives their own test, yet although \nthe standards may differ from State to State, all drivers can still \ncross lines, as they have been recognized and certified to operate a \nmotor vehicle on public roadways.\n\n  Congress has the authority to preempt state and local prohibitions on \nthe carrying of concealed weapons and has done so in the past on the \nbasis of employment for other professions.\n  To do the same for law enforcement just makes good sense.\n  This amendment will also help off-duty and retired law enforcement \nofficers protect themselves and their families. All too often, after \nthey are released from prison, violent criminals seek revenge against \nthe law enforcement officers who helped lock them away. While at a \nminimum this legislation will even out the playing field for off-duty \nand retired law enforcement officers, I hope that it will go further \nand actually give them an advantage. This isn't a ``firearms issue''--\nit is an officer safety issue. And without a doubt, on September 11, \n2001, it became a critical public safety and homeland security issue.\n  This important law enforcement amendment is especially meaningful to \nme for a number of reasons. First of all, through 6 years of service as \na deputy sheriff with Sacramento County, CA, I was able to get first-\nhand experience with the challenges facing our Nation's law enforcement \nofficers. While in that position, I personally patrolled the streets \nand encountered some dangerous characters. I also clearly learned that \na law enforcement officer's job does not necessarily end when he or she \nis off duty since you never know when you may come face-to-face with \nviolent criminals.\n  Now is the time to clearly demonstrate the Senate's strong support \nfor our Nation's men and women serving on the front lines of law \nenforcement. Law enforcement officers are a dedicated and trained body \nof men and women who are sworn to uphold the law and keep the peace. \nUnlike many other professions, a police officer is rarely ``off duty.'' \nWhen there is a threat to the peace or to public safety, officers are \nsworn to answer the call of duty. Officers who are traveling from one \njurisdiction to another don't leave their instincts or training behind \nthem, but without being able to carry their weapon, all of that \ntraining and knowledge is basically useless.\n  This amendment will help officers protect themselves, their families, \nand their fellow Americans by harmonizing our Nation's conceal-carry \nlaws for qualified off-duty and retired law enforcement officers.\n  More now than ever before, we all realize Homeland Security is vital \nto protecting our Nation, and this amendment will enhance the ability \nof our valuable law enforcement officers to do their job--to protect \nand serve.\n  One of the problems we have now, of course, is with multiple \njurisdictions in multiple States. A good example is where I live in \nsouthwest Colorado, a law enforcement officer who lives, say, in \nDurango, only 30 miles from New Mexico, is duly authorized to carry a \nweapon on or off duty in Colorado. But if he goes to New Mexico, he is \nin violation if he has a concealed weapon. It seems to me we need some \nkind of blanket protection for law enforcement officers when they cross \nState lines.\n  Also, there is another factor involved in this issue, and that is we \nare in a new kind of war, one in which the Geneva Convention rules of \nengagement and distinguishing between an armed soldier or armed \nopponent and an innocent child is simply no longer a consideration. \n``Kill all Americans'' seems to be the credo of terrorists, and because \nof that, American policemen, firemen, and EMTs have become frontline \nwarriors.\n  I know some question that this is a States rights issue. As I \nexplained, there is a patchwork, a crazy quilt of different \njurisdictions, and we need some kind of Federal recognition of that. \nCongress certainly has this authority under the full faith and credit \nclause of the Constitution to extend full faith and credit to qualified \nand active retired officers who have met the criteria to carry firearms \nset by one State and to make those credentials applicable and \nrecognized in all States and territories in the United States.\n  This legislation maintains State power to set these requirements and \nto determine whether or not an active or retired officer is qualified \nfor continued use of a firearm. It would only allow, to a narrow group \nof people, the authority to carry firearms when traveling outside their \nimmediate jurisdiction. I think this is very good. We have already done \nthis in one case by allowing airline pilots to arm, and that bill did \npass and was incorporated in H.R. 5005, which is now a public law. So \nthis is not the first time we have done this.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment when it comes up for \na vote because I think it is going to be beneficial, not only to law \nenforcement officers, but certainly to people who rely on law \nenforcement officers who are off duty but still trained in the use of \nfirearms and trained in the rule of law to protect us in this new kind \nof war.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Colorado for his \nexcellent amendment and for his willingness to stand up and speak out \non these critical issues.\n  I now yield 10 minutes of my time to the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n   Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, Senators Campbell, Leahy, Reid and I have \noffered as an amendment to S. 1805 the ``Law Enforcement Officers \nSafety Act of 2003'' which was favorably reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee with strong bi-partisan support during last session. This \namendment, which permits qualified current and retired law enforcement \nofficers to carry a concealed firearm in any jurisdiction, will\n\n[[Page S1958]]\n\nhelp protect the American public, our Nation's officers, and their \nfamilies. I note that this bill has the overwhelming support of the \nFraternal Order of Police and other law enforcement associations, which \nhave vigorously worked in support of this measure.\n   The amendment allows qualified law enforcement officers and retired \nofficers to carry, with appropriate identification, a concealed firearm \nthat has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce \nregardless of State or local laws. Importantly, this legislation does \nnot supersede any State law that permits private persons to prohibit or \nrestrict the possession of firearms on private property or any State \nlaw that prohibits possession on State or local government properties, \ninstallations, buildings, bases or parks. Additionally, this amendment \nclearly defines what is meant by ``qualified law enforcement officer'' \nand ``qualified retired [or former] law enforcement officer'' to ensure \nthat those individuals permitted to carry concealed firearms are highly \ntrained professionals.\n   There are approximately 740,000 sworn law enforcement officers \ncurrently serving in the United States. Since the first recorded police \ndeath in 1792, there have been more than 16,300 law enforcement \nofficers killed in the line of duty. A total of 1,800 law enforcement \nofficers died in the line of duty over the last decade, an average of \n180 deaths per year. In 2001 alone, there were 232 police deaths, \nrepresenting a 49 percent increase from the 156 officers who died in \n2000. Roughly 5 percent of officers who die are killed while taking law \nenforcement action in an off-duty capacity.\n   While a police officer may not remember the name and face of every \ncriminal he or she has locked behind bars, criminals often have long \nand exacting memories. A law enforcement officer is a target in uniform \nand out; active or retired; on duty or off.\n\n  Because law enforcement officers are, in reality, never ``off-duty,'' \nthis amendment will not only provide law enforcement officers with a \nlegal means to protect themselves and their families when they travel \ninterstate, it will also enhance the security of the American public. \nBy enabling qualified active duty and retired law enforcement officers \nto carry firearms, even when not on the clock, more trained law \nenforcement officers will be on the street to enforce the law and to \nrespond to crises.\n  The idea that a police officer is never really off-duty is not some \nabstract concept. Let me share a real life off-duty example. Not long \nago in Arlington, TX, Bradley Merreighn, a serial bank robber, walked \ninto a bank, pulled out and pointed a gun at a young woman employee of \nthe bank and demanded the bank's money. Unbeknownst to Merreighn, off-\nduty Arlington Police Sergeant John Gonzales was standing directly \nbehind him with his two small children.\n  Merrieghn took the bank's money from the young woman and left the \nbank. Sergeant Gonzales instinctively identified himself to the bank's \nemployees as an off-duty police officer, asked the bank employees to \nwatch his children and, although unarmed, followed Merrieghn as he fled \nfrom the bank.\n  Sergeant Gonzales' police instincts were to try to tail Merrieghn to \nprevent him from hurting someone and to assist on duty police officers \nin apprehending him. Sergeant Gonzales commandeered a car outside the \nbank and followed Merrieghn. During the pursuit, Sergeant Gonzales \nfortunately avoided being shot and killed when Merrieghn unleashed a \ntorrent of gunfire in an attempt to stop Sergeant Gonzales from \nfollowing him. Ultimately, because of Sergeant Gonzales' instincts and \nefforts, other police officers were able to respond and, after a \nstandoff, arrest Merrieghn before he harmed anyone.\n  The FOP has shared with Members of this body another example of the \nneed for this legislation. Two Maryland police officers and their \nfamilies were camping in Harpers Ferry, WV. While packing up their \ncampsite following a 3-day camping trip, a gunman opened fire on \nanother camper, wounding him in the lower leg. Two police officers \ninstinctively directed their families away from the scene and retrieved \ntheir firearms.\n\n  They confronted the gunman with their weapons and ordered the gunman \nto the ground. After searching the gunman, the off-duty officers \ndiscovered that the man had several more live rounds for his shotgun in \nhis possession. These officers held the gunman until West Virginia \nauthorities could arrive. It was later discovered that the gunman had \nan extensive criminal history--including a murder conviction. The \nJefferson County Sheriff's Department remarked that there was no way to \nknow how many lives the off-duty officers saved that day.\n  Although they were certainly heroes, they were also in violation of \nWest Virginia law because they possessed firearms. These brave \nofficers--who prevented a massacre that day, on their day off and \noutside of their jurisdiction--were not charged, but they were in \ntechnical violation of the law. No one can argue that allowing officers \nto carry firearms off-duty and outside of their jurisdiction did not \nsave lives that day.\n  These are but a few of the many examples of law enforcement officers \nacting on instinct to protect the public and thwart violent crime, even \nthough they are not armed and face life threatening circumstances.\n  We should adopt this amendment because this important piece of \nlegislation will provide that extra layer of protection to current and \nretired law enforcement officers and their families who have ably \nserved our communities across the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2637\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am compelled to speak out against \ncontinuing this assault weapons ban proposed by Senator Feinstein. An \nassault weapon is a military firearm which can be fired either \nautomatically or semiautomatically with the flip of a switch. In other \nwords, a true assault weapon is a machine gun, which is a gun already \nregulated by Federal law.\n  The firearms covered by the so-called ``assault weapons'' laws are \nsemiautomatic handguns, rifles, and shotguns. Some of these firearms \nare made to look like a military-style weapon but are mechanically \nindistinguishable from any true traditional-looking deer rifle.\n  According to the FBI, in 2001, nearly five times as many individuals \nwere murdered at the hands of criminals wielding knives than were \nmurdered by criminals using rifles. I might add, only a fraction of \nthose rifles were the semiautomatic rifles that were banned by the so-\ncalled assault weapons ban. What I think is most interesting and \ntelling about this statistic is that the proportion is nearly identical \nto what it was 10 years ago; that is, according to the FBI, in 1991, 3 \nyears before the assault weapons ban passed, nearly five times as many \nmurders were committed with knives than rifles--exactly the same \nproportion as exists today.\n  The so-called assault weapons ban has succeeded in only one thing: \nlaw-abiding men and women, precisely because they abide by the law, \nwere stripped of some of their second amendment rights. We cannot make \nthe same mistake this body made 10 years ago.\n  The number of murders committed with different weapons has decreased \nin all areas, proportionally, over the last 10 years. The suggestion \nthat the assault weapons ban is responsible for this decrease is as \npreposterous as it is misleading. There is no more evidence that the \nban on semiautomatic weapons has had a positive impact on crime than \nthere is that the setting Sun is responsible for street lights turning \non.\n  The fact is, just as we feared 10 years ago, the only impact the ban \non semiautomatic weapons has had has been on law-abiding citizens. I \nwould like, therefore, to take a few minutes about how we ought to \naddress gun violence. Instead of banning certain firearms for merely \npolitical reasons, we need to continue aggressively prosecuting \ncriminals.\n  Rather than focusing on crafting and enacting more laws that erode \nlaw-abiding citizens' constitutionally protected rights, we ought to \nchannel our efforts towards enforcing our current laws and punishing \nthose who choose to abuse those rights and commit crimes with guns.\n  For example, President Bush has made a commitment to reduce gun crime \nby getting armed criminals off the streets through his initiative,\n\n[[Page S1959]]\n\nProject Safe Neighborhoods. In contrast to the 10-year assault weapons \nban and its ineffectiveness in combating gun violence is the \noverwhelming success of Project Safe Neighborhoods. Project Safe \nNeighborhoods, announced by the President and the Attorney General in \n2001, is a comprehensive strategy that brings together Federal, State, \nand local agencies to reduce violent crime in our communities.\n  I might add that we have had a 68-percent reduction in violent crime \nsince that came into being. And I might also add that the only way to \nkeep this under control is to get tough on those who abuse the right to \nhave guns and who abuse the use of guns.\n  The President is on the right track. We do not need this particular \namendment. I hope my colleagues will not accept it.\n  This ought to be our approach. Not simply saying all guns of a \ncertain appearance are banned. We must continue to vigorously pursue \nthose who abuse the right to own a firearm--not stripping away law-\nabiding individuals' rights to own and possess firearms. Especially \nwhen, other than their appearance, those firearms are no different than \nthousands of other firearms that are considered legitimate. In fact, in \nMay of last year, I held a hearing for the purpose of determining the \neffectiveness of Project Safe Neighborhoods. The results are in, and \nthey are impressive.\n  The number of Federal firearms prosecutions has increased \nsignificantly every year under Project Safe Neighborhoods. \nSpecifically, prosecutions have increased 68 percent in the past 3 \nyears. In 2003, the Department of Justice filed over 10,500 Federal \nfirearms cases--the highest number ever recorded by the Department.\n  Federal offenders are being sentenced to significant jail time. In \n2003, approximately 72 percent of offenders were sentenced to prison \nterms greater than 3 years.\n  The per capita number of violent crimes involving firearms has \ndropped 14 percent since the start of the Bush administration. This has \ntranslated into an average of over 32,000 fewer gun crimes annually in \neach of the first 2 years of the Bush administration.\n  There were nearly 130,000 fewer victims of gun crime in 2001-2002 \nthan in 1999-2000.\n  The President has been and Congress should be making America's \nneighborhoods safer by vigorously enforcing gun laws and preventing and \ndeterring gun crime. Arbitrarily taking guns away from law-abiding \ncitizens does not assist the President in making the neighborhoods of \nAmerica safer.\n\n  Inthe course of the debate over gun liability my colleague, Senator \nDurbin, spoke of Korean-American victims in Illinois. Let me tell you \nabout Korean-American victims in California.\n  Many of the guns which current assault weapons bans are targeting--\nincluding the Federal ban enacted in 1994--are the very guns with which \nthe Korean-American merchants used to defend themselves during the 1992 \nLos Angeles riots. For those of you who may not recall the Los Angeles \nRiots, let me tell you about this tragedy. On April 29, 1992, African \nAmericans, upset over the verdict in the Rodney King case, took to the \nstreets of Korea Town in downtown Los Angeles. Although these innocent \nKorean-Americans had nothing to do with the police brutality inflicted \nupon Rodney King, their businesses were singled out. Calls for help \ncame in to 911 by the hundreds. but citizens were informed that no \nassistance was available. Order had broken down. People were on their \nown.\n  As a result of one night of violence, 55 people died, over 2,300 were \ninjured and one billion dollars of property damage was sustained \naccording to the Christian Science Monitor. Gunfire killed 35 people. \nSix died in arson fires. Attackers used sticks or boards to kill two \npeople. Two other were stabbed to death. Six died in car accidents, two \nin hit-and-runs, and one person was strangled. The violence crossed \nracial and ethnic lines.\n  Seventy-five percent of the businesses destroyed belonged  to Korean \nAmericans. Those Korean-American merchants who possessed assault \nweapons and used them to defend themselves, would likely have a \ndifferent story about gun control laws and how they help victims. The \nKorean-American merchants would agree that when one is facing mob \nviolence and the police are unable to respond, one may need a gun that \nshoots more than just six bullets or has a menacing appearance. A ban \non large capacity semiautomatic firearms will only harm one's ability \nto defend himself and his family rather than deter crime.\n\n   While most American spend little time thinking of what the police \ncan do to protect them during times of domestic tranquility, there is \nno guarantee that this will always be the case. Citizens, like the \npolice, have a right, and some would say a duty, to defend themselves \nand their families against deadly threats.\n   The assault weapons ban is a measure entirely devoid of rational \nthought. It is not based upon compelling factual data or civil \nnecessity, but of political strategy and the machinations of over-\nreactive, quick-fix ideologues. This amendment addresses neither the \nproblem nor the solution, when it comes to gun crime. And because the \namendment serves only the political agenda of the few and not the \nconvictions and rights of the many, I strongly oppose the amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2636\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, another issue I would like to talk about is \nthe amendment sponsored by my colleague, Senator McCain, the so-called \ngun show loophole.\n  Based on some of the arguments I hear made by Senator McCain and his \ncosponsors, it is apparent there are some misunderstandings about what \ngun shows are, how they operate, and existing applicable laws.\n  Gun shows are large events that are open to the public. These events \nattract a broad range of people. They include collectors, hunters, \ntarget shooters, police officers, and those who serve in the Armed \nForces.\n  Gun shows are an opportunity for Americans--fathers and mothers and \ntheir sons and daughters--to pass along a family tradition. Exhibitors \nat these gun shows include gun dealers who are all federally licensed, \nas well as gun collectors, hunting guides, target shooting clubs, and \nvendors of books, clothing, hunting accessories, and so on.\n  What Federal laws currently apply to gun shows? Contrary to popular \nopinion, there are no special exemptions for gun shows. Anyone who \nengages in the business of selling firearms must be licensed, \nregardless of where he or she does business.\n  More specifically, there is simply no such thing as an unlicensed \ndealer. In fact, dealing in guns without a license is a Federal felony, \npunishable by up to 5 years in prison and a substantial fine. Congress \nauthorized licensed firearms dealers to conduct business at gun shows \nin 1986 under the Firearms Owner Protection Act.\n  So what happens when these dealers sell guns at gun shows? Have these \ndealers applied for and received Federal firearms licenses from the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives? The answer is a \nsimple yes.\n  Dealers are required by Federal law to conduct a criminal background \ncheck. They must conduct a check through the national instant check \nsystem at gun shows just as they would have had to do in any other \nlocation. So if we adopt this amendment, who will it affect? The answer \nis not surprisingly, but unfortunately ignored by the proponents of \nthis amendment. The answer is it would affect law-abiding citizens who \nare out to hurt no one.\n  It would drive out and shut down the gun collectors who buy and trade \nsome of their guns at gun shows. They represent a fraction of the \nexhibitors at gun shows.\n  Remember, gun collectors are not gun dealers and may not engage in \nthe business of dealing firearms without a firearms license.\n  I would like to touch on an issue that many Utahns and I find \nparticularly troublesome. If we adopt this amendment, it will \neffectively create gun owner registration.\n  I want to make sure my colleagues understand how this legislation, if \nit became law, would work. Under the amendment, special firearms event \noperators would have to verify the identity of all participating \nvendors and have those vendors sign a ledger saying they were there \nselling firearms, whether or not any of the vendors actually sold a \nfirearm. This requirement is\n\n[[Page S1960]]\n\na modest improvement of the original bill, which, as introduced, would \nhave required vendors to submit to the Attorney General the names of \nall vendors slated to participate in the Gun Show. Regardless of the \nslight change, it is clear what the sponsors of this amendment intend. \nThat is, to track and register law abiding citizens who merely want to \nexercise their constitutionally protected Second Amendment rights.\n  So suppose a private, law-abiding citizen enters a gun show hoping to \nsale or trade a firearm, but that person does not make a deal and \nleaves with his own firearm. This person, this private law-abiding \ncitizen, would be on file and in a ledger forever as a special firearms \nevent vendor, copies of the ledgers to be used for any future purpose.\n  This amendment also purports to provide for instant background \nchecks. Now, anyone who knows anything about the national instant \ncriminal check system knows that they do not turn around such inquiries \nin 24 hours. In fact, currently, the national instant criminal check \nsystem has 3 days to turn around a request for a background check.\n  The amendment before us provides that the wait may be reduced to 24 \nhours if a State applies for the privilege of improving its records. \nWith a 3-business-day period still allowed to check out-of-State \nrecords, a few large States will drag down the whole scheme for all \ntransfers across the Nation.\n  Again, what is the practical effect? Gun collectors who occasionally \nattend gun shows for a day or two on a weekend will be shut down \nbecause they will not be able to have the national instant criminal \ncheck system run the required check on a prospective buyer and make \nsuch a transaction in that day.\n  There are two more important points that I think many of the Members \nin this body may have overlooked. First, in November of 2001, the \nBureau of Justice Statistics released a report on imprisoned felons and \nwhere they obtained their firearms. Fewer than 1 percent obtained the \nguns they used to commit their crimes at gun shows. Of that 1 percent, \nonly a fraction obtained weapons through collectors.\n  What does this tell us? The idea that shutting down collectors at gun \nshows will affect crime in any appreciable way is dramatically \noverstated, if not preposterous.\n  Criminals are getting their guns on the street or from the \nresidential burglaries, but not from heavily police-attended gun shows.\n  Second, and I want my colleagues to hear this: Law enforcement and \nFederal prosecutors continue to use gun shows to weed out corrupt gun \ndealers. In fact, Federal prosecutors stress to me that passing this \namendment would serve only to drive those few who would unlawfully deal \nin firearms without a license into the black market, into the back \nalleyways, and into the hidden areas of our communities, making it \nnearly impossible to locate and prosecute such criminals.\n  So not only will this amendment fail to address the true nature of \nthe problem, but it will punish law-abiding collectors who choose to \npublicly trade their firearms.\n  I submit that adopting this politically driven, knee-jerk amendment, \nwhich only injects partisanship into a bill that otherwise enjoys broad \nbipartisan support, will have two effects: One, it will shut down \nlawful gun collectors who attend and trade guns at gun shows; and two, \nif it has any effect on crime, it will affect it negatively by driving \nthe few dealers who are unlawful into the black market where it is \nexorbitantly more difficult for them to be located and prosecuted.\n  I urge my colleagues on other side of the aisle to re-examine their \nanalysis, put politics aside, and reject this amendment.\n  It will serve no purpose in pursuing our common goal of fighting \ncrime, but instead will only hurt innocent law-abiding citizens.\n  Let us not be distracted from the issue at hand.\n  We have legislation before us that enjoys broad bipartisan support \nand that deserves our attention. That should be the focus of our \nefforts, not passage of this unwise amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee for his comments and the work that he has done to keep the \ngun laws in this Nation clean, appropriate where necessary, and \nenforceable without the entrapment of law-abiding citizens. I thank him \nfor that work, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I initially want to respond to some of the \ncomments made by the Senator from Utah. I believe he read a legislative \nproposal that Senator McCain and I submitted last fall, not the \namendment that is before us today because we specifically removed from \nthe amendment today any requirement for the turning in of lists of \nvendors at gun shows to the Attorney General of the United States. That \nis not in this amendment.\n  There is no requirement for unlicensed sellers to execute any \npaperwork. That requirement will be undertaken by a special licensee, \npresumably the gun show sponsor and operator, not the unlicensed gun \ndealer. Furthermore, there is no requirement to seek permission from \nthe Attorney General or any Federal authority to conduct a gun show. So \nI think the comments of the Senator from Utah reflect not this \namendment but previous proposals. This amendment has been specifically \nmodified to make it as easy, as efficient, and as effective as possible \nto conduct these background checks.\n  The Federal authorities have a 3-day period of time in which to \nexecute a gun show background check, but, frankly, with the National \nInstant Criminal Background System, we all know the facts are clear. \nNinety-one percent of these checks are accomplished in less than 5 \nminutes; 95 percent in less than 2 hours. If the check is not completed \nin 3 days, then the transaction goes through. That is just a backstop \nin case there is information that these Federal authorities cannot \nobtain.\n  So, frankly, the suggestion that gun shows will be put out of \nbusiness is quite wrong. Those places which have even tougher standards \nthan those suggested by the McCain-Reed bill still have gun shows, and \nthey are still highly popular and highly successful.\n\n  I thank the Senator from Idaho for his comments about North Carolina. \nMy comments generally talked about closing the gun show loophole. As he \npoints out, North Carolina requires everyone who is buying a firearm at \na gun show to have a North Carolina firearm permit, which is probably a \nmore demanding standard than we are suggesting in our amendment, and we \nwould not suggest that. That is a State prerogative. Technically, they \ndo not require all the background checks on licensees and unlicensees, \nbut they do in fact require any purchaser to have a permit. That is a \nvery stringent standard.\n  Now, there has also been some discussion today about the fact that \nthis is going to cause tremendous chaos because what if someone saw a \nweapon at a gun show and then later called a private dealer. Well, that \nis why the amendment clearly defines activities that are not part of a \ngun show subject to this amendment.\n  The language states:\n\n     does not include an offer or exhibit of firearms for sale, \n     exchange, or transfer by an individual from the personal \n     collection of that individual, at the private residence of \n     that individual, if the individual is not required to be \n     licensed under section 923 or 932.\n\n  For example, if someone is a private collector, if they have some \nguns in their home and they are selling those weapons from their home, \nthen they are not subject to this provision.\n  It is as clear as we can make it to exempt the many people who are \nprivate collectors and the many people who, indeed, should not be \nsubject to this license requirement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 3 minutes have expired.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized \nfor an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague, Senator Reid \nfrom Nevada, for the 2 minutes.\n\n[[Page S1961]]\n\n  In summary, this amendment that Senator McCain and I proposed is as \nsensible as I think one can ever fashion a law. When someone walks into \na gun show with thousands of individuals, hundreds of booths, it makes \nno sense to the average person why one individual should require a \nbackground check and another does not have to conduct a background \ncheck in the sale of a firearm. It makes sense to have an even playing \nfield.\n  These are public events. It is virtually impossible for a seller at a \nmajor gun show to know the background of all the potential purchasers. \nWe know these gun shows are exploited. This is not hypothetical. They \nare exploited by criminals. Goodness gracious, it makes perfect sense \nwhy they would be. It is a supermarket where a person can obtain \nfirearms without any background check. It is like a neon sign that \nsays: Come here if you are looking to get weapons and you cannot buy \nthem legally.\n  We know what happens. We also know because of the threat of \nterrorists that terrorists have looked at these gun shows as possible \nways to obtain firearms. Frankly, I think the American public would \ndemand, as they have in the past, anything we can do that would curtail \naccess to dangerous weapons to terrorists.\n  So I hope we support closing the gun show loophole. I also hope we \nsupport the assault weapons ban. Finally, I think we have to carefully \nlook at the underlying legislation as a severe encroachment on hundreds \nand hundreds of years--indeed, many years--of common law tradition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 2 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey, Mr. Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n3 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  This bill, which has been in place since 1994, held back on the \navailability of assault weapons, those holding more than 10 rounds in \ntheir cartridge holder.\n  The assault weapons ban amendment would simply extend the current ban \non these deadly weapons for another 10 years, with no other changes in \ncurrent law. It is hard to understand why we would not go ahead and \nsimply extend this. The President of the United States said at one \npoint that this ban should continue to exist. Assault weapons are \nintended for one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to kill as \nmany people as possible in the shortest amount of time.\n  We should never forget that ill-fated day of April 20, 1999, in \nLittleton, CO, when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold opened fire on \nteachers and fellow students at Columbine High School. They were armed \nwith a TEC-DC9 assault weapon. When the shooting was over, 15 people, \nincluding the gunmen, were dead and 23 wounded. We can never forget the \npicture of those youngsters hanging out the window, pleading for help, \npleading for safety, trying to protect themselves.\n  These assault weapons have no place in a civilized society. According \nto FBI data, one in five law enforcement officers who were killed in \nthe line of duty between 1998 and 2001 were killed with assault \nweapons.\n  Even terrorists have identified our gun laws as a point of \nvulnerability. Found among the rubble at a terrorist training camp in \nAfghanistan was a manual called ``How I Can Train Myself for Jihad.'' \nThe manual stipulates that terrorists living in the United States \nshould ``obtain an assault weapon legally, preferably AK-47 or \nvariations.''\n  It also advises would-be terrorists on how they should conduct \nthemselves in order to avoid arousing suspicion as they amass and \ntransport firearms. It defies logic to understand why it is that we \nhave to protect those who want to have assault weapons.\n  I was in the Army during the war. I carried a carbine. Assault \nweapons were available for those in the infantry--sometimes--so they \ncould kill as many of the enemy as possible. Who is the enemy here?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield an additional minute to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for an additional \nminute.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, who would be the enemy in this case? \nMore law enforcement officers? More kids in a school? More people in an \noffice where a disgruntled employee took out his rage by pointing a \nrapid-fire weapon at fellow workers?\n  No, this amendment makes all the sense in the world. Ban these \nweapons. Don't let them continue to be available in our society--\nassault weapons, weapons of war.\n  Why is it necessary to ensure that the rights of those who would \ncarry that lethal a weapon be protected? I see no sense in it, and I \nhope my colleagues will take a second look. I hope those who support \nthe gun immunity bill will take a second look and say: You know what, \nthis is not a fight worth having. We don't need these weapons in our \nsociety, and we ought to continue this ban as it is.\n  I would have preferred something stronger, and I think people here \nknow that, but let's at least continue the ban as it exists, as the \nSenator from California presented it.\n  I thank my colleague from Nevada and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, would you notify me when I have used 5 \nminutes of my remaining time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will notify the Senator.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, why are we on the floor today debating a \nlaw, not debating a proposed law? We are debating this law because some \nyears ago, when the Congress put it in place, they said, let's sunset \nit to force Congress to come back and look at it to see whether or not \nit worked. Because at that time there was a concern and somebody sought \na political placebo to go home to their constituents and say, look what \nI did for you to protect you and therefore the world is safer. But many \nof us said, wait a moment, let's watch the law and see if it works. \nLet's put a sunset in it and come back and revisit it. That is what we \nare doing today.\n  In September of 2004, the assault weapons ban expires and the great \ndebate is whether we ought to extend it for another period of time or \nwhether we should not. The rationale to extend it is based on the fact \nit worked.\n  If it is a good law in place, it ought to be extended. I think the \nargument today is, fundamentally, did it or did it not work? That is \nthe business of statistics and polling and data. The Senator from \nCalifornia, who offered the extension, used tracing data. I am using \ndata that has been put forward by the Justice Department. Let's compare \nthe two.\n  I am not saying the Senator from California's data is wrong. What she \npresented to the Congress, and to the Senate, is an accurate \npresentation. But let's put it into the context of how it was intended \nto be used because I don't believe it was intended to be used for this \ndebate.\n  What is tracing data from BATF? This is a phrase to remember when you \nare talking about tracing data: Not all crime guns are traced--period. \nNot all gun traces are of crime weapons. Not all traces are of crime \nweapons.\n\n  For example, if you get a search warrant and you go into a house and \nyou find firearms and the police department wants to know from whence \nthey came, you do a trace. Were they used in the commission of a crime? \nNo. In other words, it is an intelligence-gathering piece of \ninformation for the law enforcement community.\n  In 1994, in the passage of the assault weapon ban, there was this \nbubble of public interest because there was a lot of accusation out \nthere that semiautos and assault weapons were the common weapon of the \ncriminal. A lot of traces were done during that period of time. It \ntapered off over time. So if you argue it worked, the law worked--it \ndidn't. It was simply reassessing the value of the trace at that time \nand the need to trace.\n  Back to the same premise: Not all crime guns are traced and not all \ngun traces are of crime guns. It is an information-gathering tool by \nBATF.\n  Let's turn to this statistic. Let's turn to the 2 percent of semi-\nautos used in the commission of a crime pre-1991;\n\n[[Page S1962]]\n\nsame difference after the passage of the bill and the implementation of \nthe bill.\n  Where do my figures come from? My figures come from the Justice \nDepartment, from extensive surveys of criminals now in prison as to how \nthey gained their gun, and through additional information and polling \ndata; a different purpose and a different educational informational \nflow.\n  The Senator from California, BATF, mine, the Justice Department--are \nthey inaccurate? No. But, if you are really talking about a reason, a \nbasis from which to extend the current law, and you look at this and \nsome people stand on the floor and say, oh, you have to stop this \nbecause this is the weapon of choice of criminals and they are using it \nall the time, that simply is not true. Those facts do not bear out. \nThat is not a valid basis from which to argue the extension of the \nsemiauto ban.\n  The Senator from California said ``all'' law enforcement--and she \nwent through several. Many law enforcement groups have said: Extend it. \nWhy? I guess it is logical. I will tell you one that didn't, though, \nthe Western States Sheriffs' Association. The elected sheriffs of the \nWestern States of this Nation, when the Brady Center brought them a \nresolution and said, here, we want you to pass this supporting the \nextension of the semiauto ban, they voted on it and voted it down by a \nvery large margin.\n  Why? They looked at the statistics and saw that this bill would have \nmore to do with stopping law-abiding citizens from owning the gun of \ntheir choice and very little to do with the crime element.\n  Let us return to the weapon that is the choice of the criminal. It is \nnot packing around a rifle. Somehow they are just visible on the \nstreet. It is the handgun. It always has been the handgun. It is the \nchoice, tragically enough, of most of the criminal element. Sure, there \nis a small percentage--less than 2 percent. Pictures have been shown \ngraphically about the assault weapon and what it is.\n  Well, what is a semiauto rifle? I went through that argument \nyesterday. A semiauto rifle, semiauto shotgun, a semiauto pistol is one \nthat you pull shot by shot, trigger by trigger. You do not depress the \ntrigger and rapid-fire your entire amount of ammunition within the \nweapon itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend, the Senator has \nused 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank you, Mr. President. I allot myself 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Machine guns: Fully automatic--the kind that is already \nbanned. You can acquire them by permit from BATF to put in your \ncollections, but you can't go to the street and buy them unless you buy \nthem illegally and you buy them in the black market. You don't buy them \nat gun shows. That is the reality of what we are talking about.\n  Where lies the burden of proof to renew or re-up a law that has \nrestricted the ability of law-abiding citizens, created another \ntripwire, and denied them what is a legitimate ownership right in this \ncountry? Less than 2 percent. I believe those are fully verifiable \nstatistics when we are examining this. That is why the House and many \nothers have said, no, let's not go there. Let this law expire. It may \nhave been necessary at the time largely for political purposes only. \nMany of us opposed it then, saying it wouldn't work and it wasn't \nnecessary. It didn't work and it isn't necessary. That is the reality \nof what we are doing.\n  Let us take this law from the books. Let us make sure we go after the \ncriminal who misuses the gun--who uses a gun in the commission of a \ncrime. That is where we get law enforcement. That is how we protect \nlaw-abiding citizens in this country and we don't thereby deny them \ntheir constitutional right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have 7 minutes under my control. It is my \nunderstanding that the Senator from Arizona wishes to speak for 2 \nminutes. I yield the Senator from Arizona 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me just for a minute put a practical \nface on the issue we are talking about this morning. These are just a \nfew examples of the criminals who are exploiting this loophole.\n  Ali Boumelhem, a Lebanese national, member of the terrorist group \nHezbollah, arrested and convicted for attempting to smuggle firearms \nbought from Michigan gun shows to Lebanon; Muhammad Asrar, a Pakistani \nnational in this country on an expired visa who admitted to buying and \nselling firearms at Texas gun shows. Asrar is a suspected al-Qaida \nmember who obtained a pilot's license and had photos of tall buildings \nin American cities and, though seemingly impoverished, purchased a \ntime-share for a Lear jet. And Conor Claxton, an admitted member of the \nIrish Republican Army, spent over $100,000 at Florida gun shows and \nthrough other private dealers to obtain firearms to smuggle into \nIreland.\n  We are talking about the ability of terrorists--the proven record of \nterrorists exploiting the gun show loophole for the purpose of \nobtaining weapons that could be used against the United States of \nAmerica.\n  This is a serious amendment and a serious issue. I want my colleagues \nto understand when voting on this amendment that there have already \nbeen cases where members of known terrorist organizations have \nexploited the gun show loophole and purchased weapons with which to \neventually commit acts of terror against the United States of America. \nThis is not an issue that should be in any way dismissed. There are \nmany others.\n  Mr. Thomas Timms was arrested October 2003 with 147 guns and 66,000 \nrounds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, do I have time remaining on my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey. I would like to reserve the last 3 minutes for the Senator from \nRhode Island, Mr. Reed, on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n2 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I don't know what we are talking about \nwhen I listen to the speeches. I hear it said that these aren't \nnecessarily the guns of criminals.\n  By the way, I asked the question whether the two kids who killed \ntheir classmates and others in Columbine High School, were they \ncriminals before they started to shoot that gun? I don't think so. The \nquestion is, how does the gun get into their hands? It was an assault \nweapon, and we ought to ban these weapons. The President of the United \nStates even said so.\n  I heard reference to the fact there were organizations that said this \nban should be removed. I want to talk about those who want to support \nthe ban. For instance, the Fraternal Order of Police, the world's \nlargest organization of sworn law enforcement officers; the \nInternational Brotherhood of Police Officers; the Major Cities Chiefs \nof Police; the International Association of Chiefs of Police; the \nHispanic American Police Command Officers Association--and the list \ngoes on.\n  Let us listen to what the people are saying. Who are we protecting? \nAre we protecting the average citizen? Are we protecting the worker who \nhas a disgruntled fellow employee pull the trigger? I don't think so.\n  We ought to continue this ban.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we are within a short time of beginning \nthree very critical votes today starting at 11:30 on three very \nimportant items.\n  First, let me start with the underlying bill, S. 1805. The Statement \nof Administration Policy is to keep the bill clean. Don't add all of \nthese other amendments to it. It is a clean, well-drafted, narrow \nprovision that says we are going to exempt law-abiding gun \nmanufacturers and dealers who play by the rules from third party suits \nof those who might take a law-abiding object and turn it into a \ncriminal weapon; and that action should not be allowed to reach back \nthrough the court\n\n[[Page S1963]]\n\nsystem and go after law-abiding gun manufacturers and licensed dealers.\n  Product liability: Don't change that law. Standard tort law: Don't \nchange that law. But we narrow and we define so that all of these new \ncreative arguments that the trial bar is trying to bring up in the 30-\nplus lawsuits they have brought don't fit anymore.\n  It is plain and simple. We go back to old tort in this country that \nsays the individual is responsible for their actions. The individual is \nresponsible for their actions. That is the underlying premise of S. \n1805.\n  Added to that, certainly the Senator from California will attempt to \nextend the assault weapon ban.\n  A few moments ago I argued that there is no clear evidence, and the \nJustice Department's own statistics would argue that it really doesn't \nmake a lot of sense.\n  The Senator from Arizona talked about the gun show loophole and \nmentioned that it is now accessed by terrorists for their weapons of \nchoice. He also didn't mention that all of those terrorists were \narrested. Somehow the law worked. They were caught. They were illegal. \nThey may have made the point of contact and they may have lied and they \nmay have acquired a firearm which they could have acquired outside of a \ngun show, but they were caught. They were arrested. They were \ntrafficking in guns. And darn it, that is illegal in this country. We \nhave well established that.\n  Do you create a whole new bureaucracy and a whole new hurdle over \nwhich the law-abiding citizen has to jump? I don't think so. I hope \nnot. Or do you really create that gray area that I talked about \nearlier?\n  What if I go to the gun show and see the gun I like, but it is a \nlicensed dealer, it is a collector, and months later I have his card? I \ncall him up and I say, I visited with you at the gun show. I have \ndecided to buy your weapon, the firearm. I want to add it to my \ncollection. I want to add it to my personal inventory.\n  A legal action, it is today a legal action. If the gun show loophole \nbill passes, I think it is a phenomenally gray area. We set up another \ntripwire for the law-abiding citizen.\n  The Senator from Arizona and I know how creative the trial bar is. \nLet's at least argue that they discussed it and that they avoided the \nbackground check at that time by buying it outside the gun show. The \npoint of contact was the gun show. The point of contact for millions of \nAmericans who legally buy firearms is the gun show, with 1,000 gun \nshows a year, millions of people attending them. So now we overlay that \nwith the Federal bureaucracy.\n  Yes, States do shape gun shows in their own likeness, and I don't \nobject to that. Permits are required in some instances. Twelve States \nhave done so. Have they plugged a loop hole? They have required that on \nall gun sales in their State, whether they are done inside of a gun \nshow or outside of a gun show. Is that plugging a loophole or is that \nstandardizing a law that fits that given State and the population of \nthat State? That is 12 or 15, at the most. The rest have not. We had \nthose kinds of requirements in the State of New York in 1911 and \nCongress did not speak to it. It was not called a loophole then. It was \ncalled a loophole only when the BATF, in their survey, said there might \nbe a loophole through which some might be acquiring guns. One percent, \n2 percent, 20 percent--how about 1.7 percent? It was true before the \nlaw; it is now true after the law.\n  Did the law work? In the case of assault weapons, it did not work. We \nhave denied it before, but what the Senator is going to say, let's plug \nthe loophole in the gun shows and then later on let's reach outside the \ngun shows and do the same thing, by gosh, that is called gun control. \nWhen the right of a free citizen to engage with his neighbor, which \nthey have exempted now, and they have trimmed it down a bit--and I \ndon't argue that--that is a new Federal law over all of our citizens. I \nquestion the need and I question the responsible act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, let me first indicate that this legislation \nalready includes an amendment by Senator Boxer on child safety locks, \nso the bill is not clean.\n  The question today is, Will we add additional sensible gun safety \nmeasures? One of them is the assault weapons ban. That is something \nthat is entirely appropriate, one that has been supported by vast \nnumbers of the American public, that we should continue.\n  The idea we are suddenly going to open up, once again, access to \nassault weapons across this country is difficult to bear, particularly \nby police officers. That is why they are so committed to this extension \nof the assault weapons ban because they are the individuals who have to \nface these weapons on the street.\n  There is another amendment which I cosponsored with Senator McCain \nthat will close the gun show loophole. Senator McCain pointed out quite \nclearly the terrorists who have already been identified as exploiting \nthis loophole or attempting to exploit it. Indeed, I suspect there are \nothers because the nature of terrorists is that they do not go around \nadvertising themselves too much. The loophole is there. They know it is \nthere. They will exploit it to our detriment. It is our responsibility \nto do everything we can to prohibit, preempt terrorists from attacking \nus within the United States.\n  My colleague from Idaho conjured up this fear that this legislation \nis creeping gun control; this amendment will interfere with private \nsales. That is why the McCain-Reed amendment clearly specified that it \ndoes not apply to the sale, exchange, or transfer by an individual from \nthe personal collection of that individual at the private residence of \nthat individual. That is a private transaction unaffected by this \nlegislation.\n  We know this loophole is being exploited. We know guns are going into \nthe hands of criminal elements, perhaps terrorist elements, through the \ngun show, and we also know it makes no sense to anyone--forget \nlegislative, forget advocates, the common person--to walk into a gun \nshow and understand some people have to do background checks and others \ndo not because those weapons are equally dangerous. The potential \ncustomers of these shows could be terrorists, could be criminals. We \nhave to be responsible and reasonable. That is exactly what this \namendment does.\n  This amendment does not create any new Federal bureaucracy. It does \nnot require a gun show operator to report vendors to the Attorney \nGeneral. It does not require that the Attorney General approve a gun \nshow. It places no administrative burden practically at all on an \nunlicensed vendor.\n  Just remember, 5 years ago, two young men went into a high school and \nkilled 13 people because they were able to exploit the gun show \nloophole.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time from 11:15 \na.m. to 11:25 a.m. is under the control of the Democratic leader or his \ndesignee.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the issue before the Senate today can \nreally be summed up in one word: Responsibility. I first started \nhunting with my cousins when I was a kid, and I still enjoy hunting \ntoday. I believe strongly in the second amendment. I believe in the \nright to bear arms as it has been interpreted in our country.\n  But I also believe that with our rights come fundamental, commonsense \nresponsibilities. The right to bear arms is a right that should be \nprotected for law-abiding Americans who want to protect themselves and \ntheir families.\n  There is, however, no right to place military-style assault weapons \ninto the hands of terrorists and/or criminals who wish to cause \nAmerican families harm. There is no right to have access to the weapons \nof war in the streets of America. For those who want to wield those \nweapons, we have a place for them. It is the U.S. military. And we \nwelcome them.\n  If we do not act today to continue the ban on these deadly weapons, \nthen our families in America, our police officers in America, are more \nthreatened than they ought to be. For 10 years, the assault weapons ban \nhas stopped fugitives, rapists, and murderers from purchasing weapons \nsuch as AK-47s. And\n\n[[Page S1964]]\n\nfor 10 years, not one honest, responsible American has had their guns \ntaken away because of this law.\n  It is interesting that a few months ago I was actually hunting in \nIowa with the sheriff and with some of his deputies. As we walked \nthrough a field with the dogs, hunting pheasant, he pointed out a house \nin back of me, a house they had raided only a few weeks earlier, where \nmeth and crack were being sold. On the morning when they went in to \narrest this alleged criminal, there was an assault weapon on the floor \nlying beside that individual.\n  That sheriff and others across this country do not believe we should \nbe selling these weapons or allowing them to be more easily available \nto criminals in our country. That is why gun owners across America \nsupport renewing the assault weapons ban. They support also closing the \ngun show loophole so that gun shows can continue uninterrupted without \nbeing magnets for criminals and/or terrorists who try to get around the \nlaw.\n  If there is a gun show loophole, a terrorist could simply go to one \nState, go into the gun show, buy a gun without the kind of ground check \nnormal in the process, leave that gun show, travel to another State, \nand engage in either criminal or terrorist activity or both.\n  Let's be honest about what we are facing today. The opposition to \nthis commonsense gun safety law is being driven by the powerful NRA \nspecial interest leadership and by lobbyists in Washington. I don't \nbelieve this is the voice of responsible gun owners across America.\n  Gun owners in America want to defend their families, and I believe \nthe NRA leadership is defending the indefensible. There is a gap \nbetween America's ``Field & Stream'' gun owners and the NRA's ``Soldier \nof Fortune'' leaders.\n  When he ran for President in 2000, President Bush promised the \nAmerican people he would work to renew the assault weapons ban. But \nnow, under pressure, he is walking away from that commitment, as he has \nfrom so many other promises--from education, to the environment, to the \neconomy. This President says he will sign this giveaway to the gun \nindustry, but he is refusing to sign the assault weapons ban he told \nAmerica he would support.\n  I believe gun owners have a responsibility, and so does the President \nof the United States--a responsibility to keep his word, a \nresponsibility to do what he says he will do, a responsibility to \nprotect Americans from danger, and to provide for the common defense.\n  There is a reason every major law enforcement and police group in \nAmerica supports this ban. They know no police officer should ever have \nto face the prospect of being outgunned by the military-style assault \nweapons. No American citizen should have to live in fear of being \ngunned down by snipers, gang members, or even terrorists who wield \nassault weapons.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, is there any time left on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the distinguished leader.\n  President Bush needs to tell America's police officers why he is not \nstanding on their side.\n  Today George Bush will celebrate the anniversary of the creation of \nthe Department of Homeland Security, and I am glad the President joined \nus in that effort. But it will take more than a big, new bureaucracy to \nmake America safer. Today airport screeners are being cut, air marshals \nare not getting trained, fire departments only have enough radios for \nabout 50 percent of the firefighters, and almost two-thirds of our \nfirehouses are shortchanged. The COPS funds have been eliminated in \norder to fund the President's tax cuts for the wealthiest few. By \ntaking cops off our streets with one hand, and allowing military-style \nassault weapons back on them with the other, this President is \njeopardizing the safety of our communities. It is wrong to do so, to \npay for more tax breaks for billionaires and pay back more favors to a \nspecial interest lobbying group.\n  Let me just say one word quickly about the overall issue of liability \nitself. I am not for, and I do not think any reasonable person is for, \na gun manufacturer being held liable for a murder that takes place in \nthe life of America, unfortunately too often. But what we do know is \nabout 1.2 percent or so of gun dealers and wholesalers are responsible \nfor about 57 percent of the weapons that wind up in the hands of \ncriminals. There are many ``straw'' transactions that take place in \nsituations where manufacturers know who the problem dealers are.\n  To not have a wanton-and-reckless-conduct standard for liability is \nto avoid responsibility; it is to allow people to look the other way, \nas they have in the past, when we demand responsible actions in the \ncommunities of America.\n  I believe American gun owners are right to act responsibly and to \nlive by common sense, and I am proud to stand with those gun owners \ntoday. I hope President Bush, the NRA leadership, and other lobby \ngroups will reverse course and join the millions of Americans who know \ngun rights and gun responsibilities are mainstream American values, and \nthat is what we should vote for in the Senate.\n  I thank the leader for the extra time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish to speak today on the bill before \nus, S. 1805, and some of the amendments relating to firearms that have \nbeen offered to it.\n  Listening to the debate on this issue, the American people might get \nthe impression that there are just two sides to the gun debate: On one \nside are those who view the right to bear arms as absolute and oppose \nany proposals that could remotely be considered as restrictions on that \nright. On the other side are those who view gun use as an evil in our \nsociety that must be limited in any way possible. Sometimes the \nrhetoric gets turned up so high that reasoned analysis and debate is \nobscured. That is unfortunate.\n  I have never accepted the proposition that the gun debate is a black \nand white issue, a matter of ``you're with us, or you're against us.'' \nInstead, I have followed what I believe is a moderate course, faithful \nto the Constitution and to the realities of modern society. I believe \nthat the Second Amendment was not an afterthought, that it has meaning \ntoday and must be respected. I support the right to bear arms for \nlawful purposes--for hunting and sport and for self-protection. \nMillions of Americans own firearms legally and we should not take \naction that tells them that they are second-class citizens or that \ntheir constitutional rights are under attack. At the same time, there \nare actions we can and should take to protect public safety that do not \ninfringe on constitutional rights.\n  I supported the Brady bill requiring background checks of gun \npurchasers. I have voted in favor of closing the gun show loophole that \nunacceptably increases the danger that a gun will fall into the hands \nof a criminal. And I support child safety locks and other measures to \nmake firearms less dangerous to gun owners and their families. These \nare reasonable measures that do not infringe on the rights of law-\nabiding citizens to own and use guns.\n  On the other hand, I have long opposed banning handguns, requiring \nnational gun registration, and restricting the rights of young adults \nto own guns even if they are well trained and operating under adult \nsupervision. I believe that prohibiting certain types of weapons is \nproblematic as well. Although I voted for the ban on certain kinds of \nsemi-automatic weapons in 1994, I have come to believe that it is a \nlargely arbitrary and symbolic measure. Citizens see it as a first step \ntowards confiscating their firearms. I will, therefore, vote against \nits reauthorization.\n  Finally, on the bill before us, I do not believe that granting \nspecial liability protection to the gun industry is necessary to \nprotect the right to bear arms. There is no evidence that liability \nlawsuits threaten the existence of the gun industry in America. I \nbelieve it would be a mistake to impose a nationwide standard of tort \nliability on this industry that is more lenient than the standard that \napplies to the manufacturers or suppliers of any other product. The gun \nindustry, like other industries, owes a duty to consumers of reasonable \ncare, and juries of citizens are best able to define that standard as \nthey do in tort cases of every imaginable type every day in this \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S1965]]\n\nGiving sweeping liability protection will cut off the rights of those \ninjured by negligence and set a very dangerous precedent for how \nCongress treats corporate wrongdoers. I will, therefore, vote against \nS. 1805.\n  I realize that many have very strong feelings about gun issues. But I \nalso believe that most Americans favor a moderate approach. That is the \napproach I intend to follow. My votes will not satisfy those on the \nextremes of this debate, but I believe they reflect the commonsense \nviews of reasonable Americans who regret that this issue has become the \nsubject of such overheated rhetoric.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to make plain my strong \nopposition to the bill under consideration today, S. 1805, the \n``Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.'' Let me state at the \noutset, I support the rights of law-abiding citizens to own and \nappropriately use firearms. But this bill has nothing to do with \nprotecting those citizens' rights. Instead, this bill is about \nprotecting rogue gun manufacturers that sell defective products and \nrogue gun dealers who turn a blind eye to suspicious sales and thefts.\n  The shorthand title for the bill is accurate, the Gun Industry \nImmunity Act. I won't mince words, this bill gives an entire industry a \nfree pass. In exchange for that free pass, hundreds of thousands of \nvictims across the county will confront closed doors at the courthouse. \nWhile I recognize that the bill carves out a set of exceptions of \npermissible law suits, this is cold comfort. The exceptions are \nextremely narrow and do not provide reasonable opportunities for \nlegitimate lawsuits to proceed. I am deeply troubled by the fact that \nthis bill will stop pending and future civil lawsuits against the gun \nindustry, including those filed in the wake of the DC Sniper shootings.\n  As the American public well knows, prior to their killing spree, John \nMuhammad and Lee Malvo allegedly obtained a Bushmaster rifle from a \nstore in Tacoma, Washington, the infamous Bull's Eye Shooter Supply \nShop. This rifle was one of 238 weapons that disappeared from the \nstore's inventory over a three year period. More than fifty of those \nsame ``missing'' firearms turned up in crime traces. Civil suits have \nbeen filed against Bull's Eye alleging that the store was negligent by \nfailing to keep track of its weapons, and against the gun manufacturer \nalleging that continuing to supply such dangerous weapons to a store \nthat cannot maintain accurate track is also negligent conduct. But \nunder today's bill, these allegations do not fit the narrow exceptions \nof permissible suits. Legal experts David Boies and Lloyd N. Cutler, as \nwell as the Congressional Research Service, opine that these sniper \nsuits will be dismissed immediately if the President signs the gun \nindustry immunity act. In real terms this means that the snipers' \nvictims, including Denise Johnson, widow of the Montgomery County bus \ndriver Conrad Johnson, and the family of James ``Sonny'' Buchanan, who \nwas gunned down while mowing the lawn, will have no remedies.\n  Another lawsuit that will be derailed if the gun industry immunity \nbill passes is a 1999 case against a gun dealer who repeatedly supplied \na so-called ``straw purchaser'' with handguns, one of which killed 9-\nyear old Nafis Jefferson in Philadelphia, PA. I was struck by what \nNafis' mother said when advised that her lawsuit may be dismissed. She \nstated, ``Before this happened, I believed in the American dream. You \nwork hard, you have a family, you have a good life. This--this has \ndevastated me. I understand commerce, but there also has to be common \nsense.''\n  Under the gun industry immunity bill it is quite likely that a \npending suit filed by the families of two New Jersey police officers \nwill be dismissed. The officers' families have sued the gun dealer who \nsold the gun used to shoot them, one of twelve guns the dealer sold in \none transaction, in cash, in circumstances so suspicious that the \ndealer subsequently called to alert the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms. Yet rather than having the careful consideration of the facts \nby judge and jury, today, Congress will decide that Mr. McGuire's and \nMr. Lemongello's families cannot pursue any remedies in civil court.\n  A family in Massachusetts will also be denied a right to sue should \nthe Gun Industry Immunity Bill pass. Twenty-six year old Danny Guzman \nwas killed with a 9 mm Kahr Arms gun. The gun was one of a dozen taken \nfrom Kahr's unsecured factory, some by the manufacturer's own employee \nwith a criminal record and history of drug abuse. The guns were taken \nbefore serial numbers had been stamped on them, making them very \ndifficult to trace. Eventually, a young child found the gun used in Mr. \nGuzman's death behind an apartment building close to the scene of the \nshooting. A Massachusetts court found that the suit alleges valid \nnegligence and public nuisance claims against the gun manufacturer and \nit is set for trial. Yet today's bill would deny Mr. Guzman's family \ntheir day in court.\n  Some have characterized the lawsuits against the gun manufacturers \nand dealers as ``junk'' suits that are cluttering our court houses and \nbankrupting the industry and thus, justifying this extraordinary \nsolution of blanket civil immunity. But our local, State and Federal \njudges and court personnel are no where to be found in this debate. No \nletters or reports document an inundation of firearm lawsuits plugging \nup the halls of justice. Furthermore, there is no evidence that our \nState and Federal courts cannot efficiently and effectively manage the \npending forearm lawsuits. Indeed, the opposite is true. Look no further \nthan a recently issued opinion by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nSecond Circuit in which the court addressed the certified question on \nwhether state law created a duty to protect victims of handgun violence \nfrom injury caused by illegal gun trafficking. This Court wrote a \ncareful and balanced opinion that fully addressed the issue. As a \nformer Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I am well aware of the \ncomplicated and deliberate process courts follow to develop tort law. I \nam not persuaded that Congress should tread into these waters so \nadeptly managed by our nation's judges and juries.\n  Gun manufacturers and dealers are not above the law. The gun industry \nImmunity bill is a radical and unprecedented attempt to undercut common \ntort law, usurp the responsibilities of judges and juries and most \nimportantly, deny worthy victims of their day in court. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against S. 1805, and thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Rhode Island for his hard work fighting this bill.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to join many of my colleagues, \nled by Senator Reed of Rhode Island, to express the strongest \nopposition that I possibly can to the legislation before the Senate. I \nwant to say, Mr. President, that enough is enough.\n  In doing so I am proud to not only stand with many of my colleagues \nbut many of my fellow Americans who are on the front lines trying to \nkeep our communities safe, such as our chiefs of police, other law \nenforcement, and mayors from around the country, as well as the tens of \nthousands of victims of gun violence, including my friends Jim and \nSarah Brady.\n  Here in Washington, there is a lot of talk about responsibility and \naccountability. Yet, this legislation does just the opposite. It does \nnothing but shield irresponsible gun makers and gun sellers from \naccountability.\n  Gun owners are asked to act responsibly and the vast majority of them \ndo. Gun makers and gun sellers should be held to the same standard. And \nyet, the legislation before us--the gun immunity bill--says to gun \nmakers and gun sellers that they don't need to meet the same standards \nas every as other business is required to meet, and that is to conduct \none's business in a reasonable and non-negligent manner.\n  No other industry has the kind of protection that the NRA is seeking \non behalf the gun industry with respect to a relatively small number of \nlawsuits that have been filed or may be filed in the future. I simply \ncannot understand why the Congress would give this extraordinary and \nunprecedented liability protection to the gun industry.\n  Mr. President, we must do all we can to defeat the gun immunity bill \nwhich, among many other things, will give legal protection to the gun \ndealer--Bull's Eye Shooter Supply--who armed the D.C. area snipers and \nwill take away the right to sue from the victims.\n\n[[Page S1966]]\n\nWhat an injustice to the DC sniper victims and the American people. \nWhat a real shame.\n  Let me be clear, Mr. President. Despite protestations and suggestions \nto the contrary, this bill isn't about helping people. This bill is not \nabout the rights of hunters.\n  Not one single gun owner will be helped by this immunity legislation. \nThis bill is also not about jobs. This is about serving the will of the \ngun industry first, and the interest of the American people a distant \nsecond.\n  As noted by Mayor Bloomberg of New York City, Mayor Daley of Chicago, \nMayor Kahn of Los Angeles, and Mayor King of Gary, in an op-ed in the \nNew York Times opposing this bill, federal data from 2000 shows that a \nlittle more than 1 percent of dealers account for 57 percent of all \nguns recovered in criminal investigations.\n  Responsible gun sellers should be angry about this. They should \ndemand action to clean up their industry. Yet, the legislation the \nSenate is considering now would say to the small group of irresponsible \ngun dealers, ``don't bother running a responsible business,'' and ``you \nare not responsible for your actions no matter how reckless or \nnegligent they may be.''\n  Before addressing the specifics of this legislation, let me clear up \nsome other misinformation about how criminals get their guns. Many \nfalsely believe that criminals and drug dealers steal most of their \nguns and that gun dealers are not responsible in any way for the vast \nmajority of guns that end up being used in violent crime, that it is \nthe fault of criminals. This is simply not true.\n  In 1998, a Northwestern University study of records maintained by the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms demonstrated that more \ncriminals buy their guns new than steal them. Specifically, the ATF \ndetermined that while more than 11,000 of the weapons traced were \nstolen from licensed gun dealers or residences, almost four times as \nmany--more than 40,000--were sold by licensed dealers. This number is \nastounding.\n  Almost four times as many guns recovered from criminals by the ATF \nwere gained through licensed traffickers and not through theft.\n  This is an important point to note because if most guns used in \ncrimes in our country are not stolen but in fact are purchased, \nmanufacturers and sellers of guns and ammunition can greatly influence \nthe degree to which guns flow get in the hands of criminals.\n  Gun dealers hold an enormous and unparreled power over the supply of \nguns in America. While most gun dealers who wield this power act \nresponsibly, the negligence and irresponsibility of a few bad seeds, \nlike the Bull's Eye Shooter Supply in Tacoma, WA, are the cause of the \nproblem. These bad gun dealers, the 1 percent of dealers who account \nfor 57 percent of all guns recovered in criminal investigations, need \nto be held accountable. Yet this bill removes that accountability.\n  This legislation removes that accountability through section 3 of the \nbill, which precludes even the bringing of civil actions against gun \nmanufacturers, gun dealers, distributors, sellers of ammunition, and \neven trade associations in any Federal or State court.\n  By the way, the prohibition on commencing an action applies not just \nto individuals, but to states, local governments, and, incredibly, even \nthe federal government.\n  Section 3 also states that pending civil actions ``shall be \nimmediately dismissed'' by the court in which the action was brought.\n  This bill is particularly disturbing to me because it directly and \nsignificantly affects New Yorkers. Currently, the City of New York has \na suit pending--initially commenced by Rudy Giuliani when he served as \nMayor of New York. Given that bill proponents have argued that this \nlegislation is needed to protect against frivolous lawsuits, are they \nsuggesting that Rudy Giuliani would file such a lawsuit against the gun \nindustry. I don't think so.\n  It would be a shame if New York City's suit were to be dismissed \nbecause New York City--under the Giuliani administration--filed suit to \ntry and protect the health and safety of New Yorkers by getting the gun \nindustry to change its practices.\n  Indeed, a New York federal court has already found in another case \nthat gun manufacturers improper sales and distribution practices \ncontribute to the illegal gun market in NY State, and there is ample \nevidence, including a study conducted by the National Economic Research \nAssociates, that if gun manufacturers and sellers change their \npractices and use care and act responsible in their selling practices, \nmany fewer guns wind up in the hands of criminals and used in \ncommitting crimes.\n  And the New York Police Department--the largest and one of the finest \nlaw enforcement agencies in the world--has had to expend enormous \nresources to control gun-trafficking. I don't want their work--none of \nus should want their work--to be conducted in vain by failing to hold \naccountable irresponsible gun dealers.\n  As New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer has said: ``The nation's \nlaw enforcement officials struggle every day against the scourge of gun \ncrimes, and we look to Congress to assist us in that fight, not make \nour jobs harder. By providing broad immunity to the gun industry, this \nbill will endanger the very police officers who place their lives on \nthe line to protect all Americans.''\n  In addition to New York City, a small number of New Yorkers who have \nbeen severely injured because of the negligence of others have also \ncommenced actions against certain gun manufactures and gun dealers. I \nam not going to prejudge the merits of these cases, but the bottom line \nis that they deserve their day in court. This law would deny them that \nbasic right.\n  One of these suits arose out of what has been referred to as the \n``Wendy's Massacre.''\n  In May of 2001, two criminals armed with an allegedly illegally \nacquired semi-automatic pistol went into a Wendy's restaurant, ordered \nall of the employees into the basement, marched them single file into a \nwalk-in refrigerator, duct taped their mouths, tied them up, covered \ntheir heads with plastic bags, and one by one, shot them execution \nstyle in the back of the head. These workers were brutally gunned down \nfor a total of $2,400.\n  One of those injured individuals fortunate enough to have survived \nthe tragedy was Jaquione Johnson, who now has a suit pending against \nBryco Arms. Johnson sustained serious injuries including brain damage \nand paralysis.\n  Jaquione contends that the defendant's distribution practices \ncreated, contributed to, and maintained the illegal secondary gun \nmarket through which the handgun passed until it did its deadly work. \nThis underground market, the complaint asserts, depended upon \ndefendants' irresponsible business practices, such as multiple firearms \nsales and straw purchases.\n  The complaint further asserts that because the gun dealers could gain \nsignificant revenue from illegal firearms sales, they failed to adopt \nbasic policies and practices that would greatly decrease the number of \nguns reaching criminals despite the knowledge that it was reasonably \nforeseeable that individuals like the plaintiff and the public at large \nwould be harmed.\n  No one in the Wendy's case is arguing that the defendant gun \nmanufacturer and dealer pulled the trigger that killed and maimed the \nWendy's workers. Instead, the victim is simply seeking to be \ncompensated for serious injuries that were caused by the negligence of \nanother.\n  If the defendants were not negligent in distributing the deadly \nweapon used here, they will not be held liable by the court. However, \nif the defendant gun dealers were negligent in their distribution of \nthe guns and that negligence helped cause the plaintiff' harm, then \nthey will be held accountable.\n  A suit like Jacquoine's, despite what others would have you believe, \nis not frivolous. This is a meritorious suit that must be heard in our \ncourts to ensure accountability.\n  In fact, just a few weeks ago, on February 3, a Federal judge in New \nYork denied the defendant's motion to dismiss Jaquione's suit, making \nclear that Jaquione claim is anything but frivolous. Yet, the NRA \nbelieves that it, by legislative fiat, should pre-ordain the result in \nJaquione's case.\n  This New York case and the case commenced by the City of New York\n\n[[Page S1967]]\n\nunder the Giuliani administration are not outliers. Gary, IN has a suit \npending and the Supreme Court of Indiana has held that city had a valid \nlegal claim. The Illinois Court of Appeal held similar with respect to \na case brought by the city of Chicago. The bill before us, however, \nwould override the decisions of these appellate State courts.\n  Similarly, in New Mexico, a teenager who was shot in the face has \nbrought suit against Bryco Arms alleging that the pistol's design was \ndefective and unreasonably dangerous for its failure to incorporate \nsafety devices like a loaded chamber indicator and a magazine \ndisconnect safety that would prevent a pistol from being fired with the \nmagazine removed.\n  The New Mexico Court of Appeals held that the suit stated a valid \nlegal claim and should go to trial. Further, the court stated, \n``application of our tort law can be expected to enhance [gun] \nownership by tending to increase the safety of guns.'' This legitimate \nand worthy claim would be in danger of dismissal if this bill is \npassed.\n  There are a number of other suits just like the ones I have just \nmentioned and they are before our State and Federal courts. That \nCongress, rather than these courts, would make the decision by \nlegislative fiat to dismiss these cases, regardless of the facts and \nthe law, is extraordinary and unprecedented and a real shame. It should \nnot be countenanced.\n  The proponents of this legislation point to the exceptions contained \nin section 4 of the bill and have argued that the exceptions are \nsufficient to allow non-frivolous lawsuits to be maintained.\n  First of all, despite all the talk of frivolous suits, the proponents \npoint to not one court that has deemed any lawsuit brought in any \nfederal or state court against a manufacturer or gun dealer as \nfrivolous. The proponents of this special interest legislation cannot \npoint to such a decision because there is none. No frivolous lawsuits \nhave been filed. That assertion is simply devoid of merit.\n  As to the purported exceptions in the bill, they are so narrowly \ncrafted as to be illusory.\n  The first exception provides that a lawsuit can be brought by the \nparty ``directly harmed'' against a defendant who has been convicted of \nthe crime of ``knowingly'' transferring a firearm ``knowing'' that the \nguns would be used to commit a crime of violence or a drug trafficking \ncrime.\n  In other words, this exception would not apply to a dealer who is \nextraordinarily reckless or negligent as to how it markets or sells its \nguns unless the dealer knew it was selling a gun to someone who would \ncommit a violent crime.\n  This is an extraordinarily high burden because it says that you can \nonly sue a dealer if the dealer engaged in a criminal act--if the \ndealer is, in affect, an accomplice to a violent or drug trafficking \ncrime.\n  The second exception provides that an action may be brought ``against \na seller for negligent entrustment or negligence per se.''\n  ``Negligent entrustment'' is defined in the bill to mean ``the \nsupplying of a qualified product by a seller for use by another person \nwhen the seller knows, or should know, the person to whom the product \nis supplied is likely to, and does, use the product in a manner \ninvolving unreasonable risk of physical injury to the person or \nothers.''\n  In other words, according to the Congressional Research Service, this \nexception would appear to allow a suit to be maintained against an \nentity that supplied a firearm or ammunition to a person who, because \nof age, mental disability, intoxication, or violent propensity, seems \nlikely to use the product in a dangerous manner.\n  That may be all well and good, but I wondered why the crafters of the \nbill went to the trouble of defining ``negligent entrustment,'' when \nsuch a cause of action is defined by state law.\n  Well, it's because ``negligent entrustment'' has been defined in this \nlegislation much more narrowly than how it has been defined by many \nstates under state law.\n  In fact, in the case brought by the victims of the DC snipers against \nBull's Eye Shooter Supply, the Washington state court held that \n``negligent entrustment'' also occurs when a firearms manufacturer \nsells firearms to a retail store that it ``knew or should have known . \n. . was operating its store in a reckless or incompetent manner, \ncreating an unreasonable risk of harm.''\n  Indeed, one of the allegations in the complaint brought by victims of \nthe DC sniper against the manufacturer of the gun used by the DC \nsnipers was that the manufacturer knew or should have known that the \nretailer--Bull's Eye--had a ``history of a large number of weapons for \nwhich it could not account.''\n  The Washington state court found that if the plaintiff could prove \nthis, then the manufacturer ``may be liable for plaintiff's injuries \nunder the theory of negligent entrustment.'' The court, therefore, \ndenied the defendant manufacturer's motion to dismiss.\n  So the bottom line is that this supposed ``exception'' in the bill is \nnot really an exception because it dramatically narrows the State law \ndefinition of negligent entrustment.\n  To make matters even worse, the exception does not cover \nmanufacturers; it only covers ``sellers,'' such as gun dealers. So even \nif there were a broader definition of negligent entrustment in this \nexception, it would still prohibit such a cause of action from ever \nbeing brought against a manufacturer. This is one of the major \nobjections to the bill made by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer.\n  Lastly, as to this second exception in section 4 of the bill, \nincluding ``negligence per se'' doesn't add much because the common law \ndefinition of ``negligence per se'' means that a person or entity is \nnegligent per se, 1, if the party violated a state or federal statute; \n2, if it demonstrated that the person bringing the action was the \nmember of the class of persons that the statute was intended to \nprotect, and 3, that the party's injuries suffered were the kind that \nthe statute was enacted to prevent.\n  But the bottom line is that violation of a statute is required. \nThat's not very much of an exception to the gun immunity's general \nprovision that no civil action can be brought in any federal or state \ncourt and that all pending cases must be dismissed.\n  There has been much discussion about the third exception because it \nwas recently added to this legislation, but this exception, like the \nothers in the bill, is extraordinarily narrow as to be almost \nmeaningless.\n  The third exception provides that an action may be brought in which a \nmanufacturer or a seller of a gun violated state or federal law \nconcerning the sale or marketing of guns or ammunition and the \nviolation of the statute was the proximate cause of the harm for which \nrelief is sought, including, 1, any case in which the manufacturer or \nseller knowingly made a false entry in, or failed to make an \nappropriate entry in, any record required to be kept under federal or \nstate law; 2, any case in which the manufacturer or seller aided, \nabetted, or conspired with any person in making any false or fictitious \noral or written statement with respect to any material factor \nconcerning the lawfulness of the sale; or 3, any case in which the \nmanufacturer or seller aided, abetted, or conspired with some to sell \nor otherwise dispose of a gun or ammunition, knowing, or having \nreasonable cause to believe, that the actual buyer of the gun or \nammunition was prohibited from possessing or receiving a firearm or \nammunition under subsections (g) or (n) of section 922 of title 18.\n  I know this section has already been discussed at some length, but I \nwant to underscore that two esteemed lawyers, Lloyd Cutler and David \nBoies, after reviewing this language extensively and the complaint \nfiled by the DC sniper victims against Bull's Eye Shooter Supply, \nstated that in two separate legal opinions that this suit could not be \nmaintained under this exception and would have to be dismissed.\n  The fourth exception is an action for breach of contract or warranty \nin the connection with the purchase of a gun.\n  This exception is also of no moment, however, because as troubling \nand out of the mainstream as this legislation is, one would hope that \nthe United States Congress would not seek to render null and void \ncontracts and warranty agreements entered into between the sellers and \npurchasers of guns.\n  The fifth and final exception to the general provision requiring the \ndismissal of pending cases and the prohibition on bringing any future \ncases is\n\n[[Page S1968]]\n\nan exception for ``an action for physical injuries or property damage \nresulting directly from a defect in design or manufacture of the \nproduct, when used as intended or in a manner that is reasonably \nforeseeable.''\n  ``Reasonably foreseeable'', however, is defined to exclude any \ncriminal or unlawful misuse--violation of a statute, ordinance, or \nregulation--of a gun or ammunition, other than possessory offenses. \nWhat does this mean?\n  Contrary to what some of my colleagues have said during this floor \ndebate, it does not mean that all design or manufacturing defect cases \ncan be brought or maintained.\n  This is so for a number of reasons. First, the product would have to \nbe used as intended. If there is a defect in the gun, for example, but \nan unintended use is that a child uses the gun and accidently maims or \nkills himself, this legislation would prevent the child or his parents \nfrom even filing a lawsuit against the manufacturer to seek recovery \nand, equally important, from trying to hold the manufacturer \naccountable so that the defect could be fixed and such injuries to \nother children could be prevented.\n  This exception is also extraordinarily narrow in that even if there \nis a design or manufacturing defect and even if someone is harmed \nbecause of the defect, no recovery can even be sought if the gun was \nused in any criminal activity or misused in any way.\n  I know I have taken a fair amount of time to talk about the \nexceptions contained in section 4 of this bill, but I felt it important \nbecause proponents of this legislation have constantly said ``look to \nsection 4,'' suggesting that these exceptions will enable legitimate \ncases to be brought and/or maintained against negligent manufacturers \nand gun dealers.\n  As I have laid out in great detail, the assertion made by the \nproponents of this legislation is unequivocally--simply--not true. And \nI want to make sure that the American people who are watching and \nlistening to this debate understand that.\n  I also want to take a moment to correct some other misstatements that \nhave been statements in support of this bill.\n  As noted above, one of the assertions is that there are thousands of \nfrivolous lawsuits--including I guess the one filed by former New York \nMayor Rudy Giuliani--that have been filed. Well, as we now know, that \nstatement is simply not true because not one court has deemed any case \nfiled to be frivolous.\n  In fact, a respected senior Federal judge in New York, Judge Jack \nWeinstein, actually dismissed a case brought by the NAACP because he \nheld that the NAACP wasn't the proper plaintiff. However, in his 178-\npage ruling, Judge Weinstein found that gun manufacturer's improper \nsales and distribution practices contribute to the illegal gun market \nin New York State. His conclusion was based on previously unavailable \ndata from the ATF and from the gun industry that established a \nconnection between the gun industry's marketing practices and access to \nguns by criminals.\n  He also found that the data demonstrated that a ``handful of `bad \napple' retailers in the industry supply a disproportionate share of \nguns used in crimes.''\n  Indeed, according to Robert Haas, the former Senior Vice President \nfor marketing and sales for defendant Smith & Wesson, the gun industry \nknows that the criminal market is fueled by the industry's distribution \npractices, but does nothing.\n  Haas has said: ``The company and the industry as a whole are fully \naware of the extent of the criminal misuse of firearms.''\n  ``The company and the industry are also aware that the black market \nin firearms is not simply the result of stolen guns but is due to the \nseepage of guns into the illicit market from multiple thousands of \nunsupervised federal firearms licensees. In spite of their knowledge, \nhowever, the industry's position has consistently been to take no \nindependent action to insure responsible distribution practices.''\n  This failure to take action is particularly disturbing because the \nproblem can be fixed. If all gun manufacturers took reasonable measures \nin distributing their guns, then there would be significantly fewer \nguns in the hands of criminals.\n  This is consistent with Judge Weinstein's finding that the data in \nthe case before him showed that the handgun industry could have done \nsomething about these dealers, including implementing obvious common \nsense solutions such as data gathering and monitoring regulations, but \nchose not to do so.\n  Another assertion by proponents of this legislation is that these \nlawsuits--less than 100 of them--are bankrupting the industry. Well, \nfrom what I can tell, the gun industry is doing anything but hurting. \nThat's not my view, but the view of gun manufacturers that have filed \nreports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  Manufacturer after manufacturer has reported to the SEC that it is \nfinancially stable and that ``it is not probable and is unlikely that \nlitigation, including punitive damage claims, will have a material \nadverse effect on the financial position of the Company.''\n  Another claim made is that these suits are going to cause jobs to go \noverseas. Now, I would love it, and more important, the American people \nwould greatly appreciate it, if instead of considering this bill, the \nSenate was seeking to address in a comprehensive way the more than 3 \nmillion jobs lost in the past 3 years. But the Senate has chosen not to \ndo so.\n  I have worked hard to support the development of jobs in my state and \nappreciate that there are New Yorkers in my state who help to \nmanufacture guns at Remington Arms.\n  But the truth is that Remington Arms is not in financial trouble \nbased on this litigation. Remington Arms produces long guns primarily \nand the vast majority of the victims of gun violence and crime are shot \nby hand guns, not long guns, such as rifles and shotguns. Remington \nArms does not need this protection; it is financially strong. Instead, \nit is the victims of gun violence that need protection from this \nlegislation.\n  In short, these suits are not about putting the gun industry out of \nbusiness. They are about responsible business practices, they are about \nkeeping the guns out of the wrong hands through responsible \ndistribution practices.\n  In fact, it is because of some of the lawsuits that have been filed \nthat some gun manufacturers have improved their marketing and \ndistribution practices.\n  In March of 2000, for example, the gun manufacturer Smith & Wesson \nreached a settlement with a number of government entities, including \nthe State of New York.\n  This settlement demonstrates why the gun immunity bill will actually \nmake guns less safe.\n  As part of the agreement, Smith & Wesson agreed to change the ways it \ndistributes guns it manufacturers. It promised to sell only to \nauthorized distributors and dealers who adhere to a stringent code of \nconduct and it agreed to terminate sales to any dealer who sells a \ndisproportionate number of guns used in crime. The settlement makes us \nsafer because it helps to ensure that guns won't end up in the hands of \ncriminals.\n  Smith & Wesson also agreed that their guns will be shipped with \nexternal safety locks, that all pistols will have a chamber loaded \nindicator, that new gun designs will include smart gun technology, and \nthat all guns must pass performance tests to ensure safety and quality.\n  These are reasonable agreements that all gun manufacturers should \nfollow. They make guns safer for everyone, especially those who own and \noperate them, especially for the children of gun owners. This \nsettlement demonstrates the great possibilities that exist to improve \nthe safety of guns.\n  This settlement underscores how much manufacturers and dealers can do \nto keep Americans safer without unduly affecting the bottom business \nline.\n  If the bill before us becomes law, however, don't expect to see any \nsimilar settlements in the future. If gun makers cannot be held liable, \nthey will have no incentive to enter into a settlement. If they cannot \nbe held liable, gun makers will have absolutely no financial incentive \nto make their guns safer. Indeed, they will actually have a financial \ndisincentive to develop new safety mechanisms and distribution \npractices.\n  As a Senator from a State with millions of law abiding gun owners, I \nwant\n\n[[Page S1969]]\n\nguns to be as safe as possible. I want new safety features and \nimprovements developed. And I want--we should all want--the victims who \nare injured or killed because of defective guns or bad marketing and \nsales practices to not have the courthouse doors slammed in their \nfaces.\n  Gun violence is a dangerous threat throughout our nation claiming the \nlives of thousands of people every year across America and New York \nState.\n  In 2001, the number of deaths in the U.S. from firearms was 29,573. \nIn addition, for every firearm fatality in the U.S., there are two non-\nfatal firearm injuries.\n  A study of all direct and indirect costs of gun violence estimates \nthat gun violence costs the nation $100 billion a year.\n  In 1999, New Yorkers suffered 1,652 hospitalizations and 965 deaths \nat the hands of gun violence. 291 of those deaths were individuals \nbelow the age of 24.\n  In 2000, there were 1,093 deaths in New York State from firearms.\n  We should be talking about how we can reduce gun violence and prevent \ndeaths of American men, women, and children, not how to slam the \ncourthouse door shut to gun victims and while at the same time giving \nbad gun dealers blanket immunity from irresponsibly and negligent \nconduct.\n  Although this very bad bill is currently before the U.S. Senate, all \nof my colleagues, including the bill's proponents, have an opportunity \nto help make our communities safer by supporting a number of amendments \ncurrently pending, including the amendment offered by Senators \nFeinstein, Warner, and Schumer that reauthorizes the assault weapons \nban and the amendment offered by Senators McCain and Reed that seeks to \nclose what has been called the ``gun show loophole.''\n  I must say that it is astonishing to me that we even need to debate \nthe reauthorization of the assault weapons ban because there is no \nreasonable argument that can be made against it. People do not hunt \nwith assault weapons. Instead, assault weapons are designed for one \npurpose and for one purpose only and that is to kill people.\n  Extending and improving upon the assault weapons ban is essential \nbecause assault weapons are a clear threat to law enforcement. Assault \nweapons kill police officers.\n  One in five law enforcement officers slain in the line of duty is \nkilled with an assault weapon. I would hope that everyone would agree \nthat we need to put the interests of law enforcement officers far ahead \nof the interests of the NRA. If we are to remain true to our support \nfor law enforcement officials, we need to extend and improve the \nassault weapons ban because it is our duty to protect those who risk \ntheir lives to protect us.\n  In addition, a report released yesterday by the Brady Center to \nPrevent Gun Violence, ``On Target: The Impact of the 1994 Federal \nAssault Weapons Act,'' demonstrates that the assault weapons ban passed \n10 years ago has been working. The report shows that the assault \nweapons banned by name in the Act have declined substantially, 66 \npercent, as a percentage of overall crime gun traces since the assault \nweapons ban was enacted in 1994. The study concludes that the ban has \ncontributed to a substantial reduction in the use of assault weapons in \ncrime, despite the industry's efforts to evade the law through the sale \nof copycat guns.\n  The assault weapons ban has been successful keeping these killing \nmachines off our streets but it is set to expire later this year. To \nprotect our law enforcement officials, to protect our safety, we cannot \nlet this law expire. We must reauthorize the ban on assault weapons.\n  We must also do all we can to close the ``gun show loophole'' because \nthe loophole enables those who are otherwise prohibited from purchasing \nfirearms under federal law to easily obtain guns.\n  Terrorists, criminals and other people prohibited from buying or \npossessing guns seek out unlicensed sellers at gun shows because they \nknow that they can simply put down their money and walk away with \ndeadly weapons. Additionally, because these unlicensed sellers are not \nwell-regulated and do not keep records, criminals exploit gun shows to \nsell firearms and law enforcement has difficulty tracing gun-show \nfirearms that turn up at crime scenes. Gun shows are now the second \nleading source of firearms recovered in illegal gun trafficking \ninvestigations.\n  The gun show loopholes in our laws allow individuals otherwise \nprohibited from legally purchasing firearms to easily gain access to \npotentially deadly weapons. Both the City and State of New York have \nenacted laws regulating gun sales and the possession of guns within the \nCity and State. Yet, because of the gun show loophole, these laws have \nbeen unable to stop guns from coming into New York. Expert studies by \nDr. Howard Andrews of Columbia University show almost 90 percent of \nguns recovered at crime scenes in NY were purchased out state.\n  If our background checks on gun purchases are going to have meaning \nand value, we must close the gun show loopholes and that is why I \nsupport the McCain-Reed-DeWine-Lieberman amendment and I hope the \nentire Senate will do the same.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to implore my colleagues to examine \nthe legislation before us that will give blanket immunity to bad gun \nmanufacturers and dealers and to support the amendments designed to \nmake our country safer.\n  I can't even begin to imagine what this nation will be like at the \nend of this September if the assault weapons ban is not renewed, the \ngun show loophole is not closed, and the gun immunity bill becomes law.\n  Unscrupulous and negligent gun manufacturers and dealers--both \nlicensed and unlicensed--will be able to sell guns of all kinds, \nincluding assault weapons, and incredibly, no matter what happens, no \nmatter how many Americans will be maimed and killed, they will be \nimmune from liability.\n  I implore my colleagues to do all we can to make sure that doesn't \nhappen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is still 1 minute remaining of the \nminority's time.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 11:35 is under the control \nof the majority leader or his designee.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I might ask the other side how they want to \ndeal with their 1 minute remaining prior to my closing statement.\n  Mr. REID. I yield it back.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have been granted the time of the leader \nto close out this debate before we start votes at 11:35.\n  I must tell you, I am honored by the presence of the Senator from \nMassachusetts today on the floor to debate this critical issue. I am \nhonored we have lifted the gun debate, on a fundamentally important \nbill for the average American, to Presidential politics. So let's go to \nwhere the average American is, by a Zogby poll taken some months ago, \nand this is: The red States versus the blue States, the Bush States \nversus the Gore States, in 2000.\n  When the average American, by the Zogby International polling group--\ncertainly no rightwing polling group--did their work with Southern \nMethodists, here is what they got. For the statement: ``There are \nenough laws on the books. What is needed is better law enforcement for \ncurrent laws regarding gun control.''--69 percent in the Bush States \nagreed, 63 percent in the Gore States; for the military, the veterans, \nand the nonmilitary--all of them well above a majority of 50 percent. \nWhen it comes to the underlying bill, that number jumps into the 70s.\n  Americans are fed up with the politics and the placebos to put a law \non the books and somehow you have made the world safer. What they want \nis the cop on the beat arresting the bad guy or gal, and the courts not \nsummarily putting them back on the streets. And when you use a gun in \nthe commission of a crime, I suggest, and we suggest, and the American \npeople suggest, you do the time. You don't plea-bargain them back to \nthe streets out of a liberal court system.\n  That is the reality. That is what is important about this underlying \ndebate. I am proud we have elevated it to the stature it is today.\n  I yield 5 minutes of my remaining time to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank Senator Craig.\n  Mr. President, I want to address this bill generally but then close \nmy comments on the so-called gun show loophole amendment.\n\n[[Page S1970]]\n\n  I believe there are those who benefit from the job-destroying lawsuit \nlottery in this country, and there are those who seek to restrict the \nrights of law-abiding citizens to use firearms for legitimate purposes.\n  On the job-destroying lawsuit lottery, let me just mention one \ncompany in Texas, Maverick Arms, located in Eagle Pass, where 140 \ndedicated people work to assemble Mossberg and Maverick guns, high-\nquality firearms for shooting sports, military, and law enforcement \ncommunities. Maverick's ability to continue providing good jobs to the \ncitizens of Texas is in jeopardy. It is in jeopardy because of junk \nlawsuits filed by trial lawyers, and the politicians who support their \nright to terrorize a legal employer providing a legal product, as \nopposed to focusing our efforts on the criminals and those who \nillegally use firearms who should be punished for doing so.\n  I believe it is absolutely imperative that, rather than focusing on \nand punishing law-abiding citizens who want nothing more than to \nprovide for their families by engaging in a lawful enterprise and \nproducing a legal product, we ought to focus our law enforcement \nefforts on the criminals. Indeed, we have found through programs such \nas Project Exile in Richmond, VA, and Texas Exile in my own State, we \ncan have a real impact by punishing the convicted felons who illegally \npossess firearms and those who use firearms illegally to jeopardize our \ncommunities and threaten our communities, and that there is absolutely \nno benefit to be gained by passing additional laws, as the proponents \nof these amendments would do, that limit the rights of law-abiding \ncitizens.\n  I would like to just mention in closing why I believe we do need to \nexpand the role of instant background checks to all commercial gun \nsales, no matter where they occur. But as well-intentioned as the \namendments proposed by Senator McCain and Senator Reed and Senator \nLieberman and others are, the so-called closing the gun show loophole \nbill--as well-intentioned as they are, I think it misses the mark. I \nwould like to work with them to try to bring the instant background \ncheck to all commercial gun sales in this country.\n  The problem is this amendment, as well-intentioned as it is, will \nhave the effect, should there be a State attorney general who doesn't \nseek a 24-hour instant background check period, that there will be a \ndefault through a 3-day check period, which will essentially obliterate \ngun show sales.\n  It is important to point out that, currently, everybody who is a \ndealer in firearms is subject to the Federal firearms license. Indeed, \nthere is no such thing as an unlicensed dealer. But what this amendment \nwould seek to do would be to affect people who are not dealers in \nfirearms, but are collectors, people who engage in sales to friends and \nfamily and others, and these are. As long as they are lawful possessors \nof these firearms, I don't believe the full apparatus of the Federal \nGovernment ought to intrude on that ability to conduct a sale that is \nno threat to the people of this country.\n  So S. 1706, which Senator Craig and others have cosponsored, which \ncurrently sits in the Judiciary Committee, I suggest is an appropriate \nvehicle. Senator McCain and others are cosponsors of that bill. I think \nit will ultimately accomplish the goal of this gun show amendment. I \ncannot support that amendment as it is written now, but I look forward \nto working with them to write a bill that would address the real \nproblem, and that is a need for instant background checks across the \nboard to make sure guns are not sold to common criminals, and make sure \nthat we do not unnecessarily interfere with the rights of law-abiding \ncitizens.\n  With that, I yield back the remaining time to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for his \ndebate and leadership on these issues. He has been a statewide law \nenforcement officer. He knows what laws are all about. He knows how the \npublic reacts to them, and he knows that laws have to be enforced.\n  We are minutes away from starting a very critical vote process on \nthree amendments before we break for lunch. We will vote on the \nFeinstein, McCain, and Campbell amendments. There will be time allotted \nfor each one as we get to them. In the minute that remains, I will say \nthis has been a very positive debate. At the same time, I think there \nis a common sense and a reality that stacking up gun laws on the \nFederal books of the U.S. Code doesn't work, unless they are \neffectively enforced on the ground and the criminal element who may \nviolate these laws knows there is a bite in the law; that somehow if \nthey use a gun in the commission of a crime, they are going to do the \ntime.\n  Everywhere that principle has been applied, crime has gone down, the \nuse of a gun by a criminal has gone down. There have been arguments \nabout keeping guns out of the hands of terrorists. They have not made \ntheir case because every example they use was a terrorist who had been \narrested, stopped. The guns, strangely, were to be exported out of the \ncountry by the terrorist. So they placed themselves in double jeopardy. \nNow they are doing the time. Somehow, in that portion of the law it \nworked well. But the vote we are going to take is over whether to \nextend the law for another period of time that Congress said some years \nago they wanted to look at. Therefore, we would sunset it and \nreconsider it. That is what we are doing and will do by a vote on the \nextension of the assault weapons ban, the extension of a law that \nhasn't worked.\n  All of the statistics are in. The numbers have not changed. Is the \nassault weapon, or a weapon of similar appearance, misused on occasion? \nYes, it is, but by less than 2 percent in participating in a crime. Is \nthat a justification for, again, establishing a tripwire? The Senator \nfrom Massachusetts said you are going to unleash AK-47s back on the \nstreets. Well, the law that bans them is still in place. It doesn't \nfall out with the assault weapons ban going away. That and the Uzi law \nare in place.\n  Senators will now come to the Chamber for a vote in a few moments on \nthese critical issues. I hope they have been engaged. The debate has \nbeen very civil over a very important part of what we do in the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the first vote will be 15 minutes, and for \nthe second two there is an order that they be 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Also, there are 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided before each of the amendments. The first amendment is the \nFeinstein assault weapons amendment.\n  Who yields time? If no one yields time, time will be charged equally.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I understand we are about to vote on the \nFeinstein amendment. On behalf of Senator Feinstein, I urge all \ncolleagues to support this amendment. This amendment would continue a \nban on assault weapons that has been in place for 10 years. It has \nensured that military weapons will not be on the streets of America, \nwill not be used in crimes, will not be accessible to terrorists, which \nwill not force our police officers to confront these weapons.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is a continuation \nof present law. It is not a new law. I think the American public has \ncome to understand this law and appreciate it and support it. I think \nthey would urge its adoption and its continuation. Again, I urge a \nfavorable vote on the Feinstein amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to let the assault \nweapons ban die in peace. It expires in September of 2004. Statistics \nshow it has not changed the method of operation of criminals in this \ncountry. The assault weapons or the definition to which we prescribe in \nthe law is not a weapon of choice of the criminal on the streets of \nAmerica. It has simply set up the tripwires for law-abiding citizens \nwho may choose to have this type of gun in their collection. By \ndefinition, that means that gun doesn't get misused. The stolen weapon, \nthe one trafficked in the black market, is the one that is misused. \nThat is why I believe--and many colleagues agree with me--when you \nsunset a law, you do so for the purpose of reexamining it to see \nwhether it is worthy of staying on the books of\n\n[[Page S1971]]\n\nthis country. It is not. It is time for it to go away. I ask my \ncolleagues to vote no on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 2637.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 47, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 24 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--52\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham (FL)\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--47\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lott\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Johnson\n       \n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Following this is the debate on the gun show loophole. \nThere are 2 minutes of debate and a 10-minute vote to follow. I wish my \ncolleagues would cease conversation so they can hear the proponent of \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order. Will the \nSenators in the well please cease their conversations so we can \ncontinue with the debate. We will now proceed with debate on amendment \nNo. 2636. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, if I could have the attention of my \ncolleagues, another critical vote is at hand.\n  To my colleagues, envision a door. If you walk through the door, the \nFederal Government takes over. If you stay outside the door, the \ncurrent laws are in authority. It is called the gun show loophole. We \nhave an amendment here that puts a whole new tripwire in front of the \nlaw-abiding citizen. It does not go after the criminal element. We know \nless than 2 percent of guns that are used in the commission of a crime \nare gotten through a gun show. Most of them are obtained in the back \nstreets.\n  Let's talk about law enforcement and the argument about terrorists \ngaining their guns through gun shows. The reason they arrested the \nterrorists is the current laws work. There are 1,000 gun shows for law-\nabiding citizens. Let's not create a Federal bureaucracy that will \nbegin to govern and control what is the right of free commerce in this \ncountry. Let the current Federal law work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time? The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I remind my colleagues all reference to the Attorney \nGeneral has been removed from this amendment. There is no Department of \nJustice oversight of the gun shows in this amendment.\n  Ali Boumelhem, a Lebanese national and a member of the terrorist \ngroup Hezbollah, was arrested and convicted for attempting to smuggle \nfirearms he bought from Michigan gun shows to Lebanon.\n  Muhammed Asrar, a Pakistani national, in this country on an expired \nvisa, who admitted to buying and selling firearms at Texas gun shows. \nAsrar is a suspected al-Qaida member who had obtained a pilot's \nlicense, had photos of tall buildings.\n  Connor Claxton, an admitted member of the Irish Republican Army, \nspent over $100,000 at Florida gun shows and through other private \ndealers to obtain firearms to smuggle to Ireland.\n  They were arrested. How many were not arrested? This is the most \ncurious logic I have ever heard. They were arrested. Who wasn't \narrested? A loophole exists. If we are interested in the security of \nthis Nation, we will close it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2623\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next amendment is amendment No. 2623, the \nCampbell-Leahy amendment. There are 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, this amendment has 67 cosponsors. I am \nproud to say Senator Leahy and Senator Reid of Nevada are original \ncosponsors.\n  This is the No. 1 priority for the 300,000-member Fraternal Order of \nPolice, and has been endorsed by literally every major police \norganization in the country, giving off-duty and retired policemen \nauthority to carry concealed weapons interstate with proper training.\n  We already have a similar law in place for airline pilots. Certainly \nlaw enforcement is kind of the front line of new defense in the war on \nterrorism as well as the work they do with traditional law enforcement.\n  It defies common sense that trained policemen cannot carry interstate \nwhen we all know criminals and terrorists do outside of the law. I want \nto make sure we give America's policemen the same protection.\n  I yield to Senator Leahy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senator Campbell and I have worked on this \nfor some time. I serve in the Judiciary Committee where it passed \nnearly unanimously. Having served in law enforcement, I know what it is \nlike.\n\n[[Page S1972]]\n\n  Our bipartisan amendment will establish national standards for law \nenforcement officers to carry concealed firearms so that they may \nrespond immediately to crimes across State and other jurisdictional \nlines, as well as protect themselves and their families from vindictive \ncriminals.\n  I look forward to the Senate approving our bipartisan amendment today \nto make our communities safer and to better protect law enforcement \nofficers and their families.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today as a \ncosponsor of the amendment offered by Senators Campbell and Leahy, the \nLaw Enforcement Safety Act. This legislation will take sensible steps \nto improve public safety by allowing trained active and retired law \nenforcement officers to carry their service weapons across State lines \nwithout needless bureaucratic hurdles.\n  In my State of Washington, all law enforcement officers are permitted \nto carry concealed weapons, and many jurisdictions require officers to \ndo so. In addition, all retired officers can obtain concealed weapons \npermits, and my State grants reciprocal privileges to any law \nenforcement officer visiting the State. This allows officers to \ncontinue to play a role in maintaining public safety wherever they may \nbe. I believe that the successful example set by officers in my State \nshows that this legislation warrants the support of this body. I \nbelieve that this is solid policy and that extending a similar policy \nacross the country will have beneficial public safety effects.\n  I fully support aspects of this bill that are stronger than the \ncurrent policy in my State: Requiring retired officers to maintain \ntheir firearms skills, and preserving local laws barring firearms in \nspecific locations, like churches and schools.\n  Police officers are entrusted by the public with an important \nresponsibility. Since the events of September 11, we have placed new \nburdens of our Federal, local, and State officers. We have often done \nso without providing them the resources they need to do the job. This \namendment is a step to correcting that oversight by allowing the people \nwho are the most well-trained in how and when to use firearms to avoid \noutdated restrictions on carrying and traveling with firearms.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and to provide \nadditional support to our law enforcement officers across the country. \nI look forward to working with the amendments sponsors to ensure its \nadoption.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as we all know, law enforcement officers \nare never ``off duty.'' They are dedicated public servants who are \nsworn to protect public safety at any time and place that the peace is \nthreatened. They need all the help that they can get.\n  That is why I am so proud to cosponsor this bipartisan amendment to \nallow off-duty and retired law enforcement officers to carry a firearm \nif they meet the same state firearms training and qualifications as an \nactive officer.\n  Today, there is a complex patchwork of Federal, State, and local laws \nthat govern whether current and retired law enforcement officers can \ncarry concealed firearms. This patchwork approach is confusing and \nineffective. This amendment will establish a measure of uniformity and \nconsistency across the country.\n  Over 740,000 sworn law enforcement officers serve in this country. In \nthe last decade alone, more than 1,700 law enforcement officers have \nbeen killed in the line of duty. That's an average of 170 deaths per \nyear. And, roughly 5 percent of these were killed while taking law \nenforcement action in an off-duty capacity.\n  Even the death of one police officer is unacceptable. We can and must \ndo more to protect them, and that is why I support this amendment. It \nwill increase the ability of law enforcement officers to protect \nthemselves, their families, and our communities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am under no illusion what the outcome \nof this vote is going to be. But this is gun legislation run amok. This \nis demonstrating that the Senate is more interested in the profits of \nthe gun industry than protecting the citizens.\n  This legislation will override every mayor's decision that has ruled \nthat they do not want concealable weapons in the bars and the churches \nor on the playgrounds of the schools of their district. This \nlegislation will override every Governor's decision to protect local \ncitizens by prohibiting concealable weapons in bars and churches and \nschoolyards across the country.\n  The mayors have made the decision. The States have made the decision. \nNow in the Senate of the United States we say it does not make any \ndifference if the local community is making a judgment to protect their \nlocal citizens; we know better in the Senate.\n  I don't want to hear from the other side anymore about one size fits \nall. This is it. Override the States, override the local communities, \nthat is what this does with concealable weapons which are deadly to the \nchildren and the people of this Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2623.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed \nwith 2 minutes of debate prior to the vote. The Frist-Craig amendment \nis the pending amendment. I would like to close. I ask the Senator to \nproceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am glad if Senator Craig wishes to \nclose on this amendment. I would like to close on the next amendment, \nif that is agreeable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have seen a lot of phony amendments \naround here in the 42 years I have been here, and this is about as \nphony an amendment as one could possibly imagine.\n  We have to ask ourselves, What is the problem? The problem has been \n17 law enforcement officers have been killed, according to the FBI, \nfrom armor-piercing bullets. Deer and ducks do not wear armor vests. \nPolice officers wear armor vests. What do police officers do? They try \nand protect the public interest.\n  What is out there now on the Internet? I have four different charts \nthat show what is out on the Internet selling this armor-piercing \nammunition. Let's just take a look at what the armor-piercing \nammunition does.\n  Armor-piercing projectiles contain a core of hardened steel or \ntungsten carbide which allows it to penetrate metal objects. That is \nwhat our police officers are up against.\n  The Craig amendment does what? It asks whether we ought to have a \nstudy of this kind of problem. In the meantime, if we accept that and \noppose my amendment, we know there will be law enforcement officials \nwho will be killed, shot, with these armor-piercing bullets.\n  What in the world justification is there for hunters to use armor-\npiercing bullets? Perhaps that can be answered. I have not heard it, \nbut the Senator wants to have a study.\n  What else will they do? They will increase the penalties. That will \nbe fine. Tell that to the families after these police officers have \nbeen killed. What is going to happen after that? They will even provide \nthe death penalty in some instances. This does not protect law \nenforcement officials, and I hope the Senate will support my amendment \nlater.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes has expired.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Fraternal Order of Police, 311,000 \npolice, oppose what the Senator from Massachusetts has just said. Their \nofficial organization says this is nothing more than a smokescreen to \nban about 30 percent of ammunition that is currently in the market for \nthe purpose of hunting, for the purpose of using in it a law-abiding \nway by sportsmen.\n  Can a piece of ammunition, shot in a 30.06, that will kill a deer or \nan elk pierce certain types of armor? The answer is, yes, it can. The \nSenator from Massachusetts is truthful in that. But do we want to now \nsummarily erase all of that from the market or do we want to do an \nofficial bona fide ballistic study, directed by the Department of \nJustice, to have a clear and clean understanding of what is, in fact, \narmor piercing and what is, in fact, a legitimate piece of ammunition \nthat is used by marksmen, that is used by sportsmen, that is used in \nthe legitimate business of hunting that we have longtime said is a \ngreat tradition in this country?\n  Anti-gunners have always said, if you can't get the gun, go after the \nammo--if you can't get the gun, go after the ammo. Clearly, the \nunderlying amendment that we will debate next goes after the ammo. The \nFrist-Craig amendment says, whoa, wait a minute, let's make darn sure \nwhat we are doing is the right thing before we go there.\n  No one is in favor of a cop-killer bullet. Shame on anybody who would \naccuse any Senator on this floor for being in favor of a cop-killer \nbullet. What we are in favor of is legitimate ammunition and its use, \nnot its misuse, and not the ability to say, well, that is a good bullet \nbut it was used badly; therefore, it ought to be eliminated.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of \nthe Frist-Craig amendment relating to armor piercing ammunition. The \nFrist-Craig amendment restates existing law which prohibits the \nmanufacture, import, or sale of armor piercing ammunition except for \nuse by the United States Government or for export. Additionally, the \nFrist-Craig amendment requires the Department of Justice to study and \nreport to Congress whether a uniform standard for the testing of \nprojectiles against body armor is feasible.\n  The Department would include in its study the standards which Senator \nKennedy seeks in his proposed amendment. Ideally, this report will \nconfirm or put to rest the issue of whether the amendment proposed by \nSenator Kennedy would have the effect of banning standard hunting \ninformation. This is a sensible approach to an issue which has so many \nlegitimate hunters and other gun owners concerned. Finally, and \nimportantly, the Frist-Craig amendment does something about Senator \nKennedy's concerns in a way that his amendment does not. Specifically, \nthe Frist-Craig amendment imposes serious penalties on those who use \nand carry armor piercing ammunition during and in relation to crimes of \nviolence and drug trafficking crimes.\n  The Frist-Craig amendment sends a clear message that those criminals \nwho use this type of ammunition in their crimes that they will face \nsignificant punishment. Additionally, if the criminals murder someone \nwith armor piercing ammunition in the course of a drug trafficking \ncrime or crime of violence, they will face the full range of \npunishment, including the death penalty.\n  The Frist-Craig amendment would therefore punish those who use armor \npiercing ammunition to carry out illegal activities while permitting \nthose who intend to legitimately use ammunition with common and \nconventional hunting or sporting rifles to do so.\n  It is through the Frist-Craig amendment that we would preserve what \nis the classic first deer rifle given to millions of Americans; that \nis, the 30-30 Winchester deer rifle. Finally, it is important to note \nthat the Fraternal Order of Police, representing over 311,000 police \nofficers nationwide, supports the Frist-Craig amendment.\n  A difficulty many have with Senator Kennedy's amendment is the \ndefinition of body armor, which is directed at the minimum standard for \nprotection of law enforcement officers. According to the Department of \nJustice, the minimum standard is level 1 body armor which is designed \nto resist bullets fired from various low caliber handguns, such as .22s \nor .380s. Therefore, under this amendment common handgun ammunition for \nother handguns, including .44 calibers and 9 mm, would be banned. \nAdditionally, neither level 1 nor level 2 body armor is designed to \nprevent penetration by rifles. Therefore, to ban all ammunition that \nmay penetrate level 1 body armor, or level 2 body armor for that \nmatter, would in effect ban all rifle ammunition.\n  I am troubled by this issue because I remember the draft AFT report \nissued in 1997 by ATF's career personnel that concluded that there was \nno need for new legislation. Unfortunately, those in that \nadministration's political positions whose agenda was to push gun \ncontrol legislation reversed those findings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will be 4 minutes of debate evenly \ndivided before the vote on the Kennedy amendment.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I believe the Kennedy amendment is now up. \nBoth the Senator from Massachusetts and I agree, this being his \namendment, he should be able to close the debate.\n  Let me suggest as clearly as I can to all of our colleagues, if you \njust voted yes on the immediate past amendment that passed by a very \nlarge margin, 85 to 12, then you would vote no on Kennedy. It is quite \nsimple why.\n  He sets a new ballistic standard. He does not allow the professional \nto determine what is or is not armor piercing. I don't believe a \nSenator wants to ban from the marketplace potentially 30 percent of the \nkind of ammunition that is now used in legitimate hunting.\n  That is fundamentally the issue that is at hand, to reach out into \nthe marketplace and arbitrarily draw a line when we all know that \nhunting weapons, when misdirected, have the potential of penetrating \nsoft armor and other types of armor. Are they armor piercing? No. But \nthey have the capability of phenomenal penetration. That is why they \nare hunting ammunition. That is why our sportsmen use them.\n  It is not the role of the Senate to draw that kind of line and \ndetermine what is hunting and what is not in respect to this amendment. \nI believe that is the underlying basis of the Kennedy amendment.\n  I ask that the Senate oppose it and vote no.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the current cop-killer bullets that we \nhave accepted now took 5 years to pass in the Senate. We heard the same \narguments. I was part of that whole effort. It took us 5 years to \nprovide it. We have made very marginal progress on it.\n  I raise this: Law enforcement officers killed and assaulted, on page \n17, law enforcement officers killed by firearms while wearing body \narmor. There it is, page 17: 17 law enforcement officers were killed \nwhile wearing body armor by armor-piercing bullets.\n  Don't worry about this amendment. The only people who have to worry \nabout this amendment are people who use sniper rifles and assault \nweapons and use armor-piercing bullets.\n  That is the record. The FBI has stated that. We have a chance to make \na difference. We have had a study. I can understand some people want a \nstudy. You can vote for this amendment.\n  Let me finally say this has the support of the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, International Brotherhood of Police \nOfficers, City Chiefs Association, National Organization of Black Law \nEnforcement, National Association of School Reserve Officers.\n  This applies to sniper rifles and assault weapons. Some of these \nbullets can travel as far as a mile. Some of them have incendiary tips \nwith electronic scopes. We are talking about homeland security and we \nare not even prepared to do something about armor-piercing bullets that \ncan go through police officers' vests. It is as simple as that.\n  If we care about our law enforcement officers trying to protect our \npeople, we will at least resist letting snipers have armor-piercing \nbullets.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 4 minutes equally divided on \nthe Levin amendment.\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, if I could have the attention of our \ncolleagues, this is a key amendment to the underlying S. 1805.\n  I yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I went to law school and studied the concepts \nof gross negligence and reckless conduct. There are thousands, in fact \nprobably millions, of pages of case law trying to define those legal \nterms.\n  The reality is no judge or lawyer can tell you today what they mean. \nThey say it all depends. This amendment does not clear that up. In \nfact, it only adds to the confusion, because it statutorily creates a \nstandard of care when there is no underlying cause of action, no basis \nfor liability against the defendant. There will still be lawsuits to \ndefend and lawyers to pay even if you win. I guess that may be the \nwhole point of the proponents--create a requirement for manufacturers \nto defend themselves in court even though there is no legitimate cause \nof action against them. They pay more insurance, more lawyers, so even \nif they win, they lose.\n  This bill is all about ensuring there is no cause of action against a \nmanufacturer which makes a legal, nondefective product. It makes no \nsense to say unless he is grossly negligent. He is already liable if he \nis grossly negligent. Say the gun blows up and kills somebody; that \nstandard applies already if there is a legal cause of action against\n\n[[Page S1975]]\n\nhim--in other words, a legal basis for holding him liable. It adds \nnothing but confusion when there is no underlying cause of action.\n  Here is an example: You get yourself rear-ended by the guy behind \nyou, and I am not that guy. You have no right to sue me. It doesn't \nchange anything if we say in the law ``unless Kyl is grossly \nnegligent;'' Kyl wasn't even there. All we are doing is adding \nconfusion to this by adding this gross negligence language which, \nunfortunately, will cause a lot of people to have to defend themselves \nin court, pay lawyer fees, and at the end of the day we are trying to \navoid that here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the purpose of this bill is said to be that \nyou want to make sure you do not hold people accountable for the \nactions of others. That is what we have been told the purpose of this \nbill is. That is what the stated purpose of this bill is. This \namendment says we surely should hold people accountable for their own \nactions. That is the difference. Are people going to be held \naccountable for their own reckless and grossly negligent conduct? The \nway this bill is written, the only grossly negligent conduct or \nreckless conduct somebody is held accountable for is if that conduct is \nalso illegal.\n  What if the conduct is not illegal but is grossly negligent and \nreckless and causes the death or injury of somebody else? Should that \nmanufacturer or that dealer be immunized if his own reckless or grossly \nnegligent conduct is a proximate cause of death or injury? It is a \nsimple provision. I am going to read it, if I have 20 seconds left:\n\n       None of the provisions in the act shall be construed to \n     prohibit a civil liability action from being brought or \n     continued against the person if that person's own gross \n     negligence or reckless conduct was a proximate cause of death \n     or injury.\n\n  The key word in this whole sentence is ``own.'' The key argument that \nthe opponents of the amendment make is that you only should be \nresponsible for your own actions, and I agree. The NRA has a point. You \nshould be responsible for your own actions. This amendment says if your \nactions are reckless or grossly negligent, then you are not going to be \nimmunized.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I believe the order at hand is final \npassage on S. 1805, as amended. I turn to my colleague, Senator Reed, \nfor any closing comments he would like to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, despite the passage of three very important \namendments for gun safety--one that closed the gun show loophole, \nanother that extended the assault weapons ban, and a third to require \nchild safety locks with all handguns sold in this country--the \nunderlying bill still represents a fundamental undermining of a \nprinciple of law that has lasted for centuries, and that principle is \nthat an individual is not just responsible to follow the statutes of \nthis country, that individual is responsible to act reasonably. Even \nthe most elaborate construct of statutes will never reach all the \nvariations of human behavior. That is why this fundamental principle of \nresponsible conduct must by maintained.\n  This bill turns it on its head. This bill, if enacted, will be a \nlicense to be irresponsible, and there is no more graphic example than \nBull's Eye Shooter Supply in Washington State, the source of the \nweapons for the snipers who terrorized Washington, DC. The individual \ncould not account for 238 weapons, had numerous citations by ATF, and \nwas unaware that a weapon was shoplifted and had fallen into the hands \nof assassins. That is irresponsible conduct. That conduct would be \nimmunized by this legislation.\n  I urge all my colleagues to vote no, against this legislation. We \nhave made progress on important gun safety measures, but the underlying \nlegislation would say to gun manufacturers: You can be irresponsible \nthrough your distribution network to whom you sell; to dealers, you can \nbe irresponsible to the customer to whom you sell. We don't want that. \nThe peace, security, and safety of all of us cannot tolerate that, and \nI urge defeat of this measure.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we are about to vote on S. 1805, as \namended. The House passed a clean S. 1805 with over a 2-to-1 margin. \nThe President has asked for a clean bill. But in the process of the \nlast 5 days we have added a great deal to this bill that makes it much \nless than clean.\n  We have added back the assault weapons ban. We have added trigger \nlocks. We put a new tripwire in gun shows that will allow law-abiding \ncitizens to be at risk.\n  I don't think we can go there, nor do I believe we should go there. \nI, and certainly my colleagues, have worked in good will, as have all \nwho have come to the floor to debate this issue. There has been a real \ndifference of opinion.\n  I am now told even if we passed it, it would never get to conference. \nIf you can't work the process and get to conference, how can you \ncomplete the legislative process for which the House and the Senate \nhave always historically been known? To simply have someone say no to \nallow the difference between the House and the Senate to be worked out \nis the very clear message I am hearing at this moment. That is a \nmessage that doesn't work. If that is the strategy here, that we move \nlegislation by offering amendments by working in a bipartisan fashion \nonly to say no at the end, how can we accept the process and simply \nsay, well, let us vote it out, anyway?\n\n  This is a very important bill. There is no question about that. It \nwas a substantial move in tort reform. It enshrined once again the \nhistoric tort belief that you as an individual are responsible for your \nown actions. If\n\n[[Page S1976]]\n\nsomebody acts criminally down the line and you have been law abiding \nand you are at risk, that is what the bill said. It wasn't convoluted. \nIt was clear and it was clean. I worked on it a long while, as have \nmany others.\n  I am proud of our work product, and I would love to see this bill \npass. But I now believe it is so dramatically wounded that it should \nnot pass. I urge my colleagues to vote against it.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, and was \nread the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass? The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, we have just had 5 days of very important \ndebate. I think all who entered the debate entered it with good will in \nmind. There have been different points of view, very strongly held \ndifferent points of view. As a result of that, the final passage of S. \n1805 was not possible, and the Senate defeated it. That is all I will \nsay about that process.\n  I wish to thank so many people who have been tremendously helpful on \nmy staff: Brooke Roberts, Lisa McGrath, and Doug Lucke, who worked \nextremely hard with me to perfect S. 1805 and bring it to the floor; \nChairman Hatch and his staff of the Judiciary Committee: Ted Lehman, \nBrett Tolman, and Reed O'Connor; the leadership staff in the cloakroom; \nand the 55 cosponsors of S. 1805.\n  Certainly, there was a strong effort on the part of all to get this \nlegislation to the floor, to get clean votes on it. We even, of course, \nhad the effort of the House, with a better than two-to-one majority in \nthe House, on a clean bill. The President asked that a clean bill be \nreceived at the White House.\n  None of that, in the final hours, appeared to be possible. Clearly, \nwe were not going to be allowed to go to conference. The minority saw \nno advantage in allowing the process that is historical and responsible \nin the Senate to move forward because that, of course, takes unanimous \nconsent or prolonged effort and votes to get there.\n  It is a very short timeline for this year, and we clearly need to \nmove the process forward. We will look now to bring the House bill \nforward in a clean way. Ultimately, we hope we might get a cloture \nvote. This issue will not go away. It deserves to be voted on, up or \ndown, by the Senate. Clearly, it is the will of the American people \nand, ultimately, we will have that day and that opportunity. That day \nwas not today, as much as I wished it could be.\n  At the same time, when you have a bad bill that is created by the \namendment process, it sometimes is difficult, if not impossible, to \nmake it better or to make it acceptable. I would not send to this \nPresident or any President a bad bill of the kind that was crafted in \nthe Senate through the amendment process over the last several days.\n  But, again, I thank so many who were involved in this effort. It is \ngreatly appreciated.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/02/senate-section/article/S1976-4", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1976]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to address, if I may, the subject \nmatter of Haiti and the events that have occurred there over the last \nseveral days, now going back a week or more, in that country, that \nbeleaguered nation only a few hundred miles off the southern coast of \nFlorida.\n  On Sunday morning, as we now all know, the democratically elected \ngovernment, the President of Haiti, was forced out of office. The armed \ninsurrection, led by former members of the disbanded Haitian Army, and \nits paramilitary wing called FRAPH, made it impossible for the Aristide \ngovernment to maintain public order, without assistance from the \ninternational community--international assistance that was consciously \nwithheld, in my view.\n  President Aristide left Haiti on Sunday morning aboard an American \naircraft. President Aristide reportedly has\n\n[[Page S1977]]\n\ngone into exile in the Central African Republic, where I am now being \ntold he is not allowed to communicate with others outside of that \ncountry.\n  Members of the Black Caucus of the other body, and others who had an \nopportunity to speak with President Aristide yesterday, have publicly \nrestated his claim that he was forcibly removed from Haiti by U.S. \nofficials.\n  I quickly point out that Secretary of State Colin Powell and others \nhave emphatically denied that charge. Such an allegation, if true, is \nextremely troubling and would be a gross violation of the laws of the \nU.S. and international law. Only time will tell. I presume there will \nbe a thorough investigation to determine exactly what occurred from \nlate Saturday night and early Sunday morning, regarding the departure \nand ouster of the President of Haiti, President Aristide.\n  Over the coming days, I believe an effort should be made to \nreconstruct what happened in the final 24 or 48 hours leading up to \nPresident Aristide's departure so we can resolve questions of the U.S. \nparticipation in the ouster of a democratically elected leader in this \nhemisphere.\n  Let's be clear that whether U.S. officials forcibly removed Aristide \nfrom Haiti, as he has charged, or he left voluntarily, as Secretary of \nPowell and others have stated, it is indisputable, based on everything \nwe know, that the U.S. played a very direct and public role in \npressuring him to leave office by making it clear that the United \nStates would do nothing to protect him from the armed thugs who are \nthreatening to kill him. His choice was simple: Stay in Haiti with no \nprotection from the international community, including the U.S., and be \nkilled or you can leave the country. That is hardly what I would call a \nvoluntary decision to leave.\n  I will point out as well, if I can--and I know that international \nagreements are not always thought of as being terribly important in \nsome people's minds. But in 1991, President Bush, the 41st President, \nalong with other nations in this hemisphere, had signed the Santiago \nDeclaration of 1991. That declaration, authored by the Organization of \nAmerican States, said that any nation, democratically elected in this \nhemisphere, that seeks the help of others when they are threatened with \nan overthrow should be able to get that support.\n  Ten years later, the Inter-American Charter on Democracy was signed \ninto law, a far more comprehensive proposal, again authored by the \nOrganization of American States, the U.S. supporting. The present \nPresident Bush and our administration supported that. That charter on \ndemocracy stated that when asked for help by a democratically elected \ngovernment being threatened with overthrow, we should respond.\n  President Aristide, a democratically elected President made that \nrequest and, of course, not only did we not provide assistance, in fact \nwe sat back and watched as he left the country, offering assistance for \nhim to depart.\n  I cite those international agreements because we think of our Nation \nas being a nation of laws, not of men. These agreements either meant \nsomething or they didn't. The Santiago Declaration and the Inter-\nAmerican Charter on Democracy, apparently both documents mean little or \nnothing when it comes to supporting democratically elected governments \nin this hemisphere--not ones that you necessarily like or agree with or \nfind everything they do is in your interest, but we do adhere to the \nnotion that democratically elected governments are what we support in \nthis hemisphere.\n  When they are challenged by violent thugs, people with records of \nviolent human rights violations, engaged in death squad activity, in \nthe very country they are now moving back into and threatened, of \ncourse, successfully the elected government of President Aristide, then \nI think it is worthy of note that we have walked away from these \ninternational documents signed only 3 years ago and 10 years ago.\n\n  There is no doubt, I add, that President Aristide has made \nsignificant mistakes during his 3 years in office--these last 3 years. \nHe allowed his supporters to use violence as a means of controlling a \ngrowing opposition movement against his government. The Haitian police \nwere ill trained and ill equipped to maintain public order in the face \nof violent demonstrations by progovernment and antigovernment \nactivists. Poverty, desperation, and opportunism led to wide government \ncorruption.\n  President Aristide, in my view, must assume responsibility for these \nthings. But did the cumulative effect of these failures amount to a \ndecision that we thought we could no longer support this democratically \nelected government? If that becomes the standard in this hemisphere, we \nare going to find ourselves sitting by and watching one democratically \nelected government after another fall to those that breed chaos and \nremove governments with which they don't agree. They are being told by \nthe Bush administration now that the Haitian Government was a \ngovernment of failed leadership. That is a whole new standard when it \ncomes to engaging in the kind of activity we have seen over the last \nseveral days.\n  Having been critical of President Aristide, I point out that he was \nelected twice overwhelmingly in his country. He was thrown out of \noffice in a coup in the early 1990s. Through the efforts of the U.S. \nGovernment and others, he was brought back to power in Haiti. Then he \ngave up power when the government of President Preval was elected. \nDuring those 4 years, President Aristide supported that transitional \ngovernment. He ran again himself, as the Haitian Constitution allowed, \nand was elected overwhelmingly again, despite the fact the opposition \nposed little or no efforts to stand against him.\n  There was a very bad election that occurred in the spring of 2000, in \nwhich eight members of the Haitian Senate were elected by fraud. Those \nSenators were removed from office. Six months later, President Aristide \nwas elected overwhelmingly again. It is the first time I know of in the \n200-year history of Haiti as an independent nation where a President \nturned over power transitionally peacefully to another democratically \nelected government. Whatever other complaints there are--and they are \nnot illegitimate about the Aristide government--there was a peaceful \ntransition of democratically elected governments in Haiti. That never, \never happened before. What has happened there repeatedly is one coup \nafter another--33 over the 200-year history of that nation.\n  Whatever shortcomings they may have had, President Aristide provided \nfor the first time in Haiti's history a democratically elected \ngovernment transitioning power to other people peacefully. I will also \npoint out that he abolished the military and the army, an institution \nthat did nothing but drain the feeble economy of Haiti of necessary \nresources.\n  Haiti did not have a need for an army. There were no threats to \nHaiti. In retrospect, he may regret that. But the army, in my view, was \na waste of money in Haiti, served no legitimate purpose, and President \nAristide should be commended for abolishing an institution that had \nbeen the source of constant corruption and difficulty on that nation.\n\n  Blame for the chaos does not rest solely on the shoulders of \nPresident Aristide. The so-called democratic opposition bears a share \nof the responsibility for the death and destruction that has wreaked \nhavoc throughout Haiti over the past several weeks.\n  The members of CARICOM, with U.S. backing, put on the table a plan \ncalling for the establishment of a unity government to defuse the \npolitical crisis. The opposition rejected this proposal on three \ndifferent occasions, despite the fact that President Aristide said he \nwas willing to have a government of unity, to give up power, to share \ngovernmental functions with the opposition. The opposition said no on \nthree different occasions, despite the fact that the nations of the \nCaribbean region urged the opposition to avoid the kind of transition \nthat we have seen over the last several days.\n  A hundred or more Haitians already have lost their lives. Property \ndamage may be in the millions. Given the direct role the U.S. played in \nthe removal of the Aristide government, it is now President Bush's \nresponsibility, in my view, and moral obligation to take charge of this \nsituation. That means more than sending a couple hundred marines for 90 \ndays or so into Haiti. Rather, it means a sustained commitment of \npersonnel and resources for the\n\n[[Page S1978]]\n\nforeseeable future by the U.S. and other members of the international \ncommunity that called for the removal of the elected government.\n  If the Bush administration and others inside and outside of Haiti had \nbeen at all concerned over the last 3 weeks about the fate of the \nHaitian people, perhaps the situation would not have deteriorated into \nnear anarchy, nor would the obligation of the U.S. to clean up this \nmess now loom so large.\n  We are now reaping what we have sown. Three years of a hands-off \npolicy left Haiti unstable, with a power vacuum that will be filled in \none way or another. Will that vacuum be filled by individuals such as \nGuy Philippe, a former member of the disbanded Haitian Army, a \nnotorious human rights abuser and drug trafficker, or is the \nadministration prepared to take action against him and his followers, \nbased upon a long record of criminal behavior?\n  It is rather amazing to this Senator that the administration has said \nlittle or nothing about its plans for cracking down on the armed thugs \nwho have terrorized Haiti since February 5.\n  Only with careful attention by the United States and the \ninternational community does Haiti have a fighting chance to break from \nits tragic history. In the best of circumstances, it is never easy to \nbuild and nurture democratic institutions where they are weak and \nnonexistent. When ignorance, intolerance, and poverty are part of the \nvery fabric of a nation, as is the case in Haiti, it is Herculean.\n  Given the mentality of the political elites in Haiti--one of winner \ntake all--I, frankly, believe it is going to be extremely difficult to \nform a unity government that has any likelihood of being able to govern \nfor any period of time without resorting to repressive measures against \nthose who have been excluded from the process.\n  It brings me no pleasure to say at this juncture that Haiti is \nfailing, if not a failed state. The United Nations Security Council has \nauthorized the deployment of peacekeepers to Haiti to stabilize the \nsituation. I would go a step further and urge the Haitian authorities \nto consider sharing authority with an international administration \nauthorized by the United Nations in order to create the conditions \nnecessary to give any future Government of Haiti a fighting chance at \nsucceeding. The United States must lead in this multinational \ninitiative, as Australia did, I might point out, in the case of East \nTimor; not as Secretary Defense Rumsfeld suggested yesterday: Wait for \nsomeone else to step up to the plate to take the lead. It will require \nsubstantial, sustained commitment of resources by the United States and \nthe international community if we are to be successful.\n  The jury is out as to whether the Bush administration is prepared to \nremain engaged in Haiti. Only in the eleventh hour did Secretary of \nState Colin Powell focus his attention on Haiti as he personally \norganized the pressure which led to President Aristide's resignation on \nSunday. Unless Secretary Powell is equally committed to remaining \nengaged in the rebuilding of that country, then I see little likelihood \nthat anything is going to change for the Haitian people. The coming \ndays and weeks will tell whether the Bush administration is as \nconcerned about strengthening and supporting democracy in our own \nhemisphere as it claims to be in other more distant places around the \nglobe. The people of this hemisphere are watching and waiting.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/02/senate-section/article/S1978-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the subject of the \nremoval of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq and to address some of the \nrecent criticism regarding whether, given that large stockpiles of \nweapons of mass destruction have not been found, action by the United \nStates was justified. When I have concluded, I know there are some \ncolleagues who will want to address this same question from slightly \ndifferent perspectives.\n  The tragic events of September 11, 2001, demonstrated with great \nclarity that we can no longer afford to wait for threats to fully \nemerge before we deal with them. We paid a heavy price that day for our \nprevious half-measures against those who hate us and want to destroy \nus.\n  By definition, intelligence is imprecise, and no matter what reforms \nwe implement in our intelligence community, the fact is, at least to \nsome degree, it will always be uncertain. This is precisely why \nintelligence information is just part of a larger puzzle, as it was in \nthe case of Iraq, that we used to determine the direction of U.S. \npolicy.\n  So given the uncertainty about weapons of mass destruction \nstockpiles, were our actions in Iraq justified? The answer to that \nquestion is most certainly yes. There is no doubt that the United \nStates, the Iraqi people, and the international community are far \nbetter off today without Saddam Hussein in power.\n  The inability to find weapons of mass destruction stockpiles now does \nnot mean that Iraq did not have access to such weapons, and that under \nSaddam Hussein Iraq was not a grave and gathering danger. In fact, the \noverwhelming body of evidence, including most recently that from the \nIraq Survey Group, indicates that his regime did, indeed, pose a \nthreat, and that its removal will aid in our overall aid against \nterror.\n\n  Some of our colleagues have charged that the President led the \nAmerican people to war under false pretenses; that the case for \nremoving Saddam Hussein's regime was supposedly based on an imminent \nthreat posed by that regime because of its arsenals of weapons of mass \ndestruction which now cannot be found. This assertion is categorically \nfalse, and today I intend to explain why.\n  Let's briefly review how we arrived at the decision to authorize \nforce against Iraq in October of 2002.\n  Contrary to what some would have us believe, the Bush administration \ndid not fundamentally change U.S. policy with Iraq from that of the \nClinton administration. Upon entering office in January 2001, President \nBush inherited from the Clinton administration a policy of regime \nchange. I repeat, the Bush administration pursued the same Iraqi policy \nas the Clinton administration. That policy was based on the 1998 Iraq \nLiberation Act which stated:\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States to support \n     efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from \n     power and to promote the emergence of a democratic government \n     to replace that regime.\n\n  This policy was unanimously approved by this Senate. This legislation \nand, thus, the shift in U.S. policy from containment to regime change \nreflected an acknowledgment that diplomatic solutions for dealing with \nSaddam's intransigence were being exhausted.\n  Even before that shift, however, the Clinton administration was clear \nabout the nature and capabilities of Saddam\n\n[[Page S1979]]\n\nHussein's regime and, moreover, believed that if left unchecked, the \nregime would pose a serious threat in the future.\n  On February 17, 1998, as he prepared for war against Iraq, President \nClinton stated the following:\n\n       Now let's imagine the future. What if [Saddam Hussein] \n     fails to comply and we fail to act or we take some ambiguous \n     third route, which gives him yet more opportunities to \n     develop this program of weapons of mass destruction and \n     continue to press for the release of the sanctions and \n     continue to ignore the solemn commitments that he made? Well, \n     he will conclude that the international community has lost \n     its will. He will then conclude that he can go right on and \n     do more to rebuild an arsenal of devastating destruction. And \n     some day, some way, I guarantee you he will use that arsenal. \n     . . . In the next century, the community of nations may see \n     more and more of the very kind of threat Iraq poses now--a \n     rogue state with weapons of mass destruction, ready to use \n     them or provide them to terrorists, drug traffickers, or \n     organized criminals who travel the world among us unnoticed.\n\n  That quote was from President Clinton's remarks in 1998 as he \nprepared for war against Iraq. He pointed out that the arsenal which \nIraq possessed--``a rogue state with weapons of mass destruction'' were \nhis exact words--will pose a threat because he can provide them to \nterrorists, drug traffickers, or organized criminals who travel the \nworld among us unnoticed.\n  Note that he talked about weapons of mass destruction which Saddam \nHussein possessed.\n  I have noted no objections or caveats on these warnings by Democratic \nMembers of the Senate.\n  Later that year, not 2 months after President Clinton signed the \nIraqi Liberation Act into law, he delivered an address to the Nation \nexplaining his decision to order air strikes against Iraqi military \ntargets. He discussed the potential long-term threat posed by Saddam \nHussein. Again, I quote President Clinton:\n\n       The hard fact is that so long as Saddam Hussein remains in \n     power he threatens the well-being of his people, the peace of \n     his region, the security of the world. The best way to end \n     that threat once and for all is with a new Iraqi government, \n     a government ready to live in peace with its neighbors, a \n     government that respects the right of its people.\n       . . . Heavy as they are, the costs of inaction must be \n     weighed against the price of inaction. If Saddam defies the \n     world and we fail to respond, we will face a far greater \n     threat in the future. Saddam will strike again at his \n     neighbors; he will make war on his own people. Mark my words, \n     he will develop weapons of mass destruction. He will deploy \n     them, and he will use them.\n\n  Again, I note no dissent from Democratic Senators to these comments \nof President Clinton.\n  Consider the striking similarity between these statements by \nPresident Clinton and the statements Bush administration officials made \nabout Iraq during the leadup to Operation Iraqi Freedom. In the first \nstatement I cited from February of 1998, President Clinton discussed \nthe consequences of inaction in the face of continued noncompliance by \nSaddam Hussein, noting that inaction would lead the dictator to \nconclude the international community had lost its will.\n  Consider the statements of President George W. Bush to the United \nNations General Assembly in September 2002:\n\n       The conduct of the Iraqi regime is a threat to the \n     authority of the United Nations. Iraq has answered a decade \n     of U.N. demands with a decade of defiance. . . . The United \n     Nations [faces] a difficult and defining moment. Are Security \n     Council resolutions to be honored and enforced, or cast aside \n     without consequence? Will the United Nations serve the \n     purpose of its founding, or will it be irrelevant?\n\n  I point out the focus of President Clinton's statements was on the \ntotality of our knowledge about Saddam Hussein's history, his defiance \nof the United Nations, use of chemical weapons, aggression against his \nneighbors, savage treatment of his own people.\n  This is what we had to gauge his intentions by. This broad focus on \nSaddam's past actions and known capabilities, not any particular piece \nof intelligence, was also what prompted many Members of this body to \nauthorize force against Iraq in October 2002. Consider some of the \nstatements made in 2002 by my colleagues. First I quote Senator \nDaschle, majority and minority leader:\n\n       Iraq's actions pose a serious and continued threat to \n     international peace and security. It is a threat we must \n     address. Saddam is a proven aggressor who has time and again \n     turned his wrath on his neighbors and on his own people. Iraq \n     is not the only nation in the world to possess weapons of \n     mass destruction, but it is the only nation with a leader who \n     has used them against his own people . . .\n\n  Note: 2002, Saddam Hussein possesses weapons of mass destruction, no \nqualifications except he is not the only country to do so. No \nexpression of doubts or caveats. As minority leader or majority leader, \nSenator Daschle has access to all of the intelligence that is available \nto anybody in this body.\n\n  Now I quote Senator Biden, whose comments I quote not just because he \nis one of the more thoughtful Members of this body and ranking member \nof the Foreign Relations Committee, but also because they happen to be \nvery close to the views I expressed on this issue. I quote Senator \nBiden in his colorful way of putting it:\n\n       There is a guy named Saddam Hussein who, in the early 1990s \n     broke international law, invaded another country, violating \n     every rule of international law. The world, under the \n     leadership of a President named Bush, united and expelled him \n     from that country. Upon expulsion, he said a condition for \n     your being able to remain in power, Saddam Hussein, is you \n     sue for peace and you agree to the following terms of \n     surrender . . . If the world decides it must use force for \n     his failure to abide by the terms of surrender, then it is \n     not preempting, it is enforcing. It is enforcing, it is \n     finishing a war he reignited, because the only reason the war \n     stopped is he sued for peace.\n\n  That is exactly true. That is precisely what happened.\n  Now let me quote another leader in the Senate, Senator Kerry, who \nsaid this:\n\n       It would be naive, to the point of grave danger, not to \n     believe that, left to his own devices, Saddam Hussein will \n     provoke, misjudge, or stumble into a future, more dangerous \n     confrontation with the civilized world. . . .\n\n  So this was the backdrop against which we all had voted to authorize \nthe President to act and upon which he acted. I should not say we all \nvoted to authorize the President because there were a few who did not, \nbut the vast majority of the House of Representatives and the Senate \nvoted to authorize the President to take appropriate action.\n  Some now are voicing second thoughts. Since our successful removal of \nSaddam Hussein from power, it emerges that some of the intelligence \nregarding the regime's weapons of mass destruction capabilities may \nhave been wrong, because most notably large stockpiles of chemical and \nbiological weapons have yet to be found.\n  I feel compelled to point out three obvious facts: One, an \nintelligence failure is not synonomous with a misuse of intelligence. \nTwo, this intelligence issue does not fundamentally change the case \nagainst Saddam Hussein. Three, since Iraq itself had provided \ndocumentation to the United Nations on its production of chemical and \nbiological agents, the question is not whether but what happened to the \nstockpiles.\n  Let's take the first, the misuse of intelligence. The fact remains \nthe Bush administration relied largely on the same intelligence \ninformation used by the Clinton administration during the late 1990s, \nthe same information that was available to Senators and about which \nthey spoke on this floor, some of which I have quoted.\n  President Clinton's CIA Director was retained by President Bush. By \nand large, the intelligence information was also the same as that of \nthe other allied intelligence services, with a primary source being the \ntwo U.N. inspection bodies UNSCOM and UNMOVIC, the initials of which \nare U-N-S-C-O-M and U-N-M-O-V-I-C, which were led by non-Americans, \nsuch as Rolf Ekeus and Richard Butler. That Saddam had weapons of \nmass destruction capabilities was widely accepted, even by those who \nvehemently opposed the war. As French President Jacques Chirac \ncommented during an interview with ``Time'' Magazine in February of \n2004:\n\n       There is a problem--The probable possession of weapons of \n     mass destruction by an uncontrollable country, Iraq. The \n     international community is right to be disturbed by this \n     situation, and it's right in having decided Iraq should be \n     disarmed.\n\n  I would note, if he does not have any weapons of mass destruction, \nthere is no point in talking about disarming him. The entire world \ncommunity believed he possessed these weapons, among other things \nbecause he himself had said he did.\n\n[[Page S1980]]\n\n  So given the information the international community had at the time, \nthe conclusions about Iraq's capabilities seemed clear. As former head \nof the Iraqi Survey Group David Kay recently stated in his testimony to \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee:\n\n       . . . All I can say is if you read the total body of \n     intelligence in the last 12 to 15 years that flowed on Iraq, \n     I quite frankly think it would be hard to come to a \n     conclusion other than Iraq was a gathering, serious threat to \n     the world with regard to WMD.\n\n  I might add, that is exactly what President Bush said. That is \nobviously a big-picture view.\n  It seems opponents of the President, in charging the administration \nmisled the American people, preferred to point to specific \nintelligence. So let's take a closer look at a couple of those \nexamples. First, that the President's reference in his State of the \nUnion Address regarding Iraq's attempts to purchase uranium and, \nsecond, that the administration presented intelligence community \ninformation on Iraq's WMD capabilities as though it were an undeniable \nfact rather than qualifying it properly with caveats.\n  First, there were the following 16 words in the President's State of \nthe Union Address:\n\n       The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein \n     recently sought significant quantities of uranium from \n     Africa.\n\n  Major newspapers, the Democratic National Committee, and some \npolicymakers claim this is one of the top examples of the Bush \nadministration knowingly misleading the American people and presenting \nfalse intelligence information. As the DNC chairman Terry McAuliffe \nstated:\n\n       This may be the first time in recent history that a \n     President knowingly misled the American people during a State \n     of the Union Address. . . . this was not a mistake. It was no \n     oversight and it was no error.\n\n  That is a grave charge. Charges that the administration purposely \nincluded false information in the President's speech I deem despicable, \nan attempt to create a scandal where one does not exist. The President \nhad every reason to believe the information in his speech was true. It \nhad been vetted by the CIA Director and it was consistent with the \njudgment of the intelligence community in October 2002. The National \nIntelligence Estimate at that time said Iraq was ``vigorously trying to \nprocure uranium ore'' from several African countries.\n  The British government, which the President cited, included a \njudgment in its dossier similar to that of the intelligence community's \nmajority judgment on this point.\n  In retrospect, Director Tenet stated this phrase, though factually \ncorrect and approved in the interagency process, should not have been \nincluded in the President's speech because it was not central to the \nintelligence community's judgment that Iraq was reconstituting its \nnuclear weapons program. In other words, it was just a piece of \nevidence, not important enough to include in a speech like the State of \nthe Union speech, and certainly not what we relied upon for our \nconclusion Iraq was trying to reconstitute its nuclear weapons program. \nIn any event, it does not suggest in any way that the President was at \nfault for including the information, or that he had any intention of \nmisleading the American people. The President believed the text was \nsound. It was not in error. If there was an error, it was simply \nincluding a piece of information which really wasn't central to making \nthe case, but not misleading the American people.\n  Second, the President's critics argue he failed to mention caveats in \nthe intelligence community's assessment of Iraqi capability. This \ncriticism is highly misleading. According to the 2002 National \nIntelligence Estimate, and I have an unclassified copy of it here, the \nintelligence community had ``high confidence'' in the following \nstatements:\n\n       Iraq is continuing, and in some areas expanding, its \n     chemical, biological, nuclear, and missile programs contrary \n     to U.N. Resolutions.\n       Iraq possesses proscribed chemical and biological weapons \n     and missiles.\n       Iraq could make a nuclear weapon in months to a year once \n     it acquires sufficient weapons-grade material.\n\n  So the National Intelligence Estimate, prepared by the entire \nintelligence community, led by the CIA Director George Tenet, had high \nconfidence, among other things, in the fact that Iraq possessed \nproscribed biological and chemical weapons and missiles. After the fact \nwe found some of the missiles. We found the programs to make chemical \nand biological weapons. But we don't find the big stockpile of those \nweapons. It turns out the intelligence community's high confidence in \nthis statement was either misplaced or we simply haven't found the \nmaterial yet, or it went somewhere else. We don't know the answers to \nthose questions.\n  As to this, the only dissent came from the State Department. But even \nin its alternate view it said Saddam continues to want nuclear weapons \nand available evidence suggests Baghdad is pursuing a limited effort to \nmaintain and acquire nuclear weapons capabilities.\n  Moreover, it appears the State Department did not have significant \nobjections to the key judgments related to chemical, biological, and \nmissile programs.\n  So it is clear, it is fair to say, we had a general opinion of \nSaddam's capabilities, that that is what the President addressed.\n  I want to also make it clear the President and the administration \nnever claimed Iraq posed an imminent threat, as some have said. To the \ncontrary, administration officials said the United States and the \ninternational community needed to act before it became imminent. \nIndeed, President Bush challenged those who wanted to wait until the \nthreat was imminent in his 2003 State of the Union Address, saying the \nfollowing:\n\n       Some have said that we must not act until the threat is \n     imminent. Since when have terrorists and tyrants announced \n     their intentions, politely putting us on notice before they \n     strike? If this threat is permitted to fully and suddenly \n     emerge, all actions, all words, and all recriminations would \n     come too late. Trusting in the sanity and restraint of Saddam \n     Hussein is not a strategy, and it is not an option.\n\n  So said President Bush.\n  Administration officials did use words like ``immediate'' and \n``urgent'' but more to convey the importance of dealing with the threat \nthey judged to be growing; that they did not imply or state was \nimminent, in other words, that the attack was about to occur. They did \nnot say that.\n  Indeed, that the threat was not yet imminent was well understood on \nboth sides of the aisle. As Senator Daschle, whom I quoted earlier, \nstated in explaining his support for the resolution authorizing the use \nof force against Iraq:\n\n       The threat posed by Saddam Hussein may not be imminent, but \n     it is real, it is growing, and it cannot be ignored.\n\n  I submit he was correct. One can argue, and indeed some of my \ncolleagues have argued, administration officials were at times too \ncertain in the way they said it, too certain in their statements using \nphrases like ``we know.'' But given all the information we had about \nSaddam's history of using and producing weapons of mass destruction, \nhis aggressive intentions, and the intelligence community's high \nconfidence in the key areas of assessment, it is difficult to imagine \nhow the administration could have determined Iraq was not a threat that \nneeded to be dealt with immediately.\n  So, no, there may have been mistakes in intelligence. We have yet to \nfind that out. But there was not a misleading--an attempt to mislead by \nthe administration.\n  The second point is the larger point, that whatever deficiencies \nthere may have been about the stockpiles of weapons of mass \ndestruction, it doesn't change the basic case against Saddam Hussein. \nSome of what I have quoted earlier makes that point. While it is \ntroubling our intelligence cannot tell us where these stockpiles are, \nthe larger case remains. The Bush administration, supported by a large \ncoalition, pursued a responsible policy, given all of the pieces of the \npuzzle it had. As I said, there was Saddam's previously known missile \ncapabilities and chemical and biological weapons programs; his desire \nto acquire a nuclear weapon; his continuing flagrant violation of \nnumerous Security Council resolutions; his history of aggression \nincluding, I might add, shooting at American airplanes constantly in \nthe no-fly zone while we were trying to enforce that, if you will \nrecall; and even an attempt to assassinate former President Bush. Add \nto this the regime's vast human rights\n\n[[Page S1981]]\n\nabuses which really only came to light after we were able to liberate \nIraq.\n\n  In other words, absent any statement or specific piece of \nintelligence, the case against Saddam Hussein was already made by \nSaddam Hussein himself and this was before, as I said, we found the \nmass graves of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis.\n  Our colleague Senator Kerry summed it up well at the time. He said \nthis:\n\n       I believe the record of Saddam Hussein's ruthless, reckless \n     breach of international values and standards of behavior is \n     cause enough for the world community to hold him accountable \n     by the use of force, if necessary.\n\n  I want to quote that again:\n\n       I believe the record of Saddam Hussein's ruthless, reckless \n     breach of international values and standards of behavior is \n     cause enough for the world community to hold him accountable \n     by use of force, if necessary.\n\n  There is no suggestion here we had to find weapons of mass \ndestruction, or even necessarily that we had to believe those weapons \nexisted at the time, even though, as I said, we all did, based upon the \nintelligence at the time, but that this gross violation of human rights \nwas, in and of itself, a sufficient casus belli.\n  Given the same causes and information, what then accounts for the \ndifferences between the actions of the Bush and Clinton \nadministrations? Very simply, the Bush administration made a decision \nthat, post 9/11, it was too dangerous to allow American security to \nrest in the hands of an international organization that, after 12 \nyears, had failed to enforce its own resolutions demanding Iraqi \ncompliance with the 1991 Gulf war cease-fire. It was too dangerous to \nallow a regime to stay in place which had demonstrated a clear intent \nto develop weapons of mass destruction, had ongoing ties to terrorist \norganizations, and whose leader made it abundantly and routinely clear \nthe United States was his enemy.\n  We needed to begin the process of changing the facts on ground in the \nMiddle East.\n  In fact, it was, in part, the very uncertainty that made dealing with \nSaddam Hussein an urgent matter.\n  As Senator Kerry explained before his vote in favor of the \nauthorization to use force:\n\n       In the wake of September 11, who among us can say, with any \n     certainty, to anybody, that those weapons might not be used \n     against our troops or against allies in the region? Who can \n     say that this master of miscalculation will not develop a \n     weapon of mass destruction even greater--a nuclear weapon--\n     then reinvade Kuwait, push the Kurds out, attack Israel, any \n     number of scenarios to try to further his ambition to be the \n     pan-Arab leader or simply to confront in the region, once \n     again miscalculate the response, to believe he is stronger \n     than those weapons?\n       And while the administration has failed to provide any \n     direct link between Iraq and September 11, can we afford to \n     ignore the possibility that Saddam might accidentally, as \n     well as purposely, allow those weapons to slide off to one \n     group or other in a region where weapons are the currency of \n     trade? How do we leave that to chance?\n\n  While we have not and may not find these weapons stockpiles, the case \nagainst Saddam Hussein is not diminished. His was a threat that needed \nto be dealt with.\n  The third and final point, the jury is still out as to what happened \nto Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and when. It is an intelligence \nfailure--a lack of knowledge, not an attempt to mislead people--that we \ndon't know the answer to that question. Presumably, some day we will \nfind out or at least come closer to the resolution of the issue. \nPerhaps some day we will find some of the weapons, or maybe we will \nfind evidence they were destroyed or removed before the war. There is \nno way now to know.\n  But one fact is certain. What we know is that at one time Saddam \nHussein had chemical and biological weapons. Saddam Hussein admitted it \nand the entire world believed it. What is more, that Saddam used those \nweapons against Iran and against the Iraqi Kurds will remain forever \netched in our minds.\n  I point to simply one picture among many which we can present to \nremind us of the fact that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass \ndestruction and used them--in this case, against his own people. Who \nwill forget the picture of this Kurdish mother with arms wrapped around \nbaby, both dead, as a result of Saddam Hussein's perfidy--the use of \nhis chemical weapons.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is it not correct that was one issue upon which \neveryone was in agreement prior to the Iraq war, the French, the \nGermans, the Russians, the British, ourselves, the United Nations, the \nworld in its entirety? The one thing they agreed on prior to the Iraq \nwar was the point the Senator from Arizona was just making.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if we didn't agree on anything else--and \nthere were some issues we agreed on--all of the countries mentioned, \nall of the intelligence services mentioned by the Senator from \nKentucky, in fact agreed on that point.\n  Among other things, they agreed because they read the documentation \nprovided to the United Nations by Saddam Hussein in which he admitted \nhe had biological and chemical weapons stockpiles. We knew he had used \nthem. He said he had them. The question now is, What happened to them \nbetween sometime in the late 1990s, maybe right up to a week or two \nbefore the Iraqi war, and the time we were able to go in after the \nIraqi war in search of them since we haven't yet found large \nstockpiles? We found some things. We certainly found missiles. We have \nfound the programs to reconstitute the chemical weapons program and the \nbiological weapons program. But what we thought we were going to find \nwas a lot of artillery shells filled with chemical munitions and some \nmortars and things of that sort. We thought they were going to be used \nagainst our troops. That we haven't yet found. That is a mystery. You \ncan say it is an intelligence failure, but as the Senator from Kentucky \npointed out, nobody disagreed with the proposition that at one time he \nhad those weapons. There is a lot of evidence to that fact.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So if there were any effort to mislead the public, an \nawful lot of countries were complicit in this effort, were they not?\n  Mr. KYL. If there was an effort to mislead, there would have been a \nlot of countries complicit and a lot of Senators complicit. I don't \nbelieve for a minute that, in fact, any of us attempted to mislead; \nthat Jacques Chirac attempted to mislead, that the United Nations, or \nPresident Bush attempted to mislead. We were all going forth with the \nsame intelligence. We all reached the same conclusion.\n\n  Maybe we don't know yet, but at some point in the last few months or \nyears Saddam Hussein buried, sent to Syria, blew up, or otherwise got \nrid of those weapons. We just do not know. But about their existence at \none time, there can be no doubt.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator very much. The Senator made the last \npoint I wanted to make in this regard, and then I will conclude my \nremarks.\n  We were briefed every day of the war at 9 o'clock in an area here in \nwhich we can receive classified briefings by the general in charge of \nthe operation at the Pentagon and representatives of the CIA, the \nDefense Department, State Department, and others. Every morning they \nchecked several boxes to remind us of the status of the open \nrelationship.\n  Before the operation started, they told us about their belief that \nSaddam Hussein would lob artillery shells with chemical munitions at \nour troops. They pointed out that they were going to make efforts to \ntry to prevent this from happening. They called it the ``red line'' \naround Baghdad. When we got that close, then there would be this threat \nof chemical weapons fired against our troops--maybe biological.\n  So before the war, they began the bombardment on the command and \ncontrol systems that would send the orders out to the generals in the \nfield. They bombed artillery sites hoping to destroy their artillery \nweapons. They bombed the warehouses where they thought the munitions \nmight be stored. They dropped millions of leaflets warning that if any \nofficer carried out an order to use these weapons against the allied \nforces we would hold them accountable as war crime criminals.\n  As our troops got closer to that red line, they had to don the \nequipment\n\n[[Page S1982]]\n\nthat would protect them against these munitions. It was not easy to \nfight under those conditions, but we believed this attack could very \nwell occur.\n  We got to the Baghdad Airport. By that briefing, the generals were \nscratching their heads saying: We are not sure why, but we haven't been \nattacked with these artillery shells. Yet maybe it is because we \ndestroyed the artillery units that would have fired them. Maybe they \njust got scared because of our leaflets or they couldn't issue the \norders. We are not sure. But for some reason they didn't fire them. For \nseveral days, they continued to wonder about that.\n  My point is this: At the highest levels, our troops and our leaders \nat the Department of Defense all believed this was a threat that could \nwell materialize against our troops. They went to great lengths to try \nto protect against it. This was not a matter of somebody misleading the \nAmerican people. We believed it, our troops believed it, the generals \nbelieved it, and the Defense Department believed it. And, yes, the \nPresident believed it. Nobody was trying to mislead anyone. We based a \nlot of our actions on this belief.\n  Let me conclude my remarks by saying this: Much has been made of \nDavid Kay's acknowledgment that all of the intelligence agencies \napparently were wrong about the weapons stockpiles. But listen to what \nDavid Kay said as he reflected on the decision to go to war:\n\n       I think at the end of the inspection process we'll paint a \n     picture of Iraq that was far more dangerous than even we \n     thought it was before the war. It was a system collapsing. It \n     was a country that had the capability in weapons of mass \n     destruction areas and in which terrorists, likes ants to \n     honey, were going after it.\n\n  Kay stated on numerous occasions that Saddam Hussein was in clear \nmaterial breach of Security Council Resolution 1441. The Iraq Survey \nGroup, of which he was head, discovered hundreds of cases of activities \nthat were prohibited under the original United Nations cease-fire \nresolution and that should have been but were not reported under \nResolution 1441.\n  The group found a prison laboratory complex which may have been used \nin human testing of biological agents. It found ``reference strains'' \nof biological organisms which can be used to produce biological \nweapons. It found new research on agents applicable to biological \nweapons, including the Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever. It found \ncontinuing research on ricin and aflatoxin. It also found plants and \nadvanced design work on new missiles with ranges well beyond what was \npermitted.\n  Not just the words of Resolution 1441 but the entire credibility of \nthe U.N. was at stake. The years of Iraqi violations had to come to an \nend. Now that awful and bloody regime has come to an end.\n  In the final analysis, whatever the inaccuracies of specific pieces \nof intelligence, that Saddam Hussein continued to harbor intentions for \nthe development and use of WMD remains true. The observations of David \nKay, once again, showed this. He reported earlier this year that Iraq \n``was in the early stages of renovating the nuclear program, building \nnew buildings.'' This is the regime that, as I said, David Kay called \n``far more dangerous than even we thought. To wait any longer to remove \nit would have been a gamble not worth taking.''\n\n  I yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Arizona and appreciate so \nmuch his contribution to this important discussion about the war in \nIraq and how we got into it and what people understood at the time.\n  It has occurred to me there is a criminal analogy that summarizes the \ndebate we seem to be having. So let's pose a hypothetical question to \nall of our fellow Senators. Say the FBI has received a credible tip \nthat a domestic terrorist group is planning to bomb the Capitol. This \ngroup is responsible for previous deadly terrorist attacks, we know \nthat, but has been able so far to avoid capture. When the FBI breaks \ndown the door to the group's rural compound, they find all sorts of \nprohibited weapons--machine guns, sawed-off shotguns, and grenade \nlaunchers. They also find detailed plans to gun down lawmakers, \ndiagrams of the Capitol, and information on how to construct a large \nbomb capable of destroying the Capitol Building. But they do not find \nthe bomb itself or any grenades or the grenade launchers. They found \nall of the other things, but they did not find the bombs themselves or \nthe grenade launchers.\n  Should the FBI apologize to the terrorists and offer to replace their \ndoor, even though they just caused the apprehension of the terrorists? \nSince they had yet to construct the bomb, should the terrorists go \nfree? Should we fret that we acted before the bomb was ready, even \nthough the terrorists' intent to attack the Capitol was absolutely \nclear?\n  The answer is obviously and definitely no; we should not wait until \nterrorists roam our streets before responding. We should not wait until \nthe planes have been hijacked or until the bombs have been assembled. \nWe should not have waited until Hussein's army once again stood ready \nat the border. We should not have waited until the threat he posed to \nthe United States and its allies was imminent. We should not have \nwaited for the French to say it was OK to act to defend the free world.\n  Some seem to suggest that even though we know Saddam Hussein \ncontinued to develop ballistic missiles prohibited by the U.N., our \nmilitary effort was illegitimate because we have not yet found WMD \nwarheads or the missiles. I can confidently state that Saddam's \nballistic missiles were not for the Iraqi space program.\n  On another note, I am fairly confident that the Iraqi people do not \nbelieve for a minute that their liberation is any less legitimate \nbecause we have yet to find stockpiles of WMD. I raise this simple \nanalogy because the fundamental questions about our policy in Iraq are \nfairly basic. The crux of the matter is that Saddam Hussein posed a \ngrowing threat to the United States, to our allies, and to his own \npeople. There is no doubt that Iraqis and Americans alike are better \noff now that Saddam Hussein is in prison and his evil sons have met \ntheir end.\n  Now it occurs to me, we have also lost sight of the moral dimension \nthat accompanied our liberation of Iraq. I represent in my State Fort \nCampbell, KY, the home of the 101st Airborne. I followed their efforts \nin that country very closely. This is the unit whose brave soldiers \nbrought to justice Usay and Quday Hussein. The 101st Airborne got them. \nMy colleagues are surely not unaware of how vile these two murderers \nwere and how deserving they were of the tow missiles that ended their \nbrutish lives.\n  In case we have forgotten that, let me recount a little bit of their \nevil legacy. According to many reports, Usay Hussein routinely ordered \nhis bodyguards to snatch young women off the streets so that he could \nrape them. He also ordered political prisoners to be dropped into tubs \nof acid to punish them. Usay was also in charge of Iraq's olympic \ncommittee where he oversaw the training of that country's professional \nathletes. Usay's training regimen included torturing and jailing \nathletes for poor performance. Usay would sometimes force Iraq's track \nstars to crawl along a strip of newly poured asphalt, and once required \nsoccer kickers to kick a concrete ball until their feet were broken \nafter they failed to reach the 1994 World Cup finals. This was Usay \nHussein.\n\n  Although it is difficult to think of an individual more brutal and \nevil than Usay Hussein, his brother, Quday, who was known by many \nIraqis as ``the snake'' for his blood thirsty manner, surely comes \nclose. Quday was responsible for the massacre of tens of thousands of \nShiite Muslims in the wake of the first gulf war. Maybe some of our \ncolleagues have forgotten about the marsh Arabs who live in southern \nIraq. These Iraqis used to live in the Iraqi wetlands that covered \nnearly 3,200 square miles. They had lived in these marshes for hundreds \nand perhaps thousands of years until Quday ordered them drained in a \nmassive ethnic cleansing operation. Quday was also responsible for \nhorrible cleansings of Hussein's prisons.\n  When Hussein's prisons became overcrowded, the regime did not build \nmore jails or let prisoners go. Instead, Quday ordered mass executions \nin order to reduce overcrowding. A London-based\n\n[[Page S1983]]\n\nhuman rights group reports that these unlucky prisoners were sometimes \nput feet first into massive shredders at Quday's request.\n  We do not hear much about these awful crimes anymore, so maybe some \nof our colleagues have forgotten, if they ever knew, about the extent \nof the Hussein family's brutality. I highlight their brutality in order \nto ask a serious question about the reality of the international system \nin the absence of American action. Does anybody seriously believe that \nhad the 101st Airborne not banged down their door, Usay and Quday would \nhave been brought to justice? Of course they would not have. Without \nthe 101st Airborne going after them, they would not have been brought \nto justice. Absent U.S. leadership, I cannot imagine a situation in \nwhich the U.N. would have been able to arrange for the apprehension and \ntrial of the Hussein family.\n  Had the United States not acted in Iraq, who could say with any \nconfidence that Usay and Quday would not this very day be raping young \nIraqi girls and torturing Iraqi dissidents. Of course they would still \nbe doing that. That is what they did.\n  Had the United States not acted in Iraq, could anyone say with any \nconfidence that Saddam would not be plotting our doom, that his sons \nwould not be torturing the Iraqi people, and that his regime would not \nbe preparing to rebuild the WMD infrastructure we all have agreed \nHussein once had?\n  In conclusion, Madam President, it is more than enough to justify the \nwar in Iraq and the liberation of the Iraqi people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I know the majority leader wishes to speak \nnext; and then I know the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee is here as well. I now yield to Majority Leader Frist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I just want to share with my colleagues \nsome recent experiences I had in meeting with Kurdish physicians not \ntoo long ago in my office, not too far from here, because it relates so \ndramatically to the debate and to the unfolding of many of the \nquestions that seem to be raised today.\n  I should really begin by saying in my home State of Tennessee there \nare a number of Kurdish residents who live, who reside particularly in \nthe area of Nashville where I am from. I have had the opportunity to \nmeet with them and to listen to their concerns and have had the \nopportunity to support a project called the Health Partnerships With \nNorthern Iraq, which is a project that is sponsored by the Meridian \nInternational Center here in the District, with the support of the \nState Department. It is a fantastic program, it is a great program, the \npurpose of which is to train Kurdish doctors in northern Iraq to do \nprimary care; that is, basic care. It is probably 90 percent of health \ncare in terms of responding to individual needs of families and \nindividuals.\n  What is interesting is these doctors, for a period of time, spent a \nfew weeks, and then months, of their training in this country in \nprimary care, and part of that time was spent in Tennessee at East \nTennessee State University.\n  Last January, I met with this group of Kurdish doctors in my office, \njust down the hall. They came to me as a physician, as a doctor, and \nalso as majority leader, but they came to me with very specific \nconcerns. They shared with me that they knew the war to topple Saddam \nHussein was near, and they were concerned--these are Iraqi physicians--\nthat they would be attacked with chemical and biological weapons. Their \nconcern, as I will share with my colleagues shortly, was based on \npractical experience, experiences they have firsthand knowledge of, in \nterms of being with people who had suffered from attacks.\n  But at the time when they were in my office, they came to me because \nthey said: We are simply unprepared to be practicing primary care in \nour homeland in northern Iraq. They were in a region of about 6 million \nindividuals, which had 240 primary care centers, but they had very few \nsupplies. They had only the very most rudimentary needs in terms of \ntreatment. They had no personal protective equipment in terms of \nbiological contaminants or chemical weapons. They had no ability to \ncontain or even treat victims of a chemical or biological attack. They \nhad little time for the intensive training they knew they would need in \norder to respond to such a biological or chemical attack. Yet they came \nto my office very specifically asking for help.\n  Dr. Ali Sindi, the delegation leader, asked for basic supplies. He \nasked for medical supplies and some help with acquiring medical \nsupplies, coming to the majority leader, but also coming to a \nphysician. He asked for hydrogen peroxide. He asked for bleach. \nHydrogen peroxide and bleach, as most people know today, are used to \ndecontaminate affected areas from biological or chemical weapons. He \nasked for gas masks. He asked for chemical suits. He asked for \nantibiotics in the event there was a biological attack.\n  He noted--and, again, it was a group of Kurdish physicians--he told \nme the Kurdish water systems are generally open to the air and, a lot \nof times, sitting on the rooftops of the villages there. So he, \nconcerned about chemical and biological attacks, said: And in addition, \nwhat I need is some kind of protection for these rooftop water systems.\n  Their fear--these doctors' fear, the doctors from Iraq--was not based \non intelligence briefings. Their fear was based on experience. Their \nfear was based on reality. Their fear was based on what they had seen, \nand their fear was based on what they had actually treated; that is, \nchemical weapons, weapons of mass destruction.\n  As the Senator from Arizona knows, the Kurds had been attacked by \nchemical weapons before, most notably in the city of Halabja. There, \nthousands of innocent Kurds were killed with weapons of mass \ndestruction, these chemical weapons. These doctors from that region had \ncome to see me. They had treated victims of that particular attack. \nThey know from that direct experience what chemical weapons, weapons of \nmass destruction, can do. These doctors believed, obviously, the Kurds \nwere going to be attacked with chemical weapons once again. They asked \nfrom me and from our Government, through me, for that help to be \nprepared.\n  At this juncture, I ask the Senator from Arizona, in light of these \ndoctors' past, direct experience with weapons of mass destruction--\nthese chemical weapons--does the Senator agree the Kurds were acting \nreasonably when they, with this direct experience, believed Saddam \nHussein possessed and intended to use weapons of mass destruction; \nnamely, the chemical weapons they had seen and had experience with \nbeing used before?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I would answer the question this way: It is \neasy for us, in this sort of antiseptic environment of the Senate, to \ntalk about these matters. But I was moved by the story of these Kurdish \ndoctors, who saw it with their own eyes. I cannot imagine how they \nwould not believe, and why we should not think it reasonable they would \nbelieve, Saddam Hussein would do this again, that he had every \nintention to, every capability of doing it again.\n  When I look at this picture, I think of the words of Secretary Powell \nwhen he visited Halabja and saw what occurred there and basically vowed \nthe United States would never, ever again allow something like that to \nhappen if he could do anything about it. It made me proud. It made me \nrecommitted to the proposition that when we know something like that is \ngoing on, or we believe it to be the case, like these Kurdish doctors \ndid, we have a duty to do something about it.\n  I absolutely agree with the Senator.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  Again, these physicians who came to see me from Iraq had seen with \ntheir own eyes these chemical weapons having been used before. They had \ncome--and this is just last January--to me to say: We need help to \nprotect ourselves and our communities from the use of these biological \nand chemical weapons.\n  Is the Senator aware many of the critics of the war to topple Saddam \nHussein seem to suggest there was never cause to be concerned with \nSaddam Hussein? In fact, if you listen closely to the critics, they go \nso far as to imply there was never a threat at all.\n\n[[Page S1984]]\n\n  Is the Senator from Arizona familiar with the details of one of the \nmost horrendous examples of Saddam's brutality, the 1988 massacre of \nKurdish civilians in the village of Halabja? Indeed, at the time, \n50,000 Kurds lived in the village of Halabja, a city that is very close \nto the Iranian border. They had already suffered immeasurably from the \n8 years of conventional war between Iraq and Iran. But for Saddam \nHussein, that was not enough.\n  On March 16, 1988, the Iraqi regime launched an artillery attack \nagainst Halabja, driving the residents of the city there underground. \nThey went to these underground shelters and to the basements for \nprotection from this overhead attack. But that is when the real, true \nterror began. Iraqi helicopters then came in with planes, and they came \nback once again, but this time with chemical weapons. The chemical \nweapons were all carefully documented--nerve gas, VX, mustard gas--all \nweapons of mass destruction, which were aimed at these buildings, these \ncellars, all of a sudden turning these cellars in which the Kurds were \nhiding into gas chambers. They fled, of course, gathering their \nfamilies, exposed, running for their lives.\n  Graphic evidence showed the results of Saddam's use of weapons of \nmass destruction. The Senator from Arizona just showed that picture \nwith the question: No weapons of mass destruction?\n  It reminds me so dramatically of what one survivor relayed at the \nscene:\n\n       People were dying all around. When a child could not go on, \n     the parents, becoming hysterical with fear, abandoned him. \n     Many children were left on the ground by the side of the \n     road. Old people as well. They were running. Then they would \n     stop breathing and die.\n\n  Experts agree over 5,000 innocent citizens died as a result of the \nchemical weapons attack. These were weapons of mass destruction used on \nHalabja. Again, those physicians in my office told me these stories. \nOther survivors had scarring of the lungs, something called fibrosis of \nthe lung, where the lung becomes nothing but a fibrous scar. Others \nwere blinded permanently. The consequences of this cruelty continue to \nthis day, and indeed these physicians continue to treat the residual \neffects of people in that Kurdish community. Chemicals contaminated the \nfood and water supply. The chemicals caused cancer. The chemicals \ncaused those respiratory diseases like fibrosis. They caused \ninfertility and high levels of severe abnormalities in Halabja's \nchildren.\n  Christine Gosden, a British professor of medical genetics, traveled \nto northern Iraq in 1998 to study the effects on the Kurdish population \nof the poison gas unleashed on them. She founded the Halabja Medical \nInstitute and discovered the consequences of the chemical weapons \nattack were even more damaging than she expected. She wrote in the \nWashington Post:\n\n       What I found was far worse than anything I had suspected--\n     devastating problems occurring 10 years after the attack. \n     These chemicals seriously affected people's eyes and \n     respiratory and neurological systems. Many became blind. Skin \n     disorders, which involve severe scarring are frequent, and \n     many progress to skin cancer. An increasing number of \n     children are dying each year of leukemias and lymphomas.\n\n  The Halabja Medical Institute, in its research on the attacks, \ndiscovered something even more vicious. Its conclusions noted:\n\n       While these weapons had many terrible direct effects, such \n     as immediate death, or skin and eye burns, Iraqi government \n     documents indicate they were used deliberately for known \n     long-term effects, including cancers, birth defects, \n     neurological problems, and infertility. Inexpensive in terms \n     of death per unit cost, there is evidence that these weapons \n     were used in different combinations by Baath \n     forces attempting to discern their effectiveness as \n     weapons of terror and war.\n\n  Yes, Saddam's regime conducted experiments using chemical weapons on \ninnocent Kurdish civilians. These are Kurdish civilians in his own \ncountry. Experimenting. The Kurdish physicians told me--it is to vivid \nin my mind--that in buildings like hotels with different wings, single \nfloors, people would be herded and placed into these rooms; one wing \nwould be to test VX gas on humans, killing them, and another wing would \nbe mustard gas, and there would be another gas in a third wing, to see \nwhich was more effective.\n  Iraqi soldiers even went so far as to return to the town after that \nattack in Halabja to study how efficient, how effective those chemicals \nweapons were, using the number of people who died as a measure of \nsuccess.\n  I want to ask the Senator from Arizona another question. Does the \nSenator from Arizona have any doubt in his mind that Saddam would \ncontinue to develop and use such weapons at the first possible \nopportunity?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I will answer in a couple of different \nways. First of all, I served on the Intelligence Committee for 8 years, \nand I was convinced, based upon the intelligence estimates provided to \nus over that period of time, these weapons were possessed, they had \nbeen used, and they would likely be used again if he had the \nopportunity to do so, and that there were weapons programs ongoing \nwithin the country of Iraq. So I don't have any doubt, as the Senator \nhas so eloquently pointed out here, that the Kurds, who he referred to \nand spoke with, were absolutely right that these kinds of attacks would \noccur again.\n  I wondered whether I was alone in this and, of course, in looking, I \nfound that I was not. Let me note two or three things colleagues have \nsaid. Then I will turn to Senator Hatch. But I note that in 1998, long \nbefore President Bush came to town, President Clinton had come to the \nsame conclusion, based upon the intelligence that had been provided to \nhim by the intelligence agencies. A couple things struck me and then I \nwill move on. He said:\n\n       Other countries possess weapons of mass destruction and \n     ballistic missiles. With Saddam, there is one big difference: \n     he has used them, not once but repeatedly.\n\n  That is the point the leader made.\n\n       Unleashing chemical weapons against Iranian troops . . . \n     against civilians, firing Scud missiles at the citizens of \n     Israel, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Iran . . . even against \n     his own people, gassing Kurdish civilians in Northern Iraq.\n\n  I also found it interesting that in December of 1998, in an Oval \nOffice address, President Clinton said this, and I take just one \nsentence:\n\n       I have no doubt today that, left unchecked, Saddam Hussein \n     will use these terrible weapons again.\n\n  That was the President of the United States responding to the \nintelligence he was given. I know some colleagues have said the current \nadministration hasn't qualified the intelligence enough. They have not \nsaid we think or we judge. They said we are pretty sure. Here is \nPresident Clinton staying, ``I have no doubt today.'' That is not \ncaveated or qualified.\n  Then several members of his cabinet--I looked at what they had to \nsay. Madeleine Albright, the distinguished Secretary of State, said:\n\n       I think the record will show that Saddam Hussein has \n     produced weapons of mass destruction, which he's clearly not \n     collecting for his own personal pleasure, but in order to \n     use. Therefore, he is qualitatively and quantitatively \n     different from every brutal dictator that has appeared \n     recently.\n\n  That is her judgment.\n  Secretary of Defense William Cohen talked about Secretary Albright, \nindicating Saddam Hussein has ``developed an arsenal of deadly chemical \nand biological weapons. He has used these weapons repeatedly against \nhis own people as well as Iran.''\n  We are talking about an arsenal of weapons here. Here is the former \nSecretary of Defense in the Clinton administration talking about that. \nHe went on to say in this particular interview, which occurred at Ohio \nState University:\n\n       I have a picture which I believe CNN can show on its \n     cameras, but here's a picture taken of an Iraqi mother and \n     child killed by Iraqi nerve gas. This is what I would call \n     Madonna and child Saddam Hussein-style.\n\n  That is the picture Secretary Cohen at that time displayed on the \nscreen. He said:\n\n       Now, the United Nations believes that he still has very \n     large quantities of VX.\n\n  VX is the nerve agent which is so deadly. As Dr. Frist knows, a \nsingle drop can kill you within a couple of minutes.\n  Here is Secretary Cohen and Secretary Albright referring to the \nUnited Nations believing that he still has a large quantity of this \nproduct, the point being that everybody thought he had it.\n  The United Nations thought he had it, Secretary Cohen thought he had \nit, Secretary Albright thought he had it, and President Clinton thought \nhe had it.\n\n[[Page S1985]]\n\n  I found it interesting that Senator Leahy, the distinguished ranking \nmember on the Judiciary Committee, said in 1988--and he is right on \ntarget:\n\n       If Saddam Hussein had nothing to hide, why would he have \n     gone to great lengths to prevent U.N. inspectors from doing \n     their job?\n\n  That is a question we all asked.\n\n       There is no doubt that since 1991, Saddam Hussein has \n     squandered his country's resources to maintain his capacity \n     to produce and stockpile chemical and biological weapons.\n\n  The point is, a lot of our colleagues had no doubt and they said they \nhad no doubt.\n  Senator Kerry--I will make this the last quotation--in 1998 said:\n\n       We do know that he had them--\n\n  Referring to WMD--\n\n       in his inventory, and the means of delivering them. We do \n     know that his chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons \n     development programs were proceeding with his active support.\n\n  The bottom line is the distinguished majority leader is absolutely \ncorrect. But not only do we have reason, not only did those Kurdish \nphysicians have reason to believe he had these horrible weapons and \nwould use them again, so did the leaders of our country, including the \nleaders of the United Nations all throughout this period of time of \n1996, 1998, right on up forward.\n  Unless the distinguished majority leader has anything else, I yield \nat this point to the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask my colleagues on the floor just to \nthink this through. I have been watching this debate about the threat \nof Iraq, frankly, since the early 1990s. I have been privileged to \nserve in this body since 1977, which means I have been here long enough \nto see the evolving trends in terrorism, from the Iranian revolution to \nthe perversion of the Islamic faith and advent of fundamentalism. I \nalso have been here through all the stages of relations with Iraq since \nthe rise of Saddam Hussein.\n  I recall the debate prior to the first gulf war. While certainly not \nabsolutely partisan, that debate in 1990 was the last time we had a \nvery partisan debate on foreign policy. Through the 1990s, while I had \nmany disputes with the Clinton administration over various aspects of \nforeign policy, I seemed to recall that partisanship on the question of \nIraq had diminished. In fact, the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 was \npassed in this body unanimously and in the House overwhelmingly and was \nsigned into law by President Clinton.\n  I think my colleagues would have to agree with this. I would like to \nask my colleagues if they agree with the following assessment: Since \nthe fall of 2002, the debate over Iraq policy has become more and more \npartisan and more and more bitter. While the authorization to use force \nwas passed by a large majority--I believe it was 77 to 23--and with the \nsupport of many of my Democratic colleagues, including some not present \ntoday, the debate since then has been troubling to me.\n  You would think that Congress could maintain our proper role of \noversight without descending into partisan attacks. You would think \nthat with our military in the midst of a historic mission and over 500 \nAmerican families grieving because their loved ones paid the ultimate \nsacrifice, that legitimate criticism could be expressed without \npartisan rancor or misleading rhetoric. You would think so.\n  One of the most troubling aspects of the criticism of our President \nand his policy was the suggestion, deceivingly made, that the threat of \nSaddam Hussein was not imminent. I believe these criticisms beginning \nlast year deliberately tried to confuse the American public. The threat \nwas not imminent, the critics said, implying the response to go to war \nwas not required.\n  Yet I have reviewed most of the President's rhetoric, and I have \nconcluded that he made numerous honest statements that declared that \nafter the historic attacks of September 11, we would not be defining \nour response by outdated measures of imminence. I went back and read a \nkey quote from the President's State of the Union Address in 2003 in \nwhich he declared to us, the American people, and to the world:\n\n       Some have said we must not act until the threat is \n     imminent. Since when have terrorists and tyrants announced \n     their intentions politely, putting us on notice before they \n     strike? If this threat is permitted to fully and suddenly \n     emerge, all actions, all words, and all recriminations would \n     come too late.\n\n  That is what he said, and it was right then, and it is right today. \nSo will my colleagues recall this extremely clear statement? Do they \nthink his words were casually stated? Give me a break.\n\n  I have given a lot of thought to the concept of imminence since \nSeptember 11, and as we debated our response to Iraq, I recognized that \nthe definition of ``imminence'' is necessary to support a doctrine of \npreemption. I wonder what our various Senators' views about this are \nsince the definition of ``imminence'' is different in the 21st century \nthan it was in the 19th or the 20th centuries.\n  During the debate over authorization of the use of force last year, I \nmade the following points:\n  Osama bin Laden launched an attack that changed the way America sees \nthe world. We had to recognize that the concept of imminence was not an \nabstract idea as we contemplated preemptive use of force. Preemption is \nnot a new concept in international law, despite what many of the \nPresident's critics suggest. It is as old as Grotius, the founder of \nmodern international law.\n  Contrary to critics' misinformed assertions, the U.S. has never \nforesworn the use of preemption, not since the U.N. charter and not \nunder either Democratic or Republican administrations.\n  Preemption has always been conditioned on the idea of imminent \nthreat. In the prenuclear era, we could see conventional armies \namassing on a border and base imminence on that measure. But in the \nnuclear era, the idea of imminence grew quite a bit murkier.\n  Was it the fueling of an enemy ICBM? Was it the glare on the rocket \nas it left the launch pad? Was it the warheads' return through the \natmosphere? Because we raised these questions, by the way, was the \nreason the U.S. rejected a ``no first use'' policy during the era of \nstrategic competition with the Soviet Union. Was that the reason we did \nthat? You bet your life.\n  Imminence becomes even murkier in an era of terrorism and weapons of \nmass destruction. When did the threat of al-Qaida become imminent? I \nknow when it became manifest. Not, by the way, on September 11. Osama \nbin Laden had struck many times before then. On September 11, the \nthreat became catastrophic. It was well beyond manifest. It was well \nbeyond imminent.\n  Today, most people agree the threat of Bin Laden should have been \nconsidered imminent well back into the 1990s. I first started speaking \nof this threat in 1996, but I now believe this threat could have been \nconsidered imminent even before that.\n  Do my colleagues agree we had to reconsider the definition of \n``imminence'' after September 11, that the threat of terrorism forces \nus to redefine threats to our national security, that it would have \nbeen irresponsible for any administration entrusted with national \nsecurity to avoid doing so? Does anybody disagree with that?\n  Would my colleagues allow me just a few more questions which I would \nlike to ask everybody in this body, please? I wonder if my colleagues \nwould agree with this assessment about the threat that Iraq poses.\n  I had to make, for my own conscience and to present to my \nconstituents, my own assessment of the threat posed by Iraq. The \nthreats Saddam Hussein posed to his own people were clear. Free Iraqis \ntoday will be undertaking the grim task of exhuming mass graves for a \nlong time. Saddam's threat to his neighbors and our friends in the gulf \nand Middle East are also well established. But all of us had to \ndetermine what threat was posed to the United States.\n  I feared a nexus between weapons of mass destruction and a terrorism-\nsponsoring state, and we feared they had weapons of mass destruction. \nThe U.N. confirmed they had had weapons of mass destruction. They used \nweapons of mass destruction against their own people and threatened the \nuse of them against others. They used them against others, as well, in \nthe Iranian war.\n  On weapons of mass destruction, we know that we have not discovered \nany weapons of mass destruction so far. This debate has been joined on \na number of levels. I fully support the chairman of the Senate Select \nCommittee\n\n[[Page S1986]]\n\non Intelligence in his determined efforts to learn about the failures \nof our intelligence, if there were, in fact, failures.\n  We still have not even looked at the vast majority of sites in Iraq \nwhere weapons of mass destruction may still lie. I know that every \nintelligence community professional agrees with our need to learn from \nmany errors because all of us know the value of accurate intelligence, \nwhile all of us recognize the limits to perfectibility.\n  On another level, both in the Intelligence Committee and in the \npublic arena, the debate has become more partisan, acrimonious and, \nonce again, deceptive.\n  Will my colleagues agree with me that the cost of making intelligence \noversight partisan is not worth the devaluation of a tool that we need \nmore than at any other time in our history?\n  I would like to know if my colleagues would agree with the following \nconclusion about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. We faced \na weapons of mass destruction gap.\n  This gap was the difference between the chemical and biological \nstockpiles we had confirmed existed until the late 1990s and the lack \nof evidence regarding their status or destruction in 2002--their \nstatus, their destruction, or their removal someplace else. The gap was \nsignificant. No other Western government or intelligence government \ncould explain it, nor could the United States verify that the gap had \nbeen closed by the cooperation of the Iraqi regime in proving the \ndestruction of these weapons.\n  This was a requirement, by the way, under international law, made to \nthe international community, a requirement that was the result of the \ncessation of hostilities at the end of the first gulf war; a \nrequirement that unmet left that war unresolved, unconcluded, and \ntherefore without a promise of peace.\n  The attempts at denial and deception by the Iraqi regime were \nblatant. The refusal to cooperate with the international community was \nobstinate. The potential threat posed by a regime violently hostile to \nthe United States was grave. I hope my colleagues will agree that it \nwould have been irresponsible for any administration entrusted with the \nnational security to avoid reaching similar conclusions.\n  There was the threat of terrorism. For well over a decade, Iraq was \non our list of state sponsors of terrorism. Every Member in this body \nhad ample opportunities to review the evidence supporting this claim--\nthis verified knowledge, by the way.\n  To my knowledge, no Member on either side of the aisle questioned the \nPresident's determination, or this determination.\n  Now, of course, we have not proven a link to September 11, and \nultimately there will likely not be a causal link. Perhaps Saddam was \ndirectly involved. Perhaps we will learn more.\n  Association is not causation, as every logic professor would say. \nCaution in leaping to conclusions is in order. Associating with \nterrorist groups, as we know Saddam Hussein has done and had done, \ntraining them, giving them moral and financial support, is different \nthan directing them. Nevertheless, his links to terrorism had been \nevident for a long time.\n  The President has made it clear, since his first speech before the \nCongress days after September 11, that associating with terrorist \ngroups would no longer be responded to with apathy. The previous \nadministration did so, there is no question about that, and America's \nsecurity was gravely compromised.\n\n  Do my colleagues remember the President's speech to the Congress \nafter September 11, 2001? Do they recall, as I do, the public's \noverwhelming support for what the President said that day?\n  Certainly the evidence of Al-Zurqawi whose documents were captured \nand released a few weeks ago, as well as the reports in the press \nsuggesting links with the Ansar-al-Islam indicated a troubling link \nbetween Iraq and al-Qaida.\n  I am waiting for some of the administration's critics to suggest that \nthese two terrorist elements were caused by our intervention in \nAfghanistan and that had we supported the status quo there we would not \nbe facing the terrorists of the jihadists and Ansar-al-Islam. That \nwould have been another very specious analysis.\n  It is true that Al-Zarqawi and Ansar became more active as a result \nof our intervention in Afghanistan, when we deposed the Taliban and al-\nQaida and fled from that country to hide in Pakistan or to get safe \npassage from Iran to travel to Iraq. In my estimation, if Saddam \nHussein was not involved in September 11, his regime certainly became \nmore dangerous to us as a result of our attack on the Taliban in \nAfghanistan.\n  I hope my colleagues can imagine that this President or any President \nwould not have had to respond similarly to the way President Bush \nresponded to the Taliban's protection of al-Qaida after September 11, \n2001. That is, of course, unless a President had judged the threat of \nal-Qaida imminent before that fateful day.\n  Finally, I would like my colleagues to allow me a question or two on \nthe responses we have heard from David Kay's testimonies. The response \nto the Kay testimonies has also been very troubling to me because the \ntestimonies of an honest and substantive man have been subject to \npartisan rancor over the President's difficult decision to go to war.\n  Listening to some commentators, one would think Kay's honest \nassessment that weapons of mass destruction will not be found, an \nassessment that I believe may still be premature, could be interpreted \ninto a challenge to the sincerity of the administration's estimate of \nthe Iraqi threat.\n  As I have said, I believe we need to investigate any flaws in our \nintelligence that David Kay or any other serious professional exposes. \nYet this is what David Kay told us. In an interview earlier this month, \nhe said: I certainly believe that Iraq was a gathering threat. In fact, \nin many ways, it will probably turn out that Saddam and that regime \nwere more dangerous than we anticipated because, in fact, it was \nfalling apart into unbelievable depravity and corruption.\n  Where is that quote among all of our liberal commentators in this \ncountry today? Where is that quote? That was one of the most important \nquotes he made.\n  The week before, Kay told the public, in responding to a question of \nwhether the decision to go to war was prudent: I think it was \nabsolutely prudent. He said: I think it was absolutely prudent. In \nfact, I think at the end of the inspection process we will paint a \npicture of Iraq that was far more dangerous than even we thought it was \nbefore the war. It was of a system collapsing. It was a country that \nhad the capability and weapons of mass destruction areas and in which \nterrorists, like ants to honey, were going after it.\n\n  The fact is, it took guts for the President to do what he did. He was \nright, and history will prove him to be right.\n  When I hear these testimonies of David Kay, I become concerned of yet \nanother intelligence failure: We did not adequately assess the \npolitical degradation of the Saddam Hussein regime, the political \ndegradation of a regime that killed 300,000-plus of its own citizens, \nmen, women, and children, and buried them in mass graves, and helped to \nkill a million others in its war with Iran. We did not adequately \nassess the political depravity and degradation of Saddam Hussein's \nregime. Iraq had become a gangster state.\n  It was, according to David Kay, and all the reports we are now \ngetting from free Iraq, more dangerous than we thought. Yet some \ncriticize the President's decision? Give me a break. They ought to be \ncriticized. The critics know these facts as well as I do, and ignoring \nthem is a terrible thing.\n  I would just like to ask my colleagues whether the assessment by \nDavid Kay should not support the President's brave decision to address \nthe threat of the Hussein regime by implementing a policy of regime \nchange--a policy that had been nearly unanimously supported in our \nGovernment for 4 years?\n  Was Iraq a grave and gathering threat, as the President said? I ask \nmy colleagues, especially those who have been so critical of the \nPresident, would it have been responsible for any administration \nentrusted with the national security to avoid reaching similar \nconclusions? I think Senator Kerry was right when he said this:\n\n       I believe the record of Saddam Hussein's ruthless, reckless \n     breach of international\n\n[[Page S1987]]\n\n     values and standards of behavior, which is at the core of the \n     cease-fire agreement, with no reach, no stretch, is cause \n     enough for the world community to hold him accountable by use \n     of force, if necessary.\n\n  The ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee said, back in \n2002:\n\n       There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is \n     working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will \n     likely have nuclear weapons within the next 5 years. We also \n     should remember we have always underestimated the progress \n     Saddam has made in the development of weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n\n  That was said in the Congressional Record. Why the difference today? \nLet's go back to my friend, Senator Kerry, the Senator from \nMassachusetts, again. Back in 1990 he said:\n\n       Today, we are confronted by a regional power, Iraq, which \n     has attacked a weaker State, Kuwait. . . . The crisis is even \n     more threatening by virtue of the fact that Iraq has \n     developed a chemical weapons capability, and is pursuing a \n     nuclear weapons development program. And Saddam Hussein has \n     demonstrated a willingness to use such weapons of mass \n     destruction in the past, whether in his war against Iran or \n     against his own Kurdish population.\n\n  My gosh, that was said in the Congressional Record on October 2, \n1990.\n  On November 9, 1990, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nsaid this:\n\n       [Saddam Hussein] cannot be permitted to go unobserved and \n     unimpeded towards his horrific objective of amassing a \n     stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. This is not a \n     matter about which there should be any debate whatsoever in \n     the Security Council, or, certainly, in this Nation.\n\n  All I can say is why did he say that then, and why, as a candidate, \nis he saying the things he is saying today?\n  The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts said:\n\n       [W]hile we should always seek to take significant \n     international actions on a multilateral rather than a \n     unilateral basis whenever that is possible, if in the final \n     analysis we face what we truly believe to be a grave threat \n     to the well-being of our Nation or the entire world and it \n     cannot be removed peacefully, we must have the courage to do \n     what we believe is right and wise.\n\n  That is in the Congressional Record on November 9, 1997.\n  I think the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts deserves credit \nfor those statements. He was warning America during the Clinton years \nof how terrible the Saddam Hussein regime really was. He deserves \ncredit for that.\n  On November 9, 1997, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts was \nright again. He said:\n\n       It is not possible to overstate the ominous implications \n     for the Middle East if Saddam were to develop and \n     successfully develop and deploy potent biological weapons. We \n     can all imagine the consequences. Extremely small quantities \n     of several known biological weapons have the capability to \n     exterminate the entire populations of cities the size of Tel \n     Aviv or Jerusalem. These could be delivered by ballistic \n     missile, but they also could be delivered by much more \n     pedestrian means; aerosol applicators on commercial trucks \n     easily could suffice. If Saddam were to develop and then \n     deploy usable atomic weapons, the same holds true.\n\n  He was warning the nation and he deserves credit for having done so \nthen.\n  On February 23, 1998, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nsaid this:\n\n       There are a set of principles here that are very large, \n     larger in some measure than I think has been adequately \n     conveyed, both internationally and certainly to the American \n     people. Saddam Hussein has already used these weapons and has \n     made it clear that he has intent to continue to try, by \n     virtue of his duplicity and secrecy, to continue to do so. \n     That is a threat to the stability of the Middle East. It is a \n     threat with respect to the potential of terrorist activities \n     on a global basis. It is a threat even to regions near but \n     not exactly in the Middle East.\n\n  I am hooked. Incredible. I am proud of the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts for having said that during the Clinton years. I just \nwish he would acknowledge that he said that during the Bush years.\n  There are other distinguished Senators who knew of this threat and \nwho made statements on what we should do back during the Clinton years, \nand even during the Bush years.\n  It bothers me that this President has been so viciously attacked by \npeople who know the facts and who knew them back during the Clinton \nyears and spoke out about them during the Clinton years, who are so \nwilling to demean this President during the years of George W. Bush as \nPresident. It never ceases to amaze me how out of tune we become when \nPresidential years come along. I think it happens to both sides. I \nreally believe that. I believe there are partisans on both sides. But I \nhave never seen it like it is today.\n  It used to be that we supported whoever was President in foreign \nmatters. We stand together. I guess this partisanship really began \nduring the Vietnam war. But it has reached a pitch today that is \nunseemly.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I yield to the other Senator from Utah, Mr. \nBennett.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arizona for the \ntime and for the opportunity to address this issue. Let me make one \nstatement at the beginning that I think needs to be made on the \npolitical rhetoric that is surrounding this issue. I am not questioning \nthe patriotism of those who are complaining about, disagreeing with, or \neven attacking the President. I question their accuracy. I question \ntheir wisdom. But I am not questioning their patriotism. I think that \nneeds to be made clear because in the debate over this war, there has \nbeen rhetoric that, in my opinion, has gone over the top.\n  The former Vice President with the blood rushing to his face and the \nveins standing out on his neck screeched before a crowd which has been \nrepeated on the television that the President has betrayed this \ncountry. You can disagree with George W. Bush. That is legitimate and \nproper and in an election year expected. But you should not accuse him \nof being a traitor. You should not accuse him of treason.\n  I want to make it clear again that as I disagree with those who are \nattacking the President, I am not attacking their patriotism or their \nlove of this country. But I do disagree with their wisdom and with \ntheir accuracy.\n  In the speeches that have just been given, we have had a lot of \nconversation about what I would consider past history. I am not going \nto get into that; that is, what did we know about weapons of mass \ndestruction? What did the inspectors know? What should we have done \nhere? What should we have interpreted there? I will leave that to the \nhistorians themselves to sort out. A debate on those issues becomes an \nattempt simply to bash the President and avoid the fundamental issue.\n  The fundamental issue that we have to face as Senators, as \npolicymakers, is what do we do now? We are in Iraq whether you voted \nfor the resolution, as Senator Kerry and Senator Edwards did and as I \ndid, or whether you voted against it, as Senator Durbin did. Debating \nthe wisdom of that at this point is merely an exercise in avoiding the \nreality of the situation with which we find ourselves faced now. What \ndo we do now?\n  The large majority of this body along with a large majority of the \nMembers of the House of Representatives, and the unanimous vote in the \nSecurity Council of the United Nations took us to war. What do we do \nnow?\n  That is the fundamental question that we should be addressing and \nthat we should be facing.\n  Oh, say some, no, no. The fundamental question is whether or not \nthere were weapons of mass destruction. And, since there were not, the \nreal question is, Did the President lie?\n  Well, let us look at the situation we are facing now with respect to \nweapons of mass destruction. The question is not are there weapons of \nmass destruction in Iraq and did the President lie? The question is, \nWhat happened to the weapons that everybody knew were in Iraq, and has \nthe President taken proper steps to protect us from them?\n  When I say the weapons that everybody knew were in Iraq, whom do I \ninclude in that? The first person to convince me there were weapons of \nmass destruction in Iraq was Madeleine Albright, Secretary of State to \nPresident Clinton. She met with us here in the secure room of the \nCapitol; the room where we get top secret briefings from the highest \npossible level. It was in that room that Madeleine Albright sat down \nwith the Members of the Senate and laid out the irrefutable evidence \nthat Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and justified to\n\n[[Page S1988]]\n\nus the Clinton administration's determination that they would go to \nwar, and they did.\n  Bombing another country is an act of war, and the Clinton \nadministration, in 1998, in response to the irrefutable evidence that \nSaddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, took the United States \nto war. We did not invade Iraq with troops, but certainly dropping \nbombs in the quantity and regularity with which we dropped them in 1998 \nis an act of war. We did it unilaterally. We did it without consulting \nthe United Nations. We did it without talking to the French or the \nGermans in the way that some of the President's critics say we must. We \ndid it because we knew Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\n  David Kay and his inspectors have been to Iraq, and they say they \ncannot find warehouses full of weapons of mass destruction, which \nraises the fundamental question that most people are not addressing. \nWhat happened to them? Where are they? We know he had them. We went to \nwar to deal with them. What happened to them?\n  I think there are four possible answers to that question.\n  First, one that has been raised by President Clinton himself, we got \nthem all in the bombing. President Clinton said we didn't know how many \nwe got. We could have gotten all of them. We could have gotten none. \nBut we did our best to try to destroy them.\n  One answer to the question of why David Kay was unable to find \nweapons of mass destruction when he got into Iraq with his inspectors \nis the possibility that we got them all in the bombing and had no way \nof knowing that.\n  No. 2, the second possibility raised by David Kay and others is that \nthey were trucked out of the country. They went off the border to Syria \nor someplace else. They are still in existence. They just aren't still \nin Iraq. We don't know the answer to that. But that is a possibility.\n  Possibility No. 3, they were destroyed by Saddam Hussein himself. \nSomeone would ask why would he want to do that. Look at the man. Look \nat what he did. Look at his record. He believed that the United States \nwould, in fact, not invade. We had bombed in the first gulf war. We had \nbombed in 1998. He believed we would bomb again but that we would not \ninvade, or, if we did invade, we would not topple him. After all, we \ndidn't topple him last time.\n  Pressure from the French, pressure from the Germans, said don't go \nahead with this. He could very well have believed that the \ninternational community would put enough pressure on President Bush \nthat the United States ultimately would stop short of removing him, \nparticularly if inspectors from the U.N. got into Iraq and discovered \nthere were no weapons of mass destruction. Therefore, he could have \ndestroyed them himself on the assumption that he would stay in power \nand then, as soon as the inspectors were gone, he could reconstruct his \nweapons program, reestablish weapons of mass destruction, and be right \nback where he was before we took the action in 1998. That is the third \npossibility.\n  The fourth possibility is that they are still there. There is the \npossibility that we haven't been able to find them but they are still \nthere. That is a very serious question, one that is being ignored by \neverybody who is debating the question of whether Bush went to the \nUnited Nations the right way, or whether he said the right things, or \nwhether he read the right intelligence. Those questions are minor \ncompared to the consequences of answering this question.\n  Let me pose it again and go through the four possibilities and give \nyou my answer.\n  What happened to the weapons of mass destruction that everybody in \nthe world knew he had? We destroyed them in the bombing, or they were \ntaken over the border to someplace else, or Saddam Hussein himself \ndestroyed them in order to fool the inspectors, or they are still \nthere.\n  My answer is I believe all four. I believe we destroyed some in the \nbombing. I believe some got over the border. I believe he dismantled \nsome of his programs, and I believe there are some still to be found.\n  That means, if I am right, there is work to be done to help make the \nworld safer that is not being done while we are being distracted by an \nirrelevant debate that is best left to historians.\n  There is possibly still a threat out there that we are not addressing \nbecause we are paying so much attention to the questions of what kind \nof intelligence did he read and did he have the right 16 words in the \nState of the Union Message. We waste our time on that when we are \nfacing this far more serious and obvious question.\n  What happened to the weapons that we knew he had? We should not rest \neasy until we have an answer to that question.\n  Which of the four or combination of the four possibilities really \napplies? The real question we are facing as we look ahead to November--\nand make no mistake, this debate is all about looking ahead to \nNovember--is what will the United States do after the Presidential \nelection is over?\n  How will we proceed in Iraq once the determination has been made as \nto who will control our foreign policy for the next 4 years? That is \nthe fundamental question the American voters need to be debating. That \nis the question they need to pay attention to as they make up their \nminds as to whom they will support in this election.\n  The choice is fairly clear. We can only guess about the future, but \nthe best indication of the future lies in the actions of the past. \nPresident Bush has made it pretty clear what the future would be with \nrespect to Iraq if he prevails in November. President Bush has made it \nclear if he prevails in November, we will stay the course in Iraq. We \nwill stay in Iraq until we have succeeded in our goal, which is to \nplant in Iraq a self-governing, westward-looking, open society where \nprivate property rights are respected, where the rights of individuals \nto vote and control their destiny are preserved, and where free market \nprinciples will prevail; an Iraq that will stand as an example to the \nrest of the Middle East that freedom, democracy and capitalism can \nindeed thrive there. President Bush is an optimist who believes those \nthings are so fundamental in the human spirit that they can survive in \nan Islamic background.\n  There are pessimists around who say no, the Muslims can never live in \ndemocracy. The Muslims can never live in freedom. President Bush is an \noptimist who says, I don't believe that--without trying to change their \nreligion or attack their culture. I believe they will respond to \nfreedom and the Americans will stay there until we have achieved the \ngoal of planting freedom there.\n  That is the answer to the question of what will happen in Iraq if \nGeorge W. Bush wins this election. That is an easy answer to give \nbecause his past resolve and his past determination have been very \nclear.\n  The second question, of course, is what will happen in Iraq if \nPresident Bush loses the election and we get a new steward in charge of \nour foreign affairs. That question is a little harder to answer because \nwe do not have as clear a track record. On the assumption that the \njunior Senator from Massachusetts will become the President if \nPresident Bush loses the election, we do have the signposts indicating \nwhat he would do if he inherited the situation we now have. He said on \n``Face the Nation,'' the first thing he would do is go to the United \nNations and apologize. I am not quite sure for what he would apologize, \nbut he has indicated the first thing he would do is to go to the United \nNations and apologize.\n  If I may quote the columnist for the New York Times, Tom Friedman, \nwho spoke to a group in Europe. They turned to him after the weapons of \nmass destruction question arose and asked, Are you now prepared to \napologize for your defense of Bush and your support for this war? He \nsaid something like this: Well, let me see. We have removed Saddam \nHussein, one of the most brutal dictators of the world, found in the \nprocess that he had slaughtered at least 300,000 of his own people whom \nhe had buried in mass graves. We know he is responsible for a million \nmore deaths in the two wars he started with his neighbors over the last \n12 years. We know he supported terrorism, down to the detail of paying \n$25,000 to anyone who would wrap himself in dynamite and blow himself \nup just so long as he could take another human being with him, and that \nhe\n\n[[Page S1989]]\n\nkept his people in absolute degradation and subjugation for 38 years. \nNow he is gone with his torture chambers and his secret police and his \nbrutality, and I am supposed to apologize for that?\n  I am not quite sure what Senator Kerry might say to the U.N. when he \ngoes to apologize, but apparently what he will say, as I try to gather \nfrom the speeches he has given, is the United States should no longer \nact unilaterally, that we should get international support before we go \nforward in an event like this, and presumably he would then say to the \nU.N. we are where we are, the responsibility now of building the kind \nof Iraq George W. Bush envisioned--I give Senator Kerry the credit of \nassuming he is in favor of that kind of Iraq--the responsibility for \nbuilding that kind of Iraq now lies with you, United Nations. We in \nAmerica are going to show a little humility--that is another word he \nused--show a little humility on this issue and turn it over to you and \nlet you take over the responsibility of producing the results we all \nwant in Iraq.\n\n  If that is, indeed, his program--and I assume we will find that out \nas the election goes forward--I make these observations. Number one, \nthe United Nations has no force with which it can provide security to \nthe Iraqis. There is no United Nations army. There is no United Nations \npolice force. There are no United Nations federal marshals or any other \nkind of enforcement facility you might think of. The only force the \nUnited Nations can ever use is the force that would be provided to it \nby its member states. The United Nations can pass resolutions, the \nUnited Nations can threaten people, but the threats carry no force \nunless the member states of the United Nations respond to the U.N. \nresolutions and can go forward.\n  That is the point President Bush made when he spoke to the United \nNations and said to them, if you won't enforce your resolutions, we \nwill. I don't think we need to apologize to the United Nations for \nenforcing their resolution 1441 that passed by a unanimous vote in the \nSecurity Council and which David Kay has now said Saddam Hussein was in \ncomplete violation of. That is something we should remember as we have \nthis debate.\n  The history is not all that comforting to me. Koffi Annan sent a \ngroup of U.N. folk into Iraq to help with the nation building and here \nis the series of events that occurred. The head of the U.N. mission \nshowed up and took possession of a building where he was going to \noperate. The Americans showed up and put their armored vehicles around \nthe building. He came out and said, No, that is too militaristic. You \nAmericans are too quick to show force. We are the United Nations. We \ncome in peace. Get rid of the armored vehicles.\n  The American commander, after arguing with this fellow, said all \nright, and he got rid of the armored vehicles, but he spread concertina \nwire through the courtyard, and the U.N. head of the group came out and \nsaid, get rid of that. You are too militaristic. We are the United \nNations. We are not the United States. We are not here to show military \nforce. We are here to help build the country.\n  Finally, the Americans took away the concertina wire and the next day \na truck bomb drove across the courtyard, blew up the building and \nkilled the man who had said, I don't need this kind of protection. \nAfter this, Koffi Annan said, get them out of there. We can't provide \ntheir security. We can't keep them safe.\n  I welcome the United Nations involvement. I hope we get the United \nNations involvement, but I don't think that track record speaks very \nwell for the idea that the first thing we should do about dealing with \nthe problem in Iraq is to go to the United Nations and show some \nhumility and apologize. The number one civil right which all of us \ndesire more than anything else and that is most essential in Iraq is \nthe right to walk down the street without being shot, the right to walk \nout in public without being beaten over the head. To establish security \nis the first responsibility of civilization. Security in Iraq is being \nprovided by the American military and its allies in the Iraqi forces.\n\n  George W. Bush, for all of the mistakes that have been made, and all \nof the difficulties that have been encountered, has demonstrated \nAmerica's resolve to provide this civil right to Iraqis. The United \nNations has fallen short in this category.\n  This is the fundamental question all of us should look at: Instead of \ndebating whether the President looked at the right piece of \nintelligence, whether the committees had the right information, whether \nthis or that or the other was looked at and was not, the real question \nis, where do we go from here. We are where we are, regardless of how we \ngot here. Where do we go from here--the question the American people \nwill decide in November.\n  I close with this anecdote or comment from Bernard Lewis. Bernard \nLewis probably knows more about this region than any other academic in \nAmerica. He has spent more time studying it, and has written books on \nit. He spoke to a group of us, and he was an optimist. He agreed with \nPresident Bush that democracy could be planted in the region and we \nshould stay the course until we do it. He made this comment. He said: \nListen to the jokes. In the Middle East, the only form of expression \nthat is not censored is the jokes. And this is the joke that is going \naround in Iran, right next to Iraq. Two Iranians are talking. The first \nIranian is complaining about how bad the government is, how bad things \nare. The second Iranian says: Yeah. They go back and forth, saying: \nWhat are we going to do? Where are we going to turn? Finally, the \nsecond Iranian says: I know. What we need is an Osama bin Laden. The \nfirst Iranian says: Are you crazy? That would make things that much \nworse, and the second Iranian says: Nope. If we had an Osama bin Laden, \nthen the Americans would come and save us.\n  There are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people in the \nMiddle East who are watching what we are doing in Iraq in the hope \nthat, in the words of the joke, the Americans will ``come and save \nus.''\n  We have set our hand to the plow to that particular assignment. We \nshould not turn back now. We should back our President and his resolve \nto see this through until freedom, prosperity, and self-determination \nare established in Iraq, from which it will then spread, change the \nMiddle East, and ultimately transform the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for an \nincredibly fine speech. I appreciate the remarks he gave tonight very \nmuch, and I am sure the President does, as well.\n  At this time, I yield to the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \nyielding, as well as for his leadership on this issue. He has provided \nstrong and forceful leadership in support of the war on terrorism. It \nis vitally important that all of us, not just as Members of the Senate, \nbut as Americans, support this administration and support our troops in \nmaking sure we win this war on terrorism.\n  I would like to start by saying I have spent the last 3 years working \non intelligence issues, first in the House and now in the Senate \nIntelligence Committees, and have learned some things that are very \nrelevant to this discussion.\n  First, many across the aisle supported massive cuts to the \nintelligence community budget throughout the 1990s. Between 1992 and \n1998, in fact, the Central Intelligence Agency closed one-third of its \noverseas field stations, lost one-quarter of its clandestine service \ncase officers, lost 40 percent of its recruited spies, and CIA \nintelligence reports declined by nearly one-half.\n  The Clinton administration, supported by many Democrats in this \nChamber today, decided from the outset that the end of the cold war \nmeant we no longer needed intelligence on national security threats. \nThe end of the cold war divide in actual fact made the world a much \nmore complex place, with a host of new, unconventional, and asymmetric \nthreats to our security we were not well prepared to address. Instead \nof dismantling our intelligence apparatus in the 1990s, recent history \nhas proved beyond a shadow of doubt we should have been expanding and \nenhancing the quality of those capabilities so we could better \nunderstand and\n\n[[Page S1990]]\n\ncounter the new nature of the threat. The record will show many on our \nside of the aisle were making this very point throughout the 1990s.\n  It is absurd to argue, as some in the other party appear to have \nsuggested over the years, that by emasculating the CIA and our other \nintelligence agencies, our Nation's security would not be affected, or \neven would be enhanced.\n  I would just add that penetrating terrorist groups and rogue states, \nso-called hard targets, is a difficult and dangerous business. It \nrequires a robust overseas intelligence presence, adequate and \nsustained resources, a wide-ranging stable of recruited and vetted \nspies, strong bipartisan support from Congress and the White House, and \na willingness to take calculated risks. I submit the facts of the 1990s \nstrongly suggest we had none of these.\n  In addition, it is apparent to me the intelligence community during \nthe 1990s was skewed far too heavily in favor of technical collection \nof intelligence over what is the cornerstone of the business: human \nintelligence gathering or HUMINT, i.e., using spies to acquire \ninformation on the plans and intentions of our adversaries.\n  When my House Intelligence Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland \nSecurity took a hard look at the erosion of our intelligence \ncapabilities in the 1990s, right after 9/11, it became clear to me our \nhuman spies were almost considered to be obsolete by the Clinton \nadministration and its appointed intelligence community leadership.\n  When David Kay spoke about his experiences searching for WMD in Iraq \non the ``Jim Lehrer News Hour'' last month, he said:\n\n       We are not very good as a nation in our intelligence \n     capability at reading the most fundamental secrets of a \n     society, what are its capabilities, what are its intentions? \n     We can't photograph those. You need Americans on the ground \n     penetrating those societies and people who are speaking their \n     languages.\n\n  I fully agree with Dr. Kay, and would just note it takes a long time \nand a great deal of effort to build such human espionage capabilities. \nYet our colleagues across the aisle proved in the 1990s that such \ncapabilities, however imperfect, could be torn down quickly and with \nease.\n  In July of 1997, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, over in the House, \nsaid:\n\n       I think the day for the CIA has come and gone.\n\n  I cite the Congressional Record, dated July 9, 1997. In that same \ndebate, then-Congressman David Bonior commented:\n\n       [W]e are spending, according to the New York Times, over \n     $30 billion on intelligence, and the cold war is what? Nine \n     years, seven years, eight years over with?\n\n  I cite again the Congressional Record, dated July 9, 1997. That same \nyear, here in the Senate, the junior Senator from Massachusetts \nquestioned: ``Why is it that our vast intelligence apparatus continues \nto grow . . .'' now that the cold war struggle is over?\n  I cite the Congressional Record, dated May 1, 1997. Two years before \nthat, the same Senator proposed we cut the intelligence budget by $1.5 \nbillion, not for specific programs but across the board. In 1994, that \nsame Senator wanted to cut the intelligence budget by $1 billion and to \nfreeze intelligence spending. That is the record.\n  Now, it is going to be awfully hard for certain individuals in the \nother party to justify their actions on national security matters \nduring the near decade-long period of neglect and erosion of our \nintelligence capabilities of which they were directly complicit. It is \nstunning--although not surprising--that such individuals are now \nseeking to rewrite their own history.\n  I add that the junior Senator from Massachusetts in 1995 proposed to \ncut $1.5 billion from the intelligence community. That bill he \nintroduced would have exacted cuts of $300 million in each of the \nfiscal years 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, and again in the year 2000. The \nproposal was so out of line with reality that there were no cosponsors \non the bill and, thank goodness, it never made it to the floor.\n  I ask the question, Why is it that an atmosphere of extreme risk \naversion pervaded the intelligence community during the 1990s and lasts \neven to the present day in some respects?\n  There are two particular events that bother me. First, when I chaired \nthe House Intelligence Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security \nin 2001 and 2002, I was particularly struck by the internal CIA \nguidelines promulgated in 1995 by then-Director of CIA, John Deutch, \nthat severely limited the ability of CIA case officers to meet with, \ndevelop, and recruit foreign nationals who may have been involved in \ndubious activities or have blood on their hands.\n  We found, through extensive oversight work and dialog with CIA field \nofficers, that these so-called Deutch guidelines had a significant \nchilling effect on our ability to operate against terrorist and rogue \nstate ``hard targets.'' After all, how can one penetrate a terrorist \norganization or Saddam's brutal regime, for that matter, without \ndealing with unsavory people?\n  The guidelines were, in my view, a primary cause of the risk aversion \nto which I refer in my question, and they actually stayed in effect \nthrough July of 2002, when we finally succeeded after many efforts to \ncompel the DCI to repeal them.\n  The second event concerns Mr. Deutch's decision during his mercifully \nshort tenure as DCI to conduct a CIA-wide ``asset scrub,'' which \napplied an inflexible reporting standard to all CIA spies that, if not \nmet, resulted in their automatic firing.\n  The fact is, the spying business is a lot different than a simple \ncalculation of profit and loss. Spies are human beings who put their \nlives on the line to spy for us. We have a special responsibility to \nthem and their families. Just because a spy's access may have dried up \nfor a time, that doesn't mean they won't prove useful later on on other \nissues. Moreover, since we have had many gaps in our clandestine \ncoverage of key issues at the time of the scrub, termination of spies \nwas done without regard to how we might otherwise cover a subject by \nother means. Thus, our gaps were further exacerbated.\n  In my opinion, the Deutch guidelines and Deutch asset scrub are two \nof the major driving forces behind the risk aversion to which I \nreferred in my question.\n  Mr. President, that is a direct byproduct of those years of neglect \nand resource starvation during the previous administration.\n  I want to first make it clear that it has been my experience that the \nstifling problem of risk aversion went from Washington to the field, \nand not vice versa. I know that the young, often idealistic, aggressive \nCIA case officers out on the front lines are not the problem.\n\n  Risk aversion starts when elected officials, on whose support CIA \ndepends in the face of failure as well as success, abandons the \ndiscipline. The ``end of the cold war'' and ``peace dividend'' type \narguments of those in the other party during the 1990s clearly \nmanifested themselves in the form of political abandonment of our \nintelligence community.\n  During those years of Democratic control of Congress, Hill support \nfor the intelligence mission was also questionable. I refer back to my \nprevious remarks about what the junior Senator from Massachusetts and \nothers tried to do to further reduce the intelligence community during \nthe 1990s as a case in point.\n  Moreover, the record will clearly show that during the periods of \nRepublican control of the House and Senate, significant efforts were \nmade to increase the top line of President Clinton's annual \nintelligence budget requests. Some of these Republican efforts were \nsuccessful; others were not. But for the most part, we brought the \nprevious administration along kicking and screaming.\n  It should not be surprising that when the politicians turn their back \non the intelligence community, politically appointed intelligence \nseniors start to become more reluctant to approve operations that might \nresult in some sort of political flap because they know they won't be \nsupported.\n  When such intelligence seniors start to become overly conservative, \nthe managers below them follow suit. After a while, bureaucratic \nobstacles, and other hoops through which field officers must jump \nbefore getting operations approved, start to appear. That is where you \nget the Deutch guidelines and the Deutch asset scrub.\n\n[[Page S1991]]\n\n  Now we have to figure out how to undo the bureaucratic risk averse \nmindset that has taken a decade to spread across the intelligence \ncommunity like a cancer and, like a cancer, radical treatment with \noften painful side effects may very well be required.\n  That is what happens when national security becomes relegated to the \nbottom of our Nation's priorities. Fortunately, we have a President now \nwho is anything but risk averse and who puts the long-term security \ninterests and safety of all Americans at the top of his list of \npriorities.\n  On the issue of terrorism and homeland security, Americans deserve \nstrong leadership, not political games. Our President is providing the \npositive leadership that will ensure the safety of our citizens.\n  I yield back to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I very much appreciate those remarks coming \nfrom a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  I now will yield to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for his \nleadership on this important matter. I feel very strongly that our \ncountry is not fully aware--at least the public debate on the \ntelevision and so forth have not shown a full awareness of the \nleadership that President Bush has given this country to help us deal \nwith the challenges facing us.\n  I thank Senator Chambliss for his comments about the intelligence-\ngathering functions. I wish to share some of my insights into where we \nare and where we can expect to be going.\n  After 9/11, the President of the United States was a challenged \nleader. He faced difficult times. We lost 3,000 people. Some decisions \nhad to be made. He decided that business as usual would not continue \nand the United States was going to have to take a leadership role \nagainst terrorism.\n  About that time, former Secretary of Defense and former Secretary of \nEnergy, James Schlesinger, who served in President Carter's Cabinet, \ntestified before our Armed Services Committee, of which the Chair is a \nmember. Mr. Schlesinger talked about the U.N. and its inability to make \ndecisions and take action. He referred, quoting another writer, to the \nUN as being ``an institution given only to talk.''\n  Well, in the last decade, before President Bush took office, during \nthe 8 years under President Clinton's leadership, we did a lot of \ntalking about the problems facing the world. We did a lot of talking \nabout Iraq. We passed a resolution in this body that declared it to be \nthe policy of the United States to effect a regime change in Iraq. \nPresident Clinton signed it but we didn't do anything. We talked but we \ndidn't do anything.\n  We now have a President who decided that we need to show some courage \nand leadership, and he did that. One of the first things he did, and I \nask the American people to recall, was that he confronted a great \ncountry, Pakistan. Pakistan's intelligence agencies, Senator Kyl knows \nas a senior member of the Intelligence Committee, were collaborating \nwith the Taliban government in Afghanistan. Everybody knew that and \nthat there was a lot of partnership there. We now know they were \nparticipating in the proliferation of nuclear weapons. President Bush \nchallenged them and he said: President Musharraf, you have to choose. \nThis is very serious. Are you going to allow Pakistan to be a country \nassociated with the Taliban and terrorism, or are you going to stand \nyour country in the future against that kind of activity?\n  To his credit, President Musharraf made a decision. It was not \nacademic. It was not talk. It was: Mr. Musharraf, you must make a \ndecision.\n  Since that time, he has been helpful to us in many ways, at risk of \nhis own life. His opponents have attempted to assassinate him. Would \nanybody suggest that had our President been weak and waffling and \nvacillating, that the President of Pakistan would have made that \ndecision, would he have put his very life on the line against \nterrorism?\n  Then he made the same challenge to Mullah Omar in Afghanistan where, \nas you remember, Bin Laden was training his terrorist soldiers. He \nsaid: You must reject that; you must turn against the al-Qaida; you \nmust turn to your country; and you must choose. Mullah Omar chose. He \nchose to remain friends with Bin Laden and al-Qaida terrorist groups. \nHe chose not to side with the nations who turned against terrorism.\n  Mullah Omar, I suppose, is hiding in some cave somewhere in \nAfghanistan. His government is completely gone. Yes, Bin Laden, who was \nin his country, attacked and damaged our Pentagon, and killed our \nsoldiers right out here at the Pentagon. But his pentagon no longer \nexists. It is rubble. And there is a new government with a new \nconstitution in the works to preside over a new Afghanistan where women \nhave a chance to have freedom and prosperity; when I was there I saw \nthat the people are re-building all over that country. Houses that had \nbeen destroyed are being refurbished, and people seemed to be making \nreal progress there. That is such a tremendous step forward for the \nworld.\n  Then the challenge was placed before Saddam Hussein. We had the U.N. \ntry to find these weapons. We know he used these kinds of weapons. We \nknow he was not complying with the U.N. resolutions. The U.N. found him \nin violation of those resolutions and voted in 1441 that he was in \nviolation of the resolutions. We gave him every chance to renounce \nweapons of mass destruction, and to demonstrate that he had complied \nwith multiple U.N resolutions. Because he lost the first gulf war he \nmade a commitment to eliminate these kinds of weapons and to comply \nwith U.N. resolutions, but he refused to do so. And President Bush \nacted.\n  Saddam Hussein was dug out of a hole in the ground and is now in the \nBastille where he used to put his people and kill them. But he is not \ngoing to be killed. He will be given a fair trial.\n  The people of Iraq are forming a new government. Production is up. \nElectricity production is up. I know the chief of police there, and \nthere are 70,000 new police officers, some of them being killed this \nday, but they are standing firmly for freedom in a new Iraq.\n  Lo and behold, after we dug Saddam Hussein out of the ground, Muammar \nQadhafi of Libya, known as one of the world's most significant \nterrorists in the past, renounced his terrorism and called for the \nUnited States and Great Britain--he did not talk to the U.N., but he \nwanted us to be involved in his renunciation of terrorism and he has \nallowed inspections.\n  During the former administration--and I am not criticizing, but I was \nfrustrated--when President Clinton was in office, we talked all the \ntime about nuclear proliferation but accomplished little. But only \nrecently, we had Abdul Khan, the chief nuclear scientist in Pakistan \ncome forward. What did he say? He said he was proliferating weapons \nfrom Pakistan to North Korea to Iraq to Libya and to Iraq. That had \nbeen going on but it is not going on now because he has renounced it \nand told all that he had done to the world.\n\n  Iran is now allowing the United Nations to come in and inspect their \nnuclear program. The nations in the East--China, Japan, and South \nKorea--are confronting North Korea. We are not going to keep rewarding \nNorth Korea for bad activity, as has been done in the past. We are \ngoing to insist they step up like these other nations and assume a \nplace among the decent nations in the world, or they are not going to \nget any benefits from us. We are going to keep the pressure on, and \nthat is exactly the right thing for us to do.\n  These events have occurred for one reason and one reason only: We \nhave a President of the United States who loves this country, who \nbelieves in our values. He believes in freedom. He believes in \ndemocracy. He wants to see the world be a better place. He does not \nwant to just preside over the office of President. He wants to do \nsomething good for this world, and he is doing it.\n  As a direct result of his leadership, we made extraordinary progress \nin just 2 years, progress not seen in decades.\n  It has been tough. Our soldiers are at risk, and they are putting \ntheir lives at risk every day to effect a policy that those of us in \nthis Senate voted for by an overwhelming vote. Some of them voted for \nit and then turned around and voted not to support our troops. But most \nof the Senators here, Republicans and Democrats, have stayed. Yes, we \nhave had complaints, but when has there ever been a war when everything \nhas gone perfectly smoothly?\n\n[[Page S1992]]\n\n  I urge the Members of this body, my Senate colleagues, to look at \nwhat has occurred, to recognize that we are seeing the benefits of \nextraordinary and courageous leadership. When they do so, we shall hear \nless carping, less complaining, less whining, and less second-guessing \nthan we have heard. We are making progress. We are going to continue to \nmake progress. We are going to make this world a better place and safer \nplace for the people of the United States.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me summarize what I think has been \nestablished during the last couple of hours. The reason we took to the \nfloor is because there has been a lot of criticism of the President of \nthe United States and the administration for its actions in finally \ndeciding that enough was enough with Saddam Hussein, that his continual \nviolation of the U.N. resolutions had to be enforced by someone, and \nthat before there was an imminent threat posed by his dangerous regime, \nit was important for the United States and a coalition of other \ncountries to take action to remove him.\n  The criticism has come both from potential Democratic nominees for \nPresident, Members of this body, news organizations, and others outside \nthe body, but we sought to try to put into perspective some of these \ncriticisms and to point out that at the end of the day, there should be \nno question that President Bush did the right thing.\n  The three key points were, first, that an intelligence failure is not \nthe same thing as intelligence misuse or misleading, and if there was a \nfailure because the intelligence agencies were wrong about the \nstockpiles of weapons of mass destruction that they thought existed and \nwhich we have not been able to find, it is not the same thing as saying \nthat the President misled anyone or that anyone else with access to \nintelligence misled anyone.\n  The second point was that whatever the state of intelligence, the \ncase for removing Saddam Hussein is still very strong, a point which \nseveral of our colleagues have made repeatedly on both sides of the \naisle, as well as President Clinton and other members of his \nadministration prior to the Bush administration.\n  And, third, that the question regarding the weapons of mass \ndestruction, the stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons is not a \nmatter of whether they existed but what happened to them; that everyone \nwho had access to the intelligence was convinced they existed.\n  In fact, we know they existed at least one time because they were \nused against the Kurds and against the Iranians. Saddam Hussein \nhimself, in submitting documents to the United Nations, admitted they \nexisted. This was, I believe, either 1996 or 1998 and then again in the \nyear 2002. So we had his admission that they existed. As Senator \nBennett said a while ago, nobody knows whether they were destroyed, \nshipped someplace else, or whether we destroyed them, but eventually we \nwill find out the answers to those questions.\n  The fact we cannot find those weapons of mass destruction \nstockpiles--primarily artillery shells with chemical munitions--does \nnot detract at all from the case against Saddam Hussein or make the \ncase that somehow or another the American people were somehow misled by \nthe President.\n  In closing, I will quote from the chairman of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee and the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. \nWhat the current ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee \nhad to say is: As the attacks of September 11 demonstrated, the immense \ndestructiveness of modern technology means we can no longer afford to \nwait around for a smoking gun. I do believe that Iraq poses an imminent \nthreat, but I also believe after September 11 that question is \nincreasingly outdated. It is in the nature of these weapons and the way \nthey are targeted against civilian populations that documented \ncapability and demonstrated intent may be the only warning we get. To \ninsist on further evidence would put some of our fellow Americans at \nrisk. Can we afford to take that chance? We cannot.\n  The ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee is the junior \nSenator from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller. These were his comments on \nOctober 10, 2002. Yet today we find some saying the President contended \nthere was an imminent threat, when he did not, and that we should not \nhave acted unless, in fact, there was an imminent threat.\n  I think Senator Rockefeller was correct, and I know he has access to \nall of the intelligence because, of course, he is the ranking member of \nthe Intelligence Committee.\n  Now I will read from the chairman of the Intelligence Committee: I \nhave seen enough evidence. I do not know if I have seen all the \nevidence, but I have seen enough to be satisfied that there has been a \ncontinuing effort by Saddam Hussein, since the end of the gulf war, \nparticularly since 1998, to reestablish and enhance Iraq's capacity of \nweapons of mass destruction, chemical, biological, and nuclear.\n  That was the immediate past chairman of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, the senior Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham. He, too, had \naccess to all of the intelligence.\n  My point in quoting my two colleagues is that in the Senate, those of \nus on the Intelligence Committee had access to the same intelligence \nthe President did, at least similar intelligence to what other \ncountries in the world had, and all of us, including the United States, \nbelieved these things. We had the same intelligence that was given to \nthe President.\n  We were not misleading anyone. The President obviously was not \nmisleading anyone. The fact that it turns out some of the intelligence \nturned out not to be totally correct is not the same thing as saying \nsomebody misused the intelligence. I hope my colleagues on the other \nside do not cross that line of accusing the President of intentionally \nmisleading the American people because to do so, in effect, would be \nalso to accuse our own colleagues of that very same thing. I do not \nbelieve, based upon what I know of my colleagues, that that could be \nsaid of any one of them. So I hope we can get over this notion that \njust because not all the intelligence was correct, therefore, it must \nmean somebody was misleading someone else. I think we have established \nthat is not true and that it would be very wrong to try to pursue that \nline of attack against President Bush simply because we happen to be in \nan election year.\n  We will have more to say on this subject in the future, but I want my \ncolleagues to understand that if there are charges made against the \nPresident or against this administration relating to the use of \nintelligence with respect to the war in Iraq, those charges will be \nrebutted. I appreciate very much the attention of my colleagues to this \nmatter this evening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/02/senate-section/article/S1992-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1992-S1993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THAI POLICY TOWARD BURMA: PRINCIPLED OR FOR PROFIT?\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, freedom in Burma \nhas long been under siege by a military junta calling itself the State \nPeace and Department Council (SPDC). In response to last year's brutal \nassault against the supporters of the National League for Democracy \nNLD, and its leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Congress quickly passed--and \nthe President signed into law--the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of \n2003.\n  This was an appropriate response to an act of Terrorism orchestrated \nand carried out buy the SPDC and its affiliated organizations.\n  Last week, the State Department issued its annual human rights \nreport, and the section on Burma evidences egregious and systematic \nhuman rights abuses. Let me read one excerpt from that report:\n\n     [the SPDC's] extremely poor human rights record worsened, and \n     it continued to commit numerous serious abuses. Citizens \n     still did not have the right to change their government. \n     Security forces continued to commit extrajudical killings and \n     rape, forcibly relocate persons, use forced labor, conscript \n     child soldiers, and reestablished forced conscription of the \n     civilian population into militia units.\n\n  Murder, rape, forced labor, child soldiers . . . this is a sobering \nreminder of how egregious and extreme human rights violations are in \nBurma.\n  While many in Burma's neighborhood raised concerns with the situation \nin that country, including Malaysia and\n\n[[Page S1993]]\n\nIndonesia, Thailand--led by Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra--seemed \nkeen on letting the wind out of sanction sails at every opportunity. \nThis strikes me as odd behavior given Thailand's processed commitment \nto democracy and human rights.\n  Where others speak out to demand concrete actions from the SPDC, \nincluding the unconditional and immediate release of Suu Kyi and her \ncompatriots, Thaksin has repeatedly risen to defend those who Secretary \nPowell referred to as ``murderous thugs''.\n  Last year, he initiated an international forum on Burma self-dubbed \nthe ``Bangkok Process'' that did not include the NLD, the United \nStates, or other proven champions of freedom. However, it did include \nthe SPDC, and was described the Thaksin as a meeting of the ``like \nminded.'' The ``Bangkok Process'' is fundamentally flawed by the very \nabsence of Suu Kyi and her supporters at the table. Tellingly, they \nremain under arrest and detention in Burma.\n  I agree with Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen that ``all \nvoices in the country had to be heard and opposition leader Aung San \nSuu Kyi must be released.'' In stark contrast, Thaksin recently stated, \n``Burma is on the right track. . . . If they follow our \nrecommendations, they will be okay and get everything done.''\n\n  With narcotics, HIV/AIDS and other undesirable exports pouring across \nBurma's borders into Thailand, it is only fair to question Thaksin's \nmotivations in his cozy relationship with the SPDC. Some suspect that \nthe raison d'etre can be summed up in a single word: iPSTAR.\n  iPSTAR is a $350 million broadband satellite owned by Shin Satellite, \nSattel, and Shin Corporation, a holding company created by the Prime \nMinister that owns 53 percent of Sattel. If successfully launched and \noperational, the satellite will beam its signal across Asia.\n  To convince doubting Thomases who suspect that Thailand's approach to \nBurma may be based on selfish profit--not principle--Thaksin should \nanswer the following single question:\n  What investments, including projects and activities related to \niPSTAR, do Shin Satellite and Shin Corporation have in Burma, and/or \nhave planned for Burma?\n  I intend to pose this same question to Secretary of State Colin \nPowell when he appears before the Foreign Operations Subcommittee next \nmonth.\n  Let me close by saying that many of us remain concerned with the \ncontinued deterioration of democratic institutions in Thailand--\nincluding a free and independent press. We are alarmed and distressed \nby continued reports of the deportation of as many as 10,000 Burmese \nrefugees, exiles, and migrant workers from Thailand to Burma each \nmonth. My colleagues can find additional information on this matter in \na February 25th article by Ellen Nakashima in the Washington Post and \nthrough Human Rights Watch's report ``Out of Sight, Out of Mind: Thai \nPolicy Toward Burmese Refugees and Migrants.''\n  With rising tensions in the south, it is more important that ever \nthat Thailand stay the course in its political and legal development.\n  I am sure my colleagues will agree that accountability and \ntransparency must be maintained in Thailand, be it a crackdown on drugs \nor business with Burma. As the last few weeks have clearly \ndemonstrated, Thai politicians are quick to promise a chicken in every \npot--but sometimes chickens get the flu. I say this only to illustrate \nmy hopes that Prime Minister Thaksin has prepared an alternative \napproach toward Burma and the SPDC that includes the full participation \nand input of Suu Kyi and the NLD as well as all ethnic nationalities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks an article from \nThailand's English language newspaper The Nation be printed in the \nRecord. Thaksin has it wrong--the United States is not a ``useless \nfriend'' to Thailand. On the contrary, America is a strong advocate of \ndemocracy and human rights throughout the region.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From The Nation, Feb. 28, 2004]\n\n       Reaction to US Rights Report: ``You're a Useless Friend''\n\n       Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra yesterday slammed the \n     United States as a ``useless friend'' for issuing a damning \n     report on the deterioration of human rights here. ``It's \n     unacceptable to me the way the US came out with the report by \n     citing media reports. What kind of friend are they?'' a \n     fuming Thaksin said. ``Once every year, the US comes out and \n     damages the reputation of its friend. What would they do if \n     Thailand issued the same [kind of] report?'' Thaksin told \n     reporters that although Thailand has been in discussions with \n     the US on the human rights situation here the US produced a \n     report that differed from the information Thailand supplied.\n       The US State Department yesterday released its annual \n     country-by-country review of human rights. Thailand's record \n     ``worsened'' last year as a result of the extra-judicial \n     killings and arbitrary arrests during the first round of the \n     war on drugs, from February to April, the report said. ``I \n     have to say bluntly that it [the US report] really annoyed \n     me. I have asked the Foreign Ministry to issue a statement,'' \n     Thaksin said.\n       The Foreign Ministry ``invited'' US Ambassador Darryl \n     Johnson to receive an official complaint. Foreign Minister \n     Surakiart Sathirathai said: ``It has been like this for at \n     least three times during my time [as foreign minister]. We \n     feel that it is something that is not healthy for close \n     allies like the US and Thailand.'' In what appeared to be an \n     attempt by the ministry to maximize media coverage of the \n     summoning of Johnson, photographers were asked to position \n     themselves in what is usually an off-limits area. The \n     ministry issued a statement on Thursday expressing its ``deep \n     disappointment'' over the report, saying it contained \n     ``serious inaccuracies''--particularly on the government's \n     anti-drugs campaign--and overstated the toll from summary \n     killings.\n       ``The report does not provide a balanced account of the \n     facts, even though the Thai government has gone to great \n     lengths to provide all the information to the US side,'' the \n     statement read. This was also the case for the reports in \n     2002 and 2001, when Thailand had to pinpoint various factual \n     errors and the US apologized and admitted that the reports \n     were done in haste, Surakiart claimed. Such a report is \n     ``useless'' for the governments as well as the public and it \n     needs to be corrected, he added. Johnson, who met with Deputy \n     Foreign Permanent Secretary Veerasak Futrakul, declined to \n     make any statement.\n       Ministry spokesman Sihasak Phuangketkeow, however, quoted \n     Johnson as saying: ``The US generally views Thailand's human \n     rights record in a positive light, whether it is about \n     economic or political freedom.'' Sihasak submitted a memo to \n     Johnson claiming that only 46 cases of extra-judicial \n     killings were recorded and the 1,386 drug-related deaths \n     cited in the US report were not extra-judicial executions. He \n     also dismissed the allegation that the government would not \n     allow the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \n     to make a visit to look into the matter. ``A request has \n     never been made,'' he said. According to National Police \n     figures released in December, only nine cases out of 1,176 \n     drug-related deaths have been prosecuted.\n       The drug killings sparked an outcry from local and \n     international human rights organizations. Foreign governments \n     and the UN Human Rights Commissioner expressed grave concern \n     about the murders, while His Majesty the King called on the \n     government to give a detailed accounting for all the deaths. \n     The Thai government had ``failed to investigate and prosecute \n     vigorously those who committed such abuses, contributing to a \n     climate of impunity,'' the US report said.\n       After Thaksin's visit to Washington last June, bilateral \n     relations strengthened as Thailand agreed to dispatch troops \n     to Iraq and offered Americans immunity from the International \n     Criminal Court. Thailand signed the ICC treaty but has not \n     yet ratified it. Last December, US President George W. Bush \n     officially designate Thailand a major non-Nato ally, a move \n     that boosted security cooperation between the two countries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/02/senate-section/article/S1993-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1993-S1994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK'S 132ND ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to note that as \nof yesterday, the priceless treasure we call Yellowstone National Park \nhas been preserved and protected for 132 years.\n  Yellowstone was our first national park, and one visit there explains \nwhy.\n  It is home to majestic wildlife including bison, elk, wolves and \ngrizzly bears.\n  It is the site of most of the world's geysers, including the famous \nOld Faithful.\n  And Yellowstone National Park offers breathtaking vistas at every \nturn, from raging rivers to soaring mountain peaks.\n  Before Yellowstone became a national park, the story of its discovery \nwas scattered with myths and truths throughout the 19th century.\n  Explorers and trappers stumbled upon Yellowstone's incredible beauty, \nand returned home with descriptions that sounded like fiction to the \nAmerican public.\n\n[[Page S1994]]\n\n  It took nearly 80 years, and an official expedition sanctioned by the \ngovernment in 1870, to sort out the myth about Yellowstone from the \nstriking reality.\n  Shortly thereafter, President Ulysses S. Grant signed the law in 1872 \nestablishing Yellowstone National Park ``as a public park or pleasuring \nground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.''\n  President Theodore Roosevelt, a great protector of the environment \nand treasures like Yellowstone, visited the park in 1903.\n  One hundred years ago this spring, he laid the cornerstone for the \nofficial gateway to the park. The gateway is still known as the \nRoosevelt Arch.\n  The American people's love of Yellowstone helped lead to the \nestablishment of our National Park Service. Today the Park Service \nprotects and preserves 83 million acres of natural treasures across our \ncountry.\n  The Park Service employees at Yellowstone have done a wonderful job \nof protecting the park's natural beauty, while providing opportunities \nfor people to enjoy it.\n  For example, all of the large mammal species known to exist in \nYellowstone before European Americans arrived have been restored to \ntheir natural habitats.\n  I recently had the good fortune, after many years, to once again \nvisit Yellowstone National Park. I was only able to spend a couple of \nhours there, but it was a great experience.\n  I first went there shortly after my wife and I returned from law \nschool in Washington. We traveled from Las Vegas on one of the first \nvacations we ever took.\n  I still look back with great awe at Old Faithful and the many other \nthings we were able to see, the buffalos and other animals. So when I \nreturned there, even though it was only for a few hours, the place I \nwanted to go visit again was Old Faithful.\n  Old Faithful spewed a few times during the time I was there. We took \na walk through Geyser Park. We saw buffalo lying right near the \ngeysers. The reason these great animals come and lie down near these \nspewing geysers is that, to a great extent, they keep the pests off \nthemselves by doing so.\n  Even though I was there just a short time, it was wonderful again, \nafter 25 years, to reflect back on my little children when they were \ntiny going there and visiting that park.\n  I am sure that millions of Americans also keep a special place in \ntheir hearts for Yellowstone and the memories it holds for them.\n  I hope our grandchildren's grandchildren's grandchildren will be able \nto enjoy the wonders of Yellowstone National Park, the way we do today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/02/senate-section/article/S1994-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                           SGT CORY R.

He attended Chadron State College for one \nsemester before joining the National Guard and then later, the U.S. \nArmy.\n  He spent his first year in Korea, where he was awarded several \nmedals. He was chosen to be a United Nations Command Honor Guard for 6 \nweeks, an honor for which only the best soldiers were chosen. He came \nhome 4 years later and worked as a night stocker at Wal-Mart. However, \narmy life was calling him and he missed it more than he thought. He re-\nenlisted and was again stationed in Korea for 12 months. Because of the \nwar in Iraq, his tour was extended to 15 months. He returned to the \nStates in October 2003 and proceeded to Ft. Benning, GA, where he \ntrained to be a paratrooper. He loved the thrill the first time he \njumped from the plane and it had been his dream to be a part of the \n82nd Airborne Unit in Fort Bragg, NC. He had been in Iraq just 8 days \nwhen a roadside bomb exploded west of Baghdad and killed him and two \nother soldiers.\n  SGT Cory Mracek's sacrifice will forever remind this Nation of the \ndanger that comes with the duty to protect our Nation's interests and \nthe freedoms of other arounds the world.

In 1997 he re-entered the \nArmy and was sent to Iraq in December of 2003. Corral was not scheduled \nfor deployment to Iraq until January 2004, but he volunteered to go \nearlier in place of another soldier who was married and had children. \nSergeant Corral was not one to complain, and readily accepted every \ntask that was asked of him. His arrival was greatly anticipated by his \ncompany, as they had been without a supply sergeant, and were greatly \nin need of his skills. Immediately upon his arrival, he set to work \nimproving the company supply system--organizing, filing, and issuing \nout equipment. In all that he did he showed his dedication and his love \nfor serving his country. Sergeant Corral was the first American soldier \nto die in Iraq in 2004. SGT Dennis A.

Mr. President I want to speak today on the Supreme \nCourt's recent decision to review whether the execution of child \noffenders--those under 18 at the time the crime was committed--is \nconstitutional. The Court will soon hear the case of Christopher \nSimmons, a Missouri man who was sentenced to die for a crime he \ncommitted at the age of 17. The case is called Roper v. Simmons.\n  In the past few years, our Nation has taken important strides toward \nfairness and justice in the administration of the death penalty. In \n2000, former Illinois Gov. George Ryan took the courageous step of \nhalting executions in his State pending a top-to-bottom study of the \nuse of capital punishment in Illinois. Following an exhaustive review \nof his State's system, Gov. Ryan commuted the death sentences of all \ndeath row inmates in Illinois in December 2002. Former Maryland Gov. \nParris Glendening suspended executions in his State in the face of \nglaring racial and geographic disparities in the Maryland death penalty \nsystem. Current Maryland Gov. Robert Ehrlich has since lifted the \nState's moratorium, but an execution has not taken place in Maryland \nsince 1998.\n  A number of State legislatures have inched closer and closer to \nabolishing the death penalty or instituting moratoria in their \njurisdictions. And in 2002, in a significant turning point for our \nNation, the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional the execution of the \nmentally retarded. That decision, in the case of Atkins v. Virginia, \nconfirmed that our Nation's standards of decency concerning the \nultimate punishment are indeed evolving and maturing.\n  While these events are steps toward fairness and indications of \nprogress, they also serve as reminders that our system is seriously \nflawed. The statistics and stories of innocent people wrongly convicted \nare shocking. In the modern death penalty era, 113 individuals in 25 \ndifferent States have been exonerated after being convicted and put on \ndeath row. The most recent exoneration occurred just last week in a \ncase from North Carolina. This should be disturbing to all Americans \nwho believe in the founding principles of our Nation, liberty and \njustice for all.\n  As Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in a 2002 dissent, \nafter the Court refused to consider another case involving child \noffenders, the practice of executing child offenders is ``inconsistent \nwith evolving standards of decency in a civilized society.'' In my \nview, Justice Stevens is right. Executions of child offenders have \noccurred in only eight countries since 1990: China, the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudia Arabia, Yemen, \nand the United States of America. Most of these countries, however, \nhave since banned executions of child offenders, leaving the United \nStates as the only country that acknowledges its use of capital \npunishment for child offenders.\n  According to Amnesty International, there have been 34 executions of \nchild offenders since 1990--19 of them in the United States. And there \nare currently\n\n[[Page S1995]]\n\nchild offenders on death row in America who are scheduled to be \nexecuted this year. In fact, incredibly, Texas has scheduled the \nexecution of four child offenders between March and June of this year, \ndespite the Supreme Court's announcement that it will consider the \nconstitutionality of such executions in the Simmons case this term.\n  Currently, 38 States authorize the use of the death penalty. Nineteen \nof those States have decided that they will only execute defendants who \nwere 18 or older at the time of the crime. But 5 States use 17 as the \nminimum age, and the other 16 States permit the execution of defendants \nwho were as young as 16 when they committed the crime.\n  The State Department has said: ``Because the promotion of human \nrights is an important national interest, the United States seeks to \nhold governments accountable to their obligations under universal human \nrights norms and international human rights instruments.'' But we can \nonly call ourselves protectors of human rights if we practice what we \npreach. Here at home, we continue to apply capital punishment to those \nwho were convicted of crimes committed before legally becoming adults. \nSpreading decency and humanity must begin here at home. As long as \nAmerica executes child offenders, our reputation as a shining example \nof respect for human rights is tarnished.\n  At the beginning of the 108th Congress, I introduced the National \nDeath Penalty Moratorium Act, which would suspend Federal executions \nwhile we conduct a thorough study of the administration of the Federal \ndeath penalty at the State and Federal levels. My bill would \nspecifically require a commission to review all aspects of the system, \nincluding the practice of sentencing child offenders to death. I urge \nmy colleagues to cosponsor and support the National Death Penalty \nMoratorium Act, and I look forward to the Supreme Court's review of \nthis important issue. I am hopeful that the Court will build upon the \nprogress it made two years ago when it ended the execution of the \nmentally retarded. Banning the execution of child offenders is the \nright thing to do. Congress should act if the Court doesn't.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/02/senate-section/article/S1995-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     HEALTHY MOTHERS AND HEALTHY BABIES ACCESS TO CARE ACT OF 2003\n\n\n                          medical malpractice\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, last year, the Senate considered legislation \nto try to mitigate healthcare cost increases by reforming the medical \nmalpractice system. The bill we took up was S. 11, ``The Patients First \nAct of 2003,'' which I had co-sponsored. Unfortunately, gridlock \nprevailed when a cloture motion was defeated. While I was disappointed \nthat the Senate could not address healthcare liability reform on a \ncomprehensive basis, we now have the opportunity to address the \nobstetrics and gynecological specialty with S. 2061, ``The Healthy \nMothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act.''\n  There is a reason that the OB/GYN specialty should be one of the \nfirst areas addressed by medical malpractice. It is one of three \nspecialties subject to the highest liability insurance premiums. \nNationally, the dramatic increases in premiums--more than 160 percent \nover 16 years, 1982 to 1998--have greatly outpaced the rate of \ninflation, and many physicians and hospitals have been unable to keep \nup with these escalating costs. In Arizona, OB/GYN practices face \npremiums averaging $67,000--up 16 percent in just one year's time.\n  There are only a few ways doctors and hospitals can bear these costs. \nThey can pass a portion of them on to patients or they can alter their \npractice patterns. Some physicians have cut the salaries of their hard-\nworking, professionally trained medical staff or reduced headcount in \ntheir practices. Those who are still employed after the cutbacks are \noverworked, stretched thin with added responsibilities. Other doctors \nhave reduced or completely eliminated some gynecological, surgical or \nhigh-risk obstetric procedures. Perhaps most disturbing are the \ninstances of physicians retiring early, relocating their practices to \nstates with friendly laws, or dropping obstetrics altogether.\n  The result is that women's access to prenatal and delivery care is \ncompromised. There are fewer physicians in practice to tend to women; \npatients have less time with their doctor. I am concerned that women \nseeking prenatal care and delivering their babies in Arizona may have \nto travel long distances, passing by hospitals along the way, just to \nfind a facility that can accommodate their needs. While Arizona is not \ndeemed a medical liability ``crisis state'' by the American Medical \nAssociation--I am working to make sure that does not become the case--\ninstances of facilities having to close are too frequent. For instance, \nCopper Queen Community Hospital in Bisbee, AZ, closed its maternity \nward after physicians there, who were able to deliver babies, lost \ntheir liability insurance coverage. Imagine a community hospital that \ncannot meet one of the primary needs of its residents because of \nescalating medical liability costs.\n  The problem lies with a tremendous backlog in our courts and \nexcessive jury awards that average $3.9 million. With more than 50 \npercent of jury awards totaling over $1 million, and the number of \ncases presented steadily on the rise, medical malpractice insurance \ncarriers incur a great expense for defending suits, even those that are \ndismissed with no indemnity payment. Physicians Insurers Association of \nAmerica claims that it costs physicians more than $75,000 to defend \nthemselves in cases that they win--of course, even more in cases where \nthey are found liable. Most notable may be the number of cases that are \nsettled out of court without an admission or determination of guilt, \njust to avert the possibility of a ``mega award'' that could bankrupt a \npractice.\n  Looking ahead, I am troubled by the number of medical students and \nresidents who are feeling medical liability's sting. Almost 50 percent \nof America's medical students say they factor the medical liability \ncrisis in their choice of specialty. Can we afford to have some of the \nbest and brightest physicians of tomorrow dissuaded from specialties \nbecause we did not do what was right and fix the system today?\n  The Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act only \naddresses obstetrical and gynecological care. It would establish \nparameters to maximize returns to the patients instead of trial \nlawyers. It would hold physicians and insurers accountable for medical \nexpenses in instances where they are clearly wrong. The legislation \nwould establish a period of 3 years from the date of injury for a \nperson to bring forth a claim, making exceptions to this statute of \nlimitations in cases involving minors. S. 2061 would allow for \nunlimited awards of economic damages, while placing reasonable caps on \nnon-economic damages--pain and suffering. This is an important \ndistinction that I want to take a moment to address.\n  Economic damages are for the payment of medical expenses--both past \nand future--the loss of earnings--both past and future--as well as the \ncost of having services in the home to assist someone who has been \ninjured or incapacitated from a negligent act. There is no limit on \nthese awards. It is important to me to preserve a patient's access to \nfull medical care when a party has been found negligent. This \nlegislation does that.\n  Non-economic damages meant to compensate for physical and emotional \npain and suffering are not easily quantified. For these damages, awards \nwould be capped at $250,000 and would be in addition to economic \ndamages awarded. Very often, juries have awarded individuals millions \nof dollars to punish a defendant, not necessarily to compensate for \nwhat is an intangible loss.\n  Under S. 2061, contingency fees would be set to make sure that \npatients with valid claims do not see their awards siphoned away by \nlawyers. The bill would allow lawyers to recoup fees and make a profit, \nbut not at the unfair expense of the plaintiff.\n  We have been down this road before and I am hopeful that my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in support of \nmedical malpractice reform. This legislation will deliver on the \npromise made to our constituents to fix the healthcare system in this \ncountry and rein in excessive and frivolous lawsuits.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/02/senate-section/article/S1996-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1996]]\nSAFE, ACCOUNTABLE, FLEXIBLE, AND EFFICIENT TRANSPORTATION EQUITY ACT OF \n                                  2003\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss S. 1072, the Safe, \nAccountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2003.\n  The transportation bill is a needed investment for America's \ninfrastructure. Our Nation's roads, bridges and transit systems need \nhelp now. Thirty-eight percent of our Nation's major roads are in poor \nor fair condition, and 28 percent of our bridges are structurally \ndeficient and unsafe for travel.\n  This bill is important for the economy as well. Transportation \nsurpasses education and recreation and nearly equals health care and \nfood as a contributor to economic growth, and the transportation sector \nis critical to jobs, employing millions of workers. A 6-year, $311 \nbillion transportation bill will create more than 830,000 jobs across \nthe United States.\n  I want to specifically mention how important transportation funding \nis to North Dakota. North Dakota has only 17 people per lane mile of \nFederal-aid highway; the national average is 124. As a result, there is \na huge per capita investment by North Dakota citizens to support a \nnational transportation system.\n  That means that Federal aid is critical for ensuring the development, \nsafety and reliability of transportation infrastructure, as it simply \ndoes not have the population to support its needs. The $1.463 billion \nthat North Dakota is projected to receive over the next 6 years will \nbenefit the infrastructure, economy, and citizens of North Dakota, and \nthe many others who use North Dakota's roadways for interstate commerce \nand tourism.\n  Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member Jeffords worked hard to ensure \nthat rural States would receive adequate funding in this bill, and I \nthank them for their efforts. I emphasize that we must continue to work \nto preserve this funding as this bill proceeds. I also thank them for \ntheir work to include two of my amendments in S. 1072.\n  My first amendment will ease the burdens of cumbersome hazardous \nmaterials regulations on small farmers. Farmers driving their pickup \ntrucks with a 120-gallon tank of fuel in the back should not have to \nfile security plans. These farmers are not a threat to our Nation's \nsecurity, and my amendment exempts them from these unnecessary rules.\n  My second amendment will ensure that States prohibit open containers \nof alcoholic beverages in vehicles. In this day and age, it is \nunbelievable that someone can still drive with one hand on the wheel \nand one hand holding an open bottle of Jack Daniels, and my amendment \ntakes action so that States crack down on this violation.\n  Lastly, I want to say that it is unfortunate that we were not able \ntake up amendments that Senator Burns, Senator Rockefeller and I \nsubmitted to address current problems with rail policy in this Nation.\n  While more than 40 major railroads existed in 1980, these have now \nconsolidated to seven, with four major railroads generating over 90 \npercent of the total annual rail revenue. The previous Interstate \nCommerce Commission, and the current Surface Transportation Board, STB, \nhave failed to implement captive customer protections, and in fact have \ninterpreted the deregulation act to allow railroads to deny rail \ncustomer access to rail competition. As a result, today we have a \nnational rail industry that is both deregulated and retains almost \nunchecked monopoly power over at least 30 percent of its customers.\n  This issue hits home for my constituents and me. Grain production is \na major industry in my State. Unfortunately, our grain producers are \ncaptive to a single railroad. That railroad consistently charges rates \nthat are so outrageously high that our grain loses access to both U.S. \nand foreign markets. When we do move our grain at these high rail \nrates, every dollar for rail transportation comes out of the pockets of \nour grain farmers in the form of reduced net-backs from their grain \nsales.\n  It is unfortunate that our rail amendments could not be offered for a \nfull debate and vote. They would have begun to introduce the \ncompetition in the national rail system that should have resulted from \nderegulation 23 years ago. These amendments would have provided some \nmuch needed relief to our farmers, manufacturers and electric \nratepayers and would help save American jobs for Americans. I will \ncontinue to work for a chance to take action on these amendments and \nmove our rail system toward the efficient, procompetitive system this \nNation needs and deserves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/02/senate-section/article/S1996-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On July 3, 1999, in Philadelphia, PA, a 59-year-old gay man was found \nbeaten to death in his apartment. The bodies of two other gay men from \nthe Philadelphia area were found in the Schuylkill River the previous \nmonth.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/02/senate-section/article/S1996-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               LTC COLONEL FRANK LOUIS BOSCH: IN MEMORIAM\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to share with my colleagues the \nmemory of retired Air Force LTC Frank Louis Bosch. COL Bosch was a \ndedicated member of the armed services and a dedicated community \nvolunteer. His life is truly an example of selflessness and service to \nothers.\n  COL Bosch was born in New Orleans and raised in Brooklyn, NY. \nThroughout his commendable service in the Army Air Forces, he flew \nnight missions in World War II, commanded a fighter group in the Korean \nWar, and received the Distinguished Flying Cross for his participation \nin the Battle of Khe Sanh in Vietnam.\n  Upon retiring, COL Bosch refused to believe that his service to \nothers must end. After earning a bachelor's and master's degree in \nphysical education from George Mason University, he created and led \nexercise programs for seniors at the Fairfax County recreation \ndepartment. He also organized softball leagues, ice skating groups, and \nthe Northern Virginia Senior Olympics. He worked as a docent and guide \nat the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and assisted the priests of Fort \nMeyers with burials of veterans at Arlington National Cemetery. He \nserved as an election officer in Fairfax, Eucharistic minister and \nusher at St. Michael's church in Annandale, was a former vice president \nof the WWII Night Fighters Association and a member of the Knights of \nColumbus.\n  Although he never looked to be rewarded for his service to both \ncountry and community, honors were frequently bestowed upon him. Along \nwith the Distinguished Flying Cross, he was awarded the Virginia \nGovernors Award for volunteering and the National Park Service's \nvolunteer-of-the-year.\n  COL Bosch's life serves as an inspiration to all who knew him or have \nheard his story. When his son Paul called my office today, he mentioned \nthat at the colonel's funeral at Arlington, ``the sun came out just \nlong enough for us to have a very warm feeling.'' I know that the \nexample of COL Bosch's life will be a warm feeling for all of us as we \nremember his bravery, generosity and compassion.\n  I extend my deepest sympathies to his wife, Mardy, his sons and \ndaughters, his grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. I am confident \nthat COL Bosch's spirit will live on in them for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/02/senate-section/article/S1996-4", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1996-S1997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  IN RECOGNITION OF ERNEST C.

Levister, Jr., M.D. For his \nlongstanding commitment to the health of residents of the Inland\n\n[[Page S1997]]\n\nEmpire, he has been honored by the California Medical Association \nFoundation with the Robert D. Sparks, M.D. Leadership Award.\n  The Robert D. Sparks, M.D. Leadership Award recognizes individuals or \norganizations for outstanding community health achievements. Dr. \nLevister's accomplishments have not only met this criterion, but led to \nprograms and policy that will continue to facilitate medical advances \nfor years to come.\n  For the past 30 years, Dr. Levister has used his expertise to educate \nothers, empowering his community with knowledge. He has been honored \nfor addressing the medical concerns and questions of the Inland \nEmpire's African-American community through his ``Our Bodies'' column \nin the Black Voice News since 1986. His founding role in the Technology \nAccess Partnership Foundation, a foundation that endeavors to increase \naccessibility to informational technologies, is also testament to his \ncommitment to ensuring that traditionally underrepresented groups have \nthe tools they need to live happy, healthy lives.\n  As president of the J.W. Vines Medical Society from 1994 to 2001, Dr. \nLevister strove to make educational opportunities available to students \nof all backgrounds, encourage African Americans' entrance into and \ncontinued progress in the medical field, and improve overall patient \ncare. He is a cofounder of the Vines Foundation, which works to create \neducational opportunities for African-American students pursuing health \nand science-related careers.\n  Dr. Levister is credited as a major influence in changes that the \nUniversity of California, Riverside made to its Bio Medical Science \nProgram, which now offers more opportunities to disadvantaged students \nand pre-med faculty positions to those who are traditionally \nunderrepresented. Other recognitions include the Silver Scalpel Award \nfrom the California Society of Industrial Medicine and Surgery for his \nwork to protect the rights of injured workers and their physicians, the \n2000 Black Rose and Humanitarian of the Year Award given to Dr. and \nMrs. Levister for their service to their community, and the San \nBernardino County Medical Society's 2003 Award for Outstanding \nContribution to the Community.\n  Dr. Levister's fine leadership has paved the way for the continued \npropagation of a diverse medical community to address the complex and \nvaried health care needs of the Inland Empire Community. It is with \ngreat pleasure that I congratulate Dr. Levister on his receipt of the \nprestigious Robert D.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment \ntoday to congratulate Mrs. Cornelia McReynolds of Pembroke, KY, for \nreceiving the Modernette Civic Club's Woman of the Year Award.\n  Mrs. McReynolds is best known in the Hopkinsville community as a \ndevoted mother of seven children. But her influence stretches far \nbeyond the boundaries of her home and her family.\n  She is an active member of the Eastern Star and helped to organize \nthe Community Choir of Hopkinsville. She is also director of the junior \nchoir and president of the usher board at the St. Bethlehem Baptist \nChurch. The children of the church are so fond of Mrs. McReynolds, they \ncall her ``Granny.''\n  Six of her seven children were with her when she received the award \nat the Modernette Club's 10th annual African-American Heritage \nBreakfast. They traveled from as far away as Chicago and Florida to be \nwith their mother--and of course her seventh child called by cell phone \nfrom Florida after she received the award. Even her seven-month-old \ngreat granddaughter attended the Saturday morning breakfast in her \nhonor at the Pioneer Memorial Complex.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the 100th Anniversary of Congregation Sherith Israel's \nhistoric sanctuary building in the City of San Francisco in my home \nState of California.\n  Congregation Sherith Israel, established in 1849, is one of the \noldest Reform congregations in the West. Reform Judaism spread \nthroughout North America more than 130 years ago and is\n\n[[Page S1998]]\n\nnow the largest Jewish movement in North America, with more than 900 \ncongregations and 1.5 million people.\n  Congregation Sherith Israel's synagogue building is located at the \ncorner of California and Webster Streets in San Francisco. This year \nmarks the centennial of this historic building, whose cornerstone was \nlaid on February 22, 1904. The building was designed by renowned Bay \nArea architect Albert Pissis, who was an important figure in the \nrebuilding of downtown San Francisco after the city's most famous \ndisaster, the Great Earthquake and Fire of 1906.\n  The 1906 Earthquake and Fire left the city in smoking ruins and \ndestroyed many public structures. Congregation Sherith Israel's \nsynagogue withstood this disaster and was able to house many important \nevents following the destruction. The building served as the city's \nSuperior Court for more than 2 years and, in 1945, hosted one of the \norganizing sessions of the United Nations.\n  Today, this unique building has an austere exterior which hides a \nlavish and ornamental interior, complete with the finest stained glass, \npews of rare Honduran mahogany, polished marble floors and beautifully \ndetailed painted walls and ceilings. The synagogue is home to a working \noriginal Murray M. Harris Company organ. Harris was the pioneer Los \nAngeles organ builder who is generally regarded as ``the Father of \nOrganbuilding in the West.'' The chapel also contains Congregation \nSherith Israel's original Holy Ark, built in 1970.\n  The blue-grey dome of the synagogue, taller than the dome of San \nFrancisco City Hall, is touted as one of the highest in the city. The \ndome, visible from many vistas around San Francisco, is a wonderful \nreminder of this building's history and importance to San Francisco. \nCongregation Sherith Israel's sanctuary building also continues to \nrepresent the spiritual strength, diversity and pioneer spirit of San \nFrancisco's Jewish community. A hallmark of Reform Judaism is ``tikkun \nolam,'' or repairing the world, a desire to bring peace, freedom, and \njustice to all people. Congregation Sherith Israel is a wonderful \nexample of tikkun olam in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n  I am very pleased to recognize this beautiful and historic building. \nI hope the people of San Francisco and the members of Congregation \nSherith Israel continue to enjoy this building for many more \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/02/senate-section/article/S1998-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN HONOR OF DR. FELIX G. SHEEHAN\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to speak in honor of Dr. Felix \nG. Sheehan, of Middletown, CT. Next week, on March 13, 2004, Dr. \nSheehan will be receiving the ``Irish Person of the Year'' award from \nthe Middletown division of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the oldest \nand largest Irish Catholic society in the United States.\n  Dr. Sheehan retired 2 years ago after 47 years in the medical \npractice. As a doctor, he was, in so many ways, a treasure from a \nbygone era. Even as health care became more and more of a business, and \neven as Americans increasingly dealt with the complicated world of \ncopayments, referrals, and coverage networks, Dr. Sheehan was a doctor \nwho built lifelong relationships with his patients and made house calls \nat all hours of the day and night.\n  His tremendous dedication, warmth, and kind spirit are legendary in \nMiddletown, where many of his patients became just as devoted to him as \nhe was to them. One of those patients described him as ``the best \ndoctor in the world.''\n  Dr. Sheehan was born in Belfast and came to America with his family \nat the age of 6. He served his new country in the Pacific during World \nWar II. During his service, he had an experience that would change his \nlife--and the lives of many others. While stationed aboard the USS \nWasp, he was asked one day to help out a nurse who was having trouble \ntreating a patient. It was then that he first realized that medicine \nwould be his calling.\n  After attending college at St. John's University in New York, Felix \nSheehan spent the next 5 years in his native Belfast earning his \nmedical degree from Queen's University. It was happenstance, he says, \nthat he found Connecticut. But after seeing the slogan on Middlesex \nHospital that read, ``Caring and Kindness Always, All Ways,'' he knew \nthat Middletown would be his home. Because although that motto belonged \nto the hospital, it could have easily been written to describe Felix \nSheehan.\n  To Felix Sheehan, being a doctor meant so much more than examining \npatients and prescribing medicines. He offered complimentary medical \nservices to local parochial schools. He took on needy patients free of \ncharge. He hosted a wedding for one of his employees who couldn't \nafford it. He retained legal counsel for the child of one of his \npatients. And as his own career drew to a close, he served as a mentor \nand role model to young doctors entering the profession.\n  From the day he took up his practice until the day he retired, Dr. \nSheehan gave so much of himself to so many people. In the words of his \ndaughter Laureen, ``in a very real and special sense, he was more than \na physician--he was and is a healer.''\n  From one Irishman to another, I offer my warmest congratulations to \nDr. Sheehan on the honor he will receive next week. I wish him, his \nwife Marie, and their children many more happy years together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/02/senate-section/article/S1998-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING THE JOHN EHRET HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, from May 1-3, 2004 more than \n1,200 students from across the United States will visit Washington, \nD.C. to take part in the national finals of We the People: The Citizen \nand the Constitution, the most extensive educational program in the \ncountry developed specifically to educate young people about the U.S. \nConstitution and Bill of Rights. Administered by the Center for Civic \nEducation, the We the People program is funded by the U.S. Department \nof Education by act of Congress.\n  I am proud to announce that the class from John Ehret High School \nfrom Marrero will represent the State of Louisiana in this prestigious \nnational event. These outstanding students, through their knowledge of \nthe U.S. Constitution, won their statewide competition and earned the \nchance to come to our Nation's Capital and compete at the national \nlevel.\n  The 3-day We the People National Finals Competition is modeled after \nhearings in the U.S. Congress. The students are given an opportunity to \ndemonstrate their knowledge before a panel of adult judges while they \nevaluate and defend positions on relevant historical and contemporary \nissues. Their testimony is followed by questions designed to probe the \nstudents' depth of understanding and ability to apply their \nconstitutional knowledge. Columnist David Broder once described this \nannual competition as ``the place to come to have your faith in the \nyounger generation restored.''\n  Most recently, the We the People program was highlighted at two \nnational conferences held in 2003: the White House Forum on American \nHistory, Civics, and Service, and the first annual Congressional \nConference on Civic Education. Evaluations and independent studies have \nvalidated the effectiveness of the We the People program on students' \ncivic knowledge and attitudes. This innovative civic education program \ncontinues to be one of the best antidotes to apathy and cynicism in our \nNation.\n  I wish these students the best of luck at the We the People national \nfinals and applaud their achievement. We should all be proud that they \nare learning and advocating the fundamental ideals that identify us as \na people and bind us together as a Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/02/senate-section/article/S1998-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1998-S1999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CELEBRATING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MARIN COUNTY CIVIC CENTER \n                           VOLUNTEERS PROGRAM\n\n Mrs. Boxer. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the 25th anniversary of the Marin County Civic Center \nVolunteers program.\n  In 1979, the Civic Center Volunteers program (CCV) was established to \nhelp Marin County maintain its excellent public services by providing \nlocal government agencies with volunteers from the community.\n  During CCV's 25 years of service, over 10,000 volunteers have \ncontributed countless hours of their time. Their\n\n[[Page S1999]]\n\nwork translates into the equivalent of providing over $60 million in \nservices to Marin County's local government agencies. CCV provides a \nunique service by bringing energetic volunteers with a community \nperspective into almost all aspects of Marin's county government. By \ninvolving the local community, the county is able to run its programs \nmore efficiently and with broader community involvement.\n  CCV has succeeded in enhancing civic participation by Marin County \nresidents in their local government. Civic Center volunteers become \nadvocates for the community by becoming a part of the governmental \nprocess. Over the years, programs that were initially started by \nvolunteers, such as the Consumer Mediation Unit and Job Coach, have \nbecome a part of the county's regular services.\n  As one of the Nation's first centralized county volunteer programs, \nCCV has received numerous awards and accolades, including the United \nStates Congress Achievement Award and the National Association of \nCounties' ``Acts of Caring'' Award for Public Education and \nInformation. The CCV program has been successfully used as a model for \nvolunteerism in local governments, both nationally and internationally.\n  For 25 years, the Marin County Civic Center Volunteers program has \nserved as a national model for civic leadership. CCV's dedication to \nthe community is inspiring and impressive. I congratulate the Marin \nCounty Civic Center Volunteers on their 25th anniversary and wish them \nanother 25 years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/02/senate-section/article/S1999-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/02/senate-section/article/S1999-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/02/senate-section/article/S1999-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT RELATIVE TO MODIFYING DUTY-FREE TREATMENT UNDER THE GENERALIZED \n                      SYSTEM OF PREFERENCES--PM 68\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with section 502(f) of the Trade act of 1974, as amended \n(the ``Act''), I am writing to inform you of my intent to designate \nAlgeria as a beneficiary developing country and to terminate the \ndesignation of Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Behrain, the Czech \nRepublic, Estonia, Hungary, Lativia, Lithuania, Poland, and Slovakia as \nbeneficiary developing countries for purposes of the Generalized System \nof Preferences (GSP).\n  I have considered the criteria set forth in sections 501 and 502 of \nthe Act.

A bill to establish a National sex offender registration \ndatabase, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bipartisan piece \nof legislation. As I will describe, this bill seeks to fill a gaping \nhole in our criminal justice system, made tragically evident by a \nrecent tragedy in North Dakota.\n  Last November, Dru Sjodin, a student at the University of North \nDakota, was abducted in the parking lot of a Grand Forks shopping mall. \nA suspect has been arrested, and there is significant evidence that he \nwas responsible for Dru's abduction. Dru has not been found.\n  The tragedy of Dru's abduction is compounded by the fact that her \nalleged assailant, Alfonso Rodriguez, Jr., had been released from \nprison only six months earlier, having served a 23-year sentence for \nrape in Minnesota. And what's more, Minnesota authorities had known \nthat he was at high risk of committing another sexual assault if \nreleased.\n  The Minnesota Department of Corrections had rated Rodriguez as a \n``type 3'' offender--meaning that he was at the highest risk for \nreoffending. In an evaluation conducted in January 2003, a prison \npsychiatrist wrote that Rodriguez had demonstrated ``a willingness to \nuse substantial force, including the use of a weapon, in order to gain \ncompliance from his victims.''\n  Despite this determination, the Minnesota Department of Corrections \nreleased Rodriguez in May 2003, and essentially washed its hands of the \ncase. Since Rodriguez had served the full term of his sentence, the \nDepartment of Corrections imposed no further supervision on him at all.\n  Now, the Minnesota Department of Corrections could have recommended \nthat the State Attorney General seek what is known as a ``civil \ncommitment.'' Under this procedure, a State court would have required \nRodriguez to be confined as long as he posed a sufficient threat to the \npublic, even if he had served his original sentence. But the State \nAttorney General was never notified that Rodriguez was getting out, and \nthere was no chance for the Minnesota courts to consider the case.\n  So upon his release, Mr. Rodriguez went to live in Crookston, MN, \ncompletely unsupervised, a short distance from the Grand Forks shopping \nmall where Dru Sjodin was abducted.\n  To make matters worse, the North Dakota public had no way of knowing \nthat Rodriguez had been released. There is currently no national sex \noffender registry. Each State has its own sex offender registry, which \ntracks only its own residents. So although Minnesota listed Rodriguez \nin its sex offender registry, residents of North Dakota checking their \nown State's sex offender registry would have no way of knowing this.\n  For all intents and purposes, Rodriguez was free to prey on nearby \ncommunities in North Dakota, without fear of recognition.\n  This situation is unacceptable. We must do better. A recent study \nfound that 72 percent of ``highest risk'' sexual offenders reoffend \nwithin 6 years of being released. And the Bureau of Justice Statistics \nhas determined that sex offenders released from prison are over ten \ntimes more likely to be arrested for a sexual crime than individuals \nwho have no record of sexual assault. We cannot just release such \nindividuals with no supervision whatsoever, and let them prey upon an \nunsuspecting public.\n  Today, I am offering legislation to that will hopefully ensure that \nthese breakdowns in our criminal justice system do not reoccur, and \nthat will give our citizens the tools to better protect themselves from \nsexual offenders.\n  This bill, which is co-sponsored by Senators Dayton, Coleman, and \nConrad, does the following three things: First, it directs the \nDepartment of Justice to create and manage a national sex offender \nregistry, which would be accessible to the general public through the \nInternet. This database would allow users of the registry to specify a \nsearch radius across State lines. This will give residents in the many \nstates that have large population centers close to State lines, like \nNorth Dakota and Minnesota, a much more meaningful report on nearby \nsexual offenders.\n  Second, to try to ensure that the highest risk sex offenders are not \nreleased at all, the bill requires that States provide automatic and \ntimely notification to their States attorneys of the planned release of \nany ``high-risk'' sex offender, so that states attorneys can have a \nchance to determine whether to seek a civil commitment of that \noffender.\n  And third, the bill requires intensive State supervision of ``high-\nrisk'' sex offenders released after serving their full sentence--that \nis, offenders who would otherwise go unsupervised--for a period of no \nless than one year.\n  The cost of these steps would be shared by the Federal Government and \nthe States. The Federal Government would bear the cost of maintaining \nthe national sex offender registry, and the States would bear the cost \nof supervising high risk offenders upon their release from prison.\n  To ensure compliance with these measures, the legislation would \nreduce Federal funding for prison construction by 25 percent for those \nstates that did not comply, and would reallocate such funds to States \nthat do comply with those provisions. This will be the ``stick'' that \nsome States may need to ensure that they comply with these important \nprotections.\n  Our thoughts and prayers go to Dru Sjodin's family. I cannot \nguarantee that that passage of the legislation we are introducing today \nwill prevent such tragedies from ever occurring again. But I believe \nthat it will be a significant step towards making our neighborhoods \nsafer for our loved ones.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues, on a bipartisan basis, \nto secure passage of this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2154\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title II of the Higher Education Act of 1965 \nto enhance teacher training programs, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, the \n``Community College Teacher Preparation Enhancement Act of 2004,'' \nwhich addresses two of the Nation's most pressing education needs: \nfirst, the projected demand for roughly 2.4 million new `highly \nqualified' teachers over the next decade, due to teacher attrition, \nteacher retirement, and a growing student population, and second, the \nrequirement under the No Child Left Behind Act that all teachers be \n`highly qualified' by 2006. This is an enormous challenge for the \nNation, but one that this legislation would take giant strides toward \nmeeting.\n  Our Nation's colleges and universities have done a wonderful job \ngraduating highly qualified teachers. There is no question about this, \nbut given the coming teacher shortages, it is unlikely that our four-\nyear colleges and universities, alone, will be sufficient to satisfy \nthe rising demand for well-educated teachers. Certainly, and sadly, \nthis will simply not be possible in the near term. Yet throughout the \neducational community, community colleges have come to be recognized \nfor their potential to play a leading role in filling the looming \nteacher shortage. Community colleges are already a vital part of our \nhigher education system, particularly in producing teachers. Nearly \nhalf of all of the country's undergraduates who enter post-secondary \ninstitutions began their studies at community colleges. Of the \ncountry's teachers, one in five began their education at a community \ncollege. Clearly, community colleges are already a great resource.\n  In addition to their current role, community colleges have access to \na vast population of students who could potentially become teachers, if \ngiven encouragement, opportunity and training. The Nation's 1200 \ncommunity colleges enroll more than 6 million students. Let me put that \nin perspective. That means that 44 percent of the Nation's \nundergraduates are enrolled in community colleges! It's not difficult \nto see that community colleges have the unique potential to assist the \ncountry in meeting its increased demand for high-quality teachers. Now \nlet me tell you how this legislation would utilize this resource for \nthe benefit of both our children and our future.\n  This bill seeks to build strong teacher training networks by allowing \nus to tap the extraordinary resources and student pool at all post-\nsecondary levels to increase the number of teachers across the nation. \nThis is accomplished through the establishment of a Department of \nEducation grant program to award funding to applicants who will \nstrengthen their teacher training systems.\n  Four-year institutions can offer the community college population \naccess to their established and recognized curriculum of teacher \ntraining courses. Four-year institutions that have already established \nrelationships with schools can offer practical learning to community \ncollege students who are seeking a teaching degree, and can receive \nfederal money to help implement these programs.\n  Moreover, by promoting close collaboration between community colleges \nand four-year institutions, this legislation increases the opportunity \nfor community college students to earn a baccalaureate degree in \neducation. This would help the Nation keep pace with the demand for \nhigh-quality teachers that is due--in addition to the demographic \nchanges I mentioned earlier--to requirements of the No Child Left \nBehind Act, most notably the mandate that all new teachers have at \nleast a baccalaureate degree.\n  While this legislation aims to prevent a shortage of teachers \nnationwide, it prioritizes teacher preparation in areas of extreme \nshortage, typically rural and urban areas. Further, it targets specific \nacademic areas that face even greater shortages, such as mathematics, \nscience, and special education.\n  The Community College Teacher Preparation Enhancement Act also \npromotes teacher training and outreach to secondary schools to develop \ninnovative approaches to attracting\n\n[[Page S2003]]\n\nhigh school students into the teaching profession.\n  Finally, recognizing that teacher shortage is not a regional problem, \ncare will be taken to ensure that grants are distributed in a \ngeographically diverse manner.\n  This legislation addresses a pressing issue. School districts across \nthe nation are struggling to meet the requirements of No Child Left \nBehind, and delaying assistance would only compound the problem as \nshortages of qualified teachers increase. This was not the intent of No \nChild Left Behind, but idleness on this issue will surely leave a \ndevastating shortage of quality educators for our children. It is time \nto act, and this legislation offers us a tremendous opportunity to send \na clear and overdue signal to states that we intend to be true to this \nlandmark legislation's title.\n  I look forward to working on this issue and urge my colleagues to \njoin me in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Coleman, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Wyden, \n        Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Carper, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Bayh, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Landrieu, \n        Mrs. Murray, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Biden, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. \n        Reid):\n  S. 2157. A bill to amend the Trade Act of 1974 to extend the trade \nadjustment assistance program to the services sector, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Equity for Service Workers Act.\n  Since 1962, Trade Adjustment Assistance--what we call ``TAA''--has \nprovided retraining, income support, and other benefits so that workers \nwho lose their jobs due to trade can make a new start.\n  The rationale for TAA is simple. When our government pursues trade \nliberalization, we create benefits for the economy as a whole. But \nthere is always some dislocation from trade.\n  As President Kennedy said, ``those injured by . . . trade competition \nshould not be required to bear the full brunt of the impact.'' ``There \nis an obligation,'' he said, for the Federal Government ``to render \nassistance to those who suffer as a result of national trade policy.'' \nWe meet that obligation through TAA.\n  The TAA program has not been static over time. Several times, \nCongress has revised the program to meet new economic realities. In \n1993, for example, Congress created a new TAA program targeted \nspecifically at workers who might suffer dislocation as a result of the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement.\n  Most recently, in the Trade Act of 2002, Congress completed the most \ncomprehensive overhaul and expansion of the TAA program since its \ninception.\n  We expanded the program to cover workers affected by shifts in \nproduction, secondary workers, and farmers, ranchers, and fishermen. We \nextended income support to permit workers to complete needed training.\n  We added wage insurance and other incentives to employers to promote \non-the-job training. And we added a health insurance tax credit, so \nthat workers don't need to choose between needed retraining and health \ncare for their families.\n  I am very proud to have played a leading role in passing this \nlandmark legislation. But I am also the first to admit that our work is \nnot done. Economic realities continue to change, and TAA must continue \nto change with them.\n  One fundamental aspect of TAA that has remained unchanged since 1962 \nis its focus on manufacturing. We only give TAA benefits to workers who \nmake things. That means that the 80 percent or more of American workers \nin the service sector cannot access this program.\n  Excluding service workers from TAA may have made sense in 1962, when \nmost non-farm jobs were in manufacturing and most services were not \ntraded across national borders.\n  But today, most U.S. jobs are in the service sector. And the market \nfor many services is becoming just as global as the market for \nmanufactured goods.\n  In 2001, the service sector accounted for 81 percent of U.S. private \nsector gross domestic product and a similar percentage of total U.S. \nemployment. Although trade in goods continues to dominate, cross-border \nservices trade rose to 21 percent of the total value of U.S. trade in \n2001.\n  Trade in services is a net plus for the U.S. economy. In fact, the \nservice sector generated a trade surplus of nearly $74 billion in 2001.\n  Just as we have seen with trade in manufactured goods, however, trade \nin services will inevitably cost some workers their jobs.\n  Indeed, there have been some well-publicized examples in the papers. \nSoftware design. Technical support. Accounting and tax preparation \nservices. Just recently, a group of call center workers in Kalispell, \nMontana saw their jobs move to Canada.\n  Examples abound of service-sector jobs--even high tech service jobs--\nrelocating overseas. Over the past three years, somewhere between a \nquarter and a half million service jobs have moved to other--mainly \nlow-wage--countries.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today is a simple matter of \nequity. When a factory relocates to another country, those workers are \neligible for TAA. When a call center moves to another country, those \nworkers are not eligible for TAA. But they should be. And under this \nlegislation they will.\n  This bill provides TAA benefits to three categories of trade-impacted \nservice workers:\n  First, it covers workers who lose their jobs due to competition from \nimported services. For example, if a U.S. truck driver loses his job \nbecause his employer loses routes to a Mexican-domiciled trucking \ncompany, the U.S. driver would be eligible for TAA.\n  Second, it covers workers who lose their jobs when a service facility \nrelocates overseas as, for example, in the case of a call center or \nsoftware design operation.\n  These workers would be eligible if their employer opens an overseas \nfacility, or--as is often the case--if the employer contracts out the \njobs to a foreign service provider. This ``offshoring'' eligibility \nwould apply to both private and public sector service workers whose \njobs relocate overseas.\n  Third, the bill covers secondary service workers. Secondary workers \nare those who provide inputs to a primary firm where the workers are \neligible for TAA.\n  Right now, workers who make parts for manufactured products are \ncovered if they lose their jobs when the primary firm closes. But \nworkers who supply services to a TAA-eligible firm do not. This bill \ncorrects that inequity.\n  The benefits service workers will receive under this legislation \nwould be exactly the same as those that trade-impacted manufacturing \nworkers now receive. They include retraining, income support, job \nsearch and relocation allowances, and the health insurance tax credit.\n  The bill also expands the TAA for Firms program to cover services. \nThe TAA for Firms program provides technical assistance to mostly small \nand medium-sized businesses that face layoffs due to import \ncompetition.\n  The program helps firms become more competitive so they can retain \nand expand employment. As with TAA for workers, there is no reason to \nexclude businesses that provide services from this program.\n  Hard-working American service workers deserve this safety net. \nDespite what some opponents of TAA suggest, no worker would choose to \nlose his job so he can qualify for TAA. These benefits will always be \nsecond best to a job. But they can really make a difference in helping \nworkers make a new start.\n  It is also critical to note that TAA can make an important difference \nin public attitudes. Surveys show that most Americans feel a lot more \ncomfortable with globalization and with trade agreements when they know \nthey will get help if their jobs are threatened.\n  That's why 66 percent of Americans responding to a recent poll agreed \nwith the following statement: ``I favor free trade, and I believe that \nit is necessary for the government to have programs to help workers who \nlose their jobs.''\n  The world is changing and TAA must keep up with the times. This bill \nwill\n\n[[Page S2004]]\n\nhelp our government to keep its promise to the American people to make \ntrade work for everyone.\n  I want to thank my colleagues who have joined me in co-sponsoring \nthis important legislation, particularly Senator Coleman. I've also \nbeen working closely with Members in the House, including \nRepresentatives Smith, Holden, Inslee, Rangel, and Levin.\n  I know they share my interest in seeing this bill move quickly \nthrough the legislative process and I thank them for their support. I \nplan to work hard this year to move this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2157\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to increase \nthe supply of pancreatic islet cells for research, and to provide for \nbetter coordination of Federal efforts and information on islet cell \ntransplantation; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nWashington, Senator Patty Murray, in introducing the Pancreatic Islet \nCell Transplantation Act of 2004, which will help to advance \ntremendously important research that holds the promise of a cure for \nthe more than one million Americans with Type 1, or juvenile diabetes. \nThe legislation is similar to the bipartisan bill, S. 518, which we \nintroduced last year and which attracted 52 cosponsors.\n  As the founder and co-chair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I have \nlearned a great deal about this serious disease and the difficulties \nand heartbreak that it causes for so many Americans and their families \nas they await a cure. The burden of juvenile diabetes is particularly \nheavy for children and young people. It is the second most common \ndisease affecting children. Moreover, it is one that they never \noutgrow.\n  In individuals with juvenile diabetes, the body's own immune system \nattacks the pancreas and destroys the islet cells that produce insulin. \nAs a consequence, people with juvenile diabetes require daily insulin \ninjections for survival. While the discovery of insulin was a landmark \nbreakthrough in the treatment of people with diabetes, it is not a \ncure. People with juvenile diabetes face the constant threat of \ndeveloping devastating, life-threatening conditions such as kidney \nfailure, blindness or amputation, as well as a dramatic reduction in \ntheir quality of life.\n  Thankfully, there is good news for people with diabetes. We have seen \nsome tremendous breakthroughs in diabetes research in recent years, and \nI am convinced that diabetes is a disease that can be cured, and will \nbe cured in the near future.\n  We were all encouraged by the development of the ``Edmonton \nProtocol,'' an experimental treatment developed at the University of \nAlberta involving the transplantation of insulin-producing pancreatic \nislet cells, which has been hailed as the most important advance in \ndiabetes research since the discovery of insulin in 1920. Pancreatic \nislet cell transplantation has been performed on nearly 300 individuals \nto date, and the majority of them no longer need to take insulin to \nstay alive. Significant research questions, however, remain to be \nanswered if we are to make certain that the procedure is appropriate \nfor everyone who suffers from juvenile diabetes.\n  There are also non-scientific barriers to expanding islet cell \ntransplantation, and the Pancreatic Islet Cell Transplantation Act of \n2004 addresses some of them. We were extremely pleased that a key \ncomponent of S. 518 was included in the Medicare reform bill signed \ninto law last year. That provision authorized a Medicare demonstration \nproject to test the efficacy of pancreatic islet cell transplants for \nindividuals with juvenile diabetes who are eligible for Medicare \nbecause they have end-stage renal disease.\n  The legislation we are introducing today includes the remaining two \nprovisions from last year's legislation that were not included in the \nMedicare bill. These two provisions are intended to increase the supply \nof pancreata for islet cell transplantation and to improve the \ncoordination of federal efforts and information regarding islet cell \ntransplantation.\n  There currently are only about 2,000 pancreases donated annually, \nand, of these only about 500 are available each year for islet cell \ntransplants. Moreover, most patients require islet cells from two \npancreases for the procedure to work effectively. To increase the \nsupply of available pancreases, our legislation will direct the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to grant credit to organ \nprocurement organizations (OPOs)--for the purposes of their \ncertification--for pancreases harvested and used for islet cell \ntransplantation and research. While CMS considers a pancreas to have \nbeen procured for transplantation if it is used for a whole organ \ntransplant, the OPO receives no credit towards its certification if the \npancreas is procured and used for islet cell transplantation or \nresearch. Our legislation will therefore give the OPOs an incentive to \nstep up their efforts to increase the supply of pancreases donated for \nthis purpose.\n  Finally, to provide a more focused effort in the are of islet cell \ntransplantation, our legislation requires the Diabetes Mellitus \nInteragency Coordinating Committee at the National Institutes of Health \nto include in its annual report an assessment of the Federal activities \nand programs related to islet cell transplantation and to make \nrecommendations for legislative or administrative actions that might \nincrease the supply of pancreases available for islet cell \ntransplantation.\n  Islet cell transplantation offers real hope for people with diabetes. \nOur legislation, which is strongly supported by the Juvenile Diabetes \nResearch Foundation (JDRF), addresses some of the specific obstacles to \nmoving this research forward as rapidly as possible, and I urge all of \nmy colleagues to sign on as cosponsors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/02/senate-section/article/S2005-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2005-S2006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 307--HONORING THE COUNTY OF CUMBERLAND, NORTH \n CAROLINA, ITS MUNICIPALITIES AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS AS THEY CELEBRATE \n            THE 250TH YEAR OF EXISTENCE OF CUMBERLAND COUNTY\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 307\n\n       Whereas for thousands of years before the European settlers \n     arrived, Cumberland County's streams and forests were home to \n     native peoples who lived in the area, hunted, farmed, and \n     buried their dead;\n       Whereas Cumberland County, located at the head of \n     navigation on the Cape Fear River, quickly became a strong \n     area of trade between the port city of Wilmington and the \n     lower Cape Fear River to the southeast and the Carolina back \n     country to the west;\n       Whereas the upper Cape Fear Valley in present Cumberland \n     County experienced an early migration of Highland Scots \n     beginning in 1739, many of whom settled in the area known as \n     ``The Bluff'' along side the Cape Fear River 4 miles south of \n     the Lower Little River;\n       Whereas in 1754, the area known as Cumberland County was \n     formed from lands carved from Bladen County and was named in \n     honor of William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, third son of \n     George II, King of England, an area which reflected a mixture \n     of ethnic and national backgrounds;\n       Whereas each municipality was individually chartered: \n     Falcon in 1913; Fayetteville in 1762; Godwin in 1905; Hope \n     Mills in 1891; Linden in 1913; Spring Lake in 1951; Stedman \n     in 1913; and Wade in 1913;\n       Whereas on June 20, 1775, 13 months before the Declaration \n     of Independence, a group of Cumberland County's active \n     patriots signed ``The Association'' later called the \n     ``Liberty Point Resolves'', a document that vowed to ``Go \n     forth and be ready to sacrifice our lives and fortunes to \n     secure her freedom and safety''; a marker at the point lists \n     the signers of ``The Association'';\n       Whereas the period of the American Revolution was a time of \n     divided loyalties in Cumberland County, and a considerable \n     portion of the population, especially Highland Scots, were \n     staunchly loyal to the British Crown, among them was the \n     famous Scottish heroine Flora McDonald;\n       Whereas African-American people, both slaves and free \n     citizens, were represented in the early population of \n     Cumberland County, and during the American Revolution several \n     of the county's free African-Americans fought for the patriot \n     cause; among the notables was the midwife Aunt Hannah Mallet \n     (1755-1857) who died at the age of 102; she delivered \n     hundreds of babies in her lifetime, and she typified the \n     courage and vital role of the early 19th-century African-\n     American community;\n       Whereas in 1783, the towns of Campbellton and Cross Creek \n     merged to become Fayetteville, the first town in the United \n     States named in honor of the Revolutionary War hero, Marquis \n     de Lafayette;\n       Whereas in November 1789, the North Carolina General \n     Assembly voted to adopt and ratify the United States \n     Constitution at the Market House in Fayetteville, then known \n     as the State House;\n       Whereas in 1789, the University of North Carolina, the \n     first State university charted\n\n[[Page S2006]]\n\n     in the United States, was chartered by the North Carolina \n     General Assembly in Fayetteville, it being the first State \n     university;\n       Whereas in 1793, the Fayetteville Independent Light \n     Infantry Company was organized in Cumberland County; it has \n     the distinction of being the oldest military unit in the \n     South in continuous existence;\n       Whereas in 1816, the Fayetteville Observer was founded as a \n     weekly newspaper; it is now published daily and is North \n     Carolina's oldest newspaper still in publication;\n       Whereas in 1825, the Marquis de Lafayette visited the city \n     named for him and stayed in the McRae family home that once \n     stood on the site of the Historic Courthouse on Gillespie \n     Street in Fayetteville;\n       Whereas in 1831, the Great Fire destroyed the State House \n     (the Market House) and many other buildings and caused more \n     damage than the 1871 Chicago fire or the 1906 San Francisco \n     earthquake;\n       Whereas in 1865, General William T. Sherman brought the \n     Union Army to Cumberland County, destroying the Confederate \n     arsenal and effectively bringing the county back into the \n     Union;\n       Whereas in 1867, 7 visionary African-American citizens of \n     Cumberland County paid about $136 for 2 lots on Gillespie \n     Street and formed the self-perpetuating Board of Trustees of \n     the Howard School for the education of African-American \n     youth; this school later became Fayetteville State University \n     (FSU), which now offers 41 undergraduate programs, 22 \n     graduate programs, and 1 doctoral program; FSU has 18 Central \n     Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA) and 2 National \n     Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championships;\n       Whereas in 1914, Babe Ruth, the New York Yankee great, hit \n     his first homerun as a professional at the old ballpark on \n     Gillespie Street in Cumberland County, and in doing so, the \n     19-year-old ``babe'' so amazed the crowd, that George Herman \n     Ruth was forever known by the nickname, ``Babe'', bestowed \n     upon him while playing in Cumberland County;\n       Whereas in 1918, Camp Bragg was established from lands \n     ceded from Cumberland County; it is now known as Fort Bragg, \n     home of the 18th Airborne Corps, the 82d Airborne Division, \n     and the United States Army Special Operations Command;\n       Whereas Fort Bragg was named for North Carolina native Lt. \n     General Braxton Bragg; Fort Bragg soldiers and their families \n     continue to be an integral part of the history and heritage \n     of Cumberland County;\n       Whereas in 1919, Pope Army Airfield was established and \n     remained part of the Army Air Corps until 1947 when the \n     United States Air Force was established; it was home to the \n     43d Airlift Wing and the 18th Air Support Operations Group; \n     Pope airmen and their families continue to be an integral \n     part of the history and heritage of Cumberland County;\n       Whereas on November 1, 1956, Methodist College was \n     chartered as a senior coeducational liberal arts college; it \n     has grown to more than 2,100 students who hail from 48 States \n     and 30 countries, graduated 8,145 students, and awarded \n     associate's, bachelor's, or master's degrees in 57 majors and \n     concentrations; Methodist College NCAA Division III athletic \n     teams have earned 24 national championship titles;\n       Whereas in 1961, Fayetteville Technical Community College \n     (FTCC) was founded as the Fayetteville Area Industrial \n     Education Center, with a faculty and staff of 9 people \n     serving 50 students, and has since evolved into a \n     comprehensive institution serving approximately 40,000 \n     students annually, offering more than 121 programs;\n       Whereas Cumberland County's 6th courthouse, circa 1924, \n     which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, \n     is being established and dedicated, pursuant to the county's \n     250th anniversary, as a gallery of early prominent members of \n     the local bar and elected county officials; and\n       Whereas Cumberland County and the municipalities of Falcon, \n     Fayetteville, Godwin, Hope Mills, Linden, Spring Lake, \n     Stedman, and Wade, along with civic groups, private \n     businesses and military partners, are joining together to \n     celebrate 250 years of history, culture, and diversity; the \n     celebration will take place March 26-28, 2004: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate honors the county of Cumberland, \n     North Carolina, its municipalities, and other community \n     partners for Cumberland County's 250th Anniversary \n     Celebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/02/senate-section/article/S2006-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2636.

Mr. President, there has been some conversation today about \nstatements made by people running for President on the Democratic side. \nToday, we had the person who appears to be the frontrunner for the \nnomination at this time, Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, who came and \nspoke before the Senate. He did an extremely good job of articulating \nhis feelings of the legislation pending before the Senate. At the same \ntime, he also outlined in a very brief fashion those things he thought \nwere wrong, in his view, as far as what was going on in America today.\n  I want the majority to know as the election proceeds toward November, \nwe in the Senate are going to do everything within our power to protect \nour nominee. By that I mean anything that is said outside this Capitol \nor inside this Capitol that reflects upon our nominee we are going to \nbe on this floor defending him.\n  We believe the issues are on our side, that they favor us, and we \nwant this campaign to be on the issues.\n  What has transpired during this Presidential primary season has been \nextremely important and good for the American people because the \nDemocratic candidates running for President have been able to place \ntheir views on the record, and the American people have accepted what \nthey have said about what is wrong with this country.\n  There have been debates--I do not know the number of them but a \nsignificant number of debates--where the American people have been able \nto hear how those seeking the Democratic nomination feel about our \ncountry. I want again to say whoever our nominee is, that person is \ngoing to get all the protection that is needed in the Senate. There \nwill be nothing said that is negative toward our candidate that will \nnot be responded to.\n  We feel we have had a primary season conducted with dignity and we \nare going to do everything we can to make sure the final months of this \ncampaign are conducted with dignity as far as the Democratic nominee is \nconcerned.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the question of whether or not the \nintelligence was flawed which was used so forcefully by the \nadministration prior to going to war as the reason for going to war is \na question which is going to consume the time of this body and a number \nof our committees for some time to come. It is a critically important \nquestion as to whether or not the intelligence was flawed, not just in \nterms of the accountability--which is so important if mistakes were \nmade, if exaggerations were undertaken in order to advance the decision \nto go to war--but also in terms of the future security of this Nation.\n  This country went to war, we were told, because Iraq had weapons of \nmass destruction. That was the reason that was given over and over \nagain by the administration. Whether or not there were other reasons, \nand there surely were, for that decision, which could be argued as a \nbasis for the decision, the facts are that the American people were \ntold it was the presence in Iraq of weapons of mass destruction which \nwas the basis for attacking that country.\n  When a decision is made to go to war based on intelligence, it is a \nfateful decision. It has ramifications and impacts way beyond the \ncurrent months and years. If the intelligence is as flawed as this \nintelligence was, we should find out why.\n  Whether people are glad we went to war or are not glad we went to \nwar, whether history will prove we should have waited until we had \ngreater support through the United Nations in order to avoid the kind \nof aftermath which we have seen, or not--we don't know what history is \ngoing to show in that regard--but regardless of the arguments back and \nforth as to the timing of it, the way in which it was handled, the \nfailure to galvanize the international community so we had a broad \narray of countries with us, including Muslim nations so we would not be \nthere as a Western occupying power with other Western nations after the \nmilitary success; whether or not there was adequate planning for the \naftermath, and I think it is obvious that there was not adequate \nplanning, but regardless of what position one takes on all of those \nissues, it is incumbent upon us to find out how in Heaven's name the \nintelligence could be so far off.\n  How could we have 120 top suspect sites for the presence of weapons \nof mass destruction that were high-level to medium-level sites, where \nthere was confidence that there were weapons of mass destruction either \nbeing stored or produced, and we batted zero for 120? How could we be \nso far off?\n  How is it possible that the CIA could tell us, as they did in their \nassessments, that there were chemical weapons and biological weapons \nand that a nuclear program was being undertaken again when, in fact, \nthat apparently is not the case? How is it possible that intelligence \ncan be as flawed as is this intelligence?\n  Again, regardless of what the arguments are on any side or any issue, \nI don't think any of us should be in the position of arguing that it is \nirrelevant to the future security of this Nation whether or not the \nintelligence upon which the decision to go to war was based is \nimportant. It is critically important.\n\n  Does North Korea have nuclear weapons or doesn't it have nuclear \nweapons? Should we put some credibility in the intelligence community's \nassessment of that? Where is Iran along the continuum of obtaining \nnuclear weapons? What are their intentions? Should we put confidence in \nthe intelligence community's assessment of that?\n  Whether or not we place confidence or make decisions based upon the \nintelligence community's assessment is critically important. The lives \nof young men and women, perhaps the life of this Nation, could be \ndependent upon intelligence which is being assessed by the intelligence \ncommunity. Life and death decisions are being made by the President of \nthe United States based on decisions and assessments and appraisals of \nthe intelligence community. When it is as wildly off as this \nintelligence community's assessments apparently were, then it seems to \nme we better find out for the future health of this country, not just \nin terms of trying to assess the accountability for past assessments.\n  Something happened to the intelligence after 9/11. The pre-2002 \nintelligence assessments relative to nuclear programs and biological \nprograms and chemical programs were different from the October 2002 \nNational Intelligence Estimate. Some of this has been set forth in the \nCarnegie Endowment's recent report. There are so many examples of where \nthe intelligence shifted on these critical issues after 9/11.\n  A few examples: On the reconstitution of the nuclear program after \n1998, the pre-2002 intelligence assessment was that Iraq had probably \nnot continued their research and development program relative to \nreconstituting a nuclear program after 1998. Yet in October 2002, the \nintelligence community said, yes, it has restarted its nuclear program \nafter the United Nations left in 1998. What happened between the pre-\n2002 intelligence assessment and the post-9/11 assessment?\n\n[[Page S2011]]\n\n  What about enriching uranium for use in nuclear weapons? Prior to \n2002, the assessment was that Baghdad may be attempting to acquire \nmaterials that could be used to reconstitute a nuclear weapons program. \nBut after 9/11, in the October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate, we \nhave, yes, Iraq has imported aluminum tubes and high-strength magnets. \nThe Department of Energy's disagreement with this conclusion was set \nforth, but the assessment of the intelligence community shifted after \n9/11.\n  Whether they attempted to purchase uranium from abroad, the same kind \nof shift in the intelligence assessment, there were no reports \nmentioning any attempts to acquire uranium prior to that 2002 \nassessment, but in 2002, October, suddenly the National Intelligence \nAssessment says Iraq has been trying to procure uranium ore and yellow \ncake. Again, disagreement from the Department of State, but that was \nthe assessment of the intelligence community, and on and on. We have \nthis kind of change that occurred in the intelligence assessments.\n  What is the explanation for that? What happened? There is no \nevidence, as the President has mentioned; there is no evidence that \nSaddam Hussein was part of the attack of 9/11, so what happened that \ncaused the intelligence community to shift its assessment of chemical, \nbiological, and nuclear programs after the 9/11 attack on us? That is \nsomething which we must find out.\n  We must make a determination--hopefully someday there will be an \noutside commission which will make a comprehensive review of this whole \nmatter--but, in any event, we must do the best we can through the \nIntelligence Committee.\n  I am making an effort, the Armed Services Committee, my staff, to \nlook into these issues, particularly as they relate to the question of \nhow intelligence affected the operations and the planning relative to \nour military effort in Iraq.\n  But we must make that decision. We have an obligation. This is not a \npartisan issue and it makes no difference to me whether this assessment \nis finished before the election or after the election. It must be made \nfor the health of this Nation, as to how our intelligence community, \nNo. 1, could be so totally wrong relative to the presence of weapons of \nmass destruction on Iraqi soil immediately prior to the war; and, No. \n2, how and why did the intelligence community shift its assessments so \nsignificantly after 9/11 from the assessments that occurred before 9/\n11?\n  There is another aspect of this which relates to the way in which \nintelligence was used or exaggerated by the policymakers. Here we have \nanother issue--an issue which is going to be looked at by the \nIntelligence Committee at least as far as the use of the intelligence \nis concerned up to the point where the war began. There are some recent \nstatements that I think also require explanation.\n  I have tried a number of times to find out how the Vice President \ncould have, about a month ago, made a statement relative to the vans \nthat were found in Iraq, that those vans were part of a mobile \nbiological weapons program. For the life of me, I do not understand how \nthe Vice President can make that statement when Dr. Kay who has looked \nat the van has said that there is a consensus in the intelligence \ncommunity--and I am now reading from Dr. Kay's answer to my question in \nthe Armed Services Committee--that the consensus opinion is that those \ntwo trailers were not intended for the production of biological \nweapons.\n  How is it that the Vice President of the United States at about the \nsame time that statement was made before the Armed Services Committee \nby the chief weapons inspector--that some trailers which were found in \nIraq are unrelated to a biological weapons program--would say the \nopposite in a very public forum? What is the basis for the Vice \nPresident's statement? I tried to find out. In fact, I wrote the Vice \nPresident the other day asking him: What is the basis for your \nstatement?\n  We should know. The American people should know when the Vice \nPresident says something as significant as that, that these particular \nvans which we have now gotten in our possession are, in fact, \nbiological weapons laboratories. In fact, what the Vice President said \non January 22 on NPR was:\n\n       I would deem that--\n\n  Here he is referring to those two vans--\n\n     conclusive evidence that Saddam did in fact have programs for \n     weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  Again, this is so totally opposite from what our chief weapons \ninspector has decided and said the consensus opinion is--that surely \nthe American public is entitled to an explanation from the Vice \nPresident.\n  What is the basis for his statement of January 22 on national radio? \nWhat is the basis, Mr. Vice President, for your statement? The American \npublic is entitled to know that. This is not some assistant secretary \nof some agency sitting in the bowels of the Pentagon or the bowels of \nsome other building. This is the Vice President of the United States \nwho is saying on national radio that we believe, in fact, that those \nsemitrailers were part of the biological weapons program, that they \nwere biological weapons vans. There is no explanation forthcoming, just \nsort of silence from the Office of the Vice President. We are entitled \nto more than that.\n  One possibility which the CIA's Director suggested when I asked him \nthe question was that, well, maybe the Vice President was using old \ninformation when he said that. If the Vice President of the United \nStates is making statements of significance based on old information, \nfirst, it seems to me he ought to say so and then say, Too bad that \nhappened, I will make sure it doesn't happen again.\n  But it is also kind of discouraging, if that is true. There are daily \nbriefings which I assume he is a part of--at least weekly briefings on \nthese critical issues. We have a chief weapons inspector who says those \nvans, according to the consensus opinion, are not part of and were not \npart of the production of biological weapons.\n  But what all this is part of is kind of what is going to be phase 2 \nof the Intelligence Committee's investigation which is the use of \nintelligence by the policymakers. Here the statements of our top \nleadership go beyond the intelligence in a number of ways. They are \nmuch more certain than the intelligence communities' assessments were.\n  For instance, the Vice President, on August 2002, said the following:\n\n       There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of \n     mass destruction. There is no doubt that he is amassing them \n     to use against our friends and against our allies and against \n     us.\n\n  We have this additional aspect which is now being looked into by the \nIntelligence Committee and again by my staff on the Armed Services \nCommittee as to how the administration could take the intelligence that \nwas given and then turn those less certain findings into certainties.\n  Our friend from Arizona, Senator Kyl, made the point earlier tonight \nthat there is a lot of uncertainty in intelligence, and he surely is \nright. But wow. It sure doesn't sound that way coming from the \nadministration prior to the war.\n  Vice President Cheney told Tim Russert: We know with absolute \ncertainty that Saddam is using his procurement system to acquire the \nequipment he needs in order to enrich uranium to build a nuclear \nweapon.\n  Secretary of State Colin Powell--and this will be my last comment--\nsaid at the U.N.: There can be no doubt that Saddam Hussein has \nbiological weapons.\n  The list of these statements where there is no doubt and there is \nabsolute certainty that the administration says exists about these \nprograms goes beyond what the intelligence communities' assessments \nwere. It is those statements of absolute certainty which, it seems to \nme, require an explanation as to what was the basis of those statements \nof absolute certainty and there being no doubt, particularly in light \nof the fact Senator Kyl pointed out that intelligence is, indeed, very \nuncertain and should be treated that way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Seamus Heaney, the Irish poet and Nobel \nlaureate, wrote lines that are destined for immortality:\n\n       History says, Don't hope on this side of the grave. But \n     then, once in a lifetime the longed for tidal wave of justice \n     can rise up, and hope and history rhyme.\n\n  We all long for that day when hope and history rhyme. But it is the \nspecial province of statecraft to try to make that rhyme.\n  As such, one way to look at foreign policy is to determine if our \npolicies do rhyme with history or whether they represent the triumph of \nhope over history. By history, I do not mean the strictly academic \nvariety. I mean the accumulation of insight and experience that we all \ncarry about. Perhaps it is better described as our rough sense of the \nway the world works.\n  It is particularly interesting to pose these questions in light of \nthe Bush foreign policy since so much of it seems to spring from \nideological hope, from robust attempts to reshape the world along \npredetermined lines.\n  Iraq, of course, is the crucial arena. It has been made so by the \nadministration.\n  Our immediate response to September 11 was to seek out and destroy \nthe terrorist apparatus that struck us. Our attack in Afghanistan was \naimed at the heart of al-Qaida and the rogue regime that provided it \nsanctuary. We understood very painfully that we could not grant these \nterrorists safe harbor. We had to act and we had to be prepared to act \npreemptively to destroy al-Qaida. The threat was clear and in the \ncontext of international terrorists like al-Qaida, the doctrine of \npreemption was not only compelling but also inescapable.\n  Operation Enduring Freedom, the demolition of the Taliban regime, and \nthe disruption of the al-Qaida infrastructure represented a shrewd use \nof military power to focus directly on an existential threat. The \nhistory, again, using my very nontechnical definition, clearly shows \nthat al-Qaida could not be deterred and toleration would simply invite \nfurther attack.\n  Ironically, having begun the destruction of al-Qaida in Afghanistan, \nthe administration quickly shifted its attention from the complete \ndestruction of the al-Qaida network to Iraq. Only in the past few weeks \nhas the Bush administration begun to realize that Afghanistan is far \nfrom secure. They are redoubling their military and political efforts \nto ensure that Afghanistan does not slide back into a failed state. \nStill, the President's recent budget request only provides about $1 \nbillion in funding for that effort, whereas commanders in the field \nhave said they will annually need $5 billion to ensure success.\n  Furthermore, regardless of the situation in Afghanistan, and indeed \nanywhere else, the Bush administration has never lost its preoccupation \nwith Saddam Hussein and his Baathist regime.\n  Some may recall that in January of 1998, Secretary Rumsfeld, \nSecretary Wolfowitz, and other prominent neoconservatives wrote to \nPresident Clinton urging him to use military force to remove Saddam \nHussein. In their words:\n\n       The only acceptable strategy is one that eliminates the \n     possibility that Iraq would be able to use weapons of mass \n     destruction. In the near term, this means a willingness to \n     undertake military action as diplomacy is clearly failing. In \n     the long term, it means removing Saddam Hussein and his \n     regime from power. That now needs to become the aim of \n     American foreign policy.\n\n  This letter predated the attack on Iraq by 5 years. It predated \nSeptember 11 by more than 3 years.\n  With the publication of the first glimpses inside the Bush \nadministration, this preoccupation with Iraq becomes more obvious. \nFormer Secretary of the Treasury Paul O'Neill recounts that at the \nfirst meeting of the National Security Council on January 30, 2001, the \ndiscussion quickly vaulted over nagging issues of the conflict between \nIsrael and the Palestinian Authority and landed squarely on Iraq. In an \napparently scripted exchange, Condoleezza Rice and Vice President \nCheney and George Tenet not only led the discussion but also concluded \nwith an examination of grainy photos purporting to show what the CIA \nthought was a plant producing chemical or biological materials for \nweapons manufacture. According to O'Neill, ``ten days in, and it was \nabout Iraq.''\n  September 11 did not put Iraq in the administration's gunsights. It \nwas always there. It was there as a challenge, a personal one for the \nPresident, and in the view of neoconservatives, it was there as an \nopportunity to make hope and history rhyme.\n\n  But in focusing almost exclusively on Iraq, the administration, in my \nview, disregarded a great deal of history. Again, I use the term \nhistory colloquially. The justification for action was based more on \nassumptions than evidence. The planning for their actions was based \nmore on hopes than experience. The end of the cold war and the demise \nof the Soviet Union unshackled our military power so that we are \nunbeatable in any conventional battle against any conventional foe.\n  However, it has not reversed a century in which empires collapsed and \nforeign colonies began a troubled but independent road. Our military \npower may be unchecked by any military adversary, but it is exercised \nin a world that has come to distrust the unilateral use of force and \ndisbelief of the motives of those who wield such force.\n  The administration's insistence on an essentially unilateral approach \nto confronting Iraq not only increased our effort both militarily and \neconomically, but it also defied the worldwide consensus that without \nan immediate threat, the unilateral action of a great power against a \nlesser state is a vanished aspect of the colonial epic.\n  Today, the United States is fervently trying to maintain the mantle \nof liberator and avoid the label of occupier. In large part, this is \ndue to the overwhelming presence of the United States unleavened by a \nbroad array of allies or the significant presence of the United States \nor United Nations or NATO in Iraq.\n  In contrast, multinational operations in places such as the Balkans \nmanaged to avoid the stigma of occupation and insurgency for almost a \ndecade. A multilateral attack is not a talisman that will guarantee \nsuccess, but it is more congruent with a world that has rejected the \ncolonial solution in favor of multinational action.\n  The administration's rationale for a preemptive and virtually \nunilateral operation against Iraq rested on a faithful devotion to \ntheir preconceived notions and a strained reading of available \nintelligence. One of the more thoughtful and evenhanded military \nanalysts, Anthony Cordesman, at the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies has accurately summarized the record of the \nadministration's intelligence activities leading up to Operation Iraqi \nFreedom.\n  In his words:\n\n       [T]here are many indications that the U.S. intelligence \n     community came under pressure to accept reporting by Iraqi \n     opposition forces with limited credibility, and in some \n     cases, a history of actively lying to either exaggerate their \n     own importance or push the U.S. towards a war to overthrow \n     Saddam Hussein. In what bore a striking resemblance to \n     similar worst case interpretations of the global threat from \n     the proliferation of ballistic missiles under the Rumsfeld \n     Commission, U.S. policymakers not only seem to have pushed \n     for the interpretation that would best justify military \n     action, but to have focused on this case as if it were a \n     reality, rather than a possibility.\n       In the U.S., this pressure seems to have come primarily \n     from the Office of the Vice President and the Office of the \n     Secretary of Defense, but it seems clear that the Bush \n     administration as a whole sought intelligence that would \n     support its case in going to war, and this had a significant \n     impact on the intelligence community from 2002-onwards.\n\n  The administration did not use intelligence to help make a difficult \ndecision. It used intelligence to sell a preconceived notion. The long-\nterm fixed\n\n[[Page S2013]]\n\nview of the administration held that deterrence and international \ninspectors were inherently incapable of containing Saddam. Only the \nelimination of the regime could suffice. Moreover, regime change, in \ntheir view, could have the added benefit of precipitating a \ntransformation of the entire region.\n  In effect, what the President and the administration did is present a \nfalse dichotomy to the American people--two choices, when there are \nmany more. The two choices were: Attack Iraq or do nothing. In fact, \nthere are many other things we could have done and perhaps should have \ndone, including give the U.N. inspectors more time to search. They \nmight have come to the same conclusion that David Kay did: there are no \nweapons of mass destruction in Iraq. We could have used not only the \nlegitimacy but also the cooperation of the United Nations if we had \npursued a course of diplomacy. But the President saw only two options: \nDo nothing or attack Iraq.\n  Of course, we could not do nothing; indeed, we were not doing \nnothing. We should have been actively engaged in containment, and not \njust containment but enforcing the U.N. resolution with inspectors on \nthe ground. We should recall there were U.N. inspectors on the ground \ninside Iraq and the administration, through their actions, had those \ninspectors recalled prior to the inception of the military operations. \nThat is a result of this preoccupation with Saddam, the destruction of \nhis regime, the triumph of hope over history.\n  Then in planning for post-hostilities, the administration most \nclearly let its hopes triumph over history. They bet that Iraqi \ngratitude, together with a government of exiles, would provide for a \ncheap and easy exit strategy. They ignored a history of antagonism \namong the Sunni, the Shia, and the Kurds. They spoke of a rapidly \nemerging democracy and market economy in Iraq, a country whose civic \nlife and social institutions had been suppressed for many years. They \ninsinuated exiles of dubious reputations, like Chalabi, who do not \ncommand the respect of the Iraqi people. The administration entrusted \npost-hostility planning to the Department of Defense, not for their \nexpertise, but for their ideological correctness.\n\n  One other aspect of the administration's hopes is that our operations \nin Iraq would have a transformative effect on the region, if not the \nworld. They saw a democratic, market-oriented Iraq as an irresistible \nattraction and example to the masses of Arabs who hunger for a better \nway of life. Our success in Iraq would be emulated either by \nenlightened leaders or rebellious streets. Since we have yet to succeed \nin creating this new Iraq, it is hard to judge its transformative \nvalue. In the very short run, the jury seems to be out.\n  Furthermore, our engagement in Iraq has limited our strategic \nflexibility and narrowed our strategic focus. We are paying \ninsufficient attention to a place that is more likely than Iraq to \nproduce that dreaded intersection of ``nukes'' and terrorists; and that \nplace is North Korea.\n  We know the North Koreans have nuclear material and the ability to \nmake much more of it, if they have not done so already. Although there \ndoes not appear to be any direct links between North Korea and al-Qaida \nor other terrorist organizations, the North Koreans have a disturbing \nhistory of weapons proliferation. Inept at economic development, they \nhave become too adept at trading dangerous weapons to stay afloat or as \na means to underscore their demands for international aid.\n  A few days ago, we concluded another round of international talks \nwith the North Koreans without any apparent breakthrough. As \nencouraging as these discussions may seem, success--meaning the \ncomplete and verifiable elimination of nuclear material and nuclear \nweapons held by North Korea--can come, in my view, only with more \nresolute and determined leadership by the President. To date, Iraq \nseems to have monopolized the effective attention of the President and \nhis inner circle. Failure to resolve the situation in North Korea \nthrough diplomacy will result in an intolerable situation that could \nprompt the consideration of military action. A military option is not \nappealing, and it may be extraordinarily difficult to carry out with \nthe current open-ended and demanding commitment to Iraq.\n  In addition, there has been little progress between the Israelis and \nthe Palestinians. In another regional problem area, the Iranians have \nopened their nuclear program to more robust international inspection \nbut still refuse to moderate their domestic policies and their \ninternational rhetoric. Indeed, the hardliners in Iran recently won an \nelection, giving them more clout and marginalizing the reformers within \nthat country, in the wake of our attack against Iraq.\n  Libya presents an interesting case. Our military success seems to \nhave focused their attention on repairing their relationship with the \nWest. One must be grateful any time a regime effectively renounces \nweapons of mass destruction. Nevertheless, Qadhafi's actions seem more \nlike self-preservation than democratization. And, as previously \ndiscussed, the ``shock and awe'' in Iraq did not influence the Afghanis \nto be more cooperative. In fact, we lost ground in Afghanistan to \nreconstituted insurgent forces. In the longer run, these hopes of \ndemocratic reform and economic renewal in the region and throughout the \nworld will battle historic and cultural forces that may yield, but not \nwithout a struggle and not without time.\n\n  There are signs that even the administration is coming to recognize \nthat history has overtaken some of their hopes. To minimize the stigma \nof occupier, the Coalition Provisional Authority has accelerated the \ntransition to sovereignty with a target date of June 30, a date that is \nmore difficult to achieve with each passing day. It remains unclear who \nthey will be returning this sovereignty over to. An interim \nconstitution was adopted apparently today, but there is still a great \ndeal of uncertainty as to who will be the ruling authority and \nultimately how this sovereignty will be passed--truly passed--to the \nIraqi people.\n  In recognition of the economic reality of Iraq, the CPA has quietly \nshelved plans to privatize the Iraqi economy, plans they had initially. \nNow this would be a wrenching exercise in unemployment since almost \nevery Iraqi directly or indirectly seems to work for a state industry \nor governmental entity.\n  The CPA is also deferring serious land reform in a country where land \nwas expropriated from traditional owners and bestowed upon supporters \nof Saddam. The CPA also seems quietly poised to allow the Kurds to \ndevelop an autonomous region under a loose federation, belying the \ninitial commitment to a fully integrated Iraqi state. And still \noutstanding is whether the Shia majority will ultimately accept the \ngoverning arrangements for the new Iraq.\n  And, having assumed the burden of Iraq, none of these recent \npragmatic adjustments are themselves without great dangers. A hasty \ntransfer of sovereignty could lead to a government without legitimacy \nor one that quickly morphs into a religious and authoritarian regime \nthat does not share our enthusiasm for democracy. This political \nprocess becomes an inviting target for insurgents who see disorder as \ntheir key ally. Leaving economic restructuring to the Iraqis is \nprobably leaving it undone. Allowing the Kurds to create an autonomous \nor semiautonomous region will cause consternation within Turkey while \nadding to the difficulties of the new central government in Baghdad.\n  This administration has committed the Nation to operations in Iraq. \nAnd we cannot fail. Let me emphasize that again. We cannot fail. But we \nneed to recognize that these ideological preoccupations that have led \nus to Iraq have very real costs. We are spending approximately $4 \nbillion a month to continue our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the \nbulk of it being spent in Iraq. These costs do not include the \nheartbreaking loss of American service men and women.\n  One must question a strategy in which you cannot afford to fail, but \nyou may not win anything. But, questioning aside, one has little choice \nbut to support our forces in the field and insist upon a more pragmatic \napproach.\n  First, the administration must increase the overall size of our land \nforces, not temporarily, but in anticipation of a long deployment in \nboth Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n[[Page S2014]]\n\n  Last fall, I was able to propose an amendment with my colleague, \nChuck Hagel, to increase the size of our Army by 10,000 soldiers. It \npassed on the floor of the Senate but was stripped out of the \nconference report at the insistence of the administration. They, at \nthat point, failed to recognize the need for more military personnel. \nSince that time, the administration has indicated that they now \nrecognize a need for additional forces in the Army. But they still \ncontinue to insist that it can be paid for out of supplemental \nappropriations.\n  I believe we have to prepare for a long stay in Iraq. These new \nmilitary personnel should be paid for through the budget process, not \nsupplemental appropriations here and there on an irregular basis.\n  I believe also that in addition to increasing our overall end \nstrength, the administration must increase the number of forces in Iraq \nand direct those forces to the protection of the Iraqi people, not just \nto hunt for insurgents. Today, the greatest threat to the successful \nreconstruction of Iraq is the rampant violence that engulfs the \ncountry. Only a small portion of this violence is directed against \nAmerican forces. The greatest portion is directed against the Iraqi \npeople, creating a daily climate of violence facing every Iraqi which \nsaps their will to remake their country and support our efforts.\n  Today is a prime example. Over 140 Shiites were killed when bombs \nexploded in Karbala and Baghdad during a religious holy day. However, \nthe Department of Defense still stubbornly clings to the proposition \nthat more American troops won't help. Rather, they claim that \nindigenous Iraqi security forces are the answer. So they have created, \nmostly on paper, Iraqi security forces that are inadequate and \ninsufficient for the critical months ahead.\n  ``Iraqization'' has dim echoes of ``Vietnamization.'' Both are \npolitical responses to real security problems. One failed; the other is \nof dubious value at the moment.\n  Secondly, the administration must candidly and promptly acknowledge \nthe huge costs that are necessary to pursue our international \nobjectives. The recently submitted Presidential budget does not include \nany funds for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The President is \nattempting to rely on previous supplemental appropriations until the \nelection. Recently, the chiefs of the Army, the Marine Corps, and the \nAir Force admitted they would run out of funds on October 1 for \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan. More recently, reports have \nsurfaced that the services may indeed run out of these funds sooner \nthan that. They are now robbing Peter to pay Paul as they scavenge \nother accounts to fund operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  In addition to funding for our military forces directly, we should \nunderstand even at the most optimal success level, military forces will \nbuy you time to deal with the more fundamental problems that cause \nterrorism, that cause unstable governments, unstable regions. Those \ncosts are also huge: costs in economic development assistance, costs in \neducational assistance. Those costs have to be factored in also. They \nare not included effectively or sufficiently in the budget the \nPresident sent to us.\n  As I said, this is not only poor budget policy with regard to \nmilitary forces, but if we cannot even honestly budget for military \noperations, how can we marshal the will and the dollars to reinforce \nmilitary success with the resources for economic development that will \naddress the root causes of the animosity we are confronting.\n  One measure of the wisdom of any strategy is whether that strategy is \nsustainable. The administration's choice of a virtually unilateral \npreemptive attack followed by long-term and expensive nation building \nis not a strategy that can be easily duplicated. It is especially \ndifficult to sustain without broad-based international support. \nIronically, our preoccupation with Iraq might serve as an inhibition as \nwe confront other adversaries. Moreover, our military advantages simply \nbuy us time, precious time, to deal with fundamental issues that create \nthe climate in which terrorism thrives.\n  Our attention to these issues of education and economic development \nis necessary now and not just in Iraq. These, too, are expensive \nundertakings that require international cooperation with strong \nAmerican leadership. We face great challenges around the world and here \nat home. But Americans are not strangers to great challenges. We will \nendure. And with wisdom and courage, we will prevail--the courage we \nwitness every day in the extraordinary valor of our fighting forces.\n  But the challenges before us require a strategic vision grounded on \nattention to the compelling threats we face, not the ideological \nimpulses that stir our hearts. These challenges can best be faced with \nother nations, not alone. These challenges require huge resources and a \nlong-term commitment, not budgetary gimmicks in the short run.\n  Until the administration acts on these basic principles, our response \nto real threats will be hobbled by ideology rather than focused by \nexperience.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Florida is recognized for \n30 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to start by saying I believe \nour colleagues who scheduled this debate today have done a great \nservice to this body and to the American people. The topic of the \nUnited States in the world and specifically the United States in the \nwar on terror is of great importance to the American people. They \ndeserve to have the kind of elevated discussion we are giving this \nevening.\n  This should not be a partisan issue. Rather, it is an issue of our \nnational and personal security. Never in our Nation's history have we \nbeen so dependent on credible intelligence for our safety and security \nas we are today.\n  The real test all of us will face as policymakers on behalf of the \npeople of the United States will be how wise we are in identifying the \nproblems we need to address and how willing we are to cast away the \nanchor of the status quo and initiate real reforms. In both of those \nefforts, one of our strongest assets will be our American intelligence.\n  If we were to ask any person who has a reasonable knowledge of the \ncapabilities of terrorists and the extent of America's vulnerability \nthe question, what is the likelihood the United States of America will \nsuffer another successful terrorist attack on our homeland within the \nnext 5 years, the consensus answer is certainly going to be almost a \n100 percent likelihood of a successful attack.\n  That is a sad but true fact. It is a sad but true fact which is \nunnecessary. In part, it is unnecessary because we need to initiate the \nreforms within our intelligence community. Reforms we have learned from \nthe experience of September 11, and learned again in the war against \nIraq and, I suggest, we will learn again in the incidents that have led \nup to the events in Haiti, the lack of transforming our intelligence \ncommunity to a set of agencies that can effectively understand, \ninterpret, and then assist policymakers in making decisions that will \nmake us more secure, those reforms have not been made.\n  It is also unfortunately true there has been a lack of \naccountability. We have had major intelligence failures in the last 3 \nyears. Yet, as of today, virtually no one has been held accountable for \nthose. What signal does that send to our agency and our adversaries, \nthat we are willing to tolerate performance that is less than \nacceptable, or to benefit by performance which is beyond the call of \nduty, and the former is not sanctioned and the latter is not \nrecognized.\n  What I think we are facing this evening is a series of deficits that \nwill prove as significant to the future of the American people as the \nskyrocketing budget deficit of this administration will be to our \neconomic future. These deficits include a deficit in judgment. The \nreality is in the spring of 2002, the United States and our coalition \npartners had the terrorist group which had perpetrated the tragedy of \nSeptember 11 on the ropes in Afghanistan. But a decision was made in \nthe early spring--a decision which military officials\n\n[[Page S2015]]\n\nclose to its implementation describe as an ending of the war on terror \nin Afghanistan and a substitution of a manhunt in Afghanistan and \nPakistan, and a redirection of American intelligence and military \npersonnel and resources to commence the war in Iraq.\n  This was more than a year before the war actually started. If you \nwill read the front page of this past Sunday's New York Times, it talks \nabout the fact that we are now, 2 years later, beginning to reintensify \nour efforts in Afghanistan, and we are returning to Afghanistan those \nvery military and intelligence resources that were shifted to Iraq in \nthe beginning of the spring of 2002.\n  So the consequence of making a decision that our greater enemy was \nSaddam Hussein than the enemy which had already shown the capability, \nthe will, and the presence in the United States to effectively strike \nus on September 11 has been to allow our greater enemy to become yet \nstronger.\n\n  Al-Qaida is a powerful network today. It is a powerful network which \nis less hierarchical, more entrepreneurial, more diffuse, more \ndifficult to attack--especially as al-Qaida cells form alliances with \nother radical Islamic groups. We missed the opportunity in the spring \nof 2002 to have cut off the head of this snake because we exercised \nunacceptably poor judgment as to which was the greater danger to the \npeople of the United States.\n  What is the report card on that decision of judgment? I quote from a \nstatement made by the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Mr. \nGeorge Tenet, on Tuesday of last week. This is what the leader of our \nAmerican intelligence community said:\n\n       . . . We have made notable strides. But do not \n     misunderstand me. I am not suggesting that al-Qaida is \n     defeated. It is not. We are still at war. This is a learning \n     organization that remains committed to attacking the United \n     States, its friends and allies.\n\n  Continuing to quote from the director of the CIA:\n\n       Successive blows to al-Qaida's central leadership has \n     transformed the organization into a loose collection of \n     regional networks that operate almost autonomously. These \n     regional components have demonstrated their operational \n     prowess in the past year.\n       The sites of their attacks span the entire reach of al-\n     Qaida--Morocco, Kenya, Turkey, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, \n     Afghanistan, Pakistan, Indonesia.\n       And al-Qaida seeks to influence the regional networks with \n     operational training, consultations, and money. . . .\n\n  You should not take the fact that these attacks occurred abroad to \nmean the threat to the United States homeland has waned. As al-Qaida \nand associated groups undertook these attacks overseas, detainees \nconsistently talked about the importance the group still attaches to \nstriking the main enemy: the United States.\n  In conclusion, the Director of Central Intelligence made this \nchilling observation:\n\n       The steady growth of Osama bin Laden's anti-U.S. sentiment \n     through the wider Sunni extremist movement, and the broad \n     dissemination of al-Qaida's destructive expertise, ensure \n     that a serious threat will remain for the foreseeable \n     future--with or without al-Qaida in the picture.\n\n  That is the residue of the decision to allow the snake of al-Qaida to \nregenerate itself because we determined that the greater enemy to the \nUnited States--the enemy which had the greater capability to threaten \nthe people of the United States of America--was Saddam Hussein. We have \npaid and we will pay a significant price for that flawed judgment.\n  There is also a deficit in credibility. Once the administration made \nthe decision at least as early as the spring of 2002--and probably \nearlier--it used incredible information to convince the Congress and \nthe American people to support that invasion.\n  To pick one example which has been widely reported, the \nadministration knew, or should have known, that it was using misleading \ninformation about Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, about yellow \ncake from Niger, about the existence of tubes which could be used for \ncentrifuges to make nuclear products, and about the connections of \nSaddam Hussein's regime with the tragedy of 9/11.\n  On several occasions, it was a leading figure within the \nadministration, including the Vice President of the United States, who \nwent to the intelligence agencies, asked for further information on the \nspecific charge relative to Saddam Hussein's status as a producer and \nuser of weapons of mass destruction, received from the intelligence \nagencies a report indicating it was a fabrication, and yet the \nadministration continued to recycle incredible misinformation.\n  The administration's fondness for calling Iraq the new front in the \nwar on terror has become a self-fulfilling proposition. There is \nlittle, if any, evidence that Saddam Hussein had ties to al-Qaida and \nthat terrorist networks were active in the sections of Iraq that were \ncontrolled by Saddam Hussein.\n  What now? Now we have created chaos in Iraq, and in spite of the \nbravery and professionalism of our troops, we have seen a situation in \nwhich the terrorist organizations which did not exist in Iraq prior to \nthe war have now become serious threats to the stability of that \ncountry and to the lives of American fighting men and women.\n  This is how the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, VADM \nLowell Jacoby, described the situation in Iraq when he testified before \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday of last week:\n\n       Foreign fighters who have entered Iraq since the end of the \n     war have carried out some of the most significant attacks, \n     including suicide bombings. Left unchecked, Iraq has the \n     potential to serve as a training ground for the next \n     generation of terrorists.\n\n  There was minimal to no al-Qaida influence in Iraq before the war. \nNow, and this is credible, al-Qaida has found a new base of operations \nin Iraq. There is also a deficit of trust in the American people. This \ngreat democracy has had, as one of its fundamental values, that the \npeople of America will serve their role as citizens only if they are \nfully informed about the operations of their Government. But why does \nthis administration not want to let the people know the truth about our \nforeign policy and about the decisionmaking that takes place in forming \nthat foreign policy?\n  This President lacks a basic respect for the common sense of the \nAmerican people and relies excessively on secrecy, not to protect the \nnational interests but to avoid political embarrassment.\n  I cochaired the House-Senate joint inquiry into the intelligence \nfailures that preceded September 11. Our joint committee produced a \nlengthy report, some 800 pages, which focused on, among other things, \nthe findings relative to the support which one or more foreign \ngovernments had provided to some, if not all, of the 19 terrorists.\n  The executive branch, after 7 months of examining our report, \ninsisted on censoring the 27 pages of our report that contain the most \nimportant findings about that foreign support. It reached this level of \nabsurdity. The Ambassador of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, responding to \nmedia speculation that it was his government mentioned in those \n27 pages, pleaded with the President and his administration that the \nfull report be released. ``How can I defend my kingdom against attacks \nof treacherous nature unless I can know what is the basis of those \nattacks?'' It was not just the Ambassador of the Kingdom of Saudi \nArabia. The Foreign Minister of the Kingdom flew to Washington to plead \nfor the declassification, for the release of this information so that \nhe could also defend the honor of the Kingdom.\n\n  The President refused that request even before the Foreign Minister \nhad reached the White House. Are we supposed to believe there wasn't \nsome coordination of efforts, that there were private assurances of \nmaintaining the status quo despite public pleas for release?\n  This President has shown that he does not believe the American people \nhave the right nor the ability to effectively utilize information which \nwill help them to understand who to hold accountable and to participate \nin reforms necessary for their security.\n  These are some of the deficits we have seen as a result of the events \nbefore and particularly after September 11, that we have seen in the \npreparation for the war in Iraq, and which we may well see repeated in \nthe circumstances leading up to the current anarchy that grips Haiti.\n  Again, I conclude by saying how pleased I am that Senator Kyl and \nother colleagues have given us the chance to have this discussion. We, \ntoo, have a responsibility to the American people to offer them the \nbest security\n\n[[Page S2016]]\n\nthat the Government can provide. There is no cave, there is no spider \nhole that we will be able to hide in to escape that responsibility \nshould there be another terrorist attack on our homeland and we have \nnot utilized the information of our previous failures to make our \nNation more secure.\n  Let us look in the mirror. The face we see will share the \nresponsibility for the loss of life and for the deficits I have \noutlined which are unacceptable in our democratic society.\n  Before I conclude, I would like to say that I believe the value of \nthis debate has indicated the value of similar debates on other issues \nthat have wide public concern. I will soon seek unanimous consent that \nwe schedule time for a debate of this nature on the floor of the Senate \non a regular basis for the remainder of this session.\n  I propose that the next issue to be discussed be our budget deficit, \nthe inheritance of debt that we are going to leave to our people. The \nsuggestion made recently by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board \nthat we make tax cuts permanent while we also cut benefits for Social \nSecurity and Medicare could help in framing the choices that we will \nhave in dealing with this budget deficit.\n  The American people deserve from this, the greatest deliberative body \nin the world, to pay attention to their future. They deserve to know \nthat we serve their interests with sound judgment, with credibility, \nand with respect for those who have given us the opportunity to serve \nthem.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida yields the floor. \nDoes the Senator suggest the absence of a quorum?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator is recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from the other side \nof the aisle for giving us this opportunity to discuss the matters \nsurrounding the Iraq war, a war in which we are still engaged, a war in \nwhich Americans are losing their lives and their limbs on an almost \ndaily basis. I am sure my colleagues have attended funerals, as I have \nin my own State, of brave men who did not return from that war alive. \nWe all know the human cost that has been involved.\n  A number of us were at Walter Reed Hospital 2 weeks ago for an \nevening with brave men and women who have lost limbs and health, and in \nsome cases will not ever be able to live fully normal lives because of \nthe terrible devastation wreaked on their bodies by the war in Iraq. So \nwhat we are talking about tonight is something of enormous importance, \nsomething we should have talked about far more often in the past months \nand year than we have. I attempted back in the first months of 2003 to \nget this body to address some of these critical issues, questions about \nthe information we had been provided even though we had voted \npreviously in October of 2002 on this resolution that the President \nrequested the majority of this body authorize, along with the House, to \ninitiate a war at a time of his determination. But in the weeks \npreceding that I tried in vain, as did some of my colleagues, to ask \nthe majority leader to bring this matter before the Senate, before the \nAmerican people again. Unfortunately we were not able to. The decision \nwas made not to create the time and the opportunity to do so.\n\n  Better late than never. This is much later than it should have been. \nI look forward to this opportunity in the weeks and months ahead \nbecause, as I understood from the Senator from Arizona, who was \ncoordinating the time the Republican caucus used before we were given a \nchance to reply, that whenever the questions were raised, challenges \nwere raised about the use or the misuse of intelligence information by \nthe President of the United States and by his administration, there \nwould be these occasions to discuss those matters again in the future. \nIf that is the case, then I look forward to those opportunities because \nthose questions should be raised. They have been raised before.\n  The American people have a right to know the truth, the facts about \nthese matters. Those who have lost sons and daughters over in Iraq, \nthose whose sons and daughters are serving there now, all of us whose \nlives, whose children, and grandchildren will bear the consequences of \nthese profoundly important decisions that have affected not only the \nUnited States and our national security but the stability of the entire \nworld have a right to know the truth.\n  Let's have these debates and these considerations as frequently as \npossible and air these matters fully, particularly since the \ncommissions that have been established--the most recent one, by the \nPresident himself singlehandedly--are being precluded from addressing \nmany of these issues like the misuse, as has been alleged, of \nintelligence information by high intelligence officials. That \ncommission will not be allowed to investigate those matters. It will \nnot have the authority to subpoena documents and information, \ninvestigating those matters. We will remain in the dark as those of us \non the Senate Armed Services Committee on which I serve will remain in \nthe dark despite our requests repeatedly to have that committee \ninvestigate these matters under its jurisdiction. At one point the \ndistinguished chairman of that committee, Senator Warner, a man for \nwhom I have the greatest respect, one of the finest of the men and \nwomen with whom I have had the privilege of serving in this body over \nmy 3 years, suggested on a Sunday talk show that would be the \nappropriate purview of the committee and that should be investigated to \nits determination of the facts and truth and then, from all accounts, \nwas forcefully dissuaded from that position by higher level officials \nin the administration who did not want that kind of investigation.\n  So if we can't get the facts because we can't get committees of the \nSenate to look into these matters, if we can't get the facts because \nthe President's own hand-picked commission is going to be prevented by \nhim from investigating and reviewing these matters, then let's use \nthese occasions here on the Senate floor, even if we are going to be, \nas the word was used, ambushed by the Republican caucus on these \nmatters. That was reported last week. This was going to be a big \nsurprise last Thursday. It was reported in one of the Hill newspapers \nand evidently it was decided to postpone it.\n\n  Today, after we talked, even at our caucus lunch today, the \nDemocratic caucus lunch at 1 o'clock today, based on the information \nthe Democratic leader received from the majority leader, we were going \nto finish the resolution of the bill before us and then we were going \nto turn to another piece of legislation. Lo and behold, we found out \nliterally as members of the Republican caucus took the floor this \nafternoon that this was going to be the subject for debate.\n  But so be it. If you want to ambush us on this topic, then do it as \nfrequently as possible so we can present to the American people all the \nfacts, facts they may not receive in any other way.\n  Let's go back a minute and review the bidding on this whole matter. \nLet's go back to January of 2002. Mr. Karl Rove, senior adviser to the \nPresident, political strategist, was quoted as telling a Republican \npolitical gathering that the winning issue for the Republicans in \nNovember of 2002, at the midterm election, would be ``the war.'' By \nthat at the time he meant the war against al-Qaida, against the Taliban \nin Afghanistan. But evidently in June of 2002, according to published \nreports based on an interview with the chief of staff of the White \nHouse, Andrew Card, published in the New York Times on September 7 of \n2002, but referring back to a decision that was, according to Mr. Card, \nmade in June of that year, 3 months earlier, to bring the spotlight \nonto this supposed immediate, desperate, urgent threat to the national \nsecurity of the United States and the safety of our people by Saddam \nHussein and his regime in Iraq, the question was asked of Mr. Card by \nthe reporter, why, then, was there this delay until then right before \nand then right after\n\n[[Page S2017]]\n\nLabor Day of 2002, a good 3 months later, to bring this matter to the \nattention of Congress and to the American people. Mr. Card's answer, \nand I quote, was, ``Well, from a marketing standpoint you don't bring \nout your new products in August.''\n  About two sentences later he indicated also the President was on \nvacation in August. So, instead, we were all, I think, startled--this \nSenator was certainly surprised to hear from the Vice President, Vice \nPresident Cheney, at two conventions of former men and women of the \narmed services in the last week of August of 2002, where he spoke to \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars, and he announced, ``Simply stated, there \nis no doubt that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction.''\n  The President himself then elaborated on these claims time and time \nagain. He conjured up the most serious of threats to this country. On \nSeptember 26 of 2002, at the time when this body was being pressured to \nrush to a vote about authorizing a war in Iraq, the President, after \nmeeting with Members of Congress on that date, said:\n\n       The danger to our country is grave. The danger to our \n     country is growing. The Iraqi regime possesses biological and \n     chemical weapons. . . .The regime is seeking a nuclear bomb, \n     and with fissile material, could build one within a year.\n\n  He continued on that day to say:\n\n       The dangers we face will only worsen from month to month \n     and from year to year. To ignore these threats is to \n     encourage them. When they have fully materialized, it may be \n     too late to protect ourselves and our friends and our \n     allies. By then the Iraqi dictator would have the means to \n     terrorize and dominate the region. Each passing day could \n     be the one on which the Iraqi regime gives anthrax or VX \n     or someday a nuclear weapon to a terrorist ally.\n\n  On October 7, just 4 days before the October 11 vote in the Senate on \nthe war resolution, the President said:\n\n       We know that Iraq and the al-Qaida terrorist network share \n     a common enemy--the United States of America. We know that \n     Iraq and al-Qaida have had high-level contacts that go back a \n     decade.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       We've learned that Iraq has trained al-Qaida members in \n     bombmaking and poisons and deadly gases. Alliance with \n     terrorists could allow the Iraqi regime to attack America \n     without leaving any fingerprints.\n\n  He also elaborated on claims of Iraq's nuclear weapons program when \nhe said on October 7 of that year:\n\n       The evidence indicates that Iraq is reconstituting its \n     nuclear weapons program. Saddam Hussein has held numerous \n     meetings with Iraqi nuclear scientists, a group he calls his \n     ``nuclear mujahideen''--his holy warriors. If the Iraqi \n     regime is able to produce, buy, or steal an amount of highly-\n     enriched uranium a little larger than a single softball, it \n     could have a nuclear weapon in less than a year.\n\n  At that time, 4 days thereafter, the Senate voted historically and, I \nbelieve, having voted against that resolution, erroneously to authorize \nthe war with the determination of the President--on a resolution which \nI believed and still believe is unconstitutional, was premature and, \nwhich has ultimately turned out to be the case, unfounded.\n  These assertions continued during the fall and then into the new \nyear. Of course, Secretary of State Colin Powell went before the United \nNations and stated that there were thousands of tons of these strains \nof botulism, of nerve gas agents, of botox, and other substances that \nwere of such enormous quantities that they would have been easily \nidentified by satellite surveillance or by the United Nations weapons \ninspectors then in Iraq, though at the time none had been found.\n  The Vice President again on March 16, just before the eve of the \ndecision by the President to invade Iraq, leveled a serious new \nallegation that Hussein already had nuclear weapons. He said, ``We know \nhe has been absolutely devoted to trying to acquire nuclear weapons,'' \nand ``We believe he has in fact reconstituted nuclear weapons.''\n  Subsequent events, of course, have proven all of those assertions to \nbe almost totally incorrect.\n  Thank God. When United States and British forces invaded Iraq just a \nfew days later, there were no chemical or biological or nuclear weapons \nused against them. None were found on the battlefield unused or in \ncaches hidden and ready for use or even those weapons materials \nanywhere in Iraq, as the chief weapons inspector, David Kay, has now \nindicated in his public statements. He said to our Senate Armed \nServices Committee that he does not believe they will be found. But the \nmore important fact, the irrefutable fact, is that they did not exist \nto be used against our Armed Forces. I am grateful for that. But that \nwas the overriding premise--at least I know from a number of my \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle--the overriding factor in their \ndecision to support the resolution in October.\n  Under the United Nations charter, under international law, the only \njustification legally for invading another country, for launching a \npreemptive attack against another country, starting war against another \ncountry, is either an actual attack itself or the imminent danger or \nthreat of an attack against a country.\n  It was certainly on that assertion by the administration repeatedly \nthat Members of Congress were persuaded to support the resolution in \nOctober. It was that assertion that was made by the President himself \nand others leading up to and even in the speech the President gave to \nthe Nation the night he authorized that invasion of forces.\n  In his State of the Union Address, he made assertions that Iraq had \nsought to buy uranium in Africa to reconstitute its nuclear weapons \nprogram. It was not until July 7 of 2003--almost 6 months later, or \nover 5 months later--that the administration acknowledged for the first \ntime that the President should not have made that statement even though \nthe reports were they knew conclusively as early as March. Some \nallegations are that they knew even prior to the time, or at the time \nof that statement, that that was not substantiated, or, in fact in \nMarch, a report even said it was false.\n  There are other statements that have been made by former CIA \nintelligence officials, reports made by investigative reporters that \nrefer to information that was available to the administration at the \ntime these various assertions were made that were contrary to facts as \nthey were being reported.\n  The linkage to al-Qaida, between Iraq and al-Qaida, is one that I \ncertainly can say from my own direct experience, being involved in \nprobably two dozen top secret briefings in the fall of 2002 and early \n2003 with members of the administration, that was something that was \nrepeated, was raised in a most speculative way from other intelligence \nsources.\n  Then it is reported in June of 2003, after all this has been \nunderway, according to the New York Times, two high officials of al-\nQaida now in U.S. custody told interrogators, told them before the war \nin fact, that the organization did not work with Mr. Hussein. Several \nintelligence officials said no evidence of cooperation had been found \nin Iraq.\n  It caused the CIA Director, George Tenet, to state that:\n\n       ``it was not at all clear there was any coordination or \n     joint activities,'' a CIA source told the Washington Post.\n\n  An article in the Baltimore Sun went on to say:\n\n       Last fall, in a classified assessment of Iraq, the CIA said \n     the only thing that might induce Mr. Hussein to give weapons \n     to terrorists was an American invasion. But month after \n     month, unconstrained by mere facts, the president trumpeted a \n     danger that his own intelligence officials dismissed.\n\n  Yes, there are very serious questions and a most profoundly serious \nmatter reflecting on the veracity of the President of the United States \nand his officials at the highest levels. The debate should be \nundertaken here and the American people should have a right to all the \nfacts but they will not get them.\n  One of the most disgusting ploys tonight has been to blame President \nClinton and Senate Democrats during the 1990s for the supposed \ncurtailment of our Nation's military preparedness and its intelligence \noperations. Some people are masters at this kind of slander.\n  In 2002, there were Republican campaign commercials that put Senator \nMax Cleland, a Democratic Senator from Georgia, upon the television \nscreen next to pictures of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, claiming \nthat all three of them were enemies of the national security of the \nUnited States.\n  Senator Cleland was a triple amputee and sat in this chair next to me \nduring my first 2 years of the Senate, the\n\n[[Page S2018]]\n\nmost amazing demonstration of human courage I have ever heard. I could \nscarcely imagine a man who lost three limbs serving in the military in \nVietnam, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who had voted \nfor every single dollar of President Bush's requested military \nincreases for military spending, for homeland security, every dollar, \nbeing smeared as an enemy of this Nation along with Saddam Hussein and \nOsama bin Laden.\n  Here they go again, smearing President Clinton and even Senator John \nKerry. I heard President Clinton attacked by colleagues across the \naisle from the day I joined the Senate Armed Services Committee in \nJanuary of 2001 for supposed military weaknesses. That continued up \nuntil the military that President Clinton commanded for 8 years routed \nthe Taliban and al-Qaida in Afghanistan 10 months later. Now he is \naccused of emasculating the Intelligence Agency, causing the failures \nto prevent September 11, 2001, and the failures to inform us properly \nabout the absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.\n\n  Unfortunately, we cannot find out who is and who is not responsible \nfor whatever failures occurred. We cannot find out because President \nBush has blocked the 9/11 Commission access to the information that \nbipartisan group of distinguished Americans has been requesting for \nmonths from the administration.\n  We will not get to the truth about who misused intelligence \ninformation about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq because the \nPresident refused to appoint an independent commission, refused to \ngrant them subpoena powers, and refused to authorize them to \ninvestigate the use of intelligence information by himself and his \nadministration.\n  If the former administration is the one that is so culpable and if \nthe current administration is so blameless, why wouldn't this \nadministration want those two commissions to have access to all \nrelevant information? Why would this administration block the 9/11 \ninformation that its cochairman, former Republican Governor of New \nJersey, Thomas Kean, has requested for months on behalf of his \nCommission? Why won't the President allow his own handpicked Commission \nto assess the misinformation about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq \nthat was provided to Congress and to the American people to investigate \nall the questions about that colossal misrepresentation of the truth as \nwe later discovered it to be?\n  Those are critical questions that affect the future safety of our \ncountry and our citizens, whatever flaws existed before September 11, \nwhatever errors were made after September 11, whatever mistakes, \nwhatever lack of communication, whatever misre- porting, \nmisunderstanding, misrepresenting, exaggerating, or improper \ninfluencing of information, whatever or wherever it occurred, which \nweakened our national security, must know what that was in order to \nprevent it from ever happening again.\n\n  That imperative should transcend partisan politics. It should \ntranscend Presidential reelections. It should transcend any \nconsideration except for the safety of this country and of the American \npeople.\n  If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to strengthen \nour national security, as I know they do--as we all do, because we are \nAmericans first, and we are partisans after that--then I ask them to \njoin us in insisting that the President unshackle those two \ncommissions. Let them find the truth, the whole truth, whatever it \nmight be, wherever it is, whoever it helps, whoever it hinders, so that \nwe can know what we must do to ensure that the horrors of 9/11 never, \never occur again, and to ensure that the serious misinformation about \nweapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which influenced Members of this \nbody to support a resolution to authorize the President to start a war \nagainst that country--to make sure that kind of misinformation used to \njustify a war to the American people never, ever happens again.\n  So, yes, let's debate these matters as frequently as possible. Let's \nget out all of the facts. And then let's let the American people \ndecide.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
