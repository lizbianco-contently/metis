This extends the opportunity to directly pay medical \nhealth consultants. I will discuss it later. In the meantime, I will \nset it aside for later discussion.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take a couple of minutes to explain an \namendment we will be voting on later that was introduced on my behalf \nby Senator Reid and to let my colleagues know I think it is a stunning \nsituation when suddenly, after fighting back all the amendments that we \nhad to try to improve the benefits, that we are giving our seniors--\nmiraculously there is $12 billion found and it will start a whole new \nexperiment, which may be very interesting and may be just fine. It will \npush some people out of Medicare and see if it works better in the \nprivate sector. I hate to say we have tried it and it hasn't worked but \nthat is fine.\n  At the same time, we are going to allow Medicare to do more \nprevention and do more pharmaceutical benefit. We will see what that \nlooks like when it comes to us.\n  The point I am making, yesterday the Senator from Pennsylvania was \nrailing against some Members who wanted to make this plan better \nbecause there was no money. It was so expensive. But they found money \nto do some experiment.\n  Today I have an amendment to give people a chance to decide if they \nwant to help people with cancer, if they want to help people who are \ndiagnosed with cancer.\n  I don't know if you have ever had the experience of having cancer in \nyour family, but surely we all know people who have had that \nexperience. Life in that family comes to a halt. People are reeling \nfrom the diagnosis of cancer, whether it is breast cancer, lung cancer, \nprostate cancer, colon cancer, stomach cancer, blood cancer which is \nleukemia, lymphoma; millions of Americans are touched. And we have a \ndrug benefit that stops at $4,500 and then $1,300 later you start \ngetting help for your medication.\n  Yesterday, I gave the Senate a chance to close that benefit shutdown, \nclose that coverage gap, and the Senate refused to do it, mostly on a \nparty-line vote.\n  Today I offer an amendment to let people redeem themselves. What I \nsay is, if you are diagnosed with cancer, you should never have your \ndrug benefit shut down. You are reeling from this diagnosis. You are \nsick with this disease. And you should not have to worry about whether \nyou can afford your medicine.\n  Later in the day we are going to have a chance to see if people are \nwilling to have enough compassion in their heart to stop the benefit \nshutdown for families where there is a cancer diagnosis. Why do I \nchoose cancer? I could have chosen a number of other diseases. I chose \nthat one because it touches so many families. If it passes, I am going \nto offer one where there is an Alzheimer's diagnosis. If that passes, I \nwill offer one where there is a Parkinson's diagnosis.\n  There are a couple of good things in this bill. It starts a \nprescription drug benefit. That is a plus. We are going to have to fix \nit. It is a mess. It is the only plan in the country I have found that \nhas such a benefit shutdown. The premiums can go up at any time. HMOs \nand PPOs can drop out of the business and then you do not know what you \nare going to do. The fact there is a benefit is important. And it is \ngenerous to those who are very poor.\n  But I want it to be fair to those in the middle class and I want it \nto be fair to those who need their pharmaceutical products the most. So \nI am going to give my colleagues a chance to end the benefit shutdown \nfor people who have cancer. If you want to vote no, vote no. If you \nwant to tell people you had a chance to make sure they have those \npharmaceutical products through a period of their lives when they are \nfrightened, when they are fighting a disease, go ahead. Do it. Do it.\n  But I ask you to look inside your soul. You are about to vote on a \nnew program of $12 billion. Don't walk away from the people with cancer \njust to give money to HMOs, because that vote will come back to haunt \nyou. That is how I feel.\n  I was very disappointed yesterday that we had a straight party-line \nvote, pretty much, on my amendment to end the benefit shutdown. But \naround here you have to be held accountable for what you do. So I am \ngoing to give people a chance to come back and say, OK, in the case of \ncancer, people are not going to have their benefits shut down. Just \nimagine what it is like, going through chemotherapy, taking all kinds \nof risks so you can live, because chemotherapy, as you know, basically \nkills a lot of healthy cells, too.\n  And, if that is not enough, you are going to have to deal with the \naccountants with their eyeshades in the HMOs, who will say, What have \nyou done? You really didn't get to $4,500. Why are you shutting down my \nbenefit? You will be begging them not to shut you out because your \ndoctor says if you miss this medicine you could reverse the progress \nyou are making on this disease.\n  I am going to stop discussing this amendment. I think it is pretty \nclear. Senators will have a chance to help people with cancer. If you \ndo not want to do it, then you have to live with that vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I look forward to this vote on \nmy amendment.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent agreement we \nreached last night, there was scheduled an amendment to be voted upon, \nthe so-called Grassley benchmark amendment, at 10 o'clock. We have not \nyet had the opportunity to review the amendment. As I understand it, it \nis still being negotiated. So we are not in a position, obviously, to \nagree to the amendment at 10 o'clock. We look forward to consulting \nwith both managers of the bill. Certainly I will be talking to the \nmajority leader as we continue to work to bring the amendment to the \nfloor.\n  Given the fact we are not yet at a position to vote, it would not be \nmy expectation that there would be a vote at 10 o'clock.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 972\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 972 on Medicare community health center payments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment is pending before the Senate.\n\n[[Page S8482]]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent to revise the list of sponsors \nof the amendment to read: Senators Snowe, Bingaman, Smith, Hollings, \nand Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member \nfor agreeing to this very important amendment related to our Nation's \ncommunity health centers. I also thank Senator Snowe, with whom all who \nare now cosponsoring this amendment introduced S. 654, the Medicare \nSafety Net Access Act of 2003. Her leadership on the Nation's community \nhealth centers has been unwavering and has made it possible to get to \nthe point where we can adopt this amendment.\n  I also thank Senator Smith, Senator Hollings, Senator Hatch, and \nSenator Conrad for their longstanding advocacy support for community \nhealth centers. Senator Smith and Senator Hollings need to be thanked \nfor their constant advocacy and push to see this amendment pass.\n  In addition, it should be noted that Senators Hatch and Conrad \nspearheaded a very similar effort to protect community health centers \nin the Medicaid Program back in 1997.\n  As we proceed with the passage of S. 1, we need to be careful not to \ncreate potential unintended consequences as a result of our actions. \nThis amendment corrects an important unintended consequence that this \nlegislation could have had on our Nation's community health centers. \nCommunity health centers have broad bipartisan support. The President \nand the Congress have committed to doubling the funding for community \nhealth centers over a 5-year period. The health centers provide care \nfor over 13 million people annually. Nearly one million of those are \nlow-income Medicare beneficiaries. They receive section 330 Federal \nPublic Health Service Act grant funds to support care for the uninsured \nand for low-income patients. To ensure those grant funds are used \nentirely for that purpose, Congress has specifically taken action to \nensure that both Medicare and Medicaid are fully reimbursing health \ncenters for the costs associated with the care provided for Medicare \nand Medicaid beneficiaries.\n  Simply put, the funding intended for low-income and uninsured people \nshould not be diverted and instead used to subsidize Medicare \nunderpayments. Therefore, health centers are reimbursed by Medicare \nunder a cost-base system. This amendment would simply extend the same \nrequirement to the new Medicare Advantage programs by ensuring that \ncommunity health centers are provided with a wraparound or supplemental \npayment equal to the difference between the payments they now receive \nunder Medicare generally and the payment they would receive from \nMedicare Advantage plans. This is not a new concept.\n  In 1997, Congress allowed States to dramatically increase the number \nof patients who were enrolled in Medicaid managed care. We recognized \nthe potential adverse impact on community health centers, and to deal \nwith that we required the Medicaid Program to provide a wraparound or \nsupplemental payment for the difference between the managed care \norganizations payment and a health centers reasonable cost. Again, \nSenators Hatch and Conrad were instrumental in that effort.\n  With this important amendment we are proposing today we would do the \nsame in the Medicare Program. According to testimony Tom Scully gave at \nthe Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services and testimony that the \nCongressional Budget Office gave on the 13th of June, their estimates \nfor how many Medicare beneficiaries actually were enrolled in the \nprivate health plans ranged all over the board. It went from 9 percent \nin one estimate, the CBO estimate, to 43 percent, the estimate that Tom \nScully's actuaries developed. It was a fivefold difference in those \nestimates.\n\n  In the words of Dr. Holtz-Eakin, the head of the CBO, these are \nhonest differences in trying to read a very uncertain future.\n  We do have clearly ahead of us a very uncertain future as to how many \npeople will choose to leave traditional Medicare and move into the \nprivate plans. Mr. Scully is correct that health centers will lose \ntheir guarantee of cost-base reimbursement to 43 percent of their \nMedicare patients. Potentially, this could result in centers having to \ndip into their Federal grant fund money intended to provide care to the \nuninsured, and they would have to dip into those Federal grant funds in \norder to make up for losses they were incurring trying to provide \nservices to Medicare patients.\n  Our Nation's safety net is already fragile. We need to take this \naction to ensure we are not jeopardizing it through the passage of this \nlegislation.\n  Again, both the President and Congress have committed to double the \ncapacity of our Nation's health centers to deal with the growing number \nof uninsured in this country. In light of this, the amendment we are \noffering today would protect the vital role that health centers play. \nIt would ensure that health centers are not forced to decide either \nbetween subsidizing the Medicare Program with their grant dollars or \nrefusing to provide services to some of the 1 million low-income \nMedicare beneficiaries that currently depend upon them for services.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member for agreeing to accept this \namendment. I thank all the chief sponsors, Senator Snowe, and all \ncosponsors for their hard work. I believe it is a very important \namendment. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the \namendment that I am offering today with Senator Bingaman, a longtime \nchampion of community health centers and the original cosponsor of the \nlegislation that we introduced, S. 654, the Medicare Safety Net Access \nAct, from which this provision has been taken. I also would like to \nthank my colleagues, Senators Hatch and Smith for their help in moving \nthis important policy change forward. Chairman Grassley and Senator \nBaucus also should be recognized for their work on behalf of Community \nHealth Centers. Their willingness to work with me has made adoption of \nthis policy possible.\n  This amendment will help ensure that Community Health Centers remain \na viable and integral part of the health care delivery system for \nMedicare beneficiaries and rural communities at large. Community Health \nCenters, also known as Federally qualified health centers, provide care \nto millions of medically underserved Medicare beneficiaries. In many \ncases, Community Health Centers are the only source of primary and \npreventive services to which these beneficiaries have access. This is \nespecially true for people living in America's rural and inner-city \nmedically underserved areas.\n  As many of you know, under the traditional fee-for-service program \nCommunity Health Centers currently are reimbursed by Medicare bases on \nthe cost to deliver care. However, because managed care plans, such as \nthose expected to be used under the new MedicareAdvantage program, use \ncapitated rates, which are negotiated rates based on patient volume and \noften are lower than the fee-for-service cost-reimbursement rate, \nCommunity Health Centers would likely experience substantial reductions \nin payments.\n  If, as CMS predicts, over 40 percent of seniors enter the new \nMedicareAdvantage program, Community Health Centers would experience a \nsubstantial loss of revenue because their payment for almost half of \ntheir clients would be based on a capitated rate. If this happens, \nCommunity Health Centers would be unable to meet the growing demand of \nserving the Medicare population.\n  This amendment ensures that doesn't happen. Starting in 2006, if the \ncapitated rate that a Community Health Center receives from a \nparticipating MedicareAdvantage plan is less than the fee-for-service \ncost reimbursement rate, the Medicare program will pay the difference \nin the amount. This is done presently under the Medicaid program and it \nshould be no different under the Medicare program.\n  Community Health Centers are an invaluable component in the health \ncare delivery system in rural communities and I am pleased that this \namendment has been accepted into S. 1.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Bingaman-\nSnowe-Hatch amendment. This amendment addresses an important issue for \nboth Medicare beneficiaries and community health centers by ensuring \nthat\n\n[[Page S8483]]\n\nMedicare beneficiaries, regardless of their Medicare health coverage \nchoice, would receive seamless coverage if they choose to receive \nservices from a community health center. And, it provides the Community \nHealth Centers the ability to give the Medicare beneficiaries that they \nserve seamless health coverage as well.\n  I have been a strong supporter of community health centers for many \nyears. These health centers provide care to over 13 million people \nannually; nearly one million are low-income Medicare beneficiaries. \nThese health centers receive funding under the Public Health Service \nAct in order to provide quality care to their uninsured and low-income \npatients. To ensure those dollars are used only to provide health care \nto health center patients, Congress has taken action to ensure that \nboth the Medicare and Medicaid programs are reimbursing health centers \nfor the costs associated with care to Medicare and Medicaid \nbeneficiaries. Therefore, community health centers are reimbursed by \nMedicare and Medicaid under a cost-based system.\n  In 1997, Congress allowed States to increase greatly the number of \npatients enrolled in Medicaid managed care by requiring the Medicaid \nprogram to provide a ``wrap-around' payments for the difference between \nthe managed care organization's payment and a health center's \nreasonable costs.\n  This amendment ensures that we do the same thing for Medicare \nbeneficiaries in the MedicareAdvantage program. More specifically, the \namendment ensures that community health centers are provided with a \n``wrap-around'' or supplemental payment equal to the difference between \nthe payments they now receive under Medicare through the cost-based \nsystem and the payment they would receive from MedicareAdvantage plans.\n  Officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the \nCongressional Budget Office estimate that nine to 43 percent of \nMedicare beneficiaries will enroll in private health plans offered \nthrough the MedicareAdvantage program. If these estimates are accurate, \nthen health centers will lose their guarantee of cost-based \nreimbursement for up to 43 percent of their Medicare patients. This \ncould result in centers having to dip into their Federal funding \nreceived through the Public Health Service Act. This funding is \nintended to provide care to the uninsured--not to fill in the gaps for \ncertain Medicare health center patients.\n  The Bingaman-Snowe-Hatch amendment would not only protect the vital \nrole of health centers but would also ensure that these health centers \nwould continue to provide seamless health coverage to one million low-\nincome Medicare beneficiaries. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 11 \no'clock today, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to amendment \nNo. 972 and that the amendment now be considered as being proposed by \nSenators Snowe, Bingaman, and Hatch; further, that following that vote, \nthere be 2 minutes equally divided for further debate prior to a vote \nin relation to the Edwards amendment, No. 985, to be followed by 2 \nminutes equally divided and a vote in relation to the Graham amendment, \nNo. 956, with no second-degree amendments in order prior to the vote.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the time until the votes be \nequally divided between the two managers or their designees, and I \nfurther modify the request to allow 4 minutes equally divided prior to \nthe Edwards vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 985, As Modified Further\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have a \nmodification at the desk with additional modifications. I ask unanimous \nconsent, first, that the modification be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is further modified.\n  The amendment (No. 985), as modified further, is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n       TITLE __--DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER PRESCRIPTION DRUG ADVERTISING\n\n     SEC. __01.

The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for the information of Senators, we are \ngoing to have this block of votes. Then there is going to be a period \nof time where the two leaders have agreed there would be no amendments \nvoted on. At about 2:30 or quarter to 3, we are going to try to line up \na batch of votes to take up time this afternoon.\n  So for the information of Senators, at 2:30 or quarter to 3, the two \nmanagers and leaders are going to try to line up a bunch of votes.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 985, As Modified Further\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today, together with my friend, \nSenator Tom Harkin from Iowa, to introduce an amendment to bring down \nthe cost of prescription drugs. As everyone knows, the cost of \nprescription drugs has been skyrocketing. We have to bring these costs \nunder control, not only to lower the drug costs for seniors but also to \nlower drug costs for all Americans, including those who will not get a \nprescription drug benefit under the Medicare Program.\n  There are lots of reasons drug costs are rising, and I have offered \nseveral proposals to address that in the past. This amendment addresses \ntwo particular concerns. The first is what is called the ``me too'' \ndrugs that provide minimal benefits for people but large profits for \ndrug companies. The second is the massive growth in the direct-to-\nconsumer advertising that does not genuinely educate consumers.\n  This amendment, from Tom Harkin and me, would address these problems \nwith two steps. First, we call on the Secretary of HHS to require drug \nmanufacturers to prove that ``me too'' drugs actually provide benefits \nbefore they are approved. Second, we would impose new requirements for \nfairness and balance in drug advertising.\n  Drug companies provide a very important service to America and to the \nsick. They deserve to make a profit for that, all of us agree on that. \nBut they should also fulfill their mission as businesses, to generate \ninnovative drugs that reduce pain, alleviate suffering, and cure \ndisease.\n  Unfortunately, many drug companies seem to be giving that mission \nshort shrift. We know they spend far more on marketing, advertising, \nand administration than they spend on research and development. We also \nknow that instead of focusing on truly innovative breakthroughs, drug \ncompanies are focusing on ``me-too'' drugs to compete against \nblockbuster treatments for chronic conditions like allergies and high \ncholesterol. I want to talk about that for a minute.\n  Me-too drugs can be good things. They can help a specific population, \nor they can be safer and more effective. Of course those are good \nthings. But here is the problem. Companies should not be able to profit \noff of a me-too drug just by misleading consumers about the benefits \ncompared to existing drugs. Consumers should know how exactly the new \ndrug stacks up against the existing drug.\n\n  Senator Clinton spoke of the same need last night, when she \nintroduced her very sound amendment. Consumers need to be given the \nability to make an informed choice about the best drug for them.\n  This amendment would give the Secretary of HHS the authority to \nrequire drug companies to test drugs against their competitors. And if \nthe drug company is going to advertise its ``me-too'' drug, it should \ntell the consumer how that drug compares to what they may already be \ntaking for that condition.\n  Now, I want to talk about the larger point, which is drug \nadvertising.\n  Some drug advertising is a good thing. Drug ads can let people know \nabout drugs about which they don't otherwise hear. The drug industry's \nmajor trade group, PhRMA, says the purpose of direct-to-consumer \nadvertising is:\n\n     . . . to educate consumers about diseases, about the symptoms \n     that may help them identify diseases, and the available \n     therapies developed to treat them.\n\n  Those are good. Those are good goals. Here is the problem. Does \nanyone think drug advertising today is genuinely about educating \nconsumers, as PhRMA says, rather than marketing? Does anyone believe \nthat?\n  Are drug companies educating consumers about allergy medicines by \nshowing this picture of a woman running through a field? I think all of \nus know, when this kind of advertisement, as in this picture, is shown \non television, it is clearly about selling and about marketing. This is \nnot for the purpose of educating consumers, and the American people \nknow that. They know that without anyone telling them that.\n  Are they educating consumers about arthritis with images of a couple \ndancing in their kitchen? If this were about education, would an \nannouncement read: ``Health warnings: Headache, nausea,'' and so on, \nwhile the picture on the screen still shows happy pictures of a mom and \nher kids? Absolutely not. These ads are not about education; they are \nabout marketing.\n  There is nothing wrong with marketing and persuasion in most \ncontexts. If they are selling paper towels or shaving cream, companies \nshould go ahead and market as aggressively as they can. But \nprescription drugs are different. There is nothing more important in \nour lives than our health, and there is nothing more important than \ndrugs for our health. These are matters of life and death for families, \nfor seniors, and for kids. Advertisements for these products should be \nheld to a much higher standard. They should educate, not just market.\n  That is not what these ads do. You don't have to take my word for it; \nthat is what Consumer Reports says, that is what doctors say, and, most \nimportantly, it is what common sense says. These ads make promises they \ncannot keep. They overstate benefits and they understate risks. Let me \ngive just a couple of examples from recent research.\n  This is from a study from the magazine Consumer Reports. They studied \ndrug ads and they found:\n\n     . . . a broad and disconcerting range of misleading messages: \n     ads that minimize the product's risk, exaggerated its \n     efficacy, made false claims of superiority over competing \n     products; promoted unapproved uses for an approved drug; or \n     promoted use of a drug still in the experimental stage.\n\n  In a recent FDA survey of 500 general practitioners, family doctors, \n7 out of 10 said advertisements about drugs confused patients about the \nrisks and benefits of medicines. In another study, 75 percent of \ndoctors said their patients came away with the impression that the \ndrugs they saw in advertisements work better than they actually do.\n  The Kaiser Family Foundation did a survey of nearly 2000 adults who \nsaw drug advertisements; 7 out of 10 said they learned little or \nnothing about what the treated condition; 6 out of 10 said they learned \nlittle or nothing about the drug. Here are comments from Arnold Relman \nand Marcia Angell, two former editors-in-chief of the New England \nJournal of Medicine. They said:\n\n       DTC ads mainly benefit the bottom line of the drug \n     industry, not the public. They mislead consumers more than \n     they inform them, and they pressure physicians to prescribe \n     new, expensive, and often marginally helpful drugs, although \n     a more conservative option might be better for the patient.\n\n  So this amendment is simple. It says that drug ads should be \nbalanced. They should include information about other drugs that may \naddress conditions better. And they should have a real balance between \nthe images selling the drug and the images questioning the drug.\n  Now, the Bush administration sees it differently. They think see it \nas drug companies should be able to use whatever marketing gimmicks \nthey want to sell their drugs.\n  The FDA is supposed to stop ads that are misleading. But last year \nthe Bush administration's FDA instituted a new policy that slows down \nthe FDA's efforts. As a result, the FDA issued two-thirds fewer warning \nletters last year\n\n[[Page S8485]]\n\nthan the year before. The GAO looked into this and found that warning \nletters are often ``not issued until after the advertising campaign has \nrun its course.''\n  This is a gift to the drug companies. Without the threat of a warning \nletter, they can basically air whatever kind of ad they want and just \nask for forgiveness afterwards.\n  Take the case of an ad for the prescription drug Tamiflu that ran on \nthe radio last year. It featured Eric Bergoust, the Olympic gold-medal \nskier, who said ``I felt better so soon that I didn't miss a single day \nof training.'' The FDA told the drug maker Hoffmann-La Roche to stop \nrunning the ad because Bergoust's words ``misleadingly overstated the \ndrug's efficacy.'' But the FDA's request came nearly three months after \nthe company had submitted the ad for review, a month after the flu \nseason had ended, and well after the company stopped running the ad.\n  Our amendment would make sure this kind of thing cannot happen. The \nFDA should speed up the review process and use their authority to have \nmisleading ads pulled before millions of consumers have already seen \nthem. And drug companies need to be held accountable when they \nrepeatedly violate FDA regulations. In this amendment, Senator Harkin \nand I call for stiff civil penalties for such offenders.\n  So, in short, this amendment would not bar all direct-to-consumer \nadvertising. It would simply require the advertising to educate, rather \nthan simply market. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  This amendment is for the purpose of doing something to control drug \nadvertising, to make sure that it is, in fact, about education, and to \nmake sure these ``me too'' drugs actually have a benefit before they \nare approved by the FDA.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 972\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 985, As Modified Further\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4 minutes equally divided on the \nEdwards amendment prior to a vote.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to do \nsomething about the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs in this \ncountry. Whatever we do to provide a real prescription drug benefit for \nseniors under Medicare, both for the purpose of keeping the cost of \nthat plan down and for the purpose of doing something for all Americans \nwho have no prescription drug coverage, we have to bring the cost of \nprescription drugs under control.\n  There are two abuses at which this amendment is aimed: First, \nstopping the proliferation of ``me too'' drugs that have no meaningful \nbenefit; second, stopping the abuses in advertising.\n  Everyone has seen the ads: Couples dancing in the kitchen; people \nrunning through fields. These are not for the purpose of education. \nThey are for the purpose of marketing. We are trying to bring this \nunder control by putting fairness, honesty, and accuracy in that \nadvertising.\n  The purpose of the amendment is to help control both those activities \nand, in the process, bring down the cost of prescription drugs.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleague, the coauthor of this amendment, \nSenator Harkin from Iowa, what he believes we need to do to bring down \nthe cost of prescription drugs. I yield to Senator Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What type of time \nagreement are we under now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes equally divided. The Senator has \n31 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Carolina \nfor offering his amendment of which I am a cosponsor. Every time I go \nback to Iowa, I hear from consumers and others: Why do I get inundated \nwith all these ads, and I cannot buy them unless I go to the doctor?\n  Right now, the drug companies are spending more on advertising every \nyear than they are on research, and we wonder why the price of drugs \nkeeps going up.\n  This all changed a few years ago. If my colleagues will remember, \nbefore 1997, we did not see all these ads. Now it is time to cut out \nthis massive advertising of drugs that we cannot even buy in the \nmarketplace.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield the 2 minutes on this side to \nthe Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask the body to vote no on the Edwards \namendment to increase drug costs. This is a new drug approval. The \namendment masquerades as a direct-to-consumer advertising amendment \nwhile sweeping away carefully calibrated FDA drug approval standards.\n  While the Edwards amendment masquerades as an amendment to \n``strengthen protections against misleading direct-to-consumer \nadvertising,'' the amendment drastically changes the requirements for \ndrug approval in the United States.\n  We have a great system that is working. Under the current law, \npharmaceuticals must demonstrate they are safe and effective to be \napproved by the Food and Drug Administration. Under the Edwards \namendment, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would be \nauthorized to vary this standard on a\n\n[[Page S8486]]\n\ndrug-by-drug basis to create new hurdles to drug approvals.\n  These new hurdles include lengthy, costly comparative trials and a \nshowing that the drug is safer or more effective for a subpopulation or \ncondition than a previously approved drug.\n  These changes to fundamental, longstanding law could hurt patients by \ndelaying, and possibly denying, the approval of new drugs that patients \nneed; by dramatically adding to drug development costs, discouraging \ncompanies from developing additional drugs to treat the same \nconditions; and increasing drug spending by reducing brand-to-brand \ncompetition.\n  We know far more about pharmaceuticals than many other medical \ninterventions since, unlike most other interventions, they must obtain \napproval under FDA's safe and effective standard before they can be \nused. We should reject this amendment as it would add another \nregulatory hurdle to the already long and costly drug development and \napproval process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 985, as modified further.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay that motion \non the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 956\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The order of business is \namendment numbered 956, the Graham of Florida amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is my understanding the next matter is \nthe Graham amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, on behalf of Senators Graham, Feinstein, \nMurkowski, Johnson, and this Senator, this is a tremendous piece of \nwork Senator Graham has done. It is good legislation. At least 12 \npercent of our seniors would be subject to a gap in coverage under this \nbill. Standard coverage would require seniors to pay 100 percent of the \ncost of prescriptions between $4,500 and $5,812 in total spending. At \nthe same time, they are paying 100 percent of each prescription, and \nthey are still required to pay a monthly premium.\n  Collecting a premium while a senior is in the gap is equivalent to \nlevying a tax on the sick. This amendment suspends the payment of \npremium once the beneficiary hits the gap in coverage. This amendment \nis endorsed by the National Committee to Preserve Social Security, the \nAlliance of Retired Americans, and the National Council on Aging.\n  The amendment is offset by clarification of the Medicare secondary \npayer provision. This noncontroversial offset, which yields $8.9 \nbillion over 10 years, is fully supported by the Department of Justice \nand is in the House Republican drug bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I have to ask my colleagues to vote \nagainst this amendment because it costs $200 billion. We are working \nwithin a $400 billion package. I wish we could eliminate the gap, as \nwell. What we are trying to do is help the most people who have the \nmost need with the money we have. Most seniors will not be affected by \nthe gap in coverage. Most seniors will not have drug spending in a year \nthat exceeds the benefit limit.\n  According to the CBO, about 88 percent of the seniors will not even \nhave prescription drug spending that exceeds the $4,500 limit.\n  The Senator from Florida calls the benefit limit a ``sick tax'' \nbecause he believes that seniors should not pay a premium for coverage \nfor catastrophic costs. This is as if to say you should not pay for \nfire insurance if your house is not going to be on fire. Of course, \nthat is not how insurance works. People purchase insurance to protect \nthem against an unfortunate accident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is expired.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1051\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set the pending \namendments aside and call up amendment No. 1051.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi], for himself and Mrs. \n     Lincoln, proposes an amendment numbered 1051.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To ensure convenient access to pharmacies and prohibit the \n                          tying of contracts)\n\n       On page 37, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       (C) Convenient access to pharmacies.--In this section, the \n     term `convenient access' means access that is no less \n     favorable to enrollees than the rules for convenient access \n     to pharmacies of the Secretary of Defense established as of \n     June 1, 2003, for purposes of the TriCare retail pharmacy \n     program. Such rules shall include adequate emergency access \n     for enrolled beneficiaries.\n       On page 48, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n       (4) Tying of contracts.--No eligible entity with a contract \n     under this part, or its agent, may require a pharmacy to \n     participate in a medicare prescription drug plan as a \n     condition of participating in nonmedicare programs or \n     networks, or require a pharmacy to participate in a \n     nonmedicare program or network as a condition of \n     participating in a medicare prescription drug plan.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise to offer an amendment that would \nbuild upon the protections for seniors and pharmacists that the Senate \napproved last week. I am pleased to be joined by my distinguished \ncolleague from Arkansas, Senator Lincoln, in offering this amendment.\n  This amendment would ensure that seniors have convenient access to \nlocal pharmacies. The amendment would accomplish this in two ways.\n  First, there is language in the Finance Committee's bill that \nrequires\n\n[[Page S8488]]\n\nthe Government to develop a standard for ensuring that seniors have \nconvenient access to local pharmacies. This amendment would further \ndefine what we mean by ``convenient access.''\n  The amendment would ensure that access to retail pharmacies under \nMedicare is ``no less favorable to enrollees'' than the access \nstandards under the TRICARE retail pharmacy program.\n  TRICARE is the health care program for active-duty and retired \nmembers of the uniformed services, their families, and survivors. \nTRICARE is a regionally managed program that offers eligible \nbeneficiaries three choices for their health care.\n  First, there is TRICARE Prime, where military facilities such as \nDepartment of Defense hospitals are the principal source of health care \nservices. There is also TRICARE Extra, a preferred provider option. \nFinally, there is a TRICARE Standard, the fee-for-service option that \nused to be known as CHAMPUS.\n  For all three options, TRICARE offers pharmacy benefits that include \naccess to a retail pharmacy network. To win an award to manage TRICARE \nbenefits for the military, a contractor must maintain a retail pharmacy \nnetwork that ``minimizes the number of eligible beneficiaries who will \nhave to change pharmacies'' to use the contractor's network.\n  There are three minimum beneficiary access standards for the TRICARE \nretail pharmacy network.\n  In urban areas, the contractor must have a network pharmacy within 2 \nmiles of 90 percent of eligible beneficiaries. In suburban areas, the \nstandard is a pharmacy within 5 miles of 90 percent of the \nbeneficiaries. In rural areas, the standard is a pharmacy within 15 \nmiles of 70 percent of the beneficiaries.\n  The Enzi-Lincoln amendment would not require Medicare drug plans to \nmeet these exact standards. It would only require that a Medicare drug \nplan's network be ``no less favorable'' to seniors than the TRICARE \nprogram is for active-duty military and retirees, including those who \nparticipate in the new TRICARE Senior Pharmacy Program, provided by the \n2001 National Defense Authorization Act. If the Administrator of the \nnew Center for Medicare Choices or a Medicare drug plan had a better \nway of meeting or exceeding the TRICARE standard, they would not be \nrestrained from doing so.\n  As I mentioned earlier, there is another way this amendment would \nensure that seniors have convenient access to their local pharmacies. \nThe amendment includes a provision that prohibits a Medicare drug plan \noperator from requiring pharmacies to accept non-Medicare business and \nreimbursement rates as a condition of participating in the plan's \nMedicare business, or vice versa.\n  I expect that health plans and pharmacy benefits managers that \noperate in the commercial insurance market will be the same companies \nthat will compete to provide Medicare drug plans and Medicare Advantage \npreferred provider options to seniors. If a plan wins a bid to provide \na Medicare drug benefit, they may offer reimbursement rates to retail \npharmacies that are better or worse than the rates they offer in their \nprivate sector commercial business. That is fine with me.\n  What concerns me is the possibility of these large plans ``tying'' \ntheir Medicare and non-Medicare business together. A Medicare drug plan \nshould not be able to require a community pharmacist to accept an \nunprofitable reimbursement rate for its private sector business as a \ncondition of participating in its Medicare network. Likewise, a \ncommunity pharmacist should not have to take a money-losing Medicare \nreimbursement rate in order to keep its non-Medicare business from the \nsame large plan.\n  We should allow community pharmacists to refuse unprofitable private \nsector business from a health insurer or a pharmacy benefits manager \nyet participate in a Medicare drug plan run by the same entities. By \ndoing so, we will further ensure that seniors have convenient access to \nlocal pharmacies based on fair reimbursement rates that should take \ninto account the added costs pharmacies incur in providing counseling \nand advice to Medicare beneficiaries, especially since pharmacists are \nrarely reimbursed directly for the time and effort it takes to provide \nthat counseling and advice.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with Senator Lincoln and me in \ncontinuing to improve this Medicare bill by ensuring that seniors have \nconvenient access to their local pharmacists.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming. I \nam extremely pleased to offer this amendment with him to help our \nseniors by ensuring that local pharmacists can continue providing their \nservices under the new prescription drug program created under this \nbill. I compliment him on his leadership--as well as the hard work of \nhis staff--in crafting a very plausible solution to many of our \nproblems.\n  I was proud to have supported another amendment offered by my friend \nSenator Enzi and Senator Reed of Rhode Island which sought to ensure \nthat PBMs can't force seniors into mail order programs. For those of \nus, such as the Presiding Officer and others, who represent large \ntracts of rural areas in our States, it is important to know that all \nseniors across this great Nation are going to get a fair shake when it \ncomes to a prescription drug package. We want to make sure that the \npackage we design and the law we produce are going to ensure that every \nsenior has the same quality of care, the same quality of product, and \nthe same quality of access through this prescription drug package.\n  Many Arkansas pharmacists, including Gene Boeckmann, owner of Wynne \nApothecary, have explained to me the many problems with mail order \npharmacy operations. For one, it weakens the personal contact between \ncustomer and pharmacist, a vital connection when it comes to one's \nhealth and particularly when you live in a rural area where medical \nprofessionals may not be there full time. I know many of our \ncommunities--the one just mentioned--have medical facilities that are \nsatellites of hospitals from larger communities. Consequently, many of \ntheir medical professionals are not full-time residents. Oftentimes the \nonly medical professional they have happens to be the pharmacist, \nsomeone they can call on a weekend or late at night if they run into \nproblems.\n  Mail order pharmacies that are owned by PBMs also take money out of \nlocal communities. In many small towns across Arkansas, pharmacists \nsuch as Mr. Boeckmann are the ones paying the taxes. They support the \nlocal community baseball and softball teams. They donate money so the \nschool band can go to competitions. They are serving their communities. \nThey have the right and responsibility to do that and, through this \nbill, we want them to continue. Our communities need leaders such as \nMr. Boeckmann. It is for this reason I am proud to support the Enzi-\nReed amendment.\n  As we began drafting the amendment, we attempted to include a \nprovision to prevent conflicts of interest. I hope we will be able to \naddress this issue in conference. Our original amendment would have \nprohibited a PBM from favoring a mail order contractor it owns. \nRegrettably, we could not work out language agreeable to everyone, but \nI do hope we can continue to address the conflict of interest issue in \nconference. I will be working diligently with others to see that we \ncan.\n  The amendment seeks to build on that effort by ensuring that seniors \nhave access to their community pharmacists. Over the many years of this \ndebate, I have heard from countless seniors who have told me how \nimportant their community pharmacist is to their health care.\n  I have told them time and time again, they are preaching to the choir \nwith me. I can look back in my own life to when my grandmother was \ndiagnosed with cancer. She lived with us the last 2 years of her life \nin the back of the house in the room next to mine. I can remember when \nshe would suffer from discomfort, she didn't want to talk to the \ndoctor. She knew what her ailment was. She wanted to talk to the \npharmacist.\n\n  She would call him. He would say: Mrs. Adne, you need to stop taking \nyour blue pill and keep your yellow pill, but remember it is going to \nupset\n\n[[Page S8489]]\n\nyour stomach if you don't take it with a glass of milk or a biscuit.\n  She found great relief in the knowledge that the pharmacist could \nprovide her. There was nothing more the doctors could do for her. Yet \nthe pharmacist could provide her that information.\n  I look back on the journey my family had with my own father when we \ntraveled down almost 10 years of a road through the disease of \nAlzheimer's, recognizing very little could be done by the physicians. \nYet the pharmacist was the one we could call in our small community who \nactually could tell us how we could provide relief, ways we could \nenhance the quality of life for my father as he lived out those last \nfew years and then those last few days in his own home, in the very \nwoods he grew up in as a little boy.\n  These are the qualities of life we are talking about for our \nfamilies, for our loved ones in rural areas, to make it possible \nessentially for them to be able to do that. What we are talking about \nis really putting common sense into the bill and recognizing how \nimportant it is to maintain that contact in rural areas. Seniors like \nmy late grandmother or my father don't need a mail order service with a \n1-800 number and a recording. They need their local pharmacist to talk \nto.\n  This amendment seeks to guarantee seniors convenient access to \npharmacists. ``Convenient access'' would be defined as access standards \nthat are at least as favorable as the Department of Defense's TRICARE \nprogram, to which Senator Enzi referred. That should be the minimum \nlevel of access. The TRICARE program requires that at least 90 percent \nof beneficiaries in urban areas have access to a network pharmacy \nwithin 2 miles, 90 percent of beneficiaries in suburban areas have \naccess to a network pharmacy within 5 miles, and 70 percent of \nbeneficiaries in rural areas have access to a network pharmacy within \n15 miles.\n  Second, our amendment seeks to prevent PBMs from tying one contract \nwith a pharmacist to another contract. The practice of committing \npharmacists with one contract to another simply ties their hands from \nbeing able to provide the kind of service they should be able to \nprovide.\n  As several of my colleagues have mentioned, PBMs play a major role in \nthe negotiating process between pharmacists and drug companies. Some \nPBMs have the market power to require a pharmacy provider to accept one \ncontract rate as a condition of participating in a totally unrelated \nprogram. This ``tying,'' as it is termed, of one contract to another is \nan abuse of market power, and it should be prohibited in the Medicare \nProgram. Our amendment would prohibit tying.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join us by supporting this important \namendment that will make Medicare a better program for our seniors and \nfor our pharmacists. Let's make this easier for the seniors and keep \nthe pharmacists in the business.\n  As I urge my colleagues to support the amendment Senator Enzi and I \nhave offered, I also encourage them to think back to a circumstance, \nperhaps, in which they found themselves or a story they have heard from \none of their rural constituents who can best describe to them in their \nown words how vital it is to have these important health care providers \nremain in our communities.\n  I thank my colleague from Wyoming for his great leadership and the \nhard work of his staff. I am proud to join him in offering the \namendment. I do encourage all of our colleagues to support it and to \nsupport rural America so that all seniors across the Nation will have a \nbenefit that will be equal in terms of access and for the information \nthey need in order to find quality of life through the prescription \ndrug package we believe they can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas for her \ndiligent effort. I ask my colleagues to vote for it.\n  Ms. LINCOLN. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1030\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 1030.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1030.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To encourage the availability of MedicareAdvantage benefits \n                    in medically underserved areas)\n\n       On page 356, strike lines 8 through 11, and insert the \n     following:\n       (C) Construction.--Subparagraph (B) shall not be construed \n     as restricting--\n       (i) the persons from whom enrollees under such plan may \n     obtain covered benefits; or\n       (ii) the categories of licensed health professionals or \n     providers from whom enrollees under such a plan may obtain \n     covered benefits if the covered services are provided to \n     enrollees in a State where 25 percent or more of the \n     population resides in health professional shortage areas \n     designated pursuant to section 332 of the Public Health \n     Service Act.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, this amendment would make the Medicare \nAdvantage preferred provider organization option more attractive to \npeople in areas of the country that have shortages of doctors and other \nhealth care providers.\n  The proposed amendment would ensure that Medicare Advantage plans pay \nfor covered services provided by any properly licensed health \nprofessionals to seniors in ``medically underserved States.''\n  In other words, if a MedicareAdvantage plan covers a service, then \nthe plan must pay for the service if it is provided by a licensed \nprovider in a medically underserved State, regardless of other plan \nlimitations on the types of health professionals that may provide the \nservice.\n  I assure my colleagues that this is nothing new. The law that governs \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Program provides special \nconsideration for enrollees of preferred-provider plans who live in \nStates with critical shortages of physicians and other health \nprofessionals. Such States are designated as ``medically underserved \nareas'' for purposes of the Federal employees program, and the law \nrequires preferred provider organizations to pay for services provided \nby any qualified providers in these States.\n  As a result, in medically underserved areas, Federal employees' \nhealth plans must treat any licensed health professional as a ``covered \nprovider'' for any covered services performed within the scope of that \nState's licensure laws.\n  This amendment simply would require the same treatment by \nMedicareAdvantage plans of seniors who live in medically underserved \nStates. If the plan says that a physician must provide a service, but a \nnurse practitioner is permitted under State law to provide the service, \na senior in a medically underserved State could get that service from \nhis or her local nurse practitioner.\n  The amendment would define a ``medically underserved State'' in the \nsame way it is defined for the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nProgram. The Federal employees program law defines a ``medically \nunderserved State'' as one in which 25 percent or more of the \npopulation lives in health professional shortage areas, as defined by \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services. This amendment would \ntransfer that language to MedicareAdvantage.\n  In 2003, the following States were considered ``medically \nunderserved'' for purposes of the Federal employees health plan: \nAlabama, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, \nMontana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, \nUtah, West Virginia and Wyoming.\n  By the way, Louisiana, Maine, and West Virginia were added to the \nlist in 2003, which demonstrates that the list if flexible enough to \nrecognize States that may not have shortages of health professionals \nright now, but may have a shortage in the future.\n  Here's an example of how this provision works in the Federal \nemployees program. The Rural Letter Carrier Benefit Plan allows \nphysical and occupational therapy services to be provided by qualified \nand licensed physical therapists, occupational therapists, and  \nphysicians.  However,  the  Govern-\n\n[[Page S8490]]\n\nment Employees Hospital Association Benefit Plan, or the G-E-H-A plan, \ndoes not generally allow qualified physicians to provide physical or \noccupational therapy services. As a result, physicians who may have \nspecial expertise in rehabilitation medicine, for example, cannot \nprovide such services to members of the G-E-H-A plan.\n  However, in medically underserved States, the G-E-H-A plan must allow \nFederal employees to receive physical or occupational therapy services \nfrom any physician who is qualified to do so and whose State license \npermits him or her to do so.\n  As a result, Federal employees in medically underserved States who \nlive 50 miles from the nearest physical or occupational therapist don't \nhave to drive 50 miles to receive a service they could get from the \nlocal physician.\n  Here's another example. The Rural Letter Carriers plan allows \nchiropractors to perform manipulation of the spine and extremities, as \nwell as related procedures such as ultrasound and cold-pack \napplication. The G-E-H-A plan allows chiropractors to perform \nmanipulation of the spine and certain X-rays to detect and determine \nnerve interferences, but it doesn't allow for chiropractors to perform \nultrasound or other related procedures like the Rural Letter Carriers \nplan does. Both plans also reserve certain procedures for other types \nof health professionals.\n  However, in medically underserved States, both plans must permit \nchiropractors to perform any service that the plans cover--provided \nthat the services are within the scope of the chiropractor's State \nlicense.\n  Now that I have explained what this amendment would accomplish, let \nme be clear about what this amendment would not do.\n  First, the amendment would not require MedicareAdvantage plans to pay \nfor services that they would not ordinarily cover. It would only \nrequire that plans pay for covered services in medically underserved \nStates without limiting the types of professionals who may provide the \nservice. Again, this provision only applies to services that the plan \nhas already decided to cover.\n  Second, this amendment is not an ``any willing provider'' amendment. \nA number of States have ``any willing provider'' laws that require \nhealth plans to permit all providers to participate in the network if \nthey agree to accept the plan's contract terms, especially their \npayment rates.\n  This amendment, however, would not require MedicareAdvantage plans to \nallow any health care provider to participate in the plan's network \njust because he or she is willing to do so. Nor would this amendment \nprovide that a MedicareAdvantage plan could not pay a non-network \nprovider any less than whit it pays a network provider.\n  This amendment simply directs plans to pay either their in-network or \nout-of-network for covered services that are provided by any type of \nhealth professional who is licensed to provide the service in a \nmedically underserved State.\n  Finally, this amendment is not intended to favor physicians versus \nphysical therapists, nurse practitioners, or other health \nprofessionals, or for that matter, to favor those other health \nprofessionals versus physicians.\n  This amendment simply would recognize the reality of healthcare in \nrural and frontier America--there simply aren't enough healthcare \nproviders to go around. In States like Wyoming, the problem is getting \nworse, not better. Many of our doctors and other health professionals \nare growing older and retiring, while others are leaving our State to \nmove to places with better medical liability laws.\n  In States with dire shortages of doctors and other healthcare \nproviders, seniors shouldn't have to get into the car in the heat of \nsummer or the cold of winter to drive to the nearest city to get \nhealthcare services that they could get in their own town, or the town \nnext door.\n  Even going to the town next door can be a challenge in Wyoming, \nbecause the town next door may be many miles away!\n  I want seniors in Wyoming and other sparsely populated States to be \nable to choose a MedicareAdvantage plan if they want comprehensive \nhealth coverage. These plans will be competing to offer seniors an \nintegrated medical and drug benefit, innovative services like disease \nmanagement, and more complete preventive services to keep seniors \nhealthier.\n  For seniors in rural States to choose MedicareAdvantage, they need to \nknow that a plan's network provides real access. There's a big \ndifference between a network of health care providers being available, \nand a network of health care providers being accessible.\n  This amendment would provide protection and peace-of-mind to seniors \nwho might consider joining a MedicareAdvantage plan. It's the same \nsafeguard enjoyed by other Federal employees, including the Members of \nthis Body. I ask my colleagues to join me in passing this amendment to \nensure that seniors in rural and frontier States receive the same \nprotection and piece-of-mind that we have in our own Federal health \nplan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIllinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I see my colleague from Nebraska. There as a unanimous \nconsent that I was to be recognized. I know the Senator has come to the \nfloor. I hope we can work out a time that the Senator from Nebraska \nmight be able to speak.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Senator Ensign and I are teaming up on a couple of \namendments. We will follow the distinguished Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will finish at no later than 1 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, understand what this debate is about. It \nis the first time Congress has seriously considered offering help to \nsenior citizens to pay for prescription drugs. I have said to Senators \nGrassley and Baucus, who bring S. 1, the bill that is before us, to the \nfloor, that I congratulate them for their good efforts. It is not an \neasy achievement.\n  For the first time in American history, we will offer this kind of \nassistance to seniors. But I have to say, having conceded their valiant \neffort, this prescription drug plan they have brought to the floor \nstill has major deficiencies and major problems. I think it is going to \nrun into a firestorm of criticism, primarily from senior citizens and \ntheir families, once they understand the specifics of S. 1.\n  For example, a lot has been said about a $35 monthly premium. This \nbill, S. 1, doesn't guarantee a $35 monthly premium for prescription \ndrug coverage. It is a suggestion. It is not even worth the paper it is \nprinted on. What is guaranteed is a $275 deductible, which means you \nreally don't get any drug coverage until you have spent at least $275. \nFor some people, that is not a major outlay from their own personal \nbudget. For others, it could be.\n  There also is no assurance in terms of the amount of money that will \nbe paid for your prescription drugs by the Government. The goal is 50/\n50--that you would split it with the Government. There is no assurance \nthat will happen.\n  There is also going to be a gap in coverage. In other words, if you \nsign up for this voluntary program, if you pay your monthly premium of \n$35 plus, and if you start receiving checks from the Government, you \nmay find a time, perhaps during the end of the year, when the \nGovernment checks stop coming because there is a gap in coverage.\n\n  My friend, Senator Boxer of California, will offer an amendment later \nto say what are we going to do about cancer victims--people who take \nexpensive drugs that are necessary to save their lives. Under the bill \nbefore us, there will come a point in time each year when the \nGovernment stops helping cancer victims pay for the prescription drugs \nthey need to stay alive. That gap in coverage is troubling, and it \nshould be.\n  Also, there is no allocation for money spent by employers on behalf \nof retirees, that that be counted for the employee's benefit to qualify \nfor this plan, which means that some employers might be tempted not to \nprovide coverage at all to their retirees, and others won't see the \nbenefit of that coverage because it doesn't translate into help under \nS. 1.\n  Those who push this plan believe in competition, so long as the \ncompetition is limited to two HMOs that can offer private insurance \ncoverage for prescription drugs. That is the only\n\n[[Page S8491]]\n\ncompetition they are interested in. The interesting thing is, when you \ngo to the seniors of America and say what are you looking for in a \nprescription drug plan, it is an amazing response.\n  Over 600 seniors were asked in a survey of a week or so ago: Which \nshould be a higher priority of Congress, passing prescription drug \ncoverage for seniors under Medicare or passing a bill to control \nexcessive prices for prescription drugs? The choice: S. 1, prescription \ndrug coverage for seniors under Medicare or passing a bill to control \nthe excessive, runaway, skyrocketing prices.\n  Look at what they said. Of all seniors--people over 55--25 percent \nwant Medicare drug coverage; 53 percent said control drug prices. Then \nlook as you go down here. That portion here, 55 to 64 years of age, \nsaid 25 percent want Medicare drug coverage; 57 percent said control \ndrug prices. For seniors, 65 and older, 26 percent want Medicare drug \ncoverage and 50 percent said control drug prices.\n  In each instance, by a margin of more than 2-to-1, seniors--people \nover the age of 55--have said to Congress: Don't miss the ball here. \nThe object has to be controlling the excessive cost of drugs. You can \noffer a helping hand to us, and that is good--25 percent believe that \nis good--but it won't mean anything if you don't do something about the \ncost of prescription drugs.\n  I am sorry to report to you that S. 1--I always have to look to see \nhow many pages this is--with 654 pages doesn't dedicate a paragraph or \na page to bringing down the excessive cost of prescription drugs. So \nthe No. 1 issue, by a margin of 2-to-1, for people over 55 in America \nis controlling excessive drug prices, and it is ignored by S. 1. So \nhere we are with this historic opportunity, and we are completely \nmissing what most seniors in America believe to be the highest \npriority.\n\n  I went to my staff and said: Let's start from the beginning. What \nkind of a prescription drug program would we create if we had a blank \nslate? I said to them: Here is what I would like to see us come up \nwith. Let me give a comparison between what we are proposing as my \nsubstitute amendment and the underlying bill.\n  The Grassley-Baucus bill has a $275 deductible. I said: Let's \neliminate that deductible, and we did. Under the MediSAVE amendment, \nthere is no deductible.\n  The premium under Grassley-Baucus is estimated to be $35, which means \nit could be much higher. I said: Let's require that the premium for \nthis volunteer prescription drug plan be $35 defined in statute.\n  Cost sharing, under the best of circumstances, is 50/50 under the \nGrassley-Baucus plan, and under the MediSAVE plan, which we propose, it \nis 70/30, a substantially greater benefit for every senior covered by \nthis plan.\n  The coverage gap I mentioned earlier in Grassley-Baucus says if you \nreach a point where you had $4,500 in prescription drugs in a given \nyear--not an outrageous possibility; that is a little more than $350, \n$400 a month; a lot of seniors face that--that at some point during the \ncourse of the year your benefits will stop. I said: Eliminate that gap. \nI want full coverage all the way up to the catastrophic level of $5,000 \nin prescription drugs, which then kicks in at 90-percent reimbursement. \nAnd we did.\n  Then we got to this issue: Will we have lower prescription drug \nprices? Under Grassley-Baucus, no. That is why the pharmaceutical \ncompanies love this bill. We have not heard a word from them. They \nthink this is great. Uncle Sam is going to provide some assistance to \nseniors to pay for prescription drugs, and the drug companies can \ncontinue to hike the prices of the drugs every single year without any \nrestraint in S. 1. But we know there is a better way, and the better \nway is not socialism, as some of my critics might say.\n  The better way is the Veterans' Administration of the United States \nof America. They look at their hospitals across America and the \nmillions of veterans they serve and they go to the drug companies and \nsay: If you want your drug used in our Veterans' Administration \nhospitals, you have to give us a discount, and they do. The drug \ncompanies give a 40- to 50-percent discount, and that should be part of \nthis Medicare plan as well.\n  Probably the most important single element in this MediSAVE plan I am \noffering is we are going to have Health and Human Services negotiating \ngroup purchasing. Drug companies are not going to like this. \nPharmaceutical companies do not like to see their profit margins come \ndown. But these are the most profitable corporations in America. I do \nnot believe it is the responsibility of the Senate to find ways to \nreward the special interest groups, the pharmaceutical companies, and \nthe HMOs at the expense of senior citizens. That is exactly what this \nbill does.\n  As I mentioned earlier, more benefits would count toward out-of-\npocket spending. Medicare would have a deliberate benefit available. \nThat is what I think is equally important. We say: Fine, competition in \nchoice. Private insurance companies can offer prescription drug \nbenefits but allow Medicare, the Government agency, to have a \nprescription drug program available to every senior across the United \nStates.\n\n  Why is that important? Medicare, as an agency, has no profit motive. \nMedicare, as an agency, has a lower administrative cost than health \ninsurance companies across America, and Medicare, an agency speaking \nfor tens of millions of seniors, can negotiate lower prices. They can \ndo what the Veterans' Administration has done, and that is why many of \nthe most conservative Members of this Chamber live in dread for fear \nthat Medicare would be able to compete with private insurance \ncompanies. Put that competition in place. Give the seniors a choice. \nMediSAVE does it. Grassley-Baucus does not.\n  We have an option for private coverage. Of course, it is in both \nbills.\n  We have a fallback which says if a senior citizen wants to go to the \nMedicare plan, they can always go to it, whether there is a private \ninsurance plan in their region.\n  The benefit begins, incidentally, under the Grassley-Baucus bill, \nconveniently after the next Presidential election. So the White House \ncan go around crowing about S. 1, prescription drug coverage is on the \nway, we delivered for seniors of America, and it is going to show up a \nfew days after the election. What is wrong with this picture?\n  Seniors need help right now. A discount card is nice, but let's put a \nprescription drug policy in place that helps seniors right now. So we \ncall on the establishment of this program as soon as practicable.\n  How did we do this? How did we put together all these benefits, which \nare much more generous than Grassley-Baucus, and still have CBO score \nit at $400 billion? I learned a little trick from the Republican side \nof the aisle when it came to tax cuts. When they could not get enough \nmoney for tax cuts, they decided they would sunset them at some point \nand reauthorize them. We did the same thing.\n  Grassley-Baucus costs $400 billion scored through 2013. Our MediSAVE \nsubstitute costs $400 billion scored to sunset at 2010. At that point, \nCongress can take a look at it. If we reach the point where we want to \nreauthorize the program or change it, it is up to us. In the meantime, \nwe offer seniors in America a quality program, something they want, \nsomething they can use, and something that will truly help them.\n  If we do not address the cost of prescription drugs as part of a \nprescription drug program, we are going to fail. There is nothing we \ncan do offering a percentage helping hand to seniors that will keep up \nwith the dramatic increase in the cost of prescription drugs, which \nhappens every single year. This substitute I am offering will provide \nthat kind of competition.\n  Before I yield to my friend from Minnesota, who is a cosponsor of \nthis amendment, let me give a couple other items that I believe might \nbe of interest to my colleagues.\n  The Durbin MediSAVE amendment is cosponsored by Senator Dayton of \nMinnesota, who is here, Senator Boxer, Senator Byrd, Senator Corzine, \nSenator Harkin, Senator Landrieu, Senator Stabenow, and Senator \nJohnson. It also has been endorsed by the AFL-CIO, United Auto Workers, \nAFSME, Alliance for Retired Americans, the American Federation of \nTeachers, and the National Committee to Preserve and Protect Social \nSecurity.\n  At this point, I wish to yield, for the purpose of debate, to my \ncolleague\n\n[[Page S8492]]\n\nfrom Minnesota, Senator Dayton, without yielding the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I thank Senator Durbin. I commend my distinguished \ncolleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, who has spearheaded the \ndevelopment of this amendment, and for the leadership he has shown in \nthis and so many other areas. I stand proudly with the Senator today.\n  The Durbin amendment is the essential test for this body. It is going \nto be the measure of our commitment to seniors and to other Medicare \nbeneficiaries all over America. It is going to be a test of our \nsincerity of what we said we intend to do for those people who are \neither disabled, through no choice of their own and are required to be \non Medicare at an early age, or senior citizens who have worked \nthroughout this country who have served this country so well and now \nare in their retirement years, the largest users by age of prescription \ndrug medicines. So they are the ones most dependent on the quality of \ncoverage we provide for them.\n  I heard again today from colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \nas I have heard others say throughout this Chamber, and as I have said \nmany times in Minnesota, that our senior citizens deserve prescription \ndrug coverage that is as good as Members of Congress receive; that is \nas good as the Federal employees receive through the plan of which we \nare all part. Yes, we pay into that plan, but it is also very well \ncovered--``subsidized'' would be the right word--by our employer, the \nFederal Government; the same in the case of Senator Durbin's amendment, \nat a level of parity to our plan.\n  If we want to provide senior citizens and other Medicare \nbeneficiaries with the same level of coverage that we get in Congress, \nthen Senator Durbin's amendment is the way to do that.\n  S. 1, by contrast, provides half of those benefits overall--one-half \nof what we get in Congress. That is not right, that is not fair, and \nthat is contrary to what I have heard most of my colleagues \nrhetorically say over the last month, and even the last couple of \nyears, about the intent.\n  We cannot have it both ways. It is either going to be only half as \ngood under S. 1 for senior citizens as it is for Members of Congress or \nit is going to be as good as Members of Congress receive under the \nDurbin amendment.\n  Do we have the resources? Yes, we have the resources. We surely had \nplenty of resources when I came to the Senate 2\\1/2\\ years ago, \nsurpluses for a decade, as far as the eye could see. Now that we have \nbeen shifted into deficit mode, suddenly we are talking about a bill \nthat is inadequate.\n  It is not lack of money. It is a lack of priorities. It is a lack of \nthe right priorities for people in this country, and Senator Durbin's \namendment would say we are going to go back to the drawing board and do \nwhat is right for seniors and Medicare, and then we are going to turn \naround and do what we must to balance that equation.\n  As the Senator from Illinois also pointed out so well, if we want to \ndo anything to address the ravaging of budgets of people of all ages by \nthese prescription drug prices, it has to be through the kind of \nstructured program which the Senator has proposed; otherwise, it is \njust a continued license to steal for the pharmaceutical industry.\n  S. 1 does nothing except say taxpayers are going to pay the costs of \nthese rapidly escalating drug prices. Seniors will have to pay for a \npart of it as well. And then all of the taxpayers who are not senior \ncitizens who are paying for part of this program for seniors are going \nto have to go to the drugstores for their families and themselves and \nkeep paying prices that go higher and higher.\n  I had a deck of cards made that I am handing out in Minnesota. They \ncompare the prices of these drugs now in Canada and the United States. \nAside from the exchange rates, they show a fair comparison of prices \nfor the same medicine, same manufacturer, same packaging, everything \nexactly the same in Canada as the United States. The prices in Canada \nare sometimes as low as 10 percent of what they are in the United \nStates, 20 percent quite common, a third--one can get the same medicine \nin Canada for one-third the price in the United States.\n  Why? Because the Canadian Government stands up for its citizens. The \nCanadian Government says: We are not going to allow you to charge these \nexorbitant prices and make these excessive profits out of the pockets \nof our people. Tragically, our Government does nothing of the sort. \nThis bill would continue that policy: Hands off; pharmaceutical \nindustry, take whatever you can get.\n  So I commend the Senator from Illinois. I am grateful to him for \nputting this amendment together. I am proud to cosponsor it. I commend \nit to my colleagues, and I ask the people of America to keep an eye on \nthis vote because it is going to determine whether we mean what we say.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota, and \nI think it really does come down to whether we are going to pass a \nprescription drug plan in name only or something that seniors truly \nwant and can use and is fair for them.\n  The Senator from Minnesota led us yesterday in an amazing rollcall \nvote, 93 to 3. We, as Members of the Senate, said we would live by the \nprescription drug plan that is created by this bill. Well, stay tuned. \nSee if that amendment survives the conference committee or ever comes \nback to us.\n  If it does not, if it is taken out, the Senator from Minnesota has \nmade a point. As Members of Congress, we will have a benefit twice as \ngenerous as what we are now offering to seniors across America, and \nwhat we are offering is not that generous to the seniors.\n  Look at what it is. We estimate over the next 10 years the cost of \nprescription drugs for seniors in America will be $1.8 trillion. In \nthat period of time, we are going to spend $400 billion in this \nprescription drug benefit. So that is less than one-fourth of the total \ncost of prescription drugs.\n  How can that one-fourth, $400 billion, go further? If the overall \ncosts are reduced down from $1.8 trillion.\n  Let me give an idea of how that works. The Veterans' Administration \nhas cut drug prices for veterans by as much as 50 percent by \nnegotiating with drug companies. There is no provision in S. 1 that \nrequires the Federal Government or Medicare or anyone to negotiate with \nthe drug companies on behalf of senior citizens--none. At best, we hope \nsome private insurance companies will work out a formulary that gives \nthem an opportunity for a profit by reducing the cost of drugs. That is \nas good as it gets. That is as close as this Senate will come to saying \nto the drug companies that they have to do better.\n  When it came to our veterans, we stood up as a government and said: \nWe are going to stand behind them. When it comes to this situation for \nprescription drugs for seniors, we do not.\n  Health and Human Services has a similar formulary of drugs available \nacross America for community health centers and the like. They bargain \ndown prices. But when it comes to seniors, the largest unprotected \ngroup of prescription drug users across America, this bill is silent; \nit does nothing. The alternative which I am proposing will do \nsomething.\n  Medicare has 25 times the number of people as the Veterans' \nAdministration. It has bargaining power. It can reduce the cost of \ndrugs. At this point, we know the inspector general of HHS compared a \nlist of 24 drugs covered by both Medicare and VA and found that VA \nspent 52 percent less for the same drugs. The inspector general \nestimated that Medicare would have saved $760 million in 1 year on \nthose 24 drugs alone.\n  Let me say parenthetically, when we went to the Congressional Budget \nOffice to score this, incredibly, they refused to even concede that we \ncould get a discount on drugs. Now, I like the Congressional Budget \nOffice. I am sure they are the greatest people in the world. But to \nwhom are they listening? They are ignoring the reality of the Veterans' \nAdministration. There is real cost savings that we can anticipate.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what the savings are for seniors when we \nmove from the 50/50 split that is proposed by this bill to a 70/30 \nsplit, 70 percent paid by the Government for prescription\n\n[[Page S8493]]\n\ndrugs, assuming a $35 monthly premium.\n\n  Take a look at it. If a senior in 1 year spent $1,000 for \nprescription drugs, they would end up spending out of pocket $720 under \nour proposal--that is under MediSAVE--but under the Grassley-Baucus \nbill, they would actually spend over $1,000.\n  How is that possible? A thousand dollars of prescription drugs and it \ncosts more than $1,000? Do not forget the monthly premium. The monthly \npremium has to be added in. That has to be paid. So if a senior signs \nup for this voluntary prescription drug benefit under this plan, for \nthe first $1,000 in drugs they have spent, they are not going to get \nanything back; they are still going to be out of pocket.\n  Now let's look at what happens with $2,300, which is the average that \nseniors pay for prescription drugs. Under our MediSAVE plan, it says a \nsenior will spend out of pocket $1,110--that counts your monthly \npremium. Under the Grassley-Baucus bill, it is $1,708. We are going to \nsave them about $600 if they are the average senior with the average \nannual cost for prescription drugs of $2,300. Our bill will save \nseniors $600 over the Grassley-Baucus plan.\n  As we go up to $4,000, $1,620 is what a senior would pay out of the \n$4,000 prescription drug bill under our plan, $2,558 under the \nGrassley-Baucus plan. For the $5,000 plan, the situation is a senior \nwould pay $1,920 under MediSAVE, $3,307 under the Grassley-Baucus bill. \nAnd then for $10,000, here is a situation where a senior would have out \nof pocket $2,420 for a $10,000 bill--and prescription drugs can reach \nthat cost; ask people on cancer therapies--$4,539 if they took the \nGrassley-Baucus plan.\n  So by every single measure at every single stop along the road, the \nplan I am proposing is going to offer much better and real savings for \nseniors.\n  Some I have talked to on the Republican side of the aisle say: \nDurbin, there you go again; this would be a price control. Well, the \nVeterans' Administration bargains with drug companies. We do not call \nit price control. When Canada stands up for its citizens to the same \nAmerican drug companies, I think they are standing up for a national \nvalue and a family value. It is not a matter of corrupting the \nmarketplace. The marketplace now is being driven by a handful of \nprescription drug companies that have little or no competition.\n  So unless and until some force such as the Government or the \nVeterans' Administration or the Department of Health and Human Services \nsteps in, the average family, the average senior, does not have a \nfighting chance.\n  Incidentally, we brought this other chart out so people can see that \neven under this administration, we have had efforts by the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to bargain down the cost of drugs.\n  Remember the anthrax scare? They said perhaps everybody should be \nprepared to buy Cipro. They took a look at Cipro market prices, and it \nwas $4.67 per tablet. People said: If we have an anthrax problem across \nAmerica, how will we afford this?\n  The Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy Thompson, went in \nand bargained it down to 95 cents and ultimately to 75 cents a pill \nfrom $4.67, and they made a profit at 75 cents. Do you want to know \nwhat the markup is on your prescription drugs? Look at what he \nachieved.\n\n  I will quote Secretary Thompson, who achieved this, and I commend him \nfor it:\n\n       Everyone said I wouldn't be able to reduce the price of \n     Cipro. I'm a tough negotiator.\n\n  He obviously was, but when it comes to tough negotiations, this bill \nis silent. S. 1, the bill before us, is silent when it comes to these \nnegotiations. We need to have someone who will stand up for seniors, \nfamilies, and against the excessive prices charged by drug companies. \nThe reason the drug companies want this bill is that no one is standing \nagainst them.\n  The bill I am offering, the MediSAVE substitute, will have exactly \nthe opposite impact. We will bring down the excessive costs of \nprescription drugs. We will guarantee a $35 monthly premium, no \ndeductible. We will make certain there is no gap in coverage so the \nprivate insurance companies cannot yank the chains of seniors across \nAmerica. We will always give you a Medicare option so, as a senior, you \ncan turn back to that agency and you can have a not-for-private low \nadministrative overhead cost formulary that is discounted always \navailable to you.\n  That is what seniors want. That is what they need. That is why so \nmany organizations endorsed this bill. This is the bill we should be \npassing. We should send this to the House and say: What you are \noffering is a pale alternative to the real thing; MediSAVE is the real \nthing.\n  I commend it to my colleagues. I hope they join in voting for passage \nof this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \nunanimous consent be modified so I be allowed to offer an amendment in \nthe slot allocated to the Senator from Nevada, since we are cosponsor, \nand I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to offer two amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1012\n\n (Purpose: To provide medicare beneficiaries with an additional choice \n  of Medicare Prescription Drug plans under part D that consists of a \n   drug discount card and protection against high out-of-pocket drug \n                                 costs)\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside and the Senate proceed to the consideration of \namendment No. 1012.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Hagel], for himself and Mr. \n     Ensign, proposes an amendment numbered 1012.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1026\n\n (Purpose: To provide medicare beneficiaries with a discount card that \n     ensures access to privately-negotiated discounts on drugs and \n           protection against high out-of-pocket drug costs)\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside and the Senate proceed to the consideration of \namendment 1026.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Hagel], for himself, Mr. \n     Ensign, Mr. Lott, and Mr. Inhofe, proposes amendment numbered \n     1026.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1012\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I will speak on the pending amendment \nthat Senator Hagel and I have offered. This amendment is similar to the \nbill we offered in last year's Medicare prescription drug debate. We \noffered it as a complete substitute last year. I will describe this \nlegislation.\n  What we are proposing to do is substitute our piece of legislation \nfor the prescription drug portion of the pending legislation. It is \nvery important to have a prescription drug benefit for those seniors, \nespecially those who are low or middle income, who have serious \ndiseases and sometimes have to choose between prescription drugs and \nrent or prescription drugs and maybe even the type of food they eat.\n  I have heard story after story around my State of seniors who \nliterally sometimes do not take their medications or maybe take half a \ndose because they cannot afford the prescriptions their doctor has \nrecommended.\n  The Hagel-Ensign amendment has several advantages over the current \nportion of the committee bill. First, it takes effect one full year \nearlier than the committee bill. Second, we do not have monthly \npremiums for our prescription drug benefit. Under the committee's mark, \nseniors pay $35 a month; under ours, it is a one-time annual fee of \n$25, that is all. They pay that once a year, unless they are low-\nincome, and then we waive that annual fee. Under the committee's mark, \nit is $35 a month.\n  We have several other differences in the bill. In the committee's \nmark, low-\n\n[[Page S8494]]\n\nincome seniors have a very generous benefit for those above Medicaid \nincome but who are below 160 percent of poverty. We recognize it is \nvery generous. As a matter of fact, I submit it is overly generous and \nwe will see an overutilization by those senior citizens because they do \nnot have anything at stake. One to two dollar co-pays when you are \npaying 97.5 percent of their out-of-pocket expenses is not enough to \ndiscourage overutilization. We are going to see an explosion of \nutilization of drugs, especially in the low-income market.\n  Let me explain the amendment. We offer a prescription drug benefit \nwith the seniors paying up to a certain percent depending on income, up \nto a certain dollar figure, and after that the Government will pick up \n90 percent of the cost. For people who are below 200 percent of \npoverty, which is around $18,000 a year for an individual or $24,000 \nfor a couple, they would be capped at an out-of-pocket expense of \n$1,500, and after that the Government picks up 90 percent. Between 200 \nand 400 percent of poverty, incomes for an individual up to nearly \n$36,000, and for a couple a little over $45,000, they would be capped \nat an out-of-pocket expense once again of $3,500 a year, and the \nGovernment pays 90 percent above that. Between 400 and 600 percent they \nare capped at $5,500 out-of-pocket a year. For people above that, the \nwealthier seniors, 20 percent of their income is their deductible under \nthis plan.\n  All of these people get a prescription drug discount card. That \nprescription drug discount card can provide a discount of 25 to 40 \npercent on the drugs they purchase. Before these ever kick in they have \nalready saved money for every senior. This is a completely voluntary \nplan. If seniors like the coverage they have today, they can stay in \nthe coverage they have today. If they want to try something guaranteed \nto cap their out-of-pocket expenses, this is the plan for them.\n\n  We have several real-life examples to compare with the committee \nmark. First, James Johnson is 68 years old with an income of around \n$16,000. He is above 160 percent of poverty. He is being treated for \ndiabetes. These are typical medications of someone being treated for \ndiabetes: glucophage, glyburide, neurontin, lescol, zoloft. This totals \n$5,736 a year that this person pays for prescription drugs.\n  Let's compare under the committee mark versus the Hagel-Ensign \napproach. Under the committee mark, this person would have a total out-\nof-pocket expense of $4,000. Under the Hagel-Ensign, this person would \nhave about $1,900. This person would do a little over $2,000 better \nunder Hagel-Ensign than under the committee mark. For those low-to-\nmiddle income seniors who have a serious disease, they do better under \nour approach.\n  Everyone wants to help the most those who need it the most. Under our \napproach that is exactly what happens. Those people who are sick, who \nneed the most help, get the most help under our plan.\n  Here is another real life example. Doris Jones is 75 years old with \nan income of around $17,000 per year and is being treated for diabetes, \nhypertension, and high cholesterol. She takes lipitor, glucophage, \ninsulin, coumadin, with total drug costs around $3,600. To compare the \ncommittee mark, the bill before us compared to Hagel-Ensign would spend \naround $2,380 a year under the committee bill; under the Hagel-Ensign \napproach she spends about $1,700. Although she did not have as much \nout-of-pocket drug costs for the year, she saves almost $700 a year \nunder the Hagel-Ensign approach.\n  And the last real-life example, Betty Smith is 66 years old. She has \nan income of around a little over $15,000 per year and is being treated \nfor breast cancer. She is still receiving low-dose radiation therapy \nwith nolvadex. Her medication profile is as follows: morphine, paxil, \ndexamethasone, aciphex, and nolvadex, with total costs for drugs around \n$8,000 a year. To compare Betty's costs between the Hagel-Ensign \napproach and the committee mark: her total out-of-pocket expenses will \nbe $4,340 with the committee mark; under our bill, she will spend \naround $2,100, which would be a savings to her of almost $2,200 a year.\n\n  Once again, comparing the two approaches, those middle- to low-income \nseniors who have serious diseases are going to get much more help under \nthe Hagel-Ensign plan.\n  Our bill actually costs less money than the committee approach and \nbecause of that we are going to be offering an amendment, which \nsubsidizes the costs for people with incomes 160 percent of poverty and \nunder; I will talk about that in just a minute. But the reason our bill \ncomes in at less money is because the seniors are paying the first \ndollars out of pocket. After that, the Government kicks in to subsidize \ntheir costs. So, by them paying the first dollars out of pocket, we \nencourage people to be accountable in the system. The person who is \nreceiving the drugs is responsible for paying those first dollars. \nGuess what: that causes them to go out and shop. They call the various \npharmacies and find out what the best price is. They ask their doctor, \nIs there a generic drug available that is just as effective? If it is \nsomething maybe not life-threatening and they want to take the generic \nversion of the drug, the doctor can say, Yes, I have had good \nexperience with patients with this. They can take the generic drug, \nsaving themselves money and saving the whole system money.\n  That is why our bill overall would cost less money. What Senator \nHagel and I have decided to do is, because there is $400 billion \navailable to spend under the budget, we have taken around $60 billion, \nspread over 10 years, to put toward those people who are truly poor, \nbelow 160 percent of poverty. Our plan would give them, in a \npharmaceutical benefit account, $700 to spend on prescription drugs. If \nthey do not use it, it rolls over to the next year. By the way, if it \nrolls over 2 years in a row, and the third year they get another $700, \nat the end of the year they get to keep anything above $1,500. So there \nis an incentive; they have something at stake, so they will still shop \naround for the best price for their drugs. So it keeps market forces at \nplay within our Medicare prescription drug system. That is one of the \nstrong points, we feel, about our plan.\n  There are several other advantages that we think are in our bill that \nare not included in the committee mark. I asked this question \nyesterday; I asked the administration, I asked Secretary Thompson, and \nI asked the director who oversees Medicare, What will happen under the \ncommittee's mark to the State plans? My State of Nevada and many other \nStates, New York, Massachusetts, West Virginia--have State plans that \nhelp senior citizens with prescription drugs. What will happen to those \nstate low-income plans--above Medicaid level but below around 160 \npercent of poverty--if the committee mark is enacted?\n  The simple answer is: all of those plans will go away because, for \nthose seniors under this plan, there is no reason for the States to \npick them up anymore. The committee mark will pick them up completely.\n  Our plan works with the States, instead of substituting for the \nStates. Those plans in the States that are already working, and working \nwell, will continue. As a matter of fact, each State can learn from the \nother. If they want to be a little more generous, a little less \ngenerous, they can do that. But it doesn't supplant the States, like \nthe committee mark does.\n  The other big problem I have heard articulated with the committee's \nprescription drug benefit is that private companies that currently have \nplans are going to start dropping their plans left and right. Under our \nbill, because we offer a higher deductible than most of the plans \noffer, there is not going to be the incentive for them to drop their \nplans. So it is not going to be a transfer from the private sector onto \nthe public sector. And when I say public sector, I mean the taxpayer--\nyounger people paying the taxes for older citizens.\n\n  There are many benefits to our plan, we think, over the committee \nmark. Let me just quickly repeat those.\n  First, we help those seniors, especially in the middle- to low-\nincome, much more than the committee mark does, those who have serious \ndiseases.\n  Second, we have no monthly premiums. The committee mark has a $35-a-\nmonth monthly premium.\n  Third, our plan does not replace State plans, it works with State \nplans.\n  Fourth, our plan also does not encourage the replacement of private\n\n[[Page S8495]]\n\nplans that companies have set up for their retirees.\n  Fifth, I believe our bill will control drug costs into the future. I \napplaud the committee. They have gotten together in a bipartisan way, \ntrying to come up with a fix to a serious problem. But the problem I \nsee is that it is right now scored by the Congressional Budget Office \nat around $400 billion. I think there is going to be so much \noverutilization in that, that it is going to end up being more like \n$800 billion or a $1 trillion plan. Young people are going to have to \npay that.\n  That is just how much it is going to cost in the next 8 to 10 years. \nWhen you start extending that out into the 10 years beyond that, you \nstart doubling and tripling those costs as we get the new, more \nexpensive drugs into the marketplace.\n  So I think we should do the responsible thing. That is why we are \nencouraging our colleagues to take a look at this. We had the same bill \nvoted on last year. We got a bipartisan vote. We had 51 Senators vote \nfor this plan. If we got that for this amendment, this amendment would \nbe adopted as part of the bill.\n  I know there have been deals made: Let's just defeat all amendments. \nI encourage people to say, If we can improve this bill, let's improve \nthis bill. Let's make it responsible to the next generation. But let's \nalso do what we say we all want to do, and that is to help those \nseniors who truly need the help. Let's help those who are the sickest \nand those who are in the lower-income categories, who end up having to \nmake those decisions I talked about: choosing between prescription \ndrugs and rent, between prescription drugs and food, or maybe only \ntaking one of their prescriptions or a half dose of their prescription \nbecause they cannot afford the full dose.\n\n  In conclusion, I plead with my colleagues to study this issue. I know \nthis bill is being rushed through, so people have not had a chance to \ntake a look at all the options. This is so serious. This is the biggest \nentitlement program that any Senator who is currently serving will ever \nvote on. This has incredible implications for generations to come. We'd \nbetter do it right the first time because coming back for a fix a \ncouple of years from now--we have seen how difficult it was to get to \nthis point--is going to be virtually impossible.\n  So we'd better do it right the first time--at least get as close to \nright as we can. That is why we are encouraging our colleagues to take \na serious look at the Hagel-Ensign amendment and do something right for \nthe country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for treatment of Hawaii as a low-DSH State for \n  purposes of determining a medicaid DSH allotment for the State for \n                      fiscal years 2004 and 2005)\n\n       On page 633, after line 21, add the following:\n       (3) Application to hawaii.--Section 1923(f) (42 U.S.C. \n     1396r-4(f)), as amended by paragraph (1), is amended--\n       (A) by redesignating paragraph (7) as paragraph (8); and\n       (B) by inserting after paragraph (6), the following:\n       ``(7) Treatment of hawaii as a low-dsh state.--The \n     Secretary shall compute a DSH allotment for the State of \n     Hawaii for each of fiscal years 2004 and 2005 in the same \n     manner as DSH allotments are determined with respect to those \n     States to which paragraph (5) applies (but without regard to \n     the requirement under such paragraph that total expenditures \n     under the State plan for disproportionate share hospital \n     adjustments for any fiscal year exceeds 0).''.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise in support of my amendment to \nrestore a Medicaid disproportionate share hospital, DSH, allotment for \nHawaii. Medicaid DSH payments are designed to provide additional \nsupport to hospitals that treat large numbers of Medicaid and uninsured \npatients.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997, BBA, created specific DSH allotments \nfor each State based on each their actual DSH expenditures for fiscal \nyear 1995. In 1994, the State of Hawaii implemented the QUEST \ndemonstration program that was designed to reduce the number of \nuninsured and improve access to health care. The prior Medicaid DSH \nprogram was incorporated into QUEST. As a result of the demonstration \nprogram, Hawaii did not have DSH expenditures in 1995 and was not \nprovided a DSH allotment.\n  The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection \nAct of 2000 made further changes to the DSH program, which included the \nestablishment of a flood for DSH allotments. However, States without \nallotments were again left out. Other States that have obtained waivers \nsimilar to Hawaii's have retained their DSH allotments. Only two \nStates, Hawaii and Tennessee, do not have DSH allotments.\n  As currently drafted, S. 1 provides that States without DSH \nallotments could obtain an allotment if their waiver was terminated or \nremoved. It is my understanding that while this language would permit \nan allotment for Tennessee, it would prevent Hawaii from obtaining its \nDSH allotment as long as the QUEST program remains in place.\n  My amendment would provide a DSH allotment to Hawaii and allow for my \nhome State to participate in the Medicaid DSH program. This amendment \nis needed because many of our hospitals in Hawaii are struggling to \nmeet the elevated demands placed upon them by the increasing number of \nuninsured people. DSH payments will help Hawaii hospitals meet the \nrising health care needs of our communities and reinforce our health \ncare safety net. All 50 States need to have access to Medicaid DSH \nsupport.\n  My amendment is similar to language included in the Senate passed \nversion of S. 2, the Jobs and Growth Tax Act of 2003, that would have \nprovided assistance to low DSH States and would have provided an \nallotment for Hawaii. Unfortunately, the DSH provisions were not \nretained in the conference report. A Hawaii specific provision is \nnecessary as we attempt to provide additional support for hospitals in \nlow DSH States in this legislation.\n  I appreciate all of the work done by my colleague from New Mexico, \nSenator Bingaman, to provide additional support for low DSH States. I \nurge that my colleagues support this amendment to allow the State of \nHawaii to be treated like other extremely low DSH States and finally \nreceive a Medicaid DSH allotment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, I call for the regular order with respect to \nGrassley amendment No. 974 and send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mrs. Boxer, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1062 to amendment No. 974.\n\n  Mr. REID.

NO COVERAGE GAP FOR ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES WITH \n                   CANCER.--\n\n       ``(A) In general.--In the case of an eligible beneficiary \n     with cancer, the following rules shall apply:\n       ``(i) Paragraph (2) shall be applied by substituting `up to \n     the annual out-of-pocket limit under paragraph (4)' for `up \n     to the initial coverage limit under paragraph (3)'.\n       ``(ii) The Administrator shall not apply paragraph (3), \n     subsection (d)(1)(C), or paragraph (1)(D), (2)(D), or \n     (3)(A)(iv) of section 1860D-19(a).\n       ``(B) Procedures.--The Administrator shall establish \n     procedures to carry out this paragraph.

Mr. President, we on this side have been as cooperative as \nwe could be. We have done everything we can to move this legislation \nalong. And I have said publicly that I appreciate how Senator Frist has \nhandled legislation since he has become the Republican leader. He has \nnot tried to shut off debate. He has rarely filed cloture, and that is \ncommendable. And I have said, on more than one occasion, I appreciate \nthat.\n  But we are in a situation now where, as part of the regular process \nof doing business here, we have a difficult amendment. It is a tough \nvote for a lot of people. It is a Boxer amendment. In effect, it would \nallow coverage--without exception--for prescription drugs for people \nwho are diagnosed as having cancer.\n  We have been told by various people on the side of the majority that \nwe are not going to have a vote on this. Well, my response to that is, \nwe are going to do nothing else on the bill. This is now the regular \norder. And until there is an agreement made that we are going to vote \non this, we are going to do nothing else. This is it. We have a lot of \ntough votes here, and this is one of them.\n  Now, Mr. President, we could have, if we had been mischievous, done \nother things. Some said: Why don't we have Alzheimer's? Why don't we \nhave diabetes? Why not have juvenile diabetes? Why not have \nParkinson's? The Senator from California, acting in good faith, \nrecognizing the need to move this legislation, said she would limit her \namendment to cancer. And that is what has happened.\n  So, Mr. President, we are now at a point where there is going to have \nto be a decision made by the majority when we are going to vote. We \nwant a vote. That is all we want. We want a vote. We will do it at any \ntime, but until there is an agreement, there will be an agreement on \nnothing on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to speak about the underlying \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I think one of the greatest achievements of the \nMedicare bill that has been reported out by the Senate Finance \nCommittee is the compromise Senator Grassley and I worked out on the \nissue of private prescription drug plans.\n  Over the course of this 4-year debate over prescription drugs--and I \nmight add, it has been very frustrating for a lot of Senators. We have \nbeen trying to find a way to get prescription drug benefits passed for \nseniors but have been at loggerheads the last 4 years. Both sides \nwanted their view and neither was willing to compromise. But I think, \nfinally, it is clear we have reached an agreement.\n  I commend the chairman of the committee, Senator Grassley, and all \nthose who helped to work to make this possible. Frankly, a lot of \npeople are to be complimented--everybody from Senator Breaux to Senator \nKennedy. And the list is just endless. Senator Snowe, for example, has \nbeen a great advocate, tirelessly trying to get a compromise agreement \nover the years.\n  We finally agreed private entities should administer a Medicare \nprescription drug program. I know that is something that many, \nparticularly on the Republican side of the aisle, are very interested \nin.\n  Both sides of the aisle envision these entities might include \npharmacy benefit managers, so-called PBMs. They could include insurance \ncompanies, chain store pharmacies, or partnerships among these \nentities. Any one of those groups would contract with HHS and be the \nprivate entity or the contracting company that would contract out the \nprescription drug benefits to beneficiaries.\n  The main disagreement was whether these private plans should be \nrequired to bear insurance risk for the prescription drug benefit. \nWithout being too arcane, there is a question of performance risk and \ninsurance risk. Performance risk has traditionally been borne by the \npharmacy benefits manager. But the performance risk means the \nadministrative risk and the cost of doing a good job just \nadministratively; that is, without addressing the question of insurance \nrisk as to whether people are going to buy these prescription drugs and \nhow much the subsidy is or is not.\n  Now, some argue if plans are required to bear insurance risk in \naddition to the performance risk, they will be more efficient and \nprudent managers of prescription drug costs, the argument clearly being \nif you are a company or a PBM, and you have to bear the entire cost, \nthe entire risk, including not only performance risk but insurance \nrisk, you are probably going to be more efficient and probably a more \nprudent manager than you otherwise might be.\n  Plans will have stronger incentives, if they have that risk, to \nnegotiate better prices and implement cost-containment strategies to \nminimize unnecessary utilization, the argument goes, if these plans \nbear at least some level of insurance risk.\n  Now, there have been critics of this model. Those critics argue if \nplans are required to bear insurance risk, they would structure their \nbenefit design to discourage high-cost patients from enrolling in their \nplans; that is, they would cherry pick. We would be in the unfortunate \nworld of adverse selection, where some plans would model their program \nthey would offer to seniors in a way to discourage high-cost patients \nand encourage lower cost patients, and they therefore would be more \nprofitable, leaving some of the higher cost patients, that is, those \nwho really need drugs, out in the cold.\n  The health insurance industry has not been exactly rushing to the \ntable to offer these benefits. The insurance industry does not seem \nwilling to offer prescription drug benefits to seniors, even with the \nsubsidies they would get if they are required to bear all of the risk.\n  Without a strong commitment from the health insurance industry, many \nfear that the insurance risk structure would lead to an unstable \nbenefit. There would be a lot more instability because we don't know \nwhether companies would be participating by offering plans. After all, \nthis is something that is new. Plans would come in and out at will, \nforcing seniors to switch plans and possibly their medication.\n  In writing this bill, one of the greatest challenges Senator Grassley \nand I faced was how to find the right balance between efficiency and \nplan stability. There have been several major prescription drug benefit \nbills and approaches. One we hear a lot about is the tripartisan bill \nof last year. Another one which explains this phenomenon was the so-\ncalled Graham or Kennedy bill of last year. The tripartisan model, in \ntrying to resolve the dilemma between efficiency and stability, tilted \nmore toward efficiency and away from stability. It had many more \ncompetitive components in it to\n\n[[Page S8497]]\n\nallow companies to be more efficient and cut costs and be more likely \nto participate. On the other hand, it was more unstable from the point \nof view of beneficiaries, probably more unstable from the point of view \nof the company as well, and that was a problem that many on the \nDemocratic side had with that benefit design, particularly that model.\n  On the other hand, last year a major bill that was considered by the \nSenate was the so-called Graham-Kennedy bill. That bill tilted much \nmore toward stability at the expense of efficiency. It was more \nexpensive. More than $400 billion had been allocated over 10 years, and \nseniors would have had more predictability. They would know what they \nwere getting because there was more money for companies. On the other \nhand, companies would not be able to compete among themselves, and \nthere was much less competition and, therefore, under that model, much \nless efficiency.\n  One of the main merits of this bill is that it is in the middle. It \nis between the so-called tripartisan bill and the Graham bill. In \ntrying to find the right balance between efficiency and stability, we \nare pretty much in the middle. We have found that balance. We both \nagreed that we needed to create strong incentives to keep prescription \ndrug prices low. We also agreed that we needed stronger assurances that \nprivate plans would be ready and willing to enroll beneficiaries come \nJanuary 1, 2006, when the benefit begins.\n  We have found that balance in this bill. This bill was passed out of \nthe Finance Committee by a large bipartisan margin, which is some \nindication that we found the balance.\n  There are several important elements of this compromise I would like \nto highlight. First, our proposal would phase in insurance risk \ncarefully over time through the use of reinsurance payments and risk \ncorridors. Those are pretty big terms. What do they mean? Plans would \nreceive Federal reinsurance payments for 80 percent of their enrollees' \ncosts above the stop-loss level. These payments are intended to ensure \nthat plans have strong incentives to enroll high-cost beneficiaries. \nThat is, Federal reinsurance payments would cover 80 percent of the \nenrollees' costs above the stop-loss levels contained in the bill.\n  In addition, our proposal added another component to moderate risk \nthrough the use of what we call risk corridors. What in the world is a \nrisk corridor? Simply put, it would limit a plan's loss if the plan \nsustained substantial financial losses. And by the same token, risk \ncorridors would limit a plan's gains if it earned potential profits. We \nphase in risk over the first couple of years so that the private plans \nwould have a little cushion, a little better opportunity to know how \nwell their plan is working, and that errs a little bit more on \nstability at the expense of efficiency. But after a couple years, the \ntilt is a little more toward efficiency, having gained a couple years \nof experience, hopefully, of more stability.\n  During the first couple years the bill would establish a narrow \ncorridor of risk. Over time the risk corridor would be expanded, \nthereby shifting a greater share of the risk on to the health plan. By \nphasing in risk over time, this bill addresses one of the biggest \nconcerns plans had in considering whether to participate in the new \nprogram. That is, the uncertainty during the first couple years of the \nbenefit.\n  This uncertainty takes many forms. For example, who will sign up for \nthe benefit? That is a big question. Very few people know. Second, will \ndrug costs increase faster than Congressional Budget Office \nprojections? That is a big question. Moreover, will beneficiaries \nconsume more prescription drugs once the benefit has been implemented?\n  That is another big question. It is hard to know. That is why we \nbelieve it is important to phase in risk rather than just cold turkey, \n100 percent insurance risk the first day of the first year.\n  So during this period of uncertainty, we will ask the plans to bear a \nminimal level of insurance risk. As plans develop more experience, we \nwill require them to assume more risk.\n  I am more confident than I was last year that private drug plans will \nprovide a stable delivery system for Medicare beneficiaries under this \nnew plan both in urban and rural areas. I remain concerned that not all \nseniors will have a choice of two or more prescription drug plans in \nthe region. Plans may simply, given all the provisions we have added to \nthis bill to help give them a little bit of reassurance, not be willing \nto participate in some parts of the country. After all, it is their \nchoice whether plans want to participate.\n  This concern is why I insisted that any private plan delivery system \nmust offer all beneficiaries the choice of at least two private plans, \nand if any part of the country does not have at least two choices, the \nSecretary would be required to contract with a plan that is a Federal \nfallback or a backup plan that would offer the standard benefit at the \nnational average premium. Some might argue this delivery model does not \nprovide enough efficiency and cost management. Others might argue that \nthis will prove to be too unstable, too much efficiency, too much \ninstability, despite the changes we have made. Plans may come and go. \nWorse, they may not even appear and seniors will be confused. That is a \nconcern, and it is a legitimate concern, believe me.\n  Nevertheless, I believe that given the competing forces of efficiency \non the one hand--competition and cost containment--and stability on the \nother--making sure that seniors have the prescription drugs they want--\nwe have found a balance between these two fairly legitimate concerns.\n  I am not here to say it is the perfect balance. Clearly, others have \nbetter ideas how to address the question of where the balance is. I do \nbelieve the provisions of this bill are pretty close to it.\n  As we implement this benefit, we will have to carefully monitor the \nnew delivery system very closely to ensure that, in fact, it is fair to \nour seniors and also fair to our taxpayers and to our private sector \npartners.\n  There are a lot of concerns here. One surely is making sure the \nsenior citizens get the prescription drug benefit. But then equally \nimportant is that the American taxpayers' concerns are respected, and \nthat we get savings, where we can honestly get savings, not at the \nexpense of beneficiaries. That is why I believe an inclusion of private \ncompetition is important. It is very important.\n  Health care in our country is evolving, as you know, very quickly, \nand into areas we can hardly even imagine. I believe that in the next \n10 to 20 years, when we are also faced with the problem of the baby \nboomers, there are going to be dramatic changes. What are the three \nareas going to be?\n  First of all, with the massive computational power that is \ndeveloping, nanotechnology, married with the biotechnology, we will be \nable to, in not too many years from now--10, 12, 15 years--predict, \nwith the human genome project, the interaction of systems in our bodies \nand the effect of DNA and predict what maladies or illnesses people are \ngoing to have in the future. We will develop machines that will detect \nthings at a molecular level, with thousands of tests, that will be able \nto predict what will happen to each individual, or whether some of us \nare more inclined to get cancer or to have coronary disease--you name \nit. We are going to be able to predict very precisely in not too many \nyears from now.\n  In addition, we will then be able to take actions to prevent \nillnesses with much greater certainty than we can today. We will be \nable to prevent it, since we know better what will happen to each of us \nwith respect to our health, by deciding whether to take this pill or \nthat pill or that new medicine that addresses a potential coronary \ndisease that may occur with absolute certainty, or near certainty, 30 \nyears later, or a cancer disease that may, with almost near certainty, \noccur 20 years later. That is where we will be in Medicare. It is \nchanging so much.\n  Then, basically, health care will change from remedial care to \npersonal wellness care. That is, doctors and people in the health care \nindustry will be working with individuals to determine what illnesses \nthey may or may not get and things they can do right now to prevent \nthose illnesses from occurring. It will be a big shift from remedial \ncare, which is about 90 percent of today's health care, to wellness and \npreventive care.\n  What else will happen? Seniors are going to live a lot longer. The \nquality\n\n[[Page S8498]]\n\nof our lives will be a lot better. It will change the demographics of \nthe country and the health care in our country. The main point is that \nthere are going to be a lot of changes in health care in the not-too-\ndistant future.\n  What we are passing today on prescription drug benefits will also \nchange. It is almost impossible for us to predict what the legislation \nshould be in the years 2009, 2014, as this bill does. Yet we are doing \nthe very best we can.\n  My point is that, given where we are today, in June 2003, I think \nthis is a very good and aggressive attempt to try to find the right \nbalance given all the different considerations we face. We can be very \nsure--and the chairman and I will give it utmost vigilance and \noversight to make sure--that this delivers what is being promised to \nall our Medicare beneficiaries, the seniors of our country.\n  I respectfully urge my colleagues to closely evaluate the provisions \nand the merits of this compromise proposal. I have mentioned components \nthat I think some Senators haven't had time to look at yet. I am \ntalking about the balance between efficiency and stability. I am \ntalking about phasing in risks, the risk corridors, as a good-faith \neffort to try to help make competition work--if it does work. If it \ndoes not work, we will know after a period of time. If it does not \nwork, the bill provides a safety backup plan so that seniors are \nprotected.\n\n  As I said, with all of the health care changes and the changes in the \nmedical care that will happen over the years, we will probably revisit \nthis in the not-too-distant future to address current conditions and \nthe provisions of this bill.\n  As Senators study it more closely, they will realize there is a \nlittle more good in this bill than a lot of Senators originally \nthought. A lot of people have just not had an opportunity to focus on \nthis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1062 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have had conversations while the manager \nhas been speaking. We have been assured by the majority that we will \nhave a vote on the Boxer amendment in the next 24 hours. Having said \nthat, I withdraw the Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I address an issue that many of my \ncolleagues have asked me about over the past 2 weeks. It is an issue of \ngreat concern to many, particularly on my side of the aisle. That is, \nif this bill is enacted, how much will premiums vary and what will the \nactual effect of premium variation be for seniors?\n  Now, we have had a couple of votes already on this subject. I have \nnot had a chance to address it directly and I would like to do so at \nthis point. The issue again is the extent to which benefits and \npremiums may vary under this new Medicare drug benefit.\n  My Democratic colleagues are concerned that if benefits and premiums \nfor participating drug plans are allowed to vary seniors will be \nconfused and they will be unable to make informed choices, that is, the \npremiums seniors would pay, the monthly amounts they would pay for \nprescription drug coverage, should they volunteer to participate--that \nis, if they volunteer to participate, because it is an entirely \nvoluntary program. It is not mandatory like the old catastrophic \ncoverage bill was--in 1989 I think it was. This is voluntary. Seniors \nhave a choice of whether they want to sign up for this new prescription \ndrug benefit plan. If they do sign up, they pay a monthly premium of \n$35 a month for participating in the prescription drug plan.\n  Then the question is: How much can premiums vary and how much \nconfusion might that cause among people trying to figure out the \nvarious merits of the various plans?\n  I might say they will not be able to make an apples-to-apples \ncomparison between plans that are available in their own area. That is \ntheir concern; they just will not be able to compare fairly. As I said, \nthese concerns are legitimate.\n  Certainly, those who believe in competition believe choice should be \nbased on price and on quality. It should not be based on a plan's \neffort to select the healthiest beneficiaries and jettison the sickest. \nIt should also not be based on distortions in the market. That is, we \nwant fairness. We want equity. We do not want so-called cherry picking. \nWe do not want to have certain plans pick the healthiest seniors, \nadjust premiums to get the healthiest, and leave out other seniors who \nrequire more prescription drugs that are not as healthy. That would \njust not be fair.\n  At the same time, we want to have some competition, and this bill \ndoes provide for private plans to provide a drug delivery benefit. The \nreason for relying on the competitive delivery system rather than the \nGovernment-based program is to allow for innovation and benefit design, \nto let companies look to try to find a better way of doing things, that \nis, of containing costs, and be more efficient, without sacrificing \nquality and stability to our seniors.\n  I think most of us believe that kind of innovation will lead to \nefficiency. The attempt is to design it in a way that does not lead to \na risk in selection because that would be very unfair. So the question \nis: How can we ensure that choice is in fact based on the right \nfactors, that is on price and on quality? How can we make sure there is \nenough flexibility so plans can adapt to changing needs and to \na marketplace innovation, without providing so much flexibility that \nseniors have a difficult time choosing among plans? That is the \nchallenge. That is what we are trying to resolve in this bill.\n\n  I think the proposal before us, the legislation reported out of the \nFinance Committee that has come to the floor, does a pretty good job of \nconstructing that balance, and I will explain why I believe that is \ntrue.\n  First, on benefit variation--that is different benefits seniors may \nget because of different plans--the Grassley-Baucus bill limits \nbenefits variation at several levels. First, the $275 deductible and \nthe $3,700 out-of-pocket limit are fixed in the statute. Those two \nfigures cannot vary. So plans are permitted to improve the benefit, but \nthey cannot go higher than the deductible outlined in the law, and they \ncannot raise the stop loss beyond the level specified in the law. So \nthat is one check. It does leave some potential variation on the \npremium and copay, but at least two components--deductible and stop \nloss--are fixed in the law.\n  All plans, whatever the benefit design is, whatever they offer, have \nto have those two provisions as prescribed in the statute.\n  Now, a benefit variation is also constrained through various \nlimitations in what the Congressional Budget Office calls actuarial \nvalue or expected cost of the benefit. In plain English, that means the \nvalue of the benefit must be roughly equal to the standard benefit \npackage outlined in the legislation.\n  We have all heard about the standard benefit package, the deductible, \nthe stop loss, the premium, and what the copays are, so that the value \nof the benefit of any plan any company offers must be roughly equal to \nthe standard benefit package outlined in the legislation.\n  As I understand from actuaries who spend their time thinking about \nthese things, the practical effect of these provisions combined is \nthere will not be significant variation in benefit packages. There just \ncannot be. All companies are going to know pretty much what they can \ncharge. The actuaries do not predict much variation.\n  The bill also, however, attempts to minimize premium variation. How? \nWell, the bill includes various provisions that are intended to control \nvariation in the premiums so beneficiaries will not be faced with \nwidely varying premiums within their own region or across different \nparts of the country.\n  For example, if my mother learned her friends in Florida were paying \nfar less in monthly premiums than she was paying in Montana, I believe \nI would get an earful. I would hear from my\n\n[[Page S8499]]\n\nmother. She would wonder whether the system we created is fair. And she \nwould be right; it probably would not be fair.\n  What do we try to do about this? It is not perfect, but I think it is \na major effort, and I think it is a good effort.\n  First, all Medicare beneficiaries who are enrolled in the new drug \nprogram will be combined for purposes of calculating premiums and \npayments to plans, regardless of whether those beneficiaries are in fee \nfor service, enrolled in a drug-only plan, or whether they are enrolled \nin a private PPO or HMO. All senior citizens who are enrolled in \nMedicare will be combined for the purposes of calculating premiums and \npayments to plans, regardless.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, will my good colleague from the State of \nMontana please yield for the purpose of an introduction of an esteemed \nguest? I know this is very important, but I ask if he will yield for a \nmoment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I have been explaining various provisions in the bill \nthat I think largely address concerns that some on the Democrat side \nhave and I suppose on the Republican side of the aisle, too; namely, \npotential premium variation. Premiums that seniors pay might vary. Much \nconfusion might occur for seniors and anyone else involved in \nprescription drug benefits that would be distributed under this \nlegislation.\n  As I mentioned, the actuaries say there should not be much change. \nAlso, the risk pool will include all Medicare beneficiaries, ensuring \nan adequate number of low-drug-cost beneficiaries will be able to \nsubsidize the few beneficiaries with the high drug costs. Already, \nthere is a huge risk pool. There is kind of a cross subsidization. \nThose with very low drug costs will help pay for those much higher \ncosts of other seniors. The larger risk pool will prevent premium \nvariation because we use the whole pool.\n  In addition, the bill will calculate Federal contributions toward \nplan premiums based on the national average of all plan bids. This \ncontribution is then adjusted geographically for differences in prices. \nThis is a so-called geographic adjustor. We want to make sure one part \nof the country is not discriminated against compared to another part of \nthe country or vice versa, and we included the geographic adjustment on \nprices.\n  We have not included so far, because it is difficult to calculate, \ngeographic adjustment based on utilization. As we know, in some parts \nof the country there is more utilization. That is a fancy term for \nsaying there is a lot more care given to people than in other parts of \nthe country. More care, the greater utilization, tends to be in parts \nof the country with more hospitals, more specialty health care \nproviders.\n\n  There is an interesting study I urge my colleagues to read by Dr. \nWennberg. I have not found anyone who refutes it. Looking at the \ncountry as a whole, there are parts of the country where utilization is \ntwice as high and more than twice as high as other parts of the \ncountry. People, because of where they live, get twice as much health \ncare in some parts of the country than in other parts of the country. \nThis is adjusted for age, for race, for gender. It is adjusted for all \nthe factors that can possibly be thought of.\n  The more interesting part of this study, even though some parts of \nthe country get twice as much health care as other parts of the \ncountry--and it is because there are twice as many doctors or hospitals \nin some parts of the country as in others--the interesting part of the \nstudy is, the actual care given is no better, and in fact in some cases \nit is worse. That is, if you get twice as much health care, that is, \ntwice as many visits to the doctor or the hospital, particularly for \nchronic diseases, you will not be twice as healthy; you will not be any \nhealthier, on average, than you will be in parts of the country where \nthere is less utilization.\n  The point is that we are trying to adjust, as I mentioned earlier, \nand have a geographic adjustment based on the costs. We have not yet \nfigured out a way to adjust for different utilization mainly because, \nwhen it comes to prescription drug benefits for seniors, there is \nvirtually no data because we have not had prescription drug benefits \nfor seniors yet. Obviously, it is hard to get the data if we have not \nhad the program.\n  There are other provisions in the bill that enable us to get more \ndata, so fairly quickly we can get better utilization data and \ntherefore have a geographic adjustment based not only on price but also \non utilization. That will go a long way to address some of the concerns \npeople have about potential premium variation and complexity. When we \nget that data, as I said, we will have a lot more information, but \nthere is enough information already to have the effect of minimizing \nconcern about premium variations.\n  There is another provision in the bill to help address this potential \nproblem. That is, we have included in this bill a provision based on \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Program--otherwise known as \nFEHBP--that prohibits plans from changing premiums that are \nunreasonably higher than the costs of the benefits provider. In other \nwords, plans are prohibited from price gouging. That standard currently \nis in the law with respect to the FEHBP plan. That is in the law. There \nis a provision in current law that prohibits the FEHBP plans from \ncharging premiums that are unreasonably higher than the cost that has \nbeen provided. I believe that same provision as applied to prescription \ndrug pricing is an additional guarantee against gouging and certainly \nagainst unconscionable premium variation.\n  Finally, this bill allows the Secretary to refuse to contract with \nthe plan. That is in the bill. Maybe a plan leans toward enrolling \nhealthier beneficiaries. Maybe the Secretary determines that this plan \nis not a good actor; this plan is price gouging; this plan is engaging \nin cherrypicking; it is engaging in adverse selection at the expense of \nan American; or maybe it seems less committed to staying in the \nprogram; maybe there is a shady operation; who knows, maybe it seems \nmore likely to drop out fairly quickly\n\n[[Page S8500]]\n\nand it is not solvent or financially healthy; maybe the premiums seem \ninconsistent with others in the region.\n  For any of these reasons and reasons not contemplated at this time, \nthe Secretary can decide, at his discretion, not to contract with a \ndrug plan that has submitted a bid to participate in Medicare. That \noption is still there as a protection for our senior citizens. It is my \nhope that this discretion will help assure better plan choices for \nseniors and the benefits and premiums will, in fact, be fair and \nreasonable.\n  In short, in developing this compromise bill, Senator Grassley and I \nhave tried to allow a level of variation in premiums and benefits so as \nto foster innovation and to foster efficiency but not so much variation \nthat seniors will be confused or plans will game the system.\n  I think we have done a pretty good job of ending confusion and a \npretty good job of preventing plans from gaming the system. I hope my \ncolleagues will agree this proposal strikes at that.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1040\n\n(Purpose: To provide for equitable reimbursement rates in 2004 and 2005 \n      for Medicare+Choice organizations making the transition to \n                    MedicareAdvantage organizations)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, the Senator from New York, Mr. \nSchumer, and I are in the Chamber now to offer a amendment. \nUnfortunately, I have to withdraw that amendment because of budgetary \nconstraints with which we are going to be dealing.\n  This is an amendment that we believe is critically important as a \nbridge from where we are right now on the Medicare Program to where \nthis bill takes us. The bridge is in the area of Medicare+Choice, which \nis the Medicare option that is available in certain counties in this \ncountry for a health maintenance organization, the only place in \nMedicare that provides prescription drug coverage today.\n  About 10 to 12 percent of beneficiaries under Medicare participate in \nMedicare+Choice or Medicare HMO programs. Their satisfaction rate is as \nhigh or higher than in the traditional Medicare Program. The problem \nwith Medicare+Choice or the Medicare HMOs is they are funded at a level \nwhich does not increase at the same rate that the Medicare Program \nincreases. They are held at an artificially low level, which makes it \nvery difficult for them to survive.\n  The concern of Senator Schumer, who has been a great leader on this \nissue, and my concern is what happens between now and 2006 when the new \nMedicareAdvantage Program comes into effect under this bill. That \nprogram will include Medicare+Choice or Medicare HMOs, and a new option \nthat will be available through this bill of a PPO, which is a \nmore lightly managed insurance. Medicare HMOs are heavily managed with \ngatekeepers and a restricted number of providers, both doctors and \nhospitals to which you have access, but you get more benefits. PPOs \nhave less restrictions, less management, and more choices. The fee-for-\nservice has no restrictions, maximum choices, but higher costs.\n\n  What we wanted to do is put in an amendment that gave us a bridge of \nfunding so these existing HMO plans can survive until we get to 2006, \nbecause there is a big concern. We have seen HMO plan after HMO plan go \nout of business because of inadequate funding. Through the work of \nSenator Schumer and several others in this Chamber, we have been \npushing this issue in the Senate. We ran into a roadblock because of \nthe unavailability of funds in the Senate bill. But there is money in \nthe House bill, and the amendment Senator Schumer is going to offer \nhere, as soon as I drop the mike, will mirror what the House bill does.\n  I will turn it over to my colleague from New York. This is a vitally \nimportant amendment. It is really important for us to come out of the \nconference with money for Medicare+Choice or Medicare HMO plans for the \nyears 2004 and 2005, so when 2006 rolls around we will have a viable \nprogram, a robust program that this new MedicareAdvantage Program can \nintersect.\n  If we, on our side of the aisle, are concerned about competition and \nchoices and if we want choices, then we have to fund those choices to \nget to 2006, when, candidly, there will be a lot more money for these \nprograms to survive. I would like to see them survive in the interim.\n  The Senator from New York, as I said before, is leading the charge on \nthis issue. The House, thankfully, has included it in their underlying \nbill. We hope we will be able to keep that in conference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \npending amendments and call up amendment No. 1040.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?

Madam President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself and my colleague from Pennsylvania, as the lead sponsors of this \namendment. I also ask Senators Corzine, Clinton, Lautenberg, and Kerry \nbe added as cosponsors who support what we are doing here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, Senator Santorum has summed this up \nvery well. We have a large number of senior citizens who have opted \ninto a Medicare+Choice Program. The Medicare+Choice Program has been an \nexperiment. Basically it said, let's let some providers, in this case \nHMOs, provide Medicare for senior citizens so they have an option to go \ninto it.\n  What most of these programs have done, frankly, is they made a sort \nof deal with senior citizens. They say you have to go to the doctors \nand hospitals that are a part of our plan. In that way, we will reduce \ncosts. Then we can provide prescription drug coverage or other types of \ncoverage for you. It has been quite popular in a good number of places, \nin my State as well as many other States.\n  This program has had some trouble, there is no question about it. The \nreason is the cost of prescription drugs has gone way up. Health care \ncosts have gone way up. As a result, many have pulled out of \nMedicare+Choice. Many seniors--not all but most of the seniors I know--\nwent into it so they could get some prescription drug coverage.\n  I agree completely with Senator Santorum. We are, in 2006, going to \nprovide all kinds of different help to private providers who will \nprovide either prescription drug coverage or a whole Medicare+Choice-\ntype situation. But it absolutely makes no sense to let these programs \ngo under, which they will because there is not enough money for them \nnow, in 2004, 2005, until 2006 funding kicks in, and then whole new \ninfrastructures would have to be set up.\n  In addition, the premiums have gotten so high because the costs have \ngotten high and we have been unable to put in the money that many of \nthose providing Medicare+Choice have either pulled out entirely of \nlarge regions in this country or so many have pulled out there is not \nthe competition we would like to see.\n  In Suffolk County, in my area, I think it is 80,000 senior citizens \nwho were in Medicare+Choice; but where there were once 6 providers, \nthere are now only 2.\n  In addition, and really galling to the seniors, with good reason--I \ncompletely agree with them--the premiums, the copayments on these \nprograms have been large. They once were $10 or $20 or $30. Now, \nparticularly in suburban areas, they are $140 to $170 a month. In fact, \nmany of my constituents, with justification, cannot understand why \nMedicare+Choice is available in some areas with no copayments and no \npremiums, and in others the premium is so high that if you are a \ntypical senior citizen on a fixed income, you can't afford it.\n  Our proposal does two things--and, again, Senator Santorum is exactly \ncorrect. No. 1, it provides the money so these programs can stay in \neffect until 2006. Once we get to 2006, they are taken care of because \nof the structure of this bill. But to have them collapse makes no \nsense.\n  Second, it provides some equity. Because costs are higher, for \ninstance, in Suffolk and Nassau Counties, they should not be treated \nthe same and given the same dollars as New York City.\n  Who is paying the higher costs in the end? The senior citizen who is \nhaving the same kind of expenses as a senior citizen in New York City.\n  We add just the formula and make it more flexible so high-cost areas \nget some reimbursement. This is a problem in the suburbs of New York, \nin the suburbs of Philadelphia, in the suburbs of Texas and California. \nIt tends to be a suburban problem.\n  But make no mistake about it: Many of the senior citizens who live in \nthese suburban communities are not wealthy. They are not middle class. \nThey are struggling. They are on a fixed income. Medicare+Choice \noriginally was a salvation to them. Now it is becoming a real burden.\n  I would add, I do not believe this is the fault of the HMOs providing \nthe service. It is the Federal Government that has not put in enough \nmoney to make these things viable. We have corrected this in this \nproposal, but only in 2006, when it takes effect. Again, it makes no \nsense, no sense whatsoever, to let these HMOs that do Medicare+Choice \nfold and then have to start up again.\n\n  So this is an important amendment. Unfortunately, we cannot bring it \nto a vote because in the rules of the Senate, we would have to get 60 \nvotes to adopt this, and that is too uphill a burden. But the good news \nis, it is in the House bill which has different rules.\n  I know Senator Santorum, as well as all my cosponsors, joins me in \nsaying we want this program to be put in the final bill when it comes \nout of conference committee. We know there will be the kind of dollars \nthat might be available, and this is an extremely high priority.\n  So I am offering this amendment to underscore that importance, to let \nour diligent leaders of the Finance Committee--Senator Grassley and \nSenator Baucus--know how important it is to a good number of us, and to \nmake sure it has its place at the table when the conference committee \noccurs.\n  I just want to make a few more points about Medicare+Choice Programs. \nThese do not benefit well-to-do people. Let me give you some numbers. \nAmong Medicare beneficiaries who have annual incomes between $10,000 \nand $20,000 and who do not have Medicaid or group health coverage, 40 \npercent are in Medicare+Choice. These are the very people who cannot \nafford the high cost of prescription medicines.\n  Medicare+Choice, when it came in, was a godsend to them. And I, for \none, am on this side of the aisle, but I do not let any ideological \nblinders get in my way. If Medicare+Choice, a private program, is going \nto solve their problem, great, but let's provide it with the funds, \nparticularly in more suburban, high-cost areas so it can actually work.\n  Here is another statistic. In addition, 52 percent of Hispanic and 40 \npercent of African-American Medicare beneficiaries who do not have \nMedicaid or group health depend on Medicare+Choice. So this is an area \nthat affects typical Americans: hard-working retirees, who have not \nmade a windfall, who made a decent living just by the sweat of their \nbrow, and now they are retired and are on a fixed income, they need \nsome kind of help that goes beyond Medicare because they have a large \nprescription drug bill or they need something else. Medicare+Choice \nbecomes a health care safety net.\n  Again, it would be a shame if we did nothing. If we did not have this \nbill,\n\n[[Page S8502]]\n\nmost of the Medicare+Choice Programs would have faded away or made the \npremiums so high they would be out of the reach of all but very \ncomfortable people. This amendment provides the bridge between now and \n2006 when we know this will work.\n  I know there are many Senators who are enthusiastically for this \napproach. I want to add that Senator Kerry, who could not be here \ntoday, wanted me to let my colleagues know how enthusiastic a supporter \nhe is.\n  I hope we will work this out in the conference because it is one of \nthe most important things that are not in this bill, once you overcome \nthe basic disagreement we have of Medicare versus private.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1040 Withdrawn\n\n  So I am going to withdraw the amendment because, again, we do not \nwant to put ourselves, because of the Senate rules, under a burden of \nhaving to get much more than a majority, a 60-percent vote. We have \nhope because it is in the House bill. We are going to work hard in \nconference to see that it is kept in the conference agreement. But at \nthis point, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw this \namendment on behalf of Senator Santorum, myself, and the other \ncosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator has the right to \nwithdraw the amendment, and the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto yield to the Senator from New Mexico and then retain the floor after \nhe offers his two amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Rhode Island \nvery much for yielding to me.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments \nbe set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1065\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself and \n     Mr. Domenici, proposes an amendment numbered 1065.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, just very briefly, let me state that \nthis is the revised version of the amendment Senator Domenici and I had \n2 days ago that would have eliminated the assets test.

Madam President, just to indicate what this amendment \ndoes, this is an amendment related to Medigap and directs that a \nMedigap plan be developed to wrap around the prescription drug benefit \nthat is currently in the bill.\n\n[[Page S8503]]\n\n  Again, I will further explain this amendment and argue for it when we \nget the opportunity to do so.\n  I did need to have both of these amendments offered so that the \nCongressional Budget Office would do a score for them. Again, I thank \nmy colleague from Rhode Island for yielding to me for that purpose.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the historic \nlegislation that is before this Chamber. A year ago, this body \nundertook a similar endeavor to bring a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit to the 40 million aged and disabled beneficiaries who are on \nthe program today, as well as maintain the promise for the tens of \nmillions of future beneficiaries who will be joining the rolls in the \ncoming decades.\n  Despite the fact that a majority of Senators voted in favor of a $594 \nbillion plan for a drug program offered by Senators Graham, Miller, and \nKennedy, procedural barriers prevented us from delivering a benefit to \nour elderly and disabled last year.\n  Since that time, Congress has passed another round of tax cuts at the \nPresident's behest, and the Nation's fiscal condition continues to \ndeteriorate at an alarming rate. Just last week, the Congressional \nBudget Office announced that this administration is now on pace to \nshatter previous Federal budget deficit records. CBO's latest fiscal \nyear 2003 budget deficit forecast now tops $400 billion, an increase of \n$100 billion over the CBO's deficit forecast offered just a month ago.\n  The current record budget deficit was $290 billion set in 1992. In \njust the first 8 months of fiscal year 2003, we have already posted a \ndeficit of $291 billion.\n  Congress and the administration are now turning their attention to \nthe long-neglected problem of a prescription drug benefit for Medicare. \nThis year, we are faced with an arbitrary cap of $400 billion under \nwhich a drug benefit must fit. This cap is the result of the \nadministration's insistence on dealing with the drug benefit after the \ntax cut and not before. Madam President, $400 billion was not \nsufficient when we sought to enact a meaningful prescription drug \nbenefit last year, and I believe it is even less adequate this time.\n  The issue of Medicare prescription drugs is extremely important to \nme, and even more important to the constituents I represent.\n  In of a State of slightly more than a million people, 14.5 percent of \nthe population in Rhode Island is over the age of 65 years. This is a \nhigher proportion of older persons than the national average of 12.4 \npercent. According to the Census Bureau estimates, the number of \nelderly is expected to increase to 18.8 percent of Rhode Island's \npopulation by the year 2025. Rhode Island also has one of the highest \nconcentrations of persons age 85 and over. Consequently, seniors in my \nState tend to utilize higher degrees and greater levels of health care \nthan their counterparts in other States.\n  My State is also unique in terms of its health insurance market. \nBeing a small State, Rhode Island experienced a particularly tumultuous \ninsurance cycle during the mid-1990s that resulted in basically one \ninsurer remaining in the market. Being dominated by a single insurance \ncompany has resulted in artificially low reimbursement rates for \nproviders in my State. In fact, I am told Medicare is often the highest \npayer, sometimes 30 to 40 percent higher than some of the private \noptions.\n  This has created a tremendous burden on providers in my State who are \nstruggling to keep up with the increasing cost of doing business while \ncontinuing to provide quality care to their patients.\n  As Senator Grassley stated at the outset of this debate, his \nlegislation contains a provision aimed at increasing the reimbursement \nrate for rural providers that fall below the national average. This \nwill make certain rural patients are not denied access to doctors and \nquality care. However, I believe the same assurance must be given to \nall Medicare beneficiaries, regardless of where they live. I am \nconstantly hearing from providers in my State who are struggling with \nthe drastically increasing cost of doing business. I believe we must do \nmore to recognize regional variations in the cost of providing health \ncare services in this country to ensure all providers are equitably \ncompensated for services under the Medicare Program and access to care \nfor beneficiaries is assured.\n  I would like to take a few moments to outline the many concerns I \nhave regarding this legislation. I commend the Senate Finance Committee \nand the leadership of Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus for their \nefforts to move a package forward. This is a daunting challenge. They \nhave invested their energy and their vision and their enthusiasm over \nmany weeks. I commend them for that.\n  However, I believe the proposal before this body is deficient in many \nsignificant ways. Under the legislation, seniors below 100 percent of \npoverty and those between 100 and 135 percent of poverty would have \nmuch of their needs covered at minimal expense. This is one of the \nbeneficial aspects of the legislation. I must commend the Senators for \ninsisting upon this protection for low-income seniors. Seniors between \n135 and 160 percent of poverty would face a variable deduction and \ncoinsurance.\n  These are beneficial aspects. If we could do more along these lines \nto provide assurances to low-income seniors that their benefits would \nbe taken care of, if we could close the gap in coverage and we could do \nmany things, this legislation would be one that would be universally \nsupported. But there are significant shortcomings as well as the \nbeneficial aspects.\n  Our elderly and disabled beneficiaries need a comprehensive Medicare \nprescription drug benefit now, not 3 years from now. According to the \nKaiser Family Foundation, a senior today pays an average of $999 in \nout-of-pocket drug costs. Under the Grassley-Baucus proposal, beginning \nin 2004, seniors would be entitled to the Bush administration's \nprivately run discount card program. The Government-endorsed card would \nprovide seniors with negotiated discounts on certain drugs.\n\n  Instead of taking the time and expense to implement and dismantle a \ntemporary discount card, we should be dedicating ourselves to \nimplementing today a meaningful comprehensive prescription drug benefit \nas expeditiously as possible. I recognize the proposal before us is \nhighly complicated and relies on a private marketplace that does not \neven exist and will take time to put in place. Yet if the original \nMedicare program could be up and running within 11 months during an era \nwhen there were no computers to speak of, I see no reason why we can't \nphase in the basic elements of a prescription drug program starting \nimmediately.\n  I greatly fear the beneficiaries of Medicare will never see this \nbenefit take effect when 2006 rolls around. There are a number of very \nplausible scenarios such as increasing Federal budget deficits, \ncompetition with the never ending drumbeat for tax cuts, and the \nexpiration of some of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, the lack of private \ncompanies willing to offer these new plans, technical problems, or any \nnumber of other potential stumbling blocks that could derail \nimplementation of this benefit, leaving seniors with nothing more than \nthe temporary discount card as a benefit. Indeed, the bill before us \ncontinues the temporary card more than 6 months after the benefit is \nsupposed to start.\n  Given the fact that Medicare beneficiaries have already waited too \nlong for Congress to enact a prescription drug benefit, we need to do \nall we can to deliver a Medicare prescription drug benefit as soon as \npossible. Yet an effort by Senator Lautenberg to move up the \nimplementation date of the new Medicare Part D program to July 1, 2004 \nfailed. I am extremely disappointed this amendment did not prevail, \nleaving seniors to wait even longer for us to deliver on this promise.\n  The current package relies entirely on the private sector to provide \na Medicare prescription drug benefit to seniors. The new Medicare Part \nD program created by this legislation is a significant departure from \nthe traditional Medicare Program structure. The expectation is that \nMedicare HMOs and PPOs will provide the complete range of health care \nservices, including prescription drugs, under the new MedicareAdvantage \noption, while drug-only plans, which currently don't exist in the \nhealth insurance marketplace,\n\n[[Page S8504]]\n\nwill provide drug coverage to beneficiaries who remain in the \ntraditional fee-for-service Medicare Program.\n  It is important to point out that most seniors have a favorable \nopinion of the existing Medicare Program and are satisfied with the \ncoverage they receive through the traditional program. According to a \nrecent Kaiser Family Foundation Harvard School of Public Health survey, \n80 percent of seniors have a favorable impression of Medicare and 62 \npercent felt that the program is well run.\n  Seventy-two percent of people age 65 and over surveyed thought \nseniors should be able to continue to get their health insurance \ncoverage through Medicare over private plans and 63 percent favored \ndrug coverage through Medicare over private plans.\n\n  The only time a beneficiary would have access to the Medicare \nprescription drug fallback option under the traditional program is when \nno other private plans are available in their service area. However, \nonce two drug-only plans enter the market in a particular area, this \nfallback option automatically disappears and a senior's choice is \neliminated. He or she is forced to move to a different plan. I believe \nseniors should have true choice when making a decision about Medicare. \nThey should be able to choose the Medicare prescription drug plan that \nbest suits their needs, even if it is the Government-administrated \noption, which has a proven record of lower costs to taxpayers.\n  I support providing a level playing field for all Medicare \nprescription plans and was a proud cosponsor of Senator Stabenow's \namendment that would have guaranteed the availability of the Medicare \nfallback plan as the standard option for seniors. This was not an \namendment to force some outmoded Government-controlled health care \nsystem. It was an amendment about choice; indeed, a choice seniors \noverwhelmingly favor. Apparently we rejected that choice when we \nrejected the Stabenow amendment.\n  The Federal Government already serves as a direct provider of \nprescription drug benefits to millions of active-duty military \npersonnel and veterans, so we do have a compelling Government model \nrather than a private sector model on which to base our expansion of \nMedicare.\n  Advocates for private sponsored prescription drug coverage under \nMedicare contend the private sector is more efficient and generally \nbetter suited to providing a prescription drug benefit to the elderly \nand disabled. I have also heard arguments that private plans are more \ncost-effective. However, as history has shown, the Medicare program has \noperated with significantly lower administrative costs than their \nprivate sector counterparts--2 to 3 percent versus 8 to 10 percent. \nMoreover, the Federal Government already has a long track record of \nproviding prescription drug benefits to millions of active duty \npersonnel and their families.\n  The Government also has a wealth of experience as a bulk purchaser of \nmedications for our Nation's veterans. The TRICARE program provides \ncomprehensive health and prescription drug coverage to 8.6 million \nmilitary and their dependents. Similarly, almost 5 million of our \nveterans have access to prescription drug coverage for free for \nservice-connected conditions and for a nominal $7 copay for a 30-day \nsupply of medication for nonservice-connected ailments.\n  Federal health care programs have a proven track record of offering \ncomprehensive, stable, and reliable benefits in a cost-effective \nmanner. The facts certainly do not necessarily reflect the rhetoric \nwhen it comes to private plans.\n  Indeed the best model for, I think, pharmaceuticals is the Veteran's \nAdministration and TRICARE programs, all of which are run by the \nFederal Government.\n  Under the Finance bill, premiums will vary based on geographic \nlocation and the level of benefits offered by the plan. The most recent \nCBO estimates indicate that the average premium for the standard \nprescription drug plan would be $35 in 2006 and will increase to $59 by \n2013. However, private plans are free to provide a different package of \nbenefits so long as the minimum benefit is ``actuarially equivalent'' \nto the standard benefit package set forth by the Government. Plans \nwould also be free to charge beneficiaries a different premium to \nreflect these benefit packages. For beneficiaries on fixed incomes, \nthese unpredictable premiums will be a great burden.\n  Beneficiaries will also face annual unpredictable increases in their \ndeductible. The bill sets the deductible at $275 for 2006 and will \nincrease in subsequent years based on the average annual per capita \nexpenditures on covered drugs. I fear that some of the cost saving \nmeasures in this bill are ``pennywise and pound foolish.'' We should be \nvery clear that this legislation imposes a significant amount of cost-\nsharing on seniors, not only in terms of the $275 deductible, variable \nmonthly premiums and 50 percent coinsurance under the prescription drug \nplan, but in other areas as well. Specifically, the Grassley-Baucus \nproposal increases the annual deductible beneficiaries currently pay \nunder Medicare Part B to $125 in 2006 and it indexes future increases \nto inflation.\n  I am also deeply concerned with other provisions included in this \nlegislation to offset the cost of the rural provider payments. In \nparticular, it imposes for the first time a beneficiary coinsurance \nrequirement of 20 percent for diagnostic lab tests to offset a portion \nof these rural provider payments. I have heard from literally hundreds \nof providers and beneficiaries from my State in opposition to this new \ncost burden. In essence, what this provision translates to is an $18.6 \nbillion shift in cost onto beneficiaries over the next decade. From a \nregional standpoint, absolutely none of this funding will benefit \nproviders in my State, nor will it ensure better access to care or \nimprove quality of care to beneficiaries in my State. Yet the over \n170,000 Medicare beneficiaries in Rhode Island will be forced to pay \nmillions in additional costs. I believe it is extremely unfair and \ninappropriate to boost the payments of a select group of providers at \nthe expense of beneficiaries. The purpose of the legislation is to \nbring new benefits--not impose new burdens--on our elderly and \ndisabled.\n  The bill also reduces the reimbursement rate for certain cancer drugs \nadministered in a physician's office. I fear that the cumulative effect \nof these provisions will be increasingly limited access to care for \nsuburban and urban beneficiaries, either because they cannot afford the \ndeductibles and coinsurance they are expected to pay, or because they \nare unable to find a physician who will take Medicare.\n  I am also skeptical of the new ``Center for Medicare Choices'' being \ncreated under this bill to administer parts C and D of Medicare. I \ndon't understand why the new ``Medicare Advantage'' program under Part \nC and the prescription drug benefit program under part D are being \nseparated from Medicare Parts A and B under the Center for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services.\n  Scarce Federal dollars that could be directed towards providing a \nmore generous benefit to seniors are instead being used to create a new \nfederal bureaucracy. I am also concerned that the time and effort \nneeded to create this new agency will slow the implementation of a drug \nbenefit plan for seniors.\n  When the Medicare program was originally created in 1965, it was done \nin response to the fact that elderly and disabled Americans were simply \nunable to get affordable health insurance coverage through the private \nmarket. While many aspects of our health care system have dramatically \nchanged since then, I believe this same basic principle holds true \ntoday.\n  Should this legislation pass without significant changes, Medicare \nbeneficiaries are going to be faced with a barrage of confusing and \ncomplicated options. If we expect seniors and the disabled to be \ninformed consumers of health care, we need to be absolutely certain \nthat we provided the resources necessary to educate them on their \noptions. They are going to need assistance, at least initially, in \nsorting through all of the relevant information to determine which \noption is best suited for them, based on their overall health care \nneeds. Indeed, one third of all seniors are probably better off it they \ndo not participate in Part D, according to CBO.\n  While the Grassley-Baucus proposal does take some initial steps to \nbolster beneficiary education through the Medicare State Health \nInsurance Program (SHIPS) volunteers and through\n\n[[Page S8505]]\n\nlocal Social Security Offices, this new program, with all its options, \nand new features, is going to be very confusing to the public. I \nbelieve we need to do more on education and outreach to assist \nbeneficiaries with this new program if the program is going to be \nsuccessful and effective.\n  For example, even today, only about half the seniors who are eligible \nfor the various low-income assistance programs (QMB, SLMB, QI-1) enroll \nin those programs.\n  I believe we can and must do more to ensure that beneficiaries, \nparticularly those in hard-to-reach rural and inner city communities, \nhave access to information describing these new changes, the importance \nof the low-income benefit, and encouraging enrollment. I hope to work \nwith the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee to make \nsure that all Medicare beneficiaries are well informed in terms of the \nparameters of the temporary discount card as well as the more \ncomprehensive benefit.\n  Medicare beneficiaries who are eligible for Medicaid, known as the \ndual eligibles, have disproportionately high medical and long-term care \nneeds. These seniors, including most vulnerable elderly in nursing \nhomes, are ineligible for the drug benefit in this proposal. This \npopulation represents about 11 percent of older Americans covered by \nMedicare. While Medicare covers acute care and major medical expenses \nfor this group, Medicaid picks up the cost of their prescription drugs. \nSince many of the dual eligibles suffer from chronic illnesses and have \nmultiple health problems, their drug costs are extremely high. With the \nGassley-Baucus proposal, the Federal Government shirks its \nresponsibility as the primary payer by failing to assist these Medicare \nbeneficiaries with their prescription drug costs. Indeed, it prohibits \nthese seniors from receiving the drug benefit. It is also unclear how \nStates' efforts to help this population will work with this proposal. \nCurrently, States struggling with tight budgets are cutting back on \ncare for Medicaid beneficiaries, and they are cutting optional \nbenefits. Prescription drugs are one of Medicaid's optional benefits \nthat States could choose to cut. The Grassley-Baucus proposal does \nnothing to help lift the States' burden and enable them to provide \nneeded health care to their populations.\n  Under the Grassley-Baucus proposal, those low-income seniors who are \nnot eligible for coverage through Medicaid, would as I mentioned, \nreceive substantial Federal assistance. Unfortunately, their plan \nrelies on state asset tests, which as Senator Bingaman has illustrated, \ncan be extremely confusing and onerous for beneficiaries. Moreover, it \nis estimated that roughly half of all beneficiaries who would be \neligible for assistance under the plan would be disqualified because of \nthe asset test. Consequently, they would be forced to pay significantly \nhigher deductibles, premiums and coinsurance.\n  So the laudable attempts to cushion the blow for low-income seniors \ncould be undercut by maintaining this asset test.\n  For a vulnerable senior or disabled person struggling to get by on a \nfixed income, their options will not be much better than what they face \nnow. If they are unable to afford prescription medications without \ncoverage today, they are not going to be any better off under this \nplan. Low-income Medicare beneficiaries are still going to be in the \nunenviable position to having to choose between their medications and \nother basic costs, such as food and transportation.\n  The bill provides $250 million to reimburse local governments, \nhospitals and other providers for emergency health services furnished \nto undocumented aliens, but does not offer aid to help cover \nuncompensated care provided to the uninsured Americans in health care \nfacilities around the country.\n  Over half of the estimated unauthorized immigrants in the United \nStates live in five states--California, Texas, New York, Illinois and \nFlorida. However, all States in the Union face substantial costs due to \nuncompensated care, regardless of immigration status.\n\n  In 2001, people who were uninsured during any part of the year \nreceive $98.9 billion in care, of which $34.5 billion was uncompensated \ncare. Last year, my State of Rhode Island provided more than $120 \nmillion in uncompensated care, and this is expected to grow higher this \nyear due to the weak economy.\n  Local governments, hospitals, and providers throughout the United \nStates are facing rising care costs, trying to provide services to the \nuninsured, which includes undocumented aliens but includes many others.\n  With the sluggish economy and rising deficits, States cannot alone \ncontinue to shoulder the burden placed on the health care system by the \nuninsured. A recent Institute of Medicine report entitled ``A Shared \nDestiny'' documents the impact of the uninsured and uncompensated care \non communities.\n  The consequence of uninsurance for communities can include reduced \nhealth care services, closure of local health care institutions, \nincreases in local cost of health care and health insurance, and poorer \nhealth for residents in general.\n  Federal reimbursements for health services provided to the uninsured \nare needed by all States. It would be more equitable to States to \ndistribute funding based on uncompensated care determined by the number \nof uninsured individuals in a State as a percentage of the total number \nof uninsured U.S. residents rather than simply immigration status. \nUnder the current provision, over 50 percent of the funding would go to \nthree States, and seven States, including Montana, might not receive \nany funding.\n  Distributing funding based on the number of uninsured will help all \nof us. I hope Senators Grassley and Baucus will work to explore ways in \nwhich we can address this extremely pressing issue for all States.\n  Another aspect of the legislation is a very serious one and one which \ntroubles me significantly. It is the projection by CBO that 37 percent \nof Medicare eligibles who presently receive prescription drug coverage \nthrough an employer retirement plan will lose that coverage as a direct \nresult of this legislation. Under this bill, over 4 million people will \nlose their existing prescription drug coverage.\n  This effect is particularly troublesome because many seniors with \nretiree coverage currently enjoy more generous benefits than would be \nprovided to them under this legislation. We are all aware that some \nemployers are already eliminating coverage or trimming back on the \nbenefits offered to retirees. However, this legislation will likely \naccelerate this disturbing trend because employers see no reason to pay \nfor a benefit the Government already provides.\n  I am deeply disappointed that the amendment offered by Senator \nRockefeller, which would have permitted drug spending by employers to \ncount toward the out-of-pocket spending requirements of the drug \nbenefit, was not approved. I believe the Senator's amendment would have \ngone a long way toward eliminating a problem of employers dropping \nretiree health insurance coverage.\n  I am also particularly concerned that legislation may have negative \nimplications for State and local government retirees and their \nfamilies. States across the Nation are suffering from staggering budget \nshortfalls. This legislation might present an enticing opportunity for \nStates to slash some of their costs by shifting their retiree health \ninsurance costs on to the Federal Government by substituting what they \ncurrently offer for what is being proposed under the Grassley-Baucus \nplan.\n\n  I know this would have serious implications for the over 35,000 \nretirees and their families currently in the Rhode Island State \nemployees pension system as well as the almost 20,000 employees who \nwill be expecting these benefits when they retire.\n  Over the past several days, my colleagues and I have brought forth \namendments that would have addressed the many recognized shortcomings \nin the pending legislation. We have repeatedly attempted to modify the \nbill in a way that would have provided a stable, universal, and \naffordable Medicare prescription drug benefit to the almost 40 million \nelderly and disabled beneficiaries in America.\n  I fear that the product taking shape in this Chamber is only going to \ndisappoint beneficiaries by delivering a hollow benefit that will not \nmeet their real health care needs. Even with an additional $12 billion \nin resources, this body is choosing to experiment with\n\n[[Page S8506]]\n\nthe privatization of Medicare over providing enhanced benefits to \nseniors or eliminating the gap in coverage under this plan.\n  For these reasons, I am unable to support this legislation. I am \ndeeply disheartened to be reaching this conclusion, but elderly and \ndisabled Medicare beneficiaries deserve better than the proposal before \nthis Chamber. I only wish we were seizing this historic opportunity to \nprovide them with a benefit they need and deserve and can be sure they \nwill get.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1040\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I come to the floor in support of the \namendment proposed and then withdrawn by my colleague, Senator Schumer, \nthat would have helped Medicare+Choice programs continue to provide \ninsurance for their beneficiaries. This is a serious problem in New \nYork and, I have reason to believe, in many other parts of the country \nbecause, as costs have continued to rise, many health plans are being \nforced to drop people from their rolls. They are actually withdrawing \nfrom large regions of New York and elsewhere in the country, leaving \npeople to scramble for alternatives. Even those who are continuing to \nprovide coverage are raising their premiums drastically.\n  Like the rest of Medicare, Medicare+Choice plans are feeling the \nsqueeze in a system caught between rapidly exploding costs and rapidly \nimploding finances. Here we are on the floor debating the future of \nMedicare and the structure of new benefits like prescription drugs, but \nwhile we debate the future of Medicare, we need to recognize that there \nare people right now in our States who depend on these plans today, and \nthe plans, when they withdraw and then reenter from year to year, cause \nconfusion and excess costs that fall directly on the backs of our \nseniors. So these seniors, who are already facing rising premiums, \nbenefit cuts, and withdrawal of services, should not be forgotten in \nthe context of the debate we are carrying on today which will actually \ntry to encourage more seniors to move in to these kinds of private \nhealth insurance choices.\n  I hope that we do something not only about the future, but we start \ndoing something about the present and take care of our seniors who were \npromised better benefits in these Medicare+Choice plans only to find \nthe rug pulled out from under them, as the plans either raised \npremiums, sometimes 15, 20 percent, and withdrew from their region, \nleaving them without the coverage for which they thought they \nbargained.\n  I fear we are setting up many more of our seniors for this kind of \ndisappointment, confusion, and disruption if we do not heed the lessons \nof what has already happened.\n  I thank the Chair for this attention, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I do not think in my 19 years in the \nSenate we have faced a more important and decisive issue than what is \nbefore us right now. The action the Senate will take on this bill, I \nbelieve, will set us on one of two courses.\n  If the Senate passes S. 1, as it is now constituted, and then goes to \nconference with the House--and the House bill is even worse than this \none--we will have set this country on a course, inexorably, I believe, \ntoward the privatization of Medicare and the privatization of Social \nSecurity. That is why I believe this upcoming vote is such a momentous \nvote.\n  There are those who say: We can pass it--maybe it is better than \nnothing--and then we can come back sometime in the future and make it \nbetter and fix it. I am not certain that is a gamble I want to take \nwith the future of Medicare and Social Security.\n  The proponents of this bill are claiming that it is going to provide \nprescription drug coverage for seniors. Obviously, that is something we \nall hear about when we go back to our respective States--we know it; we \nsense it; we feel it; we see it--that more of our elderly are cutting \ntheir pills in half. They are not taking the prescribed medicine. They \nwind up in the emergency room of the hospital.\n  Under Medicare, if one is in the hospital, they get their drugs paid \nfor. But if they are outside and they need drugs to keep them healthy, \nto keep them out of the hospital, then there is no help. I hear this \nfrom our seniors all the time.\n  So we know the need is there and that we should address it. We have \nbeen talking about it for a number of years.\n  Quite frankly, I think the bill before us, S. 1, moves the focus from \nthe elderly and their situation and their need for an affordable, \nreliable prescription drug benefit, to a special interest: What is best \nfor the drug companies? What can we do to make sure that they can \ncontinue to make the high profits they are making; to continue to be \nable to advertise and push these drugs on people who may demand drugs \nfor which they could use cheaper alternatives?\n  The focus of this bill is a special interest focus to help the drug \ncompanies.\n  I have gotten over 700 phone calls in my office. Only four of them \nwere for this bill. Seven hundred phone calls from the elderly, and \nonly four in favor of it. I cannot believe I am the only person getting \nthese kinds of phone calls. Funny, I have not gotten one phone call \nfrom a drug company. They are very happy and very satisfied with this \nbill.\n  So why do we find ourselves in this situation? Well, it is really \nonly a matter of priorities. This administration and Congress had no \nqualms about passing enormous tax cuts amounting to $93,000 a year for \nmillionaires and above, but now we have problems coming up with \nadequate funds for our Nation's seniors. This bill will not provide \nsignificant relief to the millions of seniors who need it.\n  Let's put it in perspective. During the last 3 years, this Congress \nhas passed, and the President has signed, $1.6 trillion in tax cuts. \nThat is assuming we do not continue the cuts that are already scheduled \nto sunset. If we do not sunset these tax cuts, it is going to amount to \na lot more than that.\n  At the same time, we are told by CBO that seniors will have about \n$1.8 trillion in drug costs over the next 10 years. So do we have the \npicture? We have just passed $1.6 trillion in tax cuts, half of which \nbenefit the wealthiest 1 percent in our country. Keep that figure in \nmind, $1.6 trillion. That is with the sunset provisions. Now, if we do \nnot sunset them, it is going to be trillions more than that.\n  CBO says over the next 10 years our seniors are going to need drugs \ncosting about $1.8 trillion. We do not have the money for that. Why? \nBecause $1.6 trillion has already gone out for the tax cuts. After \nbreaking the bank on these tax breaks for the wealthy, we are left with \ntable scraps for our seniors. It is all due to a bad budget that many \nof us did not support. I did not vote for this budget. It was a bad \nbudget.\n  We are going to see more about how bad this budget is when our \nappropriations bills hit the floor on education, health, and job \ntraining. We are going to see how bad this budget really was then.\n\n  Some examples of how bad I believe the provisions of this bill are: A \nsenior living on $15,000 per year--that is just right over 160 percent \nof the Federal poverty level--with $1,000 in annual drug costs will \nactually lose money if enrolled in this program. My colleagues heard me \nright. If a senior is making $15,000 a year, and they have $1,000 in \nannual drug costs, if they join this plan, they pay more in than they \nget out. In fact, it is estimated that at least 35 percent, more than a \nthird of all Medicare beneficiaries, will lose money if they enroll in \nthis plan.\n  A married couple with a combined income of $20,000, again just \nslightly over the 160 percent of poverty level, if they had individual \ndrug costs of $1,500 each--that is $3,000 a year in drug costs--they \nwould save less than $400, barely 12 percent of their total drug costs.\n  Even seniors with high drug costs will only get modest assistance. In \nfact, a senior under Medicare will have to have drug costs approaching \n$9,000 per year before this plan will even cover a half of their \nexpenses.\n  When we add together what a senior has to pay in premiums, \ndeductibles, and cost sharing, then they have this coverage gap, the \ndonut hole, where\n\n[[Page S8507]]\n\nthey do not get 50 percent coverage until they hit $9,000 in drug costs \nand then they get a 50/50 split--$9,000 in drug costs before they even \nget 50 percent.\n  As I said, the plan has a donut hole, a gap, the coverage of the size \nof Texas, maybe Alaska. What this means for seniors is that they will \npay 100 percent of their drug bill even while they are continuing to \npay premiums, but they will not receive any drug coverage.\n  Now, there is an eruption coming. When this bill passes and it gets \nout there and seniors finally get in this in a couple of years, there \nis an eruption coming because there are going to be seniors out there \nsaying: Wait a minute, I am paying into this thing and I do not get \nanything back because I fall in this gap? Wait until my colleagues \nstart hearing from their constituents on that one.\n  Under this gap, once a senior's total drug costs reach $4,500, they \nare on their own until their catastrophic kicks in at $5,800, if I am \nnot mistaken. But they still have to continue to pay premiums. Even \nthough they pay for everything, they still pay the premiums. They are \npaying something, but they are getting nothing. That leaves a senior \ncitizen with another $1,300 in out-of-pocket drug spending each year if \nthey hit that gap.\n  That is what we call the Swiss cheese model of drug coverage. It is \nfull of holes, and woe to you if you fall in one of them.\n  This bill provides too little to middle-class seniors. We tried to \nfix the problem. Senator Boxer offered an amendment to fill in this \nunfair coverage gap. The Republicans said: No, we cannot afford it.\n  Oh, we can afford $1.6 trillion to the wealthiest in this country, \nbut we cannot afford to close the coverage gap. Priorities, my friends, \npriorities. That is what this debate is about, priorities.\n\n  The second flaw in the bill is it is a bureaucratic maze. Congress is \ntrying to cram through one of the most significant changes in social \npolicy in decades in 2 weeks. I am beginning to think it is because the \nleaders of this effort do not want seniors and the rest of the people \nin this country to see what is in the bill until it is too late. This \nis a complex, daunting, bureaucratic nightmare of a bill, and it will \nbe for seniors.\n  This weekend the New York Times headlined in red ``Criticism of drug \nbenefit is simple: It's bewildering. High level of complexity causes \nconcern.''\n\n       With both houses of Congress poised to pass a Medicare drug \n     bill next week, lawmakers are increasingly anxious about the \n     complexity of the legislation and its reliance on new and \n     largely untested arrangements to deliver drug benefits to the \n     elderly.\n       This complexity, they say, may be daunting and confusing to \n     beneficiaries, and even to insurance companies, which are \n     supposed to manage the new benefits. Many lawmakers say they \n     have just begun to examine the bill's intricate details and \n     the web of political compromises behind those provisions.\n       Senator Larry E. Craig, Republican of Idaho, lamented the \n     bill's ``high level of complexity and prescriptiveness.'' \n     Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, said it \n     would create ``a Medicare maze, a whole new bureaucracy.''\n\n  Yes, it is bewildering. It is complex. If you think reading the bill \nis complex, 654 pages, I bet there are not a handful in this room who \nknow what is in the bill--maybe a few in the committee, not many more. \nIf you think that is bewildering, wait until the seniors start getting \nhit with this.\n  There is a reason why over the last several years when we put in \nMedicare+Choice for Medicare 89 percent of seniors chose to stay in \ntraditional Medicare. Why? They want a simple, straightforward, \nunderstandable, reliable, guaranteed benefit, one in which they get \ncoverage for the drugs they need, one they can sign up for and it does \nnot put you in and put you out and put you in and put you out, year \nafter year, but it is there solidly and one that is affordable.\n  What they are going to get under this plan is a series of befuddling \nand bewildering steps just to obtain substandard drug coverage.\n  Let's take an example. A senior citizen, we will call him Bob, next \nyear is going to receive a drug card. Well, la-di-da, he will get a \ndrug card. He might already have three or four drug cards in his \nwallet. In fact, I had an individual in Iowa a few weeks ago who took \nout his wallet and he already had five prescription drug cards: One \nfrom AARP, one from the State, one from a drug company, and a couple \nmore I did not recognize. He said: Not a one is worth a hoot.\n  Millions of drug cards are out there now from CVS, State programs, \nother private organizations, AARP. If discount cards provided anything, \nif they amounted to anything, they would not need a drug benefit under \nMedicare. There are millions of them out there. Seniors will tell you \nthey are not worth the paper they are printed on.\n  The reality is for the next 2 years, seniors like Bob will be left \nwith virtually nothing. He gets a card. If Bob were low income, next \nyear he will receive a debit card worth $600. Consider this. Bob gets a \ndebit card worth $600, but what happens when Bob is going to the \ndrugstore and he is getting his prescription drugs. It is now July and \nhe goes to the pharmacist for his refill and the pharmacist says, \nsorry, you are out of money. The $600 is used up. What does he do then? \nHe goes back and he sees his friend Fred, and Fred says, Well, I am \nstill going to the drugstore and I am getting mine free. Bob wonders \nwhy he does not get his. Wait until that hits next year. Wait until \nyour constituents start calling you up because their debit card has run \nout of money and it is July or August or September.\n\n  Now he has the card for a couple of years. After 2 years of having \nthe card, it expires. It is done for. Now Bob is going to be forced to \nwade through hundreds of pages of health plan documents to choose which \nplan he wants. I decided to look at some of the plans that are out \nthere and here are three of them. Here is Care First, Blue Cross Inc. \nAnyone want to try wading through this? Anyone want to read that and \nunderstand what is in there? I am a lawyer, probably not very good, but \nI have trouble reading that.\n  Here is another one from the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of the \nMid-Atlantic States. Bob will have to wade through this one, too, to \nfigure out what he wants.\n  Here is one from MDIPA. This is a little smaller than the others but \nstill pretty daunting.\n  In a couple of years, Bob will get a couple of these and he will be \ntold to decide which he wants. He has to read through them and figure \nit out. What is he going to do, hire an accountant; hire a lawyer to \nfigure out which plan is best for him? The plans could have different \nbenefits, different rules, different prices, and different drugs.\n  Once Bob makes his choice, he could find out some of the drugs he \nneeds are not actually covered by the plan. So he either has to change \ndrugs or what, change plans? No, Bob cannot do that. He can do that at \nthe end of a year. But if he finds out his drugs are not covered, he \ncannot switch. He has to wait until the end of the year. If Bob chooses \none of the new PPO plans, the preferred provider plans, he might even \nhave to change doctors to become part of it because they will list only \ncertain doctors.\n  If that is not enough, once Bob chooses a plan and he is in it, his \nmonthly premiums may skyrocket past $35 a month at any point in time. I \nhave said to some people, That cannot be right; surely they cannot do \nthat. But it is in the bill. It is in the 654-page bill. If you belong \nto a plan, any time that plan wants to raise the premium, you have to \npay it. You cannot get out of the plan. You have to stay in it. So you \nhave signed up for a plan. It says it will charge $35 a month. After a \ncouple of months, the plan figures out it is not making enough money \nand now the premiums will be $45 a month. Why, you can write your \nSenator and tell your Senator how unfair this is. Guess what. Your \nSenator cannot do a darn thing about it. Nowhere in this bill does it \nguarantee seniors will not have to pay different monthly premiums.\n  Senator Daschle offered an amendment to try to fix this significant \nproblem so seniors would be guaranteed some protection from fluctuating \nmonthly premiums but, again, the Republicans said no. So we are \nsupposed to vote for a bill that cannot even tell seniors what they are \ngetting and how much it is going to cost them. In fact, Senator Lott, \nwho was quoted in the New York Times this week, said:\n\n       You are going to make a huge change in an entitlement \n     program and you don't even know how it would work, if it \n     would work.\n\n\n[[Page S8508]]\n\n\n  At least we have one Republican over there who recognizes this as a \nbureaucratic maze. At least the amendment of Senator Daschle would have \ngiven seniors some peace of mind that what they bargained for is what \nthey were going to get.\n  So we are back to Bob. Now, Bob is in the plan. His premiums might \nskyrocket. He might find that the prescription drug coverage is \nunaffordable. Now Bob is down at the coffee shop with his friends. None \nof them make very much money, but their income levels vary a little \nbit. They are all basically the same. They are retired, they worked \nhard all their lives, and they are spending a little time watching \ntheir grandkids grow. None of them are wealthy. They weren't born with \nsilver spoons in their mouths. They don't have a lot of stock. They are \njust getting by.\n  You know, you see them on Main Street all the time. You see them in \nour towns, all over our States--average, middle class elderly \nAmericans--and they are down at the coffee shop. They start talking. \nBob finds out that all of his friends pay different amounts for their \nprescription drugs. Bob's friend George is paying a $50 deductible. Bob \nsays, ``How can this be?''\n  Well, George earns just a little less than Bob. He earns $14,000 a \nyear. So he pays a $50 deductible. He pays a lower premium and 10 \npercent copay for most of his drugs.\n  Their other friend Joe makes a bit less money a year. He is getting \naround $12,000 or so a year. He pays no deductible, no premium, and a 5 \npercent copay for his drugs.\n  Bob is sitting there and he is astounded. He doesn't make much more \nthan they do. He makes $15,000 a year. He is struggling to make ends \nmeet at that, and he is still stuck paying 50 percent copays, large \ndeductibles, and large premiums.\n  Think about how you are going to hear from your seniors who gather at \nthe local McDonald's in the morning to have their coffee and they start \ntalking about this. One gets drugs practically free. Someone making \njust a few hundred dollars more pays the full premium, the full \ndeductible, 50 percent copays. Try explaining that to your elderly \ncitizens when this hits the streets.\n  Seniors are going to know immediately that this is not fair. This is \nthe first time in Medicare's history that we are means-testing the \nprogram, where seniors are treated differently under Medicare. I \nbelieve there are serious consequences to creating this welfare class \nin Medicare, and that is what we are doing. We are creating a welfare \nclass under Medicare.\n  It will be incredibly confusing for seniors to have four tiers of \ndiffering benefits. Seniors will not know where they fall in these \nincome classes. Think of it, there are four. You have 75 to 100 percent \nof the poverty level; you have another class from 100 to 135 percent of \nthe Federal poverty level. You have another class from 135 to 160 \npercent of the Federal poverty level. And now you have another class \nabove 160 percent of the poverty level. There are four different \nclasses.\n  How does Bob know where he fits? He is going to have to go through \nsome tests. He is going to have to fill out some forms and submit the \nforms so people know how much money he makes.\n  I had some of those forms here. Here they are right here. Here is a \nset of forms right now for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. It is 16 \npages long. It is what a person has to fill out in the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania to show they are poor, if I can use that word, that they \nare low-income, that they need some assistance, some benefits. This is \nthe kind of paperwork they fill out.\n  Here is all the information about you: where you live, what you do, \nwhat you have done in your lifetime. Any cash on hand? Any savings \naccounts? Any checking accounts? Any certificates of deposit? Any \nstocks or bonds? A boat? Do you have a Christmas or vacation club?\n  Does anyone own or is anyone buying a car, truck, or motorcycle? You \nhave to fill it in--the year, make, and model.\n  Do you have a life insurance policy? Do you own a burial space or \nburial plot? This is what the elderly are going to have to start \nfilling out. And guess who gets it. Where do they take this?\n  Let's say Bob's friend George--how much did I say George is making? \nHe is making about $14,000 a year. He has to prove that. He has to \nprove it by filling this out.\n  Who does he give it to? The IRS? No. Does he give it to his Senator? \nNo. How about his Congressman? No, he doesn't give it to the \nCongressman either. He gives it to his pharmacist and his doctor.\n  So, now, our pharmacists all over America are going to have to keep \nall this stuff on file. Now they are going to have to look through it \nto make sure that George didn't make a mistake somewhere in filling \nthis out. Think what is going to happen to elderly all over America who \nnow say: Wait a minute, I don't necessarily want my pharmacist to know \nall my business. The pharmacists are going to say: I don't want all \nthis paperwork. Wait until that hits the streets. More paperwork for \nour pharmacists, more paperwork for our elderly. And they aren't going \nto know how to fill this out.\n  Not only that--assets. What if George, let's say, or George and \nBetty, husband and wife, fall just slightly below the $19,000 level in \nboth incomes. So they go to fill out this paperwork to get a cut in \ntheir drug coverage, to get a better benefit. But then they hit that \npage on assets. What kind of assets do you have?\n  I know people are going to laugh about this, but this is true. Betty \nis going to have to have her wedding ring appraised by somebody. How \nmuch is it worth? How about family heirlooms? Let's say George and \nBetty had some furniture that their grandparents passed down. It is now \nan antique, worth some money. How much is it worth?\n  I said the other day, it seems to me this portion of the bill is \ngoing to be a boon to the pawnshop artists around America. They are all \ngoing to be called out to assess things and determine how much they are \nworth. Who is going to pay that bill? That is in the bill. You may \nthink I am joking. It is in the bill, an asset test, and it includes \nthings such as jewelry and furniture and, yes, even a burial plot. We \nare forcing this humiliating process on seniors, to prove they are \npoor, by filling out this complicated paperwork--an assets test.\n\n  Finally, after all of this trouble, if Bob and his friends' health \nplan does not make enough money off of them, they will just pull out of \nthe market, leaving them right back where they started. We have seen \nthis happen time and time again with Medicare HMOs all over the \ncountry. It could happen over and over and over again as the new \nprivate, drug-only HMOs come in and pull out.\n  The Federal fallback may be available one year but not the next. So \nseniors will be bounced from one plan to another plan, maybe back to \nMedicare, maybe to another plan. There is nothing to stop it. And if a \nplan is in there, and it is not making money, they are out of it.\n  So I guess I could ask, by now are you confused? Is it a little tough \nto follow what all is going to happen? Imagine how our seniors are \ngoing to feel. Senator Clinton prepared this chart. I looked it over, \nand it really does kind of give you the complexity of this bill we are \ntalking about. I will not go through it all except to say that seniors \nstarting here, in private plan ``one,'' with a $40-a-month premium, \n$275 deductible, 47 percent coinsurance, no limitations on doctors--\nwell, let's say you join this plan and then find out the drugs you need \nare not offered there. You file a grievance. It goes to a hearing to \nsee whether the drug is covered. Then, let's say it is a private plan, \nand it doesn't make enough money, and they drop out. Then you fall back \ninto the Federal fall back and you start all over.\n  It is a maze. That is what we are asking our seniors to get involved \nin. Keep in mind that over one-third of all seniors will have to \nnavigate this maze--just to lose money. They have to go through this \njust to lose money. One-third will go through this maze, and they will \npay more in than they get out.\n  I suspect very strongly that this whole thing was developed by people \nwho want the system to fail. They want it to fail. This bill is an \nexample of ideology over fact, placing all the\n\n[[Page S8509]]\n\nbets on private health plans to provide the drug benefit to seniors. It \nis especially bad for seniors in rural States where private plans have \nshown no interest in participating in the Medicare Program. This \nprivate-sector worship is derived from the belief that the free market \nwill take care of everything: The free market is the answer to \neverything; if only it is just put on the free market.\n  Well, private enterprise or the free market does very well, thank \nyou, when you are doing automobiles or airplanes or wicker baskets or \nwidgets, clothes, glasses, watches, television sets, computers, and a \nhost of other things. That is where the free market works. But the free \nmarket, the private sector, by its very nature, leaves those people \nbehind who are not profitable, people such as those with disabilities, \nmental illnesses, and the elderly.\n  The free market did not break down the barriers to people with \ndisabilities in our country. It was this Congress and a President and \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act that said: No more; we are going to \nprovide opportunities and openness in our country to people with \ndisabilities. It was not the free market because people with \ndisabilities simply are not profitable.\n  Why do you think we have health care coverage now under Medicare and \nprivate health care plans for physical illnesses but not for mental \nillnesses, for which we have been trying for a long time to get parity? \nPeople with mental illness are not profitable. And why do we have \nMedicare? Because a long time ago the private insurance companies found \nout that the elderly were not very profitable either. And I speak about \nthis from personal knowledge.\n  When I was a senior in high school, in the small town of Cumming, IA, \npopulation 150, my mother had passed away some years before. We were a \nbunch of bachelors living in a house. My father was 74 years old. It \nwas 1958. He worked most of his life in the coal mines, and he had then \nwhat they call miner's lung, also known as black lung. He had a couple \nof injuries. He was not in very good shape. He had no stocks. He had no \nbonds. He owned no property. He did not own anything.\n  His total income--total income--per year was less than $1,500 \nbecause, thank God, during World War II, he had worked for a while and \ngot covered under Social Security. See, before that he had worked all \nhis life, and there was no Social Security. But, fortunately, during \nWorld War II he worked a little bit, and got covered by Social \nSecurity, so he was getting about $1,200 or $1,300 a year. Actually, he \ngot a little more than that because he had kids under the age of 18, me \nbeing one, and Social Security gave him a little extra, $35 a month.\n  So here was my dad. He was 74. He was in bad shape. He had no assets, \nno money. There was no Medicare out there, folks. There was nothing. \nCould my dad afford to see a doctor? No way. And my father did not see \na doctor. But every year, like clockwork, in the middle of the winter, \nmy dad would get sick. It happened every year. He would get sick. He \nhad this bad lung problem. He would catch a cold, and he could not get \nover it. He would get pneumonia, and we would get a neighbor, with a \ncar, and rush him to Des Moines to the hospital. They would put him in \na tent, dry him out, get his lungs down, and cure his pneumonia. They \nwould send him home after a couple weeks.\n  How did we afford to do that? We did not have anything. I will tell \nyou how we afforded it. Thank God for the Sisters of Mercy at a \nCatholic hospital in Des Moines, IA, who gave us charity because he did \nnot have anything. That is the only way that my father got health care.\n  Now, why didn't some insurance company rush out to cover him at a \nprice he could afford? Keep in mind, he was making less than $1,500 a \nyear. He was not profitable. He was 74. He had black lung disease. He \nhad a couple of other illnesses and injuries. My father was not \nprofitable to an insurance company.\n  I can remember like it was yesterday when I came home from leave from \nthe Navy. This was later on in 1966. I came home on leave from the Navy \nto see my father, who was now nearing his 80th year of life. I remember \nwhen he showed me his Medicare card and said: Now I can go see a \ndoctor. I can go to the hospital if I have to. And I don't have to take \ncharity anymore.\n  I often wonder, what would my father's later years have been like, \nwhat would it have been like if he had had Medicare earlier on? How \nmuch better his life would have been, how much healthier he would have \nbeen, how much more he would have enjoyed in his elder years if he had \nhad decent health care.\n  So I don't want anyone lecturing to me about how wonderful the \nprivate market is for health care for the elderly. Go tell it to \nsomebody else, but don't tell it to me because I lived through this. \nThat is why when someone tells me that the private sector is somehow \ngoing to take care of the elderly, I say: Wait a second, maybe the \nelderly who have a lot of money, but how about those at the bottom?\n  That is why I say what we are doing here is setting up a welfare \nclass. Once again, people like my father will have to fill out \npaperwork and beg, ask to be put in a system they can afford. I guess \nwe haven't learned anything around here. We haven't learned a thing. \nMaybe we have too many people here who didn't go through what I went \nthrough. I don't know. I don't know everybody's situation. I would like \nto think if people went through with their fathers what I went through \nwith mine, they might have a different perspective on Medicare.\n  There is no reasonable rationale for relying on private health plans \nfor prescription drugs for the elderly, even in monetary terms and \ncosts. We know administrative costs are much lower in Medicare. We have \na history. The administrative costs in Medicare are between 2 and 3 \npercent a year; in private health care plans, 15 percent per year \nadministrative costs. We also know that over the last 30 years, \nMedicare spending has grown at a slower rate than private health care \nplan spending: 9.6 percent compared to 11.1 percent.\n  Here is a story that appeared in the Washington Post recently. It is \nentitled ``Bush Pushes for Expanded Private Role in Medicare.'' It \nreads:\n\n       President Bush yesterday renewed his call for market \n     competition to play a large role in Medicare's future, as the \n     Senate wrestled over how far to go in encouraging private \n     health plans to deliver care and prescription drug coverage \n     to older Americans.\n       Bush disparaged a core tradition of Medicare in which the \n     federal government has determined what medical services are \n     covered and how much government pays doctors and hospitals to \n     provide them. He said Medicare would be more effective if \n     ``health plans compete for their business and give them the \n     coverage they need, not the coverage that a Washington \n     bureaucrat thinks they need.\n\n  Well, with all due respect, President Bush never lived through what I \nlived through. His father never had to rely on charity for health care \nlike my father did. So he can disparage Medicare because no one in his \nfamily ever gave a hoot about Medicare. They didn't need it. He has \nturned a cold shoulder of indifference to those who rely on Medicare.\n  But not only that, the President ignores history. He says the private \nsector can do it better. Wait a second. We have a history. We have \nfacts. We don't have to rely upon rhetoric. We have facts. \nAdministrative costs in Medicare, 2 to 3 percent; private health care \nplans, 15 percent. OK, which is more efficient? In the last 30 years, \nMedicare spending has grown at a slower rate than private health care \nplan spending has grown. So what is he talking about? What is the \nPresident talking about when he says the private health care plans can \ndo it better?\n\n  We have a history. We have facts. We have data. That private sector, \nwhen it comes to the elderly, does not do it better.\n  When it comes to this private plan program, it means there is going \nto be less money available to actually help seniors get prescription \ndrugs. Billions will be wasted on advertising, marketing, glossy \nbrochures, higher payments to private plans, billions of dollars that \nshould be going directly to seniors. And how about CEO salaries? We \nhaven't talked about that. All these private health care plans, they \npay a lot of money for their CEOs. That is fine, if they are in the \nprivate sector. But that is money that is going to be siphoned off. \nLast year, the drug companies in America spent more money on \nadvertising than they did on research. Wait until this plan gets out \nthere.\n\n[[Page S8510]]\n\n  I say to every senior citizen listening to me give this talk: Get \nprepared. You are going to get a lot of mail in your mailbox. You are \ngoing to get a lot of brochures for this drug and that drug and this \nplan and that plan. You are going to get inundated with advertisements, \nand you are going to see them on TV. You think you see a lot now. You \nwait, you will see more. Why? Because now they have all this money.\n  I understand we are about to have an amendment that is going to \nprovide $6 billion to the private companies to entice them into \nproviding these plans. If they are so doggone good, why do we have to \ndo this? ``Senate GOP Eyes Billions to Encourage Private Plans, \nEmployers.'' I am told it is going to be $6 billion. We haven't seen it \nyet. Whether it is $6 billion, $5 billion, $4.5 billion, I don't know. \nWhatever it is, it is too much.\n  I mean if President Bush is right and the private sector can do it \nbetter, why do we have to bribe them? Why do we have to bribe them with \ntaxpayers' money, $6 billion, come on and get it? Talk about hogs \nfeeding at the trough. This is it, folks. Six billion dollars, I am \ntold. Well, maybe $5.5 billion. I don't know what it is. But they are \ngoing to give it to entice them into this program. Why are we robbing \nseniors to cushion the pockets of private plans with billions of \ndollars of a subsidy? ``President Bush Pushes for Expanded Private Role \nin Medicare.''\n  Well, you kind of see it all coming together. The President, \nRepublicans are pushing for all these tax breaks for their wealthy \nfriends. And now they reward the drug companies. No cost containment at \nall. Let the drug companies keep boosting their prices year after year \nafter year. And guess what. We will just keep raising the premiums on \nseniors. Now we get the private plans in with their expensive CEOs, \ntheir expense accounts, and we are going to bribe them with $6 billion. \nWhat a deal.\n  Tom Scully, the Bush administration's top Medicare official, called \nMedicare ``an unbelievable disaster'' and ``a dumb system'' during a \nrecent meeting in Pennsylvania.\n  The third-ranking Republican in the Senate, Senator Santorum from \nPennsylvania, said:\n\n       I believe the standard benefit, the traditional Medicare \n     program has to be phased out.\n\n  Senator Robert Bennett of Utah, on March 1:\n\n       Medicare is a disaster. Medicare will have to be \n     overhauled. Let's create a whole new system.\n\n  Of course, we all remember the immortal words of our former House \nSpeaker, Newt Gingrich. He didn't want to kill Medicare, he just wanted \nto let it ``wither on the vine.''\n  So let's get this straight. Seniors are telling us not to privatize \nMedicare; 89 percent have already voted to keep traditional Medicare. \nThey tell us they want a less expensive, more reliable, \nstraightforward, simple benefit, guaranteed to be there.\n  The facts tell us that privatizing Medicare doesn't work. We have the \nfacts. So why did the administration, in this bill and the House bill, \ninsist on this privatization? Because it is the first step toward total \nprivatization of Medicare and, I believe, the first step toward \nprivatizing Social Security.\n  Senator Stabenow offered an amendment I supported which would have \nguaranteed a Government fallback in every area of the country, so that \nseniors could choose traditional Medicare regardless of what private \nplans are offered. As we said on the Senate floor that day, this bill \noffers two private plans. Senator Stabenow wanted to say: OK, we will \ngive them more choice and offer a Medicare plan. Let them all compete. \nThe Republicans said no. They want only to have two choices for seniors \nbetween two private plans. But they don't want to let seniors be able \nto choose Medicare, which they have already shown.\n  As the Senator from Michigan stated time and time again on the Senate \nfloor, 89 percent have already chosen Medicare. Yet somehow we are \nturning a deaf ear to them.\n  It seems to me we have a lot of talk around here about choice, but \nthey don't want to let Medicare be one of those choices for seniors. \nThe only choice in the bill is for HMOs and private plans. They will be \nthe ones choosing your premiums. They will be the ones choosing your \noptions. They will be the ones choosing your benefits. Well, you tell \nthat to my seniors back in Iowa who have never had a private option.\n  The Republicans say they want to provide seniors with choice. They \nclaim seniors should get the same type of benefits we in Congress get. \nWell, all right. Let me tell you what I have for drug coverage. I pay \n25 percent for my drugs. That is it. I go to the drugstore and I pay 25 \npercent. What a nice deal; simple, straightforward. Seniors won't have \ncoverage anywhere nearly as generous in their plan. Look at it this \nway. If this plan provides $400 billion over 10 years, which is what it \ndoes, CBO has estimated that senior drug costs over the same period of \ntime will be $1.8 trillion.\n  Figure that out. We are providing $400 billion. The estimated drug \ncosts are going to be $1.8 trillion, and that is probably on the lower \nside. That means we are leaving the seniors to cover 78 percent of the \ntab for drugs. I get 25 percent; seniors have to pay 78 percent. You \nare going to tell me that is fair? Again, there is a storm coming, when \nthe seniors in this country find out what is in this bill and how it \naffects them.\n  So why the insistence on privatizing Medicare? Well, I think the \nanswer is clear. Congress is choosing a special interest over seniors' \ninterests by following ideology over facts. I said earlier today there \nare three reasons we are passing this bill. The first reason is because \nthe drug companies want it. The second reason is because the drug \ncompanies want it. You guessed it, yes. The third reason is because the \ndrug companies want it.\n  You might think, from my comments, that I have it in for the drug \ncompanies. Nothing could be further from the truth. I have fought for \nyears on the floor of the Senate for more money for research--the kind \nof basic research that is done through the NIH, done in coordination \nwith drug companies, taking some of that basic research and investing \ntheir own money in these drugs and bringing them to the marketplace. \nSome of them have been wonderful. We are making new strides in drug \ndevelopment every day. I have a lot of respect for our drug \nmanufacturers who have brought a lot of these drugs to market. However, \nthat does not mean my esteem for the drug companies would compel me to \nvote for a bill that will continue to allow them to make the kind of \nprofits they make on the backs of our senior citizens who are on fixed \nincomes.\n\n  No, in this one case, in this area--this is where Medicare ought to \nprovide the drug benefit. It is where Medicare--just like we do in the \nVeterans' Administration--ought to be the one bargaining for the prices \nfor our elderly. Let me and the others who can afford health plans, and \npay generously for them, pay the drug companies, not the elderly.\n  So, again, drug companies stand to gain billions of dollars from this \ndrug benefit--trillions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Without losing my right to the floor, yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I, like you, have been in the House and Senate. Can you \never recall a bill involving an industry like the pharmaceutical \nindustry, such a grand bill involving a national program, involving \nthat industry, where that industry has been so silent during the course \nof the entire preparation and deliberation of the bill? I ask the \nSenator from Iowa, in his vast experience and with his great insight, \nwhat does he make of the silence of the pharmaceutical industry about \nS. 1, the pending bill?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, the Senator asks an insightful question. Earlier, I \nhad stated--and the Senator may not have been in the Chamber--my office \nhas received over 700 phone calls. Only four have been in favor of this \nbill. I have not received one phone call from a drug company.\n  Now, the Senator understands when we have legislation that impacts \npowerful industries in this country, and if it impacts them negatively, \nthey are all out here. Our phones are ringing off the hook; lobbyists \nare in our offices; the private jets are parked at Dulles. They are all \nover the place.\n  So it says to me that this bill must be a great benefit to the drug \ncompanies because I haven't heard one peep\n\n[[Page S8511]]\n\nfrom them. I have found in my experience, I tell the Senator, in the \nHouse and in the Senate that when you see a large industry silent on a \nbill that impacts them so greatly, you can only come to one assumption: \nThey must love it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator, if he has had the time to read the 654 \npages of S. 1, has the Senator heard from staff or anyone during the \ncourse of the days and days of debate about this S. 1, the prescription \ndrug proposal, that it contains anything that is going to reduce the \nexcessive increase in the cost of prescription drugs for American \nfamilies and American seniors?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator again for a very insightful question. \nI asked my staff--and I have good staff, and they do a lot of work on \nhealth care--to look at this 654-page bill.\n  I said: What in there will help keep the cost of drugs down? Anything \nat all?\n\n  Nothing. Zero. There is nothing in the bill that is going to help \nkeep the cost of drugs down. In fact, I say to the Senator, I think \njust the opposite is going to be true because this bill will allow \nplans to increase premiums any time they want. So you signed up for a \nplan, and your premium is $35 a month. The plan is not making much \nmoney. The drug company jacks up the price of the drugs a little bit. \nThat means the plan is not making much money, but the plan can increase \nthe premium. The drug companies are always left harmless. They can just \nkeep jacking up the prices.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator, through the Chair, will yield for one \nmore question.\n  (Mr. SMITH assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am aware of Senator Harkin's background as a Vietnam \nveteran and a naval aviator. The Senator is undoubtedly aware that the \nVeterans' Administration, which is trying its best to provide medical \ncare for the millions of veterans in our country, has negotiated with \nthe drug companies to bring down the cost of drugs for veterans as much \nas 50 percent.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Since we have established there is no effort in this bill \nto bring down the cost of prescription drugs for Medicare recipients in \nour country, we hear from the other side of the aisle that any effort \nto bring down the cost of drugs is tampering with the free market.\n  I ask the Senator from Iowa for his objective appraisal. Does he \nthink the Veterans' Administration is guilty of socialistic, \ncommunistic, Bolshevik behavior, tampering with the market to bring \ndown the cost of prescription drugs for the millions of veterans who \ndesperately need their care? I think I know the answer to the question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think the Senator knows the answer to that question. He \nand I have both fought hard in this Chamber for veterans benefits. I \nyield to no one in my support of those who have put on the uniform of \nthis country to defend our flag, to defend our way of life, and I know \nthe Senator from Illinois will take a back seat to no one also in that \neffort. We fought hard to get a veterans drug benefit that had cost \ncontainment. That is what it does.\n  Today, I am proud to say--I am proud--because of what we fought for \nhere, the veterans in this country today get the cheapest prices on \ndrugs of anyone in our country. I am proud of that fact, and they \ndeserve it. Has it ruined the drug companies? Of course not. They are \nselling more drugs. Maybe they take a little bit less profit, but they \nare selling more drugs because now people can afford to buy them. That \nis what we need today. We need that kind of system Medicare could \nprovide in dealing with the drug companies for big purchasing, bargain \ndown the prices so the elderly can get the same price on drugs as our \nveterans.\n  I ask rhetorically a question of the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Does the Senator from Illinois think the drug companies \nare losing money on every bottle of pills a veteran buys? I can see him \nshaking his head. Obviously not. Veterans get their bottle of pills \ncheaper than anyone else. I bet my bottom dollar the drug companies are \nnot losing a penny on any one of them. They are making money. They are \njust not making as much money as they are, say, if I went in and bought \nthem.\n\n  I yield for a question without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not have a question except as to what \nthe status of the legislation is at this point.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend from Iowa yield so I can respond to the \nSenator from West Virginia?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield, without losing my right to the floor, to the \nassistant minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from West Virginia, the distinguished \nSenator, we are trying to get some votes lined up shortly. It is my \nunderstanding Senator Byrd wishes to speak for 10 or 15 minutes on the \nDurbin amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. I would.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Dorgan wishes to speak for how long on the Durbin \namendment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Five minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Does Senator Stabenow wish to speak on the Durbin \namendment?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Five minutes.\n  Mr. REID. And then Senator Lindsey Graham is here to speak on what?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. To call up my amendment, 2 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Of course, the Senator from Iowa has the floor. How much \nlonger does the Senator expect to speak?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I do not think I will be much more than a half an hour.\n  Mr. REID. That kind of defeats that theory.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I may not be that long. I think I can wrap up in a half \nan hour.\n  Mr. REID. So much for my ideas.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as I said earlier in response to the \nquestions asked by my friend from Illinois, it is clear S. 1, the 654 \npages, is a sham, a ruse, a bewildering, complex bill that is going to \ncause a lot of consternation for a lot of our elderly.\n  Again, to the Senator from Illinois, I say, our Government, instead \nof using our power and influence to negotiate for better drug prices \nand better drug coverage on behalf of American seniors, is choosing to \nnurture special interest groups and big campaign donors. Why is it \nother industrialized nations are spending between 30 and 50 percent \nless on drugs than the United States? To me it is a matter of \npriorities.\n  I end my comments by saying again, before this bill came, the \nRepublicans took care of their friends, giving the wealthiest in this \ncountry nearly $1 trillion in tax breaks. Not only did we find the \nmoney to give every millionaire $93,000 in tax cuts, we made these tax \ncuts retroactive to January 1 of this year.\n  Less than a month later, here we are, and the Republicans tell us we \ndo not have enough money to get seniors on a fixed income real help \nwith their prescription drug costs. Instead, next year they get a card. \nIf you are low income, you get a $600 debit card. And then 2 years from \nnow--actually 3 years from now in 2006--we start this class business. \nSome are in this class, some in another class, and some in another \nclass. Try to figure it out.\n  Our job in Congress should be to use our votes to provide security \nfor seniors, not hand out profitable favors for special interest \ngroups.\n  If we are going to live up to our promise to seniors--our promise to \nseniors--I ask, how many Senators in this body in the last couple of \nyears have signed pledges not to privatize Medicare, not to privatize \nSocial Security? Our senior citizens, I know in my State and I am sure \naround the country, have asked us to sign those pledges. I wonder how \nmany here have signed them not to privatize Medicare and not to \nprivatize Social Security.\n  If we are going to live up to those promises we made and those \ndocuments we signed and put their interests ahead of the special \ninterests, the only vote on this bill is a resounding no, unless this \nSenate, in its wisdom, adopts the amendment offered by the Senator from \nIllinois, Mr. Durbin, because the Durbin amendment will work.\n  The Senator from Illinois has developed a comprehensive and \nthoughtful alternative that truly gives what our seniors want and need: \ncomprehensive coverage with the option of staying in Medicare.\n\n[[Page S8512]]\n\n  Let's take a look at the key differences between S. 1 and the Durbin \namendment.\n  Under S. 1, seniors have to pay a $275 deductible every year. Under \nthe Durbin amendment, there is no deductible. Under S. 1, the bill \nbefore us, seniors pay a premium not set by law but set by insurance \ncompanies, which can be raised at any time. Under the Durbin amendment, \nseniors will know what premium they will pay because it will be set by \nlaw. Under the bill before us, even after the deductible, seniors will \nstill have to pay 50 percent of their drug costs, the result of which \nmeans more than one-third of seniors will actually lose money if they \nparticipate.\n\n  I have a chart that illustrates the so-called savings for seniors \nunder the proposed drug benefit. Let's say you are a senior citizen and \nyou are making over $14,369 a year--let's say you make $15,000 a year. \nYour total drug costs are $500. Your monthly drug costs about $42. Your \nshare is $389.50. Your premium is $420. Your total out-of-pocket \nexpenses for that year are $809.50. That means you lose $310 on your \ndrugs. You pay in but you lose.\n  Let's say your total costs are $1,000 a year. Your out-of-pocket \nexpenses are $1,057.52. You lose $58. It is not until you reach just \nabout $1,200 a year in drug costs that you break even. If your drug \ncosts are less than that, you lose. Try telling that to senior citizens \nin your State.\n  Let's face it, if you have an income of $15,000 a year and you live \nup in some of our northern States and you have a high heating bill in \nthe wintertime, maybe you have other extraneous expenses, maybe you \nhave to rent a place, you are not a homeowner and you have to pay rent, \nyou have to eat, you have to buy clothes, and you are paying $500 a \nyear in drug costs, and yet you are going to lose money? Wait until \nthat hits the streets.\n  Under the Durbin amendment, seniors will pay only 30 percent of their \ndrug costs, getting much closer to what I pay now--25 percent to 30 \npercent. That is it. They will know in advance they are only going to \npay 30 percent.\n  Under the bill before us, seniors will actually lose coverage for a \nperiod of time, even while they continue to pay their premium. That is \nthat donut. When the drug costs reach $4,500, seniors stop getting any \nbenefits until they reach $5,800. That is $1,300 they pay out of \npocket, but they continue to pay their premiums.\n  Under the Durbin amendment, there is no donut hole, no coverage gap.\n  Most importantly, the bill before us will create mass confusion for \nseniors who stay in traditional Medicare because for the first time \nthey will have to negotiate private plans and deal with the \npossibility, if not the likelihood, that plans will come into and pull \nout of States year after year. The result of this volatility will be a \ncompletely unpredictable system, where seniors not only will not know \nwhat plan they will be in from year to year, but they may have to \nswitch drugs every year as plans with different formularies come in and \nout of the system.\n  Think about the confusion that is going to cause.\n  The Durbin amendment opens Medicare to private competition, but it \nincludes a real and dependable prescription drug benefit delivered by \nMedicare. Basically, they have stated we will let them compete with \nMedicare and we will provide those choices to the elderly, but the \nDurbin amendment is real and dependable. The Durbin amendment makes \nother improvements on the underlying bill, but the bottom line for \nseniors is simple. The Durbin amendment delivers what the bill does \nnot, a meaningful, dependable, reliable prescription drug benefit to \nall seniors in all States at all times.\n\n  Now, some might say, yes, but the Durbin amendment sunsets at the end \nof 2009. Well, before any of my Republican colleagues start screaming \nbloody murder and start casting aspersions about how this may be a \ngimmick and a hoax, let's remember this is exactly the same thing they \ndid, with the support of the President, to shoehorn almost a trillion \ndollars in tax cuts for the wealthy into a $350 billion price tag.\n  I always say if it is good enough for the wealthy, it ought to be \ngood enough for our seniors, too. Let them have the same deal.\n  Again this is about priorities. Earlier this year the President and \nthe Republican Congress made it clear their top priority was tax breaks \nto those least deserving and least in need. That is the result of their \nfirst effort. I am sure there will be more before the year is out. I \nalready hear them over in the House talking about it. It netted each \nmillionaire in this country a $93,000 tax cut this year.\n  What the Durbin amendment says to our seniors is they are also our \npriority. Instead of bleeding our Treasury dry by giving every tax \nreceipt back to the richest in the Nation, the Durbin amendment says \nbefore we get too far ahead of ourselves on tax breaks for the wealthy \nor anything else, we are going to get seniors the help they need.\n  Some will come and argue his plan is too expensive, that it is not \nsustainable. All I can say is, this plan has roughly the same short- \nand long-term costs as the tax breaks we passed.\n  All I ask is, what are the priorities of my colleagues? As luck would \nhave it, both the tax breaks for the wealthy and under the Durbin \namendment would sunset at roughly the same time. So in the not too \ndistant future, the new Congress and new President can again set their \npriorities and decide which should be continued. Should we continue the \ntax breaks for the wealthy or should we continue a reliable \nprescription drug benefit under Medicare for the elderly? That is a \nchoice a future Congress could make.\n  We should not foist upon our elderly a misguided, complex, \nbefuddling, bewildering--and these are not my words; these are words \nused by others--system of prescription drug coverage that will not meet \ntheir needs, that will cost them more money, that will actually cost \nsome of them more than what they get out of it. That is what we are \ndoing. That is what we are going to foist upon the elderly of this \ncountry, unless we adopt the Durbin amendment. If we do, then this \nSenator can wholeheartedly support this bill and vote for it. If not, \nthen I will not be a part of a sham, of a ruse, to tell our elderly \nthey are going to get something when they are not, to hold out a false \nhope when in fact they are not going to get the benefits they have \nasked us to give to them.\n  This Senator's priority is with the elderly. Let's deal with them \nfirst. Let's meet their needs first. Then if we have something left \nover, let's think about tax breaks for the wealthy. Let's not do it the \nother way around.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the following \nMembers be recognized to speak: Senator Graham for 5 minutes, Senator \nByrd for 10 minutes, Senator Stabenow for 5 minutes, Senator Domenici \nfor 10 minutes, Senator Dorgan for 5 minutes, and Senator Ensign for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we had some \nvotes tentatively scheduled after and that appears to have fallen by \nthe wayside. I therefore ask that Senator Byrd be recognized for up to \n15 minutes rather than 10 minutes, and Senator Stabenow for 10 minutes \ninstead of 5 minutes, and I ask that the Senator from New Hampshire \naccept that modification to the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. SUNUNU.

A committee \n     to which an implementation bill is referred under this \n     paragraph may report such bill to the respective House \n     without amendment.\n       (3) Report or discharge.--If a committee to which an \n     implementation bill is referred has not reported such bill by \n     the end of the 15th calendar day after the date of the \n     introduction of such bill, such committee shall be \n     immediately discharged from further consideration of such \n     bill, and upon being reported or discharged from the \n     committee, such bill shall be placed on the appropriate \n     calendar.\n       (c) Floor Consideration.--\n       (1) In general.--When the committee to which an \n     implementation bill is referred has reported, or has been \n     discharged under subsection (b)(3), it is at any time \n     thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the \n     same effect has been disagreed to) for any Member of the \n     respective House to move to proceed to the consideration of \n     the implementation bill, and all points of order against the \n     implementation bill (and against consideration of the \n     implementation bill) are waived.

A motion further to limit debate is in order and \n     not debatable. An amendment to, or a motion to postpone, or a \n     motion to proceed to the consideration of other business, or \n     a motion to recommit the implementation bill is not in order. \n     A motion to reconsider the vote by which the implementation \n     bill is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order.\n       (4) Vote on final passage.--Immediately following the \n     conclusion of the debate on an implementation bill, and a \n     single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if \n     requested in accordance with the rules of the appropriate \n     House, the vote on final passage of the implementation bill \n     shall occur.\n       (5) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals from the \n     decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the \n     rules of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the \n     case may be, to the procedure relating to an implementation \n     bill shall be decided without debate.\n       (d) Coordination With Action by Other House.--If, before \n     the passage by 1 House of an implementation bill of that \n     House, that House receives from the other House an \n     implementation bill, then the following procedures shall \n     apply:\n       (1) Nonreferral.--The implementation bill of the other \n     House shall not be referred to a committee.\n       (2) Vote on bill of other house.--With respect to an \n     implementation bill of the House receiving the implementation \n     bill--\n       (A) the procedure in that House shall be the same as if no \n     implementation bill had been received from the other House; \n     but\n       (B) the vote on final passage shall be on the \n     implementation bill of the other House.\n       (e) Rules of Senate and House of Representatives.--This \n     section is enacted by Congress--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is \n     deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n     applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed \n     in that House in the case of an implementation bill described \n     in subsection (a), and it supersedes other rules only to the \n     extent that it is inconsistent with such rules; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the \n     procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and \n     to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that \n     House.\n\n      SEC. __04. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out this subtitle for each of fiscal years \n     2012 through 2013.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I offer this amendment \nwith the hope we can negotiate a resolution and have it accepted as \npart of the package. The chairman of the committee has been very \ngracious in trying to bring that result about. Briefly, this amendment \ncosts no money. The whole idea of reform in the bill is a new \nalternative traditional Medicare that will be created, called Medicare \nAdvantage, to which people will gravitate, that allows preventive \nmedicine practices that currently do not exist, bringing modernization \nto Medicare, making it more user friendly and cost effective. That is \nthe goal of the bill, by creating a new option.\n  Estimates range from 2 to 43 percent participation. For those looking \nfor reform, the only vehicle for reform in this bill I can find is the \nidea of Medicare Advantage, and that is somewhat minimal.\n  This amendment addresses the problem of ``what if.'' What if in 2010, \nafter 4 years of enactment of this bill, the traditional Medicare is \nthe primary choice made? What if the Medicare Advantage Program does \nnot receive 15-percent enrollment? If it has not achieved 15-percent \nenrollment, creating efficiency and modernization is going to be lost.\n  This is the last time maybe in a generation to look at traditional \nMedicare and not only improve it for the senior citizen but improve it \nfor their grandchildren who are going to have to pay for it.\n  Traditional Medicare, as I understand this bill, is pretty much \nunaffected in terms of reforms. Having a prescription drug benefit can \nbe a good idea because it emphasizes preventive medicine practices. \nHaving prescription drugs reasonably available can keep people \nhealthier longer and improve the quality of life and keep them out of \nthe hospital and do a lot of good things. But Medicare is $13 trillion \nshort of the money we need. This bill is going to be $4 trillion \nadditional liability. This is a chance as a body to look at the \nstructural problems that Medicare faces.\n  We are increasing the age limit to 67 for Social Security \neligibility. It seems to me that is a good idea given the fact people \nare living longer. I would like to do that with Medicare. I don't think \nthat is oppressive. I think that is fair to grandparents and \ngrandchildren. I believe we should have a means test. If we have a \nprescription drug benefit, I believe you should be asked to participate \nbased on your ability to participate because $3 out of $4 coming into \nMedicare Part B comes from the General Treasury. It is truly a \nsubsidized entitlement. These are the type of reforms I would like to \nsee happen. I don't think they are going to happen. And the Medicare \nAdvantage Program is the only alternative that has a reform element to \nit.\n  My amendment says in 2010, after 4 years, if 15 percent of Medicare \nrecipients are not enrolled in Medicare Advantage, if you cannot get 15 \npercent to pick Medicare Advantage--you get 2 years to reach 15 \npercent, January of 2012. If you have not achieved 15 percent by \nJanuary 2012, it is a chance to have a fail-safe mechanism requiring a \ncommission to be appointed. The President, the House, and the Senate \nwould appoint nine members to this commission who would study and \nreport back to Congress in a timely manner what would be needed at that \npoint in time to save Medicare from bankruptcy to make sure it does not \nblow a hole in the budget and make sure it is efficiently run. This \ncommission has 18 months to create a work product, legislation that \ncomes back to the House and Senate, and we vote up or down on that \nlegislation.\n\n  This amendment will force in the future reforms that may not be \nachieved if we do not have adequate participation in Medicare \nAdvantage. It takes the issue away from Congress in the sense of the \ncommission is required to look at it and bring it back to Congress\n\n[[Page S8515]]\n\nfor our input and our vote. I believe we need an element like this in \nthis entitlement bill because if we do not have a way down the road to \ntake a second look at this program, we are all going to suffer greatly \nin this Nation.\n  It costs no money. Hopefully, it will never have to happen. If we \ncannot get 15 percent of Medicare recipients to enroll in Medicare \nAdvantage, there will be no way to reform this program. I hope we can \nfind a resolution in a bipartisan fashion and this amendment will be \naccepted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, before we pat ourselves on the back, pop the \nchampagne bottles, and fan out across America to tell seniors that \ntheir prescription drug worries are now an issue of the past, let's \ntake a closer look at the Medicare proposal before us.\n  The more I read through this Medicare bill, the more I become \nconvinced that history is once more repeating itself. I can recall a \npainful experience during my majority leadership when an outraged \ncitizenry, composed mostly of seniors, forced Congress to repeal the \nill-fated Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act back in 1989. The year \nbefore, Congress was engaged in a Medicare debate eerily similar to the \none we are having at this time. A bipartisan compromise was reached to \nmake the most sweeping change in Medicare's then 23 years of existence.\n  Congress agreed to two key changes to the Medicare program--a \nprescription drug benefit and a ``stop-loss'' protection from \ncatastrophic medical bills. Facing deficits as we do today, Congress, \nin its infinite wisdom, decided that beneficiaries should pay for the \nnew benefits themselves, with the wealthiest paying the most. The new \nlaw included a complicated benefit that was too difficult to explain \nand a lengthy delay in the benefit's taking effect. In the end, seniors \nsaw the bill, were confused as to what they are were getting in \nexchange, and wanted no part of it. Hence, it was repealed in the next \nsession. We are poised to make the same mistake again.\n  I foresee a great deal of confusion and dismay occurring around \nkitchen tables and in corporate boardrooms across America when people \nactually start to read beyond the newspaper headlines and see the fine \nprint of this plan 3 years from now. Seniors may not know whether to \nlaugh or weep. And if no one signs up for this new Medicare plan, it \nwill fail and fail miserably.\n  What incentive do seniors have to sign up for a plan that is full of \ncoverage holes, up-front costs, and confusing paperwork? What incentive \ndo insurance companies have to enter an untried, untested, drug-only \ninsurance market? How can an insurance company make a plan work when \nalmost every single participating insuree makes a claim?\n  Many of the 335,000 Medicare beneficiaries in West Virginia are \nstruggling just to make ends meet and pay for the prescription \nmedicines that sustain them. In West Virginia, the average annual \nincome of a Medicare beneficiary is a mere $10,800.\n  I have to wonder, what does this prescription drug proposal mean to a \n75-year-old widow from West Virginia who lives off her late husband's \npension of $21,000 a year, but has $5,700 per year out-of-pocket drug \ncosts to treat her diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, and \nelevated cholesterol levels?\n\n  To take advantage of this new, so-called drug benefit, she would have \nto spend at least $420 in yearly premiums, a $275 deductible, and then \nshe and Medicare would each pay 50 percent of her drug costs until the \ncosts reach $4,500, after which she would pay the remainder of her \n$5,700 medical bill--about another $1,000 in other words. And she could \nvery well have to spend more given that the deductible, premiums, and \ncopay amount are not defined in this legislation. Does this sound \nconfusing? I am confused just trying to describe it.\n  Ultimately, Medicare would pay about a mere $2,000 of this poor West \nVirginia widow's $5,700 drug costs, a benefit of only about 35 percent. \nWhat a flimsy benefit. It doesn't even come close to the approximately \n70 percent prescription drug subsidy Members of Congress receive under \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefit Program. We wouldn't dare design \nhealth benefits for ourselves in this way.\n  Under this legislation, seniors in similar situations in West \nVirginia and across the Nation would still be forced to resort to pill \nsplitting and desperately foregoing the medicines their doctors have \nprescribed.\n  Let's slow down and take a better look at this legislation. President \nBush says he wants the Senate to pass a bill before the July recess, \nand so we're now engaged in a headlong rush to do just that. Members \nhave been sitting around for days just waiting for Congressional Budget \nOffice staff, who have been working nonstop around the clock to \nproduce, and in some cases, reproduce cost estimates that fall within \nthe too small budget parameters that we have required for passage. This \nis no way to legislate on a program of such great importance to the \ncitizens of this country. We need more time to explain this plan to our \nelderly citizens. Don't we need their feedback?\n  I doubt that our Nation's seniors will be excited about accepting a \nmere half-loaf benefit. Seniors will probably want no part of it. Just \nlike they did almost 15 years ago, when I was majority leader they may \nrevolt, and Members of Congress could be back here scratching their \nheads and scrambling to find a solution and save their seats.\n  Senator Durbin and I and other Senators have offered a substitute \nMedicare amendment that actually makes sense, and I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of it. The Medicare benefit under the Durbin amendment has no \ndeductible, a guaranteed $420 yearly premium, no gaps in coverage, and \na catastrophic cap on drug spending at $5,000. The Durbin amendment \nwould also allow seniors to receive their prescription drug benefit \nthrough the traditional Medicare program or through an available \nprivate plan if they desire. Seniors would receive their prescription \ndrug benefit as soon as possible, rather than having to wait until \n2006, after the next elections. Finally, the Durbin amendment would \nallow the Federal Government to use the leveraging power of millions of \nseniors to negotiate lower prices for prescription medications.\n  The same widow in West Virginia with $5,700 in drug costs, would only \nhave to spend about $2,000 under the Durbin amendment plan versus the \nalmost $4,000 she would have to pay under the Grassley-Baucus Medicare \nbill before us today. I think it is quite obvious which Medicare plan \nthe elderly citizens from West Virginia would choose.\n  This legislation, as it stands, also does nothing to address the high \ncost of prescription drugs. We should do better for our seniors. And we \ncan do better. I believe that we can improve this legislation through \nthe adoption of the Durbin amendment. Let's not shortchange our \nseniors. They deserve our very best efforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMichigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW.

Mr. President, I believe this is an incredibly \nimportant vote. This amendment really is about providing seniors with \nwhat they are asking. The seniors of this country, and those who are \ndisabled, deserve our best effort. As we come together we have been \nspending this time putting together prescription drug coverage for \nseniors, debating about how to lower prices, and the Durbin amendment--\nwhich I am pleased to cosponsor--does just that. I believe the Durbin \namendment is our best effort. That is what seniors are asking for.\n  They are not asking for more insurance forms to wade through. Most of \nthem are not asking for more choice. They are asking for prescription \ndrug coverage.\n  I was talking to someone today at lunchtime who is on Medicare. He \nsaid to me, Whatever you do, please do not do anything to Medicare. It \nis simple; it is easy; it is dependable; they handle my secondary \ninsurance.\n  He said, I actually have a 1-800 number I call and a real person \nanswers the phone.\n  He was going on and on talking about how successful and how helpful \nMedicare has been for him.\n  I said, Boy, I would love to have you come to the floor and share \nthis with my colleagues, because we keep hearing about how awful the \ntraditional Medicare system is.\n  The conversation I had with the gentleman at noon reflects what I \ncommonly hear at home. As I said before, the seniors of this country \nconsider Medicare--and I wish we would consider Medicare--a great \nAmerican success story.\n  Why is the Durbin amendment the best effort we can provide? Why is it \nthe best we can give to our seniors?\n  First of all, working within the dollars that have been put aside in \nthe budget resolution, this does not require any additional funds. But, \nby doing this, by putting the priority on our seniors and those \nreceiving the health care, by making that the focus, that the priority, \nyou can create a very different benefit if your priority is to start \nwith: What do our seniors need? What do those who are disabled need? \nLet's start with a system that is designed for them.\n\n[[Page S8517]]\n\n  When we do that, we can create a system that does not have any \ndeductible, no deductible at all. We can create a system that \nguarantees what the premium will be. Not a suggested premium like we \nhave in the underlying bill, but we can say it is $35 a month; it is \nguaranteed; it is in the law. Seniors will know what to count on and \nwhat to claim for.\n  We can do a better job on cost savings. Instead of saying we will \ncover 50 percent of the cost, we can cover 70 percent. That is a big \ndifference--70 percent of the cost.\n  We can make sure there is no coverage gap. In fact, no one will lose \ntheir benefits, their help with their medical payments, as they move up \nwith greater and greater bills. The higher the bill, the more they \nwould continue to get help.\n\n  One of the reasons this can be done is because there is a real effort \nto get the best possible price for our seniors. The real issue in all \nof this debate--and the reason we have all this convoluted, complicated \nprocess that has been going on--is the pharmaceutical industry wants to \nmake sure all the seniors are not in one plan where they can negotiate \na big group discount as with any other insurance plan. We know the \nveterans of this country do not pay retail because the VA gets a group \ndiscount. Well, the Durbin amendment would give our seniors that group \ndiscount. And if you do that, you can lower prices. It is still a fair \nreturn, but you can lower prices, and use those savings to provide a \nbetter benefit, to make sure there is no deductible, to make sure there \nis no gap in coverage for our seniors.\n  We also can deal with a very important issue for many of us; that is \nthe question of employer benefits. We want to make sure our employers \ndo not have the incentive to drop benefits. There are many people in my \ngreat State of Michigan who I have worked with in our great auto \nindustry, and other manufacturing industries, and others that have good \nbenefits now. We are grateful to the employers in the industries \ninvolved, and they have a history of good benefits, good wages, and \ngood employees, I might add. We are very proud of the work that goes on \nin Michigan.\n  Now that many of our Michiganites have retired, we want to make sure \nwe provide incentives for employers to maintain those benefits. Those \nlifesaving benefits are absolutely critical. And we know that in the \nunderlying bill, unfortunately, the projection is there will be an \nincentive for many employers to drop or reduce benefits, which is not \nacceptable.\n  What we have in this option, in this best offer that is in front of \nus, is the ability to count the employer benefits toward out-of-pocket \nspending, which is an encouragement for employers to continue to \nprovide the benefits they currently provide to their retirees.\n  Under the Durbin amendment, you would have the option of a private \nplan. If you would like to go into an HMO or PPO, if that is a positive \nexperience for you, you have that choice. But it also makes sure there \nis a Medicare choice always, that you have an opportunity to stay \nwithin Medicare.\n  Then one of the most important parts of this amendment is the fact \nthat it would take effect as soon as possible. I think one of my \nconcerns is with all of the talk and all the news reports about a new \nprescription drug benefit, it is not clear to our seniors that, in \nfact, no help in terms of a benefit is available until 2006. There is a \ndiscount card, yes, but nothing in terms of the bill taking full effect \nuntil 2006. So this amendment would say ``as soon as possible.'' As \nsoon as possible we want to make sure this takes effect.\n  The Durbin amendment puts forward our best effort. It is a better \nbenefit. It is a defined benefit so there is dependability. It reduces \nprescription drug costs. It maintains choice for those who wish to have \nanother choice other than traditional Medicare. It creates a reliable \nMedicare benefit fallback if you choose private insurance. If your \nprivate carrier drops you, such as happened to my mother with her \nMedicare+Choice plan, you would always be able to have Medicare as a \npermanent choice for you if that happens. We incentivize employers to \nmaintain benefits. And, finally, the Medicare-delivered benefit can be \nimplemented faster.\n\n  There is a lot of good work and good will among all of our colleagues \nto try to develop and pass a prescription drug benefit here in the \nSenate. I believe our seniors deserve the very best we can offer, \nsomething that is straightforward, is dependable, is reliable--a system \nthat is based on what is best for them, not what is best for insurance \ncompanies or pharmaceutical companies or any other interest but what is \nbest for them.\n  Medicare has been a great American success story. It works. It just \nneeds to be updated. It just needs to be modernized to cover \nprescription drugs. I believe it also should be modernized to cover \nmore preventive efforts and other kinds of improvements that will \ncontinue to strengthen Medicare and allow it to modernize and improve \nwith the times.\n  We can do that. We can do that without going to a complicated, \nconvoluted system that focuses more and more on efforts that ultimately \ncould privatize Medicare.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in support of the Durbin amendment. Give \nour seniors what they are asking for.\n  I will share with my colleagues a chart I have used many times on \nthis floor. Right now, 89 percent of the seniors of this country are in \nMedicare. They are asking--I am very confident they are asking--for the \nDurbin amendment. I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that if there is not \na vote called following the statement by the Senator from Nevada, Mr. \nEnsign, Senator Durbin be recognized for 15 minutes, Senator Smith of \nOregon for 5 minutes, and Senator Nickles for 20 minutes to speak on \nthis bill or any pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about this \nlegislation. Perhaps some will not recognize my speech at all because I \nknow there is $12 billion to be resolved, and I understand it is going \nto be resolved. I am speaking as if we have finished our work and we \nare going to vote. I am here to tell the Senate and anybody interested \nwhy I am going to vote for this legislation.\n  First of all, we need prescription drugs for our senior citizens.\n  Secondly, we have a situation, of which I am absolutely positive. \nFrom what I have heard, if I were attending the meetings in the \nDemocratic caucus, I would hear the Democratic Senators who are \ninformed on the subject stand up and talk about how bad this bill is. I \nwould hear them say that it does not do enough, that it does not take \ncare of enough poor people, that it does not have enough choice, and \nthat all the seniors who are currently on Medicare are expected leave \nand go somewhere else. That is not any good.\n  And just as sure as that is going on, and I have inquired before \nmaking this speech if that is the case, I go to our Republican \ncaucuses, and I hear one Senator after another speak about the \nshortcomings of this bill. Some speak about it with a clear-cut: ``I am \nnot going to vote for it.'' But many speak of it in terms of: ``I just \nwant to let you know how bad I think it is. I don't want to talk you \nout of it, I just want to tell you how bad it is.'' One Senator after \nanother, then another: ``I just want to tell you how bad it is. It just \nwon't work.''\n  Then somebody else on this side begins speaking about it from fiscal \npolicy, and they say: ``It is going to cost too much. It is going to \nbreak us.'' And there are Senators in the other caucus saying: ``We are \nnot reforming the Medicare system, and it's going to go broke. We are \njust adding more debt to that system.'' Now again, I have not been \nthere, but I asked.\n  Then I go to our caucus, and I hear the same thing: ``The Medicare \nsystem is already somewhat bankrupt. It is not going to have sufficient \nmoney in a few years. We are going to have to start finding money for \nit somewhere. And this is going to add, some say, $4.5 trillion.'' That \nis what we have been hearing in our caucus. Some are saying: ``No, I \ndon't want you not to vote for it, but I just want to tell you about \nall these problems.''\n\n[[Page S8518]]\n\n  I want to tell you I am going to vote for it because I am a hope-\nfilled Senator. I am hope filled about the future of the American \neconomy and American prosperity. I am hope filled about American \ningenuity, American breakthroughs, American science achievements, and \nAmerican wellness achievements. I want to tell you about why I am \nhopeful.\n  First, we have mapped the human genome system during our lifetime. \nThis means that we currently know where the aberrations in the human \ngenome system are, and where all of the major diseases lie within the \nchromosome system of the human anatomy. That is an unheard of \nachievement.\n  Why do I speak of it while I try to talk about Medicare and \nprescription drugs? Because we are not living in a stagnant world. We \nare not living in a world that during the next 10 or 15 or 20 or 30 \nyears that we are going to have just what we have today in terms of \nwellness, in terms of prescription drugs, in terms of curing illnesses. \nWe are in the midst of the most gigantic breakthroughs in wellness. We \nare in the midst of breakthroughs in terms of finding cures to all \nkinds of human ailments and all kinds of drug breakthroughs which are \ngoing to cure people and make them well. There sits that breakthrough \ncalled the mapping of the human genome system.\n  At the same time we are passing this bill, science is far from \nstagnant. There is going on in science today something called \nnanoscience. Nanoscience involves the actual manipulation of atoms to \ncreate new systems and new products. While we are wondering if we are \ngoing to be able to afford this drug system we are currently putting in \nplace, out there in all kinds of centers of higher learning, American \nscientists and scientists in the rest of the world are developing \ntechnology involving the manipulation of atoms to create new systems \nand new products.\n  I believe within 15 to 20 years there will be so many new products \nand things that will be manufactured and made that will add to the \nproductivity of America. I mention it because it makes my vote tomorrow \non this bill hope filled. I believe there are going to be productivity \nchanges, there are going to be drug cures, there are going to be \nmedicinal cures, there will be wellness cures. All of these things are \ngoing to happen because we are not going to be living in a stagnant \nsystem. We are going to deliver under this prescription drug bill the \ndrugs our people need; principally with the money going to the poorest, \nwho need the most help, and then moving it upwards so that those who \nare least in need will get the least help.\n  While we have Senators on each side finding fault with the proposal, \nwhich probably means it is pretty good, we also find them saying: ``We \ncan't afford it.''\n  I am here to suggest we can afford it. As a matter of fact, I am here \nto say we can't afford not to do it. I am here to say with all the \nbreakthroughs that are going to occur, we must put in place a system \nthat is more apt to take advantage of those breakthroughs. I believe \nthe distinguished leader of the Senate who has spoken on this subject \nis correct. If we have these HMOs and PPOs and these delivery systems, \nthey are more apt to take advantage of the breakthroughs that are going \nto occur because of nanoscience, because of the genome, and then \nbecause there is also a huge new system called microtechnologies. \nMicrotechnologies, believe it or not, are going to create all kinds of \ntiny little engines, engines that are going to be able to do all kinds \nof things that make products and solve problems and cure health \nproblems.\n  The microtechnology system means that little tiny engines will be \nproduced on a chip just like the chip that we now talk about. There \nwill be engines on that chip. And, if you look at that chip with a \nmicroscope, you will actually see little engines working. Those engines \nmay, indeed, be put in the human body to go after certain ailments and \njust take them on as little engines. And the illnesses will disappear \nor perhaps be ameliorated.\n  All of these things are going to happen. Nobody at the CBO, nobody at \nthe other agencies who have evaluated whether we will be able to pay \nfor this bill and whether we will be able to deliver on this bill, have \nfigured in those kinds of gigantic breakthroughs that are going to \noccur in this American system. In fact, none of them are figuring the \nproductivity breakthroughs that are going to occur, in this Senator's \nopinion, from nanoscience and microtechnology breakthroughs. Nor are \nthey taking into consideration breakthroughs on the medicinal side that \nwill result from our continuation of funding the NIH at about 10-\npercent growth a year.\n\n  I add one caveat. If I were voting on this bill and were asked, \n``What should you do in addition to this bill?'' I would adopt a \nresolution that would require mandatory funding of the physical \nsciences at about 10 percent a year just like we did the NIH for the \nnext 10 years. Then you would have the great instruments of \nbreakthrough--the NIH, the National Institutes of Science, plus \nAmerican ingenuity and business. You would have the physical sciences \nfunded at a much higher rate than we are funding them so that \nnanoscience and the others I have spoken of can have their breakthrough \nday. So that we can, in fact, deliver what we plan to deliver under \nthis bill.\n  I close where I started, by saying: For all intents and purposes, the \nbill is finished. It is probably not perfect, but no democracy can draw \na perfect bill. It is probably better than those who are saying how bad \nit is, and it is probably slightly worse than those who are running \naround saying how great it is. But it is pretty good in terms of a \ndelivery system that can get us started and that we can always change.\n  I don't fear the fact that we have a large group of Americans coming \nalong, the generation that we are worried about, the baby boomers. I am \nnot concerned about how we are going to pay for them and how we are \ngoing to take care of them. I believe the breakthroughs I have just \ndiscussed generally will be specific breakthroughs that will be \noccurring rapidly in large numbers, every year for the next 20 to 30 \nyears. I believe that 20 years from now we will not recognize the \nprescription drugs being delivered today. We will not recognize what \nthe drugs are being delivered to cure, and what they are curing because \nwe will have made so many changes. And, almost all of these changes \nwill be for the positive. By applying human ingenuity, human knowledge, \nhuman capacity to such basic research as the human genome or the \nmapping of the chromosomes and the aberrations on the chromosomes which \ncreate diseases, we are going to find cures so that we won't have to be \npaying the drug costs because we will have found the cures for the \nsicknesses.\n  I thought it would be a good 15 minutes, maybe 10, while we had a few \nlax moments, to at least let one Senator put some comments in the \nrecord that sort of set the tone for what he will be thinking about \nwhen he votes on this rather celebrated bill. I will be thinking about \nall the people we are going to help today, tomorrow, and next year. But \nI will also be thinking about all the changes that are going to occur \nbecause of these great sciences that I have just spoken of. We won't \nrecognize what we are taking care of in 10 years. We won't recognize \nwhat medicines we are delivering. We won't recognize what diseases we \nare curing. And, frankly, it is entirely possible that we won't \nrecognize the hospital system that we have delivering hospital care to \nour people if, in fact, the genome system really works as some people \nthink it will.\n\n  Some are saying within 20 to 40 years we won't even have hospitals \nlike the ones we have. There will be different kinds of institutions \nthat will be delivering health care because of the capacity of the \ngenome system to deliver health care in a completely different way. I \nhope that these words at least are helpful. They are to this Senator. \nThey make me feel that I have something to say beyond coming down here \nand reading a bunch of numbers, which I used to have to do ad nauseam \nwhen I was chairman of the Budget Committee, and try to make all kinds \nof predictions on how you are going to have enough money for this, \nthat, or the other thing.\n  To tell you the truth, this program is a close call in terms of \nwhether we are going to be able to pay for it. It might be a close call \nas to whether it is the best program we can put together. But I tell \nyou, it is the right thing to do. We don't have anything like it today, \nand our people, in particular poor people, suffer because of it. We \nought to\n\n[[Page S8519]]\n\nfix this as soon as we can and then go to work keeping an environment \nin our economic system that is vibrant and healthy. We must do this so \nthat our system can do the things that I have been discussing over the \nnext 15 or 20 years as this prescription drug benefit delivers the \nprescription drugs we are talking about.\n  I understand my time has elapsed, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from North Dakota is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, we are about to vote at some point in \nthe coming hour or two on a series of amendments, one of which will be \nthe Durbin amendment, called the MediSAVE amendment. I wanted to make a \ncouple of comments about that amendment.\n  I regret there being a substantial difference between what is \npromised and what is delivered to senior citizens with respect to a \nprescription drug benefit in the Medicare Program. My colleague from \nNew Mexico indicated this is not a perfect bill. It is not. It is not a \nterrible bill; that is certainly the case as well. It addresses an \nissue that almost every Senator says needs addressing, and that is \nadding a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare Program. But I \nconfess, the more we have dealt with this, the clearer it is to me that \nwe are creating the most complicated, byzantine system that we possibly \ncould have created.\n  We had opportunities, and will continue to have them, to improve this \nbill. We have missed most of them in the last few days.\n  This is a horribly complicated proposal. The Durbin amendment is an \namendment that provides substantially improved benefits, and I will \ndescribe all of them. These benefits are not in the underlying \nlegislation. The average cost of prescription drugs for senior citizens \nin this country is about $2,300 a year.\n  I might say that senior citizens are about 12 percent of America's \npopulation and they consume one-third of the prescription drugs, \nbecause we know when people reach retirement age, that status of life, \nmany of them need prescription drugs in order to deal with their health \nissues.\n\n  Miracle drugs provide no miracles for those who cannot afford to take \nthem. So we understand when people reach their declining income years, \nwe ought to put together a prescription drug plan, attach it to the \nMedicare Program, and give them the assurance that we did 40 years ago, \nthat if they are sick, they can go to a hospital; they would have \nMedicare; and if they need prescription drugs now, give them the \nassurance that they will have that opportunity.\n  We all have talked to senior citizens, particularly women, I might \nsay, who live on fixed incomes, alone, at an advanced age, and have a \nvery minimal amount of income, and who tell us: I cannot afford to take \nthe prescription drugs the doctor says I must take.\n  I have talked about the woman who came to me at a meeting one day and \nsaid, ``I have heart disease and diabetes.'' She must have been in her \neighties. ``The doctor prescribes medicines and I have no opportunity \nto buy them because I cannot afford them.''\n  The fact is, we can do something about that. Now, my colleague, \nSenator Durbin from Illinois, offers an amendment that creates a more \nmeaningful benefit to senior citizens, No. 1. If they spend $2,300 a \nyear, on average, for prescription drugs, the underlying bill will give \nthem the benefit of somewhere around $600.\n  I will say that again. If they spend $2,300, we are going to say you \nhave prescription drug coverage now. But the fact is, it only covers \n$600. My colleague's amendment will double that to $1,200.\n  Second, it creates a defined benefit. Under the plan before us, the \nGrassley-Baucus plan, there is no guaranteed benefit for seniors. The \npremiums are left to the insurance companies. Well, figure out what you \ncan do, describe what the premium is going to be, and tell us later, \nwould you?\n  That is no way for the Congress to define a prescription drug \nbenefit. My colleague offers an amendment that has a defined benefit \nand that is exactly what our responsibility is, to define the benefit.\n  The other issue my colleague addresses is reduced cost. I offered an \namendment that did pass that talks about the reimportation from Canada \nof prescription drugs, offering consumers the same drug, made by the \nsame company, put in the same bottle, at a lower price because we pay \nthe highest prices for prescription drugs in the world. You can buy \nexactly the same drug in Canada for a substantial discount.\n  My colleague says, with this prescription drug plan attached to the \nMedicare Program, what we ought to do is instruct Health and Human \nServices to negotiate the same group purchasing arrangements that we \nhave done in the VA. We know how that works. We know what that saves.\n  There isn't any reason it should not be in this legislation. My \ncolleague's amendment maintains a choice. People still have the \nopportunity to go into a private plan someplace, but they can come back \nto this plan, which will be a Medicare attached plan with better \nbenefits.\n  So what my colleague from Illinois is offering is something that is \nmuch better, provides better benefits, provides defined benefits, \nprovides downward pressure on prices, and it seems to me it represents \nwhat everybody in this Chamber has promised at one time or another but \nwhich none will deliver unless we start passing an amendment of this \ntype.\n\n  We have missed a lot of good opportunities in recent days to pass \namendments that would have improved this bill. I guarantee you, if we \ndon't make some improvements, by the year 2006, when this becomes \navailable--it should have been 2004, but the last amendment was turned \ndown--there will be a lot of disappointed people, because they expect \nprescription drug coverage. Instead, they are going to get a fraction \nof that. We can remedy that.\n  The first step, it seems to me, is to vote for the Durbin amendment, \nthe MediSAVE amendment. There are other amendments we can support as \nwell which will make this the kind of prescription drug benefit in \nMedicare that senior citizens have been promised by virtually all of \nus.\n  Let's not deliver much less than we have promised. We have all \npromised to do something about this because we understand the need and \nwe understand the urgency. When you reach those declining income years \nof life and need prescription drugs, the miracle drugs to save your \nlife and to maintain a decent life, we understand the need to provide \nthe help to finance those drugs. Many seniors simply cannot do it. They \ngo to the grocery store that has a pharmacy in the back, and they have \nto figure out the cost of their drugs before they decide how much food \nthey can afford. We have all heard those stories time and again.\n  The question is, are we going to do this? If the answer is yes, the \nquestion is, are we going to do it right? If the answer is yes, then it \nis voting for the Durbin amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Who is to be recognized next?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the agreement, Senator Ensign of Nevada \nis to be recognized next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask that the time of the Senator from \nNevada be reserved, and we now turn to Senator Durbin who is under the \nconsent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Nevada. I say \nto my colleagues, the more they study S. 1, the more they get to know \nit, the more concerned they have to be. I agree with the premise that \nwe are making a commitment for the first time to provide prescription \ndrug help to senior citizens. This is historic. We are doing the right \nthing.\n  Then when you look at the way this has been written and try to put it \nin the context of your parents or grandparents making these decisions, \nyou understand the complexity of it, the fact it does not provide the \nprotection which a lot of people promised. Basically, when it gets down \nto it, this is fraught with danger and peril.\n  The seniors understand that. When you sit down with senior citizens \nand\n\n[[Page S8520]]\n\nsay let me tell you what we are doing, what we are offering, the first \nthing they say to you is: Senator, what are you doing to keep the cost \nof drugs from running off the chart? I know you say you are going to \nhelp me by paying a certain percentage. What good is that percentage, \nSenator? My Social Security payments are going up, enough to keep up \nwith the cost of inflation. So if you are not going to contain the cost \nof prescription drugs, what good is this?\n  That is a hard question, isn't it? But it is the right question. When \nyou take a look at S. 1, the bill before us, the honest answer is \nnothing. What this bill says is we will rely on HMOs and private \ninsurance companies to offer a prescription drug benefit.\n  My friend from Florida was an insurance commissioner. Senator Nelson \nhas told us time and again what it means to deal with some of these \ninsurance companies. As much as his expertise might bring to this \ndebate, the greatest experts on HMOs are senior citizens. Ask them \nabout coverage by HMOs. They despise HMOs. They know what these \ninsurance companies are going to do.\n  First, they are going to nail them with a premium much more than 35 \nbucks a month. There is a provision in this bill which makes insurance \nsense but does not make common sense. It says if you have a chance to \nenroll in this voluntary program at the monthly premium--and let's \nassume for discussion it is $35--and you turn it down because it is \nvoluntary and say you do not want to enroll in it, and then a year \nlater or 2 years later, you think, maybe you should enroll in it, there \nis a provision in this bill that says your monthly premium may not be \n$35, it may be $100.\n  It makes insurance sense because it is called adverse selection. You \ndo not want sick people to pay premiums just when they get sick. Think \nabout that senior on a limited income who has to make a calculation as \nto how much they are going to pay. Look at that senior, if you are \ntalking about a $1,000 annual prescription drug bill--I am sitting \nthere with my mother or my grandmother, and she says to me: Son, should \nI pay this $35 a month? I know it is a $275 deductible.\n  I say: Mom, your payments are less than 100 bucks a month. You are \ngoing to end up paying more. You are not going to get any help from \nthis plan because the first $1,000 your monthly premium is going to be \nadded on to the help from the Government. You will be paying more than \n$1,000 for $1,000 worth of drugs. It may not make sense to you, mom.\n  OK, maybe I will not sign up.\n  Then a year or two later she starts getting sick and \nneeds prescription drugs desperately, and now that monthly premium is \nno longer $35; it is $100. It makes insurance sense, but it does not \nmake common sense, and that is one of the wrinkles in this bill.\n\n  When you ask the seniors about S. 1, this Grassley-Baucus bill, they \nare worried about this $35 premium that may be $50 or may be $100, and \nthese are people, I hate to remind my colleagues, who are living on \n$400 or $500 or $600 a month.\n  To a Member of the Senate, $35 is not something you consider a life-\nthreatening decision. For a senior citizen on a fixed income, a widow \nliving alone in a small rural town in downstate Illinois or Florida, it \nis a big deal. Seniors have told us: I do not like this idea of $35 a \nmonth if it is not even certain that is what the premium is going to \nbe.\n  Then you say to them: Incidentally, you are going to have to deal, \nonce again, with HMOs and private insurance companies for your \nprescription drugs, and they start bailing out saying: What are you \ndoing to me, Senator? I do not trust these people. That is why almost \n90 percent of the people on Medicare do not sign up for the Medicare \nHMO. They do not trust these HMOs. They know what they are going to do.\n  I sat in this Chamber and heard the debates where HMOs and insurance \ncompanies make life decisions for seniors time and again, and they come \ndown on the side of protecting their bottom line, protecting their \nprofit, rather than protecting the health of the seniors. The seniors \nknow this. When the Republicans come forward and say trust the HMOs, \nthey will take care of you on prescription drugs, they will bring the \nprices down, you know they are not going to mistreat you, seniors are \nskeptical, and they have a right to be.\n  Let me tell you, there is an alternative which I offered. Madam \nPresident, I say to my colleagues in the Senate, I hope they will take \na look at it for two reasons: No. 1, if this plan turns out to crater \nand bomb and the senior citizens across America say, What have you done \nto me; this is not what we were bargaining for, you will at least be \nable to say: I voted for an alternative. Sadly, it didn't make it. I \nhope it does, but if it does not make it, I voted for the right \nalternative that did not have the problems of S. 1. That is what \nMediSAVE offers.\n  For my colleagues in the Senate, unless you are sure you want to go \nto the bank on S. 1, that you want to walk into a senior citizens \nmeeting and try to explain this to your constituents who live in the \nState of Maine or the State of Florida or the State of Pennsylvania, \nthen for goodness' sake, think twice about a simpler, more honest, and \ndirect approach. Let me tell you what it is.\n  It has a guaranteed $35-a-month premium. S. 1 guarantees nothing. No \ndeductible and a payment by the Government of 70 percent of the drug \ncost; not 50 percent--70 percent. Does that sound overly generous? My \ncolleagues in the Senate, guess what. That is what we get. That is our \nbenefit in the Senate.\n  Is this lavish, luxurious, too much, over the top? I do not hear a \nlot of Senators complaining about it, nor Members of the House of \nRepresentatives. If it is good enough for my colleagues, is it not good \nenough for your mother? Is it not good enough for your grandmother? \nThat is what it boils down to. The Durbin amendment says we are going \nto give seniors across this Nation the same percentage break on \nprescription drugs that Members of Congress get.\n\n  Yesterday, by a vote of 93 to 3, we said that is fine. We all know \nwhat that is all about. There is this little process where the bill \npasses the House and passes the Senate, and then there is this mystery \ngathering called a conference committee, the waltz kings of the House \nand the Senate. They waltz nonchalantly into the committee room and \nclose the door. And out of that committee room in a day or a week or a \nmonth pops a bill twice this size that no one has read. They say: I am \nafraid we do not have time to read it; we have to get moving. We have \nto get back home. We will let our staff take a look at it.\n  Two weeks from now somebody will take a close look at it. They will \nvote and leave. How many times have we seen that happen?\n  After the waltz kings have gone into the conference committee and \ndone their work, I bet you dollars to donuts Mark Dayton's amendment, \nwhich said Members of Congress are bound by the same prescription drug \nbenefit as senior citizens in America, will be gone--out. We will be \nback at 70-percent reimbursement on our prescription drugs and say to \nseniors: You know, 20 percent is really all we can afford, and I hope \nyou understand.\n  The alternative is 70/30. If it is good enough for Members of \nCongress, it is good enough for your mom and your grandmother.\n  There is no coverage gap under the MediSAVE amendment, and there is \nno coverage gap under congressional health insurance, congressional \nprescription drug benefits.\n  We have an amendment offered by Senator Boxer, and I hope my \ncolleagues will think twice about this. To think that one could spend \n$4,500 in a year and then have their protection cut off for \nprescription drugs is something people just rationalize and say: Gosh, \nwe wish we had more money; we would make it work. Senator Boxer brings \nit to the real world. What if someone you love has been diagnosed with \ncancer? What if they are facing some of the most expensive drug \ntherapy--chemotherapy, radiation therapy--imaginable to save their \nlives and they are forking out dollar after dollar to get through this \nillness that could claim their life and you are praying for them every \nday and guess what. Come October, after they have been on this drug \ntherapy for 9 months, this prescription drug benefit under S. 1 \ndisappears.\n  What are you supposed to do? Fork it over out of pocket, if you can. \nIs that\n\n[[Page S8521]]\n\nan answer? MediSAVE, the alternative, says do not do that to people. \nCover them completely. Make this a real insurance policy, not a game \nwhere if you are too sick we are going to nail you.\n  It also says let's negotiate the drug prices. That is what this is \nall about.\n  If we do not deal with the expensive drug prices in America, this is \na fraud on the public. Think about it. We estimate over the next 10 \nyears that seniors will spend $1.8 trillion on drugs. How much do we \nprovide to help them--$400 billion. Do the math. It is less than 25 \npercent. But if we could bring down that cost from $1.8 trillion to a \nmore manageable figure, that $400 billion goes further.\n  The Veterans' Administration has shown they can do it for our \nveterans. They brought down the price of prescription drugs in veterans \nhospitals by 50 percent. We can do the same thing for Medicare \nrecipients if we care more about them than the profits of the drug \ncompanies. Trust me, the drug companies can bring those prices down and \nstill continue to be the most profitable businesses in America.\n  These companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year showing \npeople skipping through a field of wild flowers, saying, I no longer am \nsneezing; therefore, I need to have Claritin and Clarinex; and whatever \nthe next generation of Claritin is going to be, please go to your \ndoctor and beg for it.\n  They spend hundreds of millions of dollars on this marketing and then \nthey say they cannot cut the cost of their drugs because it will cut \ninto their research. Baloney. We know better. They spend more money on \nadvertising than they do on research for new drugs, and that tells the \nstory. They can bring down the cost of these drugs for seniors and \nfamilies across America and have plenty of money left over for profit \nand plenty of money for research.\n  We say under this MediSAVE amendment this competition will reduce \ncosts and make this drug benefit worth something to families and \nseniors across America.\n  I say to my friends, the last part of this is the most important \npart. Medicare will offer a drug benefit option. Those who stand back \nand say, Senator Durbin, you have gone too far; Medicare is going to \noffer a prescription drug option; I ask them to please look back at 40 \nyears of history and experience in America, where the Medicare Program \nhas worked with doctors and hospitals in every city and town in America \nto provide the very best medical care for seniors. At the beginning of \nthat debate, many people voted against it saying it was pure socialism, \nthat was not the market at work, and they were right. It is not the \nmarket at work. It is the Government of this country representing the \nfamilies of this country at work for them.\n  We believe the same should be true when it comes to prescription \ndrugs. Medicare should offer an option. Let the Medicare \nadministration, with no profit motive and low administrative overhead \nand the ability to bargain for a discounted formulary of drugs, compete \nwith these private insurance companies, which my friends on the \nRepublican side of the aisle insist are going to show the way in how to \nsave money for seniors. If it is true, they will be ready to compete \nand the seniors can make the choice, but under this bill they cannot. \nThere is no choice to be made.\n  Medicare does not offer a prescription drug option under this bill, \nand that tells the whole story.\n  The final point I will make to my colleagues is this: If they voted \nfor Senator Dayton's amendment yesterday, 93 to 3, saying Members of \nCongress are going to pay the same thing as seniors across America and \nmy colleagues think we are going to get by with knocking that out in \nconference and nonchalantly passing the bill and we get 70 percent \nreimbursement while seniors get 20 percent reimbursement, I am sorry, \nthe cat is out of the bag. The press corps and the American people are \nwatching every move. Do the right thing. Bring seniors up to the level \nof Members of Congress. Do it now. Vote for the MediSAVE amendment and \nthen my colleagues can go home and I think honestly say to seniors we \nhave given them a real prescription drug benefit.\n  The drug companies will not like it, the HMOs will not like it, but I \nguarantee that parents, grandparents, and seniors across this country \nare going to understand they finally have a benefit that was worth the \nwait.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield to the Senator from Florida for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I say to my colleague from Illinois, I think \nhe has analyzed this about as well as anyone I have heard. We made \npromises to the senior citizens of this country that they would have a \ndefined benefit that would cost a minimal amount with very little \ndeductible, with no huge gap in the coverage, that would be a part of \nMedicare and that whatever it was to cost----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Reserving the right to object, we have been waiting about \nan hour and a half to speak and all I can say is we have been waiting \nquite a long time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Two additional minutes, and I will ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senator be given 2 additional minutes for his patience.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I do not need any additional time. I just wanted to speak \nif I could.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Two minutes. Does the Senator object?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Okay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. So I compliment the Senator and ask him why, \nif that was the promise that was made to American seniors, are we not \nconsidering this as the major bill on the floor, the MediSAVE \namendment, instead of the package we have on the floor?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Florida. The answer is obvious: \nBecause the drug companies won the debate and the seniors lost it. The \ndrug companies have no pressure whatsoever to reduce prices. Secondly, \nan ideology that said the private side, the insurance companies and the \nHMOs, are the only answer to America's future in health care overcame \ncommon sense.\n  Common sense has shown seniors, and the Senator knows it better than \nanybody in this Chamber, when the HMOs get their hands on benefits like \nthis, seniors are going to lose out. That argument has won the day, and \nthat is what is in S. 1.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is No. 1077, authored by \nthe Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nlaid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1024\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I call up amendment No. 1024.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign], for himself and Mrs. \n     Lincoln, proposes an amendment numbered 1024.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to repeal the \n            medicare outpatient rehabilitation therapy caps)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title IV, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. OUTPATIENT THERAPY CAP REPEAL.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1833 of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395l) is amended by striking subsection (g).\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect on January 1, 2005.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, there is a cap on the amount of therapy \nthat can be given to seniors for physical therapy, occupational therapy \nand speech therapy, that is set to go into effect in July. There is a \n$1,590 cap that is set to go into effect. What we need to do is to \nrepeal that cap and we need to do it for very good reasons.\n\n[[Page S8522]]\n\n  First, the oldest and the sickest seniors will be in a situation \nwhere they have to pay 100 percent of the costs over the cap. MedPAC \nand independent analyses have found that one out of seven beneficiaries \nneeding such therapies will exceed the cap. This arbitrary limitation \nwould cause the greatest harm to the sickest and the most vulnerable of \nour beneficiaries. It would be those seniors who suffer from stroke, \nfrom Parkinson's disease or a similar condition that would likely \nexceed the therapy cap.\n  It would be the older, more vulnerable beneficiaries who will be most \naffected by this therapy cap. As beneficiaries continue to age and \nencounter multiple health problems, they are more likely to be the ones \nto exceed the cap. Unlike other requests for Medicare monies, this \nprovision is truly a provision for the beneficiaries. It is the \nbeneficiaries who will either bear the cost of the cap or not get care. \nIt is a beneficiary cap on services.\n  In 1999, as part of the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act, Congress \npassed a 2-year moratorium to prevent implementation of the caps. A \nyear later, Congress passed an extension of that moratorium for 1 more \nyear through 2002, and CMS has delayed implementation until July 1 of \nthis year. So we need to act.\n  From a personal story, several years ago my grandmother had a total \nknee replacement. I visited her in the hospital when she was going \nthrough rehabilitation. Anybody who has had a total knee replacement \nunderstands it is one of the most painful surgeries you can have, as \nwell as rehabilitation is painful. If the cap would have been in place \nat the time, she could have ended up being in a situation--at her \nincome level, if she was a senior who could not afford to pay \nadditional money--of not getting the care and rehabilitation needed for \nindependent living. She is about 85 years old and lives on her own \ntoday because of the physical therapy.\n\n  There are many other people we will institutionalize if we do not \nrepeal the cap. It is very important that truly needy seniors who are \nvery sick get the rehabilitation they need for the occupational \ntherapy, speech therapy, as well as physical therapy.\n  I urge our colleagues to look at this. I have talked to the chairman \nof the Finance Committee, and he is committed to making sure this cap \ndoes not go into effect this year. It truly would be harmful to many \nseniors in our population.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1073\n\n  Mr. SMITH. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment \nand call up amendment No. 1073.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Smith], for himself and Mr. \n     Feingold, and Ms. Cantwell, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1073.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To allow the Secretary to include in the definition of \n  special medicare choice plans for special needs beneficiaries plans \n     that disproportionately serve special needs or frail, elderly \n                             beneficiaries)\n\n       On page 379, strike lines 9 through 13, and insert:\n       ``(A) In general.--The term `specialized Medicare+Choice \n     plans for special needs beneficiaries' means a \n     Medicare+Choice plan that--\n       ``(i) exclusively serves special needs beneficiaries (as \n     defined in subparagraph (B)), or\n       ``(ii) to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by \n     the Secretary, disproportionately serves such special needs \n     beneficiaries, frail elderly medicare beneficiaries, or both.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. I come to the floor on behalf of myself and Senator \nFeingold and ask unanimous consent to add Senator Cantwell as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Senator Feingold and I have designed this amendment to \nhelp frail Medicare beneficiaries with special health care needs. This \nis truly one of those times when doing the compassionate thing is in \nharmony with what is cost-effective.\n  It is a fact that chronic illness is the highest cost, the fastest \ngrowing segment of health care. Seniors are disproportionately affected \nby multiple chronic conditions that require a wide array of services. \nMore than half of all seniors have two or more chronic conditions.\n  Further, one in five Medicare beneficiaries has five or more chronic \nhealth conditions. These seniors account for two thirds of total \nMedicare expenditures.\n  They also see, on average, 14 different physicians annually and fill \nan average of 50 prescriptions per year.\n  These seniors require routine monitoring, treatment and coordination \nof care among multiple providers to prevent or delay a decline in their \nhealth.\n  And yet traditional Medicare does not include a care coordination \nbenefit. However, a limited group of Medicare+Choice plans do.\n  ``Specialized Medicare + Choice plans'' focus on frail and \nchronically ill Medicare beneficiaries with special needs--such as \nnursing home residents, nursing home certifiable beneficiaries who live \nin the community, and low income seniors who are eligible for both \nMedicare and Medicaid.\n  These plans provide important services absent from original Medicare \nsuch as care coordination, disease management and supportive services.\n  The Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003 takes an \nimportant step toward providing a ``home'' for such plans to transition \ninto mainstream Medicare by creating a designation for ``Specialized \nMedicare Advantage Plans for Special Needs Beneficiaries.''\n  The amendment I am offering today would also allow the Secretary of \nHHS to permit plans that disproportionately serve special needs \nbeneficiaries to offer specialized Medicare Advantage plans.\n  For example, under my amendment, health plans serving a large number \nof seniors whose poor health places them at risk for entering nursing \nhomes could become a specialized Medicare+Choice provider. These are \nknown as social HMO's or SHMO's.\n  The Social HMO demonstration is an example of one such program that \nassists frail elderly with special needs but serves a mix of well and \nfrail seniors.\n  One of the four Social HMO demonstrations--Kaiser's Senior Advantage \nII--is in my home State of Oregon.\n  This program is extremely popular with the seniors it serves--those \nwith the most complex medical needs--while saving the state of Oregon \nmillions of dollars in Medicaid costs that would have been incurred had \nthese seniors required nursing home care.\n  I have several letters of support for my amendment, and I ask \nunanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                            Kaiser Permanente,\n\n                                      Portland, OR, June 24, 2003.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: I am writing to thank you for your \n     support of Kaiser Permanente's Social HMO Demonstration \n     program through an amendment to the Medicare Prescription \n     Drug and Reform Act of 2003. The underlying bill would \n     establish a special designation for newly anointed ``Medicare \n     Advantage'' plans that exclusively serve beneficiaries with \n     special needs such as nursing home residents and dually \n     eligible (Medicare/Medicaid) beneficiaries. Your amendment \n     would allow the Secretary also to designate as specialized \n     Medicare Advantage plans those that serve a disproportionate \n     share of special needs beneficiaries.\n       Kaiser's ``Social HMO demonstration, Senior Advantage II, \n     is an example of a specialized M+C plan that \n     disproportionately serves these types of beneficiaries, \n     including those that qualify for nursing home care but live \n     in the community. We currently serve, 4,400 Medicare \n     beneficiaries. Seniors with multiple chronic conditions, like \n     many of those served by Senior Advantage II, are at greater \n     than average risk of unnecessary hospitalizations, adverse \n     drug interactions related to multiple drug usage, and \n     contradictory information from different providers. Those \n     with five or more chronic diagnosed conditions also are more \n     than four times as likely to have functional limitations than \n     someone with only one condition. The average Senior Advantage \n     II members has 13 diagnoses. Like other specialty M+C plans, \n     Kaiser has developed a wide range of chronic care and \n     geriatric programs to efficiently respond to the health care \n     challenges of our special needs beneficiaries. About 30% of \n     our members are eligible for our Expanded Benefit package \n     that allows our frailest members, those who\n\n[[Page S8523]]\n\n     qualify for nursing home care, to remain independent and in \n     the community. In fact, over three-quarters of respondents to \n     a survey of Social HMO members indicated that the Expanded \n     Care services were ``important or very important'' in helping \n     them remain living at home.\n       Senior Advantage II has been making a difference in the \n     lives of our most vulnerable Oregonians for two decades. The \n     Kaiser Permanente SHMO also serves as model to integrate home \n     and community-based care into the rest of the local \n     organization and Kaiser nationwide. Your amendment would \n     allow the Secretary to establish a new population-based \n     designation for M+C plans like ours that recognizes their \n     commitment to targeting and serving special needs \n     beneficiaries.\n       Kaiser Permanente appreciates your continued support of our \n     efforts to develop more effective programs of geriatric care \n     and for your leadership on behalf of our nation's most \n     vulnerable seniors.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Eugene Scanzera,\n\n                                   Manager, Medicare Product Line,\n     Kaiser Permanente Northwest Region.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Medicare Payment Coalition for\n\n\n                                          Frail Beneficiaries,\n\n                                   Bloomington, MN, June 24, 2003.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: On behalf of the Medicare Payment \n     Coalition for Frail Beneficiaries, we offer our strong \n     support for your amendment to the Medicare Prescription Drug \n     and Reform Act of 2003. Your amendment would promote better \n     care for frail elderly and seniors with complex medical \n     conditions by establishing a special designation for certain \n     Medicare Advantage plans serving this high-risk group.\n       Beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions represent \n     the most needy and costly group in Medicare. Those with five \n     or more conditions see an average of 14 different physicians \n     annually and have about 37 office visits each year. This \n     segment of the Medicare population also is the most \n     expensive, costing Medicare about 14 times as much as for \n     beneficiaries who have only one chronic condition. To improve \n     health outcomes for this vulnerable group of seniors and \n     control Medicare costs over the long run, we need to \n     establish a special approach for addressing the complex and \n     ongoing nature of the problems faced by the highest-cost \n     population.\n       Currently, there are only a few Medicare+Choice programs \n     with the skill and expertise for serving special needs \n     beneficiaries. Most of these programs operate under \n     demonstration authority like Evercare, the Wisconsin \n     Partnership Program, the Minnesota Senior Health Options \n     Program and the Social HMO demonstration, although a few \n     private plans offer plans targeted toward special needs \n     beneficiaries. Care coordination, aggressive primary care \n     interventions and specialized geriatric interventions used by \n     these plans have led to improved outcomes and reduced use of \n     expensive services such as inpatient hospital and nursing \n     home care.\n       The Medicare Prescription Drug Act, as introduced, creates \n     a designation for ``specialized Medicare Advantage plans'' \n     for plans for exclusively serve special needs beneficiaries. \n     Your amendment enhances this important provision by allowing \n     the Secretary also to designate as specialized Medicare \n     Advantages plans those that disproportionately serve special \n     needs beneficiaries. This designation allows these plans to \n     be recognized for intentionally targeting for service frail, \n     chronically ill beneficiaries. This designation also could \n     offer the Secretary greater flexibility in the administration \n     of these plans. Historically, it has been difficult for \n     specialized plans to transition from demonstration status to \n     mainstream provider status because there is no mechanism for \n     doing so. This legislation provides an important first step \n     for this by establishing a population-based specialized plan \n     designation and enabling an approach to managed care that \n     simply cannot be implemented under traditional M+C \n     arrangements.\n       Congress is on the verge of enacting the most profound \n     changes to Medicare since its inception in 1965. Your \n     amendment provides a framework for enhancing Medicare's \n     responsive to our nation's most vulnerable and costly \n     seniors. I extend our sincere thanks for your leadership in \n     this important area.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Richard J. Bringewatt,\n                                                            Chair.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Keeping seniors out of nursing homes by managing their \nhealth better while saving money is a win-win situation. Despite this, \nthese specialized programs only exist in several States.\n  My amendment will further improve Medicare through the development of \nspecialized programs that manage the care of Medicare's most medically \ncomplex and expensive beneficiaries more effectively, leading to \nimproved quality of care and ultimately life for seniors with multiple \nconditions, while helping control Medicare costs.\n  It is not often that we see a proposal in the Senate that will \nsimultaneously improve quality of health care while saving the \ngovernment money, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. \nIt is compassionate and it is cost effective.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 994\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the Durbin \namendment. I wish to make a couple of points to my colleagues about it.\n  No. 1, this is not a $400 billion amendment. I have been informed \nthat the Congressional Budget Office scores this at $570 billion over \n10 years. It attempts in the legislation to limit the cost by limiting \nthe years--according to the Congressional Budget Office, effective in \nlimiting the cost. So we are talking about $170 billion over budget \nallocation. That would obviously add an increasing amount of money to \nthe unfunded liability and the Medicare Program.\n  One of the things we want to do, one of the reasons we were able to \nbring a bipartisan consensus, is to add a responsible benefit and focus \nthe money we are going to put forward on Medicare prescription drugs to \nthose who are the lowest income, the poorest of the poor.\n  We talked about that the other day; we talked about the assets test. \nOne of the keys to this legislation is the greatest subsidies go to the \nlowest income.\n  If we take those above the Medicaid eligibility already covered by a \nprescription drug plan, under the plan before the Senate now the \nsubsidy is 97.5 percent. So the Government picks up 97.5 percent of \ndrug costs and the beneficiary 2.5 percent. That is a fairly generous \nsubsidy for the poorest of the poor who are not otherwise covered. The \nvery poor, Medicaid, who are already covered, are people at 75 percent \nof poverty up to 100 percent of poverty--obviously poor. Those who are \nslightly above the poverty level get a 95 percent subsidy. So for every \n$1 they spend 95 cents is picked up by the Federal Government. That is \na very generous subsidy.\n  Some would argue--and I would be one--that we should have a generous \nsubsidy. We can argue whether it is 90 or 95 or 85 or 99, but it should \nbe a very high subsidy because these are very low income individuals \nwho do not have assets, do not have any other way to pay for their \nprescriptions, and they are truly deciding whether to buy food or to \ntake the medicine prescribed them. We do have a focus benefit on low-\nincome.\n  The Senator from Illinois focuses in on those who are higher, above \n160 percent of poverty, and says this program is inadequate for them. I \nmake the argument that there are many who have said that for higher \nincome individuals, given the fact that the vast majority of higher \nincome individuals already have prescription drug coverage, well over \n75 percent of people at 160 percent of poverty and above have existing \nprescription drug coverage, many provided through their employers, all \nof which are probably more generous than either this benefit or the one \nthe Senator from Illinois is offering.\n  So what we are doing--and this is a big concern on both sides of the \naisle--is our benefit plans are displacing private dollars with public \ndollars. The concern, at least on my part, and I think on others, is: \nIs that a wise thing to do? Should we be taking private plans and \nreplacing them with public dollars? In some cases, and I would argue in \nmost cases, under either formula--certainly under the one that is on \nthe floor right now--probably the benefits are not as generous.\n  So there is an issue as to whether we should be doing this at all for \nhigher incomes or whether we should have some sort of catastrophic \nbenefit or some other benefit for higher income. That is what Senator \nEnsign is going to be putting forward in his plan with Senator Hagel \nlater on.\n  But I think the overwhelming sentiment among the American people is, \nyes, we should have a prescription drug benefit for those who have \nlower incomes, who can't afford it, and those who are high users of \ndrugs because of chronic illness. But to spend a lot of additional tax \ndollars on higher income seniors, I think most Americans are saying \nthat is probably not a wise expenditure of funds, to go to $570 billion \nor more when just a couple of years ago--less than that, I think it was \na year ago--we were looking at $350 billion, or $300 billion. Now we \nare at $400\n\n[[Page S8524]]\n\nbillion. There is no end as to how much we would like to subsidize, I \nam sure, from some people's perspective--everybody over the age of 65 \nin the Medicare Program. But I think the responsible thing to do is \nwork within budget constraints and focus the resources on the poorest \nof the poor. That is what we have done.\n  The other criticism I have with this plan is it is a one-size-fits-\nall, Government-run plan. History has shown those are not necessarily \nthe most efficient, the most cost-effective, and best-run kinds of \nplans.\n  The Senator from Illinois says we have this gap. We may have a gap, \nwe may not, depending on how the insurer who bids on these plans \nstructures the plan. The only thing fixed in the plan on the floor now \nis the deductible is $275 for those people who are at 160 percent of \npoverty and above; the deductible is fixed at $275.\n  Also fixed is the catastrophic insurance. What does that mean? That \nmeans where the Government comes in and pays 90 percent of all the \ncosts of drug use. It comes in after the person has spent $3,700 out of \npocket. So the plan does not kick in--the design between that is \nflexible, but the plan cannot kick in until you have spent $275, and \nyour catastrophic benefit, that is where the Government comes in and \npays 90 percent of the cost above a level of expenditures, out-of-\npocket expenditures, which kicks in after you have spent $3,700. Beyond \nthat, the plan can be structured to have all sorts of designs to \nprovide prescription drug coverage.\n  The argument I would make is there are some people who would like \nsome designs, other people would like other designs, and we should let \npeople decide what plan fits their needs as opposed to a one-size-fits-\nall plan.\n  I see the Senator says there should be no deductible. I think most \npeople would argue, when you have ``no deductible'' plans, you have \nvery skewed utilization. In other words, you have people using this \nplan a lot more than if there were some constraint before you get your \nbenefit. When it comes to deductibles and copayments, they are very \neffective in getting people to think twice as to whether they want to \nconsume more because they have at least some stake in the consumption.\n  There is lots of evidence out there that suggests that people who do \nnot pay anything for their drugs tend not to--the best way to put it--I \nguess--value them as much as people who do pay something. That sort of \nmakes sense.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. In one second. That makes sense. If you are not paying \nanything for something, you value it less than if you had to pay even \n$2 or $5 or some sort of copay.\n  That is important psychologically because you have better \nutilization, you have a better track record of people properly taking \nsomething because they have an investment, personal investment in this \nparticular drug.\n  I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator if he would concede the point that both \nthe underlying bill, S. 1, as well as the MediSAVE amendment require a \npercentage payment of prescription drug bills for every dollar spent: \nThe underlying bill, 50 percent; the bill I proposed, 30 percent; even \nat catastrophic levels, 10 percent.\n  To say the individual is paying nothing overlooks the fact that there \nis a percentage requirement copay on every prescription drug for every \nsenior under both plans.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I see that you have a cost share of up to 70/30. I do \nnot have that. I was just looking at the summary you provided, so I \ndon't know whether there is no cost share for lower income or how the \ncost share works. All I know is it is up to 70/30. I do not know what \nthat necessarily means.\n  I see there is no deductible, so I was commenting on those two.\n  If there is a cost share throughout, that is a positive thing. Maybe \nwe would share the agreement there needs to be some sort of cost share, \nparticularly for those who are not at poverty level. If you are at \npoverty level, then the cost share should be minimal because you don't \nwant to use it as a great disincentive to the drugs prescribed to you. \nBut if you have some income, you should have some responsibilities for \nputting forth some money for these drugs. That is ground we share.\n  As the Senator from Illinois suggests, there is cost sharing under \nour plan. It is a little bit more than the Senator's. But the Senator's \nplan is more expensive, a lot more expensive than the plan we have \nhere.\n  The other problem I have is that it does not bring in any kind of \nprivate sector incentives, to try to reduce costs. One of the problems \nwith the Medicare system today is it is a top-down, Government-run, \none-size-fits-all plan, where the private sector, which administers \nthis plan--Medicare administers it, but they do it through \nintermediaries which are really private sector entities.\n  The private sector, in a sense, administers the Medicare plan. But \nthey are an intermediary. In other words, they are just folks who \ninterface with the beneficiary and collect money and pay bills and do \nwhat Medicare just doesn't have the capacity to do. The problem with \nthat is they do not have any risk in doing their job. In other words, \nall they do is a ministerial job. They get paid to provide a service as \nopposed to what we do in this plan, which is vitally important. We say \nto those who want to provide Medicare benefits, whether it is through \nthe stand-alone drug benefit we are providing or through the Medicare \nAdvantage Program, which is a PPO and HMO product which has the \nMedicare drug benefit integrated into the entire benefit which is \ninpatient and outpatient procedures, we want you to assume some of the \nrisk.\n  Why is that important? What do I mean by risk? Insurance risk. The \nrisk that if they do not manage the program well, they are going to \nlose money.\n  When that is done to insurance companies, they tend to behave \ndifferently, when they have no risk, if the plan is not run well. The \nrisk is if they really do a bad job, they could lose the contract, and \nthat happens on occasion. But there is no financial risk to them if \nthey are not managing this benefit correctly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Sure.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for yielding. This is getting \nperilously close to a debate, which hardly ever happens on the floor of \nthe Senate. I will gladly ask for time and yield to his questions so we \ncan have an honest-to-goodness Senate debate. It will be a historic \nday.\n  My question is this: Is it not true that, although the Medicare \nagency does not provide the services but works through intermediaries, \nthe Medicare agency attempts to control the costs by establishing what \nproviders can be reimbursed, what hospitals and doctors can be \nreimbursed, as much as we are suggesting here that the drug companies \nwould be told that they have to reduce costs for Medicare \nbeneficiaries? Isn't that an analogy?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator from Illinois is correct. The way we \ncontrol costs within the Medicare system is through price controls \ndictated by the Federal Government. There are a whole host of problems \nwe run into all the time with the uneconomic decisions, in many cases, \nby CMS--which is the agency that runs Medicare--in reimbursing for \nservices.\n  We have lots of places in this country where doctors will not provide \nservices to Medicare recipients because the reimbursement does not \nmatch what their costs are. We talked to lots of hospitals and they \nwill tell you, depending on the region--because it is different in \ndifferent regions--this is a very convoluted price control system. They \nwill tell you they are not getting the proper reimbursements for their \nservices and they cannot afford to provide those services, or if it was \nnot for private payers in certain regions of the country, these \nhospitals would be going under because of the reimbursement dictated, \nnot by the market, not by what beneficiaries value, but by what is \ndecided in Baltimore, MD, by a bunch of people sitting behind a desk \nwho have no idea of what it costs in Coudersport, PA, to provide OB/GYN \nservice, or gynecological services, in this case, because you don't \nhave a private-sector service for Medicare recipients.\n\n[[Page S8525]]\n\n  Nevertheless, the point is, you have an artificially imposed price \ncontrol from a very far-removed entity. And I think at least most \nMembers on this side of the aisle would like to see that change. We \nwould like to see the system better reflect what the marketplace will \nbear as private insurance dictates. It is a much more flexible, much \nmore dynamic system that takes into account what the beneficiary wants \nand what they value.\n  So I would argue that while I agree with the Senator from Illinois \nthat this plan mirrors very closely the traditional Medicare plan--I do \nnot disagree with him at all--I would argue the traditional Medicare \nplan is a command-and-control, top-down plan that does not work \nparticularly well.\n  One of the reasons we are here today is that it takes an act of \nCongress to add a benefit. It should not take an act of Congress to add \na benefit. We should have prescription drug coverage.\n  Had we had the Medicare Advantage Program in place 20 years ago, \neverybody in Medicare Advantage today would have a prescription drug \nbenefit. Everybody would have it. They would have the ability to offer \nthat benefit because they would be responding to what the consumer and \nthe beneficiary wants. Just like today, Medicare+Choice--which is a \nMedicare HMO that was established 5, 6 years ago--has prescription drug \nbenefits if you are in that program. Why? Because there are \nbeneficiaries who want that.\n  Madam President, I understand the chairman of the committee would \nlike the floor, so I will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Let me say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, this is \njust for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Then I will yield \nthe floor.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 6:30 the Senate \nproceed to a vote in relation to Durbin amendment No. 994, to be \nfollowed by a vote in relation to the Clinton amendment No. 1000, with \nno second-degree amendments in order to the amendments prior to the \nvotes, and with 2 minutes equally divided for debate prior to each vote \nafter the first; further, that following those votes, the Senator from \nIowa--me--be recognized to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, in relation to the time \nbetween now and 6:30, I ask my friend from Pennsylvania, how long do \nyou intend to speak?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I would be happy to divide the time \nbetween now and 6:30 equally between the two sides.\n  Mr. REID. I think that would be appropriate. I ask that the consent \nrequest of my friend from Iowa be modified to divide the time between \nnow and 6:30 equally between the majority and minority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Iowa accept the \nmodification?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. With the time controlled by Senator Durbin on our side.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. And the Senator from Pennsylvania on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, another concern I have--and it is not \na concern with the bill; it is just the marketing of the bill--is to \nsuggest that their plan will move forward immediately. One of the \ncomments made was that the plan before us does not take effect until \n2006, and their plan will take place as soon as possible.\n  Let me just suggest, we went to CMS, which is the organization within \nthe Government that runs Medicare, and other experts in the field and \nasked: When is the soonest possible we can have this drug benefit in \nplace? And they said: It would not be prudent to do so before 2006, to \npromise before 2006, because it is rather complicated to put together.\n  So the reason we put in 2006 is we want a backstop. The Durbin \namendment has no backstop. It just says: As soon as possible. Who knows \nhow long that will be? We have a backstop, focusing on getting this \nready for 2006, which I think is actually beneficial, and, at the same \ntime, it does not rush the process that potentially could do something \nthat would be imprudent and, potentially, ineffective in moving forward \na plan.\n  So I think 2006, given all the expertise we have in this town as to \nwhat would be the proper timeframe, is the right answer. It is a good \nbalance between making sure there is a date certain and that it is \nfairly quick and, at the same time, not too quick as to cause problems.\n  The other thing we do--and this is not mentioned in the marketing of \nthe MediSAVE amendment--we have a plan that does go into effect \nimmediately, unlike the Durbin amendment, which will probably be \nyears--at least a year or 2--before it goes into effect. And there \nwould be no coverage for anybody under that amendment.\n  We will have coverage immediately, starting within a few months, \naccording to CMS, again, the agency that runs Medicare. They \nanticipate, with the drug card--which accomplishes much of what the \nSenator from Illinois has suggested they want to accomplish, which is \nto get a group discount or volume discount through the Federal \nGovernment--we will do that immediately, not in a year or 2 years or 3 \nyears or however long the Durbin amendment would take, but it will do \nit immediately.\n  Within a couple of months, we will have out to every Medicare-\neligible beneficiary a discount card that can replace all the other \ndiscount cards that a lot of seniors already have. It will be a single \ndiscount card that will give a discount nationally where we will be \nable to negotiate with a variety of different pharmaceutical companies. \nSo it is an opportunity for us to use the volume discount to be able to \nreduce drug costs for seniors.\n  In addition to that, if you are lower income, you will receive up to \n$600 in money to help defray the cost of your prescriptions--not 2 \nyears from now, not 3 years from now, but immediately--really, a few \nmonths from now, hopefully as soon as the first of the year, or maybe \neven sooner than the first of the year. So it really does accomplish a \nlot of what the Durbin amendment attempts to do.\n  By the way, once we move into the full-blown plan in 2006, you are \ngoing to be contracting under the stand-alone benefit which goes with \nthe traditional fee-for-service Medicare system as well as Medicare \nAdvantage, which is the PPO and HMO options that will be available to \nseniors--none of that will be available, by the way, under the \nDurbin amendment--but what we will do is provide the opportunity for \nthem to negotiate these discounts with pharmaceutical companies because \nthey will be bidding in large regions, multi-State regions, with lots \nof people, lots of scrips that will be filled. So they will be able to \nuse their purchasing power to get a lot of these volume discounts.\n\n  Now, will they be as big as the Federal Government? No. But when you \nare looking at these kinds of volumes, there is only so much volume \ndiscount you can get. At some level you don't get any more discount. It \nsort of caps out. We think the prescription business will be big enough \nthat they will get substantial discounts and accomplish exactly what \nthe Senator from Illinois hopes to accomplish in his legislation.\n  It looks like the Senator from Illinois is ready to go, so I reserve \nthe remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  I say to the Senator, again, I am prepared, at any point, if the \nSenator would like to ask a question and debate, let's try it. Let's \nsee how the Senate works in real debate. But I really appreciate the \nSenator from Pennsylvania coming to the floor.\n\n  I say to the Senator, you were the first voice in opposition to this \namendment. I have been coming here day after day after day. I suspected \nthere was some opposition here--don't get me wrong--but I am glad the \nSenator came forward to speak his mind about this amendment.\n  And I congratulate you on your choice of words. Those who oppose an \namendment involving Medicare use words such as ``top-down,'' ``command-\nand-control,'' conjuring images of commissars, Bolshevik 7-year, 10-\nyear plans--this kind of mighty hand of government pressing down on the \npoor, the\n\n[[Page S8526]]\n\npoor peasant, the poor American citizen.\n  The sad reality is, the seniors of America don't agree with you. They \nlike Medicare. They even like it in Pennsylvania. Do you know what we \nfind when we say to seniors: ``We give you a choice. You don't have to \nstay in Medicare. You can go to a private HMO''? Eighty-nine percent of \nthem stay in Medicare--the ``top-down, command-and-control'' system.\n  Now, why do they stay there?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I say to the Senator from Illinois, I believe the \nnumber is 12 percent of Medicare beneficiaries participate in the \nMedicare+Choice Program. So it is 88 percent.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am sorry I said 89. I stand corrected.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator will yield further, I would also ask the \nSenator if he knows that Medicare+Choice is not available in most \ncommunities because they are only available in most urbanized areas.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will concede the point because I can remember so well \nwhen these Medicare HMO choice plans came rolling into Illinois and so \nmany other States and realized they couldn't make the money off seniors \nthey planned to and pulled the rug out from under them. They called my \noffice and they said: What happened to this Medicare HMO we were \nsupposed to turn to? We can't trust them. They are not there. We are \nsticking with Medicare.\n  So my point to the Senator from Pennsylvania is that we are dealing \nhere with a Medicare option which most seniors don't view as an ugly, \nreprehensible, big government option. They view it instead as something \nthey are comfortable with, that America for 40 years has lived with, \nand has been a dramatic success since the days when President Lyndon \nJohnson came forward and said: There is no reason, since your mother \nand father, once retired, now have a little Social Security check, why \nthey shouldn't have health care. So we are going to create Medicare. In \nthe 1960s, we did it. It worked.\n  What is the proof of its value and effectiveness? The fact that \nseniors are living longer. It is an indication to me that this \nGovernment-run Medicare Program has worked. It pains my friends from \nthe conservative side of the aisle to concede the fact that a \nGovernment program works, but Medicare does work. And because it has \nworked, seniors trust it. But my Republican friends didn't like it to \nstart with--at least their predecessors in the Senate--and they don't \ncare much for it today. So they are trying to find a way to move us \naway from this command-and-control, top-down program, and they have \ndecided they will use prescription drugs as their stalking horse for \nthe elimination of Medicare. That is a sad outcome.\n  Now they are even talking about $6 billion with which they are going \nto subsidize private insurance companies, a Federal subsidy to create \nan alternative to Medicare as part of this bill.\n  The goal for some--I won't ascribe this to the Senator from \nPennsylvania because I don't know if this is his own philosophy--is to \nget rid of Medicare. They believe it is outmoded and old-fashioned. I \ndo not. I believe Medicare offers something to seniors which the \nprivate sector cannot offer: A nonprofit, low-administrative-cost \nsystem which treats seniors the same from one edge of America to the \nother and basically says: We will try to keep costs under control \nbecause we speak for tens of millions of seniors.\n  The same approach can work effectively when it comes to prescription \ndrugs. The MediSAVE plan, which I offer with the support of major \nsenior citizen organizations and organized labor, says just that. If \nyou want a private insurance company to compete, God bless you, bring \nthem in. Give them their best opportunity. If they can beat the socks \noff Medicare in a region of the country, that is to the benefit of \nseniors. But for goodness' sake, why are those who are in favor of the \nprivate sector so afraid of Medicare as an option, the top-down, \ncommand-and-control, bureaucratic government? That happens to be what \nwe have lived with successfully for 40 years in America under the \nMedicare system.\n  Despite all the pejorative adjectives applied, seniors don't see it \nthat way. They trust Medicare. Some Senators may not trust it, but \nseniors trust it. We ought to trust them to make a choice. What is \nwrong with their making a choice?\n  Frankly, you have to be honest about this bill. There is no guarantee \nin here about a $35 monthly premium. Seniors could face a much larger \npremium, and they know it. There is no guarantee that the private HMO \ncompany offering prescription drugs is going to be around in 2 years. \nIt could be gone. And that infuriates seniors as well. They had the rug \npulled out from under them with the Medicare HMOs. They don't want the \nsame thing happening with prescription HMOs. That is why most of them \nare likely to gravitate toward the Medicare style plan. That is a \ndagger to the heart of styptic-hearted conservatives who want to see \nMedicare go away. But it is a fact.\n  Ask your seniors in Pennsylvania, in Illinois, even in Tennessee. \nThey will tell you they like Medicare: Please, don't give up on it. \nThat is why I think this alternative is so important.\n  Frankly, what we are saying to them is, we are going to have an issue \nwhich my friend from Pennsylvania has not addressed. We are going to \nhave an effort by Medicare and others to bring prescription drug costs \ndown. It has worked for the Veterans' Administration, and we have 25 \ntimes as many seniors under Medicare as we have veterans.\n  So let us give that bargaining power to Medicare and to the private \ninsurance companies. And who is going to win? The winners will be \nseniors and their families.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator from Illinois yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I want to ask you, first on the Medicare+Choice plan. \nYou say it has failed. Are you aware that the Senator from New York, \nMr. Schumer, offered an amendment today? I encourage you to read his \nstatement. He talked about how the Medicare+Choice plan has been \ndramatically underfunded. I have a letter here from July 12 of last \nyear signed by 11 Democrats, including Senators Clinton, Schumer, \nLieberman, Corzine, and Wyden, talking about how the Medicare fee-for-\nservice plan has grown by at least 10 percent, and yet the \nMedicare+Choice plan has been locked in by law and growing at only 2 \npercent. That is the reason a lot of the Medicare+Choice plans had to \nleave. Are you aware of all that information?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am not. I thank the Senator for bringing to it my \nattention. Let me make it clear: Some Medicare HMO choice plans are \ngood. Seniors want them, and they should have the option to turn to \nthem. In my State, though--I don't know if it happened in \nPennsylvania--some of these insurance plans came in and decided they \ncouldn't make enough money, and they cut and ran.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator will continue to yield, I would suggest \nyou look at the statement of the Senator from New York today. I ask \nunanimous consent that the letter to which I referred be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 2002.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Daschle: We are writing to express our \n     continued support for the Medicare+Choice (M+C) program. \n     Currently approximately 5 million Medicare beneficiaries are \n     enrolled in M+C plans across the country and many of them \n     live in the states we represent. For these seniors, M+C \n     represents a vital link to high quality, affordable health \n     coverage.\n       Unfortunately, a serious funding crisis is threatening the \n     Medicare+Choice option. Many participants live in areas where \n     funding for their M+C health benefits has increased by only \n     two or three percent annually since 1998 while health care \n     costs have risen by at least ten percent. These increases are \n     inadequate and they threaten the viability of the program in \n     most areas. We believe Congress should assign a high priority \n     to adequately funding the Medicare+Choice program.\n       We understand the difficult task you face in balancing so \n     many competing demands in the health care areas. However, we \n     believe that M+C plays an important role in the overall \n     soundness of the health care system, and we would like to see \n     it continue without disruption for the seniors we represent. \n     We hope you will consider our support for M+C as you work on \n     Medicare legislation this year.\n           Sincerely,\n         Joseph Lieberman, Jon Corzine, Barbara Boxer, Chris Dodd, \n           Max Cleland,\n\n[[Page S8527]]\n\n           Dianne Feinstein, Ron Wydem, Charles Schumer, ------, \n           Jean Carnahan, Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Take a look at this letter. It is very clear that the \nreason these plans left was that we set the growth rate for Medicare \nHMOs at one-fifth the growth rate of the traditional Medicare Program, \nand obviously they couldn't continue because health care costs \ncontinued to go up. Remember, they were the only ones providing \nprescription drugs. So while Medicare was going up 10 percent without \nprescription drugs, HMOs were going up probably 10 percent or more \nbecause they were offering prescription drugs. So they said: We just \ncan't continue, under this artificial ceiling, to continue. What we are \ntrying to do with this plan is to put that choice back to seniors.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reclaiming my time, you don't put it back in that \nsituation. You eliminate Medicare as a competitor to these private \ninsurance companies. The Medicare agency itself cannot offer this \nprescription drug plan other than through a private agency with which \nthey contract.\n  What I am saying to the Senator from Pennsylvania is: Take a look at \nthe Veterans' Administration. The Veterans' Administration is a good \nindication of what can happen when a Federal agency such as the \nVeterans' Administration wants to bring down costs; it bargains on \nbehalf of the people it represents and lowers prescription drug costs.\n  Under this bill, S. 1, as I understand it, you have to have two \nprivate insurance companies offering in a region or there is a Medicare \nfallback, which turns out to be a plan that they contract out to some \nprivate provider.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator from Illinois will yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Does your plan have the benefit actually administered \nby the CMS or do they, like the traditional Medicare plan, contract \nthrough an intermediary to provide the benefit?\n  Mr. DURBIN. This is a Medicare delivered benefit through the Medicare \nagency.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So there is no intermediary. The plan is actually run--\nunlike the current Medicare plan, it is going to be run by the Federal \nGovernment without an intermediary?\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will allow me to consult with the expert.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I guess the difference is, we don't divide it into 10 \nregions when it comes to Medicare.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. It is provided through an intermediary, which is the \nexact same delivery mechanism of the fallback plan in this bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The difference is this: The difference is negotiating \nlower costs for prescription drugs. And in this situation, it is my \nbelief that this underlying bill does not. The reason the Stabenow \namendment was defeated the other day, the reason there is opposition \nhere, is, once you put Medicare in the picture on a national basis, \nbargaining for lower prescription drug prices, you are more likely to \nsucceed and the drug companies are more likely to have to reduce their \ncosts.\n  I think that is why the pharmaceutical companies don't particularly \ncare for my approach and the reason many people have opposed it here. \nBut from where I am standing, if my interest is in the senior citizens \nof America having the lowest prescription drug prices and our giving a \nhelping hand as much as we can, rather than the bottom line profits of \nprescription drug companies, I think this is a much more advisable \napproach.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of amendment \nNo. 994 from my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin. The MediSAVE \namendment would provide a vastly superior Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit to our seniors. But I am also disheartened. This is not the \nbill we are debating. I wish it were.\n  The MediSAVE amendment meets all of the principles I laid out for a \nMedicare prescription drug plan. In an earlier statement, I outlined \nthe principles that I would use to grade any Medicare prescription drug \nplan. I think the MediSAVE plan gets an A. I commend Senator Durbin for \nhis hard work on this plan.\n  I have five principles for a prescription drug benefit.\n  1. The cornerstone must be Medicare. I am opposed to the \nprivatization of Medicare. Any prescription drug benefit that relies on \nthe private sector must be in addition to, not in lieu of, traditional \nMedicare. Seniors must not be forced to leave the Medicare system they \ntrust to get the prescription drugs they need.\n  2. Voluntary. No one should be coerced or forced into a private \nprogram or forced to give up coverage they currently have.\n  3. Affordable. The benefit must be affordable. That means a \nreasonable premium and copayment.\n  4. Universal and portable. The benefits must be available to all \nseniors, regardless of where they live. And all seniors must have the \nsame benefit, and be able to take it anywhere they go.\n  5. Meaningful. The benefit must cover the drugs your doctor says you \nneed--not what an insurance executive thinks you should get.\n  How would the MediSAVE plan benefit seniors?\n  MediSAVE would create a more meaningful benefit. It would have no \ndeductible for drug coverage. It would have a guaranteed premium of $35 \nper month. Rather than having to pay 50 percent of their drug costs \ncovered, under this plan seniors would have to pay 30 percent of those \ncosts. That adds up to a big savings for seniors, many of whom live on \na fixed income. MediSAVE would also take into account the amounts that \nemployers contribute toward retirees' drug costs which will help \nmillions of seniors keep the employer-sponsored health care they \nearned. But most importantly, MediSAVE would deliver the prescription \ndrug benefit through the Medicare that seniors trust.\n  I believe the Durbin amendment is a great improvement over the bill \nwe are debating. I urge all my colleagues in supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I join several of my colleagues to \nurge Members of the Senate to vote in strong support of the ``Medicare \nSavings Alternative that's Voluntary and Equitable,'' or MediSAVE \namendment. I thank Senator Durbin for working hard to create an \namendment which will make this Medicare prescription drug package a \nmeaningful benefit for seniors across this country.\n  I have been troubled over the course of this debate on many fronts. \nThere are numerous holes in S. 1 that many of my colleagues have tried \nto fill. Many of my colleagues have offered targeted amendments to \naddress this bill's specific flaws. So far, we have tried to put some \nreasonable limitations on the premium levels that can be charged to \nbeneficiaries. We have tried to eliminate the coverage gap that will \nhit seniors hard in the fall of 2006. We have tried to extend the \nfallback period to two years to provide more stability to seniors \nliving in areas where managed care is just not likely to work. We have \nattempted to ensure that the 37 percent of employers that are estimated \nto drop their retiree coverage would not do so. And all of these \nattempts have been unfruitful, due to the resistance of Members on the \nother side of the aisle.\n  We have tried to make this a better bill, and while we have had \nsuccess on a few cost containment amendments, we have come up short on \nmany of these other critically important provisions. Seniors in my home \nState will be scratching their heads in 2006, wondering where their \naffordable, comprehensive Medicare prescription drug benefit is. This \nis why I am a cosponsor and supporter of the MediSAVE amendment. This \namendment will provide seniors with a real benefit, one that allows \nseniors to get their drug coverage through traditional Medicare, not \nforcing them into plans to get it. It has no deductibles, limited cost \nsharing and no coverage gap. It addresses a blatant omission in this \nbill to deal with the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs in the \nU.S. It allows the Federal Government to utilize its bargaining power \nto purchase prescription drugs at reasonable prices, rather than \nproviding a blank check to drug manufacturers as is planned under the \ncurrent bill.\n  Let's try and make this the best bill possible. This amendment may \nrequire us to allot some additional funds down the road, but aren't our \nseniors worth\n\n[[Page S8528]]\n\nit? Isn't the security of average seniors, those who have worked hard \nall their lives to make this country what it is today equally, if not \nmore important than big tax cuts for the elite? I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important amendment today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. A couple of points, Mr. President. The Senator from \nIllinois said people prefer having the Government run this program and \nadminister this program. I know the Senator doesn't like top-down \ncommand and control, but it is what it is. It is a one-size-fits-all \nGovernment benefit.\n  A survey was just done a few days ago that said voters trust private \nplans over Government to provide health benefits by a margin of 54 to \n34, when it comes to providing medical and pharmaceutical benefits. So \nthe American people are used to dealing with private sector entities \nwhen it comes to health insurance, and they are very comfortable to \nhave them provide services. And, in fact, arguably even the Medicare \nsystem that the Senator from Illinois has put forward is going to be \nrun--the drug benefit is going to be administered by a private sector \nentity. It will be a company that will be contracting through a \nMedicare agency to provide these services. The difference is--this is \nthe real key difference between what we want to do and what the Senator \nfrom Illinois wants to do, one of them--that we want to have these \nprivate sector entities that we were contracting with to bear some of \nthe risk of insurance.\n  Again, I repeat that the importance of having these private sector \nentities bear some of the risk of insurance is, if they are bearing the \nrisk, and if they don't administer this program effectively, it is \ngoing to cost them money. So they are going to probably do a little \nbetter job of administering that program than if they are simply being \npaid a fee to write checks or collect fees. So we believe having a \nshared risk with the private sector and the public sector getting \ntogether to use the best of the private sector, which is to be able to \nhave good beneficiary relationships and to go out and try to solicit--\nremember, if you are a private sector contractor, you have competition. \nYou have to treat your beneficiaries well or they can go to the other \nplayer. Your ability to sign up beneficiaries will be diminished if you \nare not providing quality services.\n  Under the Senator's plan, there is one administrator, no incentive to \nsave money, no incentive to be customer friendly. It doesn't matter \nbecause they have no place else to go. You can take it or leave it. If \nyou have competition and you allow people to go somewhere else, they \nhave an obligation not only to be better at providing services but they \nhave an obligation, if they want to keep these beneficiaries in their \nprogram, to provide good services, quality services, to be responsive--\nnot be open, as a lot of these organizations are, from 8:30 to 4:30, \nand if you have a problem, you have to call on Monday morning.\n  A lot of these ministerial organizations, again, have no risk \ninvolved. The beneficiary has no place else to go. They have no \nincentive to save money. So why not just basically save money on their \nside, cut back on what it costs to administer this program, and get \npaid the same fee. They can save a little money that way, and they have \nno chance of losing anybody.\n  I think having some incentive to provide quality services and to try \nto save money because they have some stake in it is a very important \ncomponent of delivering better services for the consumer and a better \nproduct for the taxpayer. We keep coming back to this, and we seem to \noverlook it.\n  Millions of Americans are paying their hard-earned tax dollars for \nthis benefit. We have an obligation to make sure the money is \neffectively spent. I think we have an obligation to put into place \nsystems that are more efficient than the current system--more efficient \nnot from the standpoint of how much it costs the Government in \nadministrative costs. That is one of the things I hear, that this is \nmuch more administratively effective than it is for these other private \nplans. Well, if all you do is pay bills, and you don't worry about how \nmuch is being used, you don't worry about the quality or about anything \nelse, all you are doing is writing checks in Baltimore or writing \nchecks to companies like Blue Cross plans who are the intermediary, \nthen it is pretty cheap. But if what you are doing is trying to \ncoordinate care to try to make sure that quality is imbued through the \nsystem, if you are trying to actually provide a quality service, it is \nprobably going to cost a little bit more. I think most people believe \nthat is a good tradeoff, plus you have the competitive angle, which I \nargue could actually save money.\n  So while I respect the Senator from Illinois and the fact that he has \nput forth his amendment, it is, in fact, a straight extension virtually \nof the traditional Medicare delivery services. It is not $400 billion; \nit is $570 billion. It is $170 billion more than what we all have \nagreed upon in the budget to provide for a prescription drug benefit.\n  The American public has been very clear about this. Yes, they want \nprescription drug benefits for seniors, but they want those benefits \nfocused on those who are lower income, who cannot afford it, and those \nwho are high users of prescription drugs because of disease or chronic \nillness. So what we have done in this bill is to do that. They also \nwant a fiscally responsible alternative. They want a fiscally \nresponsible plan. In fact, in surveys over the past several years, they \nwere asked a simple question: Are you for a $400 billion Medicare \nprescription drug plan or are you for an $800 billion Medicare \nprescription drug plan? Overwhelmingly, believe it or not, they are for \na $400 million plan. The American public realizes there is not just an \nendless pot of money that is going to be available to provide benefits \nfor anybody, and they want something fiscally responsible.\n  There are many on this side of the aisle who would argue that what we \nhave even in the underlying bill is not fiscally responsible; it is too \nmuch money, too much of a subsidy to too many people. But we brought \nthis bill forward to find a bipartisan compromise. Part of that was to \nmake sure there is--and there is--a $389 billion drug benefit in this \nbill. There is a few billion dollars to help these PPOs get set up and \norganized--literally, I think, seven. So there is 380-some-billion-\ndollars for the drug benefit, which is one objective we want to \naccomplish.\n  The other objective this side of the aisle would particularly like to \nsee is to have choices for seniors--the private-public partnership \nwhich we believe are so important to improve quality and efficiency for \nthe taxpayer. We are spending only $7 billion on that. That is a paltry \nsum compared to this big expansion of the drug benefit. We think that \nis important. The Senator from Illinois would disagree with that. It is \na very different point of view.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I say to my friend, thank you for \nexpressing your point of view. You are the first person to speak on it \nin opposition. I hope you don't carry the day, but you might.\n  It is interesting that some are fiscal conservatives and deficit \nhawks when it comes to prescription drug benefits, but where were these \nvoices during the tax cut debate? We were sunsetting tax cuts right and \nleft, creating the biggest deficit in the history of the United States, \nand I didn't hear a word from the deficit hawks.\n  When it comes to helping senior citizens paying for drugs, we have to \nbe responsible. This amendment is responsible. It is sunsetted. We have \na report from CBO which says that. The $570 billion does not take into \naccount the fact that this is sunsetted in 2010. It works within the \n$400 billion.\n  The second issue raised here is that there are people--and I think my \nfriend from Pennsylvania is perilously close to this coalition--who \ndon't care much for Medicare. They don't think it is a very good \nprogram. Well, the vote is in on Medicare, and it is 88 to 12. Eighty-\neight percent of the people who had a chance to move out of Medicare \ndidn't do it. They stayed. I hope you will vote for the MediSAVE \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There are 2 minutes evenly divided before the \nnext vote.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. This amendment is critical to the functioning of the \nplan now under consideration. If we are going to move toward creating a \nmarketplace for drugs, then we need information about which drugs work \nbetter for the money they cost. Last December, we found out through a \nstudy by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute that the newer \ndrugs such as calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors which cost 30 \nto 40 percent more than diuretics were not as effective for treating \nhigh blood pressure. There is much information about this.\n  My amendment is very simple. It asks NIH to do studies comparing \ndrugs to give that information to physicians and to consumers so they \ncan make good decisions in the marketplace. It also asks that we \nsynthesize the literature out there, make it available over the \nInternet. If we are going to have a marketplace for drugs, the \ninformation about which drugs are more effective should not be the sole \nproperty of the great companies. Physicians, clinicians, consumers, and \npatients need that information. This will help us do that.\n  I hope you will support this amendment. It does not have any cost \nattached to it. It is about getting information to the people who will \nmake the decisions about which drugs should be used when it comes to \nmaking these choices we are trying to provide for people.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to amendment No. 1000, \noffered by Senator Clinton. This amendment would give the Federal \nGovernment new funding to manage comparative effectiveness studies of \npharmaceuticals. While this may sound good on the surface, this \namendment would end up as a tool for health care rationing by \nbureaucrats in Washington.\n  Comparative effectiveness analysis in the private sector can provide \nuseful information. However, giving the Federal Government the power to \nmake national determinations based on one or two comparative studies is \ndangerous, because these decisions would affect tens of millions of \npatients who rely on the Government for their health insurance.\n  This amendment would get the Federal Government even further into the \nbusiness of making medical decisions. It would promote one-size-fits-\nall medicine.\n  Studies conducted under this amendment may be misused by the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services or other bureaucracies by \nencouraging broad and simplistic decisions about which patients should \nhave access to new medicines.\n  Even worse, these comparative effectiveness studies might become a \nrigid benchmark adopted by payers across the health care system. \nPrivate insurers already look to Medicare for decisions on medical \nprocedures and technologies, and doctors are already concerned about \nthe way Medicare conducts those determinations.\n  Private insurers copy many of Medicare's limitations on the \nprocedures and therapies from which physicians choose in determining \nthe best course of treatment for their senior patients. If we extend \nthis level of bureaucratic control to drugs and biotechnology, the \nGovernment's decisions about medical access would end up being imposed \non many more patients than just Medicare beneficiaries.\n  In considering this amendment, we need to keep in mind that \ninnovations in health care are usually incremental. This applies to \ndrug developments, where ``next-generation'' advances yield incremental \nbenefits compared to existing treatments.\n  Government studies on comparative effectiveness may fail to recognize \nor value fully these advances. If we had a Medicare drug benefit in \nplace today that only paid for so-called ``breakthroughs'' in \npharmaceuticals, we may not have reaped the benefits of many \nantibiotics, antivirial drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, \nand ``beta blockers'' for controlling high blood pressure.\n  Finally, centralized comparative analysis runs the risk of \noverlooking the value of specific medicines for individual patients. \nPrescription medicines to treat a specific disease or condition are \ndifferent from one another. That is why patients and doctors need \nchoice.\n  Population-based comparative effectiveness determinations such as \nthose proposed in this amendment may fail to recognize important \ndifferences in the way individuals and sub-populations respond to \ndifferent drugs and drug combinations. As a result, such studies can \ndiscourage access to new\n\n[[Page S8530]]\n\nmedicines that can benefit many patients with diseases and conditions \nsuch as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease and mental illness.\n  Comparative effectiveness studies are not dangerous, and we ought to \nencourage more and better studies on the relative merits of various \ndrugs for various people. What concerns me is how this amendment would \nput the Government in control of these studies.\n  If one branch of the Government is conducting these broad studies, \nand another branch of the Government is paying for the drugs that your \nloved one needs, it is just a matter of time before the results of the \nbroad studies are imposed upon the freedom that your family doctor has \nto choose the best drug therapy for your loved one.\n  Coming from Wyoming, I am used to fighting against one-size-fits-all \nsolutions from the Federal Government. I certainly cannot support an \namendment that would impose such an approach on something as important \nas healthcare for seniors who rely on pharmaceuticals to make their \nlives better.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I appreciate the intent of the \namendment. However, I have significant concerns and must oppose it. The \nresearch provided by this amendment is unnecessary. It duplicates, in \nfact, existing authority in the HHS.\n  More importantly, this amendment contains two damaging provisions. It \ndirects the Food and Drug Administration to include information coming \nfrom these studies in approved product labeling, effectively taking the \nsole authority of the FDA to regulate prescription drug labeling and \ngiving it to other, nonexpert sources.\n  This amendment also changes the fundamental research mission of the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n  Further, these changes have not been considered by the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which has jurisdiction over \nthese programs.\n  This amendment is unnecessary. I urge my colleagues to defeat it.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I believe there is a unanimous consent \nrequest that the next amendment be the Grassley-Baucus amendment. I \nthink they are working on that. I ask unanimous consent to make a \nstatement on the bill for not to exceed 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first I want to make a couple comments on \nthe bill, then talk about a couple amendments we will be working on. I \nwish to compliment first Senator Frist and Senator Grassley, Senator \nBaucus for getting us here. I also compliment President Bush because he \nhas been pushing for us to expand Medicare to include prescription \ndrugs. I happen to share that goal so I compliment him because here we \nare.\n  I believe in the next 24, maybe 28 hours, we will eventually pass a \nMedicare bill that will provide prescription drugs. That is our \nobjective. That is a good one. I hope we will be successful.\n  I also hope we will pass a bill that is affordable. I am not sure the \nbill before us now meets that definition. I want to talk about what is \nin the bill and maybe some of the challenges we have confronting us, \nbut again I want to compliment the chairman of the Finance Committee.\n  This year we did have a markup in the committee, and we did report \nout a bill. I didn't vote for it. I will explain why I didn't vote for \nit. But I hope to vote for a bill either on the floor of the Senate or \nas the bill comes out of conference.\n  At least we had a markup. I am on the Finance Committee. The \nDemocrats were in control of the Senate last year. We didn't have a \nmarkup in the Finance Committee. We basically had a markup on the floor \nof the Senate. We spent some time on it, several weeks, but we didn't \npass a bill. It didn't become law. It was very frustrating. We didn't \ndo the normal process.\n  This year I don't quite agree with the final outcome as it came out \nof committee, but at least we had a chance. We had a bill. We had a \nmarkup. We considered dozens of amendments. We reported out a bill.\n  Now, the Senate has been on this bill for 2 weeks. We have considered \na lot of amendments. We will consider more both tonight and tomorrow. \nSo my compliments to the leader and to the chairman of the committee \nfor getting the bill to where we are.\n  Let me talk a little bit about the current status of Medicare. \nMedicare has big challenges confronting it today. It is a very popular \nprogram, but it is a program that really can and could and should be \nimproved. It is a very expensive program. The cost of Medicare has more \nthan doubled since 1990. In 1990 we were spending $100 billion. Today \nwe are spending over $200 billion. But that doesn't show the \nliabilities that we already have in the system.\n  Medicare has a shortfall of $13.3 trillion. By ``shortfall'' I mean \nbenefits that have been promised that are not funded, not paid for. \nThat is an enormous sum of unfunded liability. The total unfunded \nliability of Social Security is $4.6 trillion. The total debt held by \nthe public is $3.6 trillion. So we are looking at Medicare's shortfall \nactually exceeding or tripling the total amount of debt held by the \npublic.\n  I heard many colleagues, when we talked about raising the debt limit, \nsay we should not do this. What we are doing on Medicare and the bills \nwe are considering right now will increase the unfunded liability in \nMedicare probably by $4 or $5 or $6 trillion, greater than the total \nSocial Security shortfall and far greater than the debt held by the \npublic. This is an enormous expansion of benefits we are saying we will \npay for. People need to know it.\n  Is it affordable? Just to pay for the Medicare shortfall today \naccording to the 2004 budget of the U.S. Government it says to pay the \nactuarial deficiency as a percent of discounted payroll tax base--we \nwould have to increase Medicare taxes 5.3 percent on top of the 2.9 we \nare already paying just to pay for\n\n[[Page S8531]]\n\nthis $13.3 trillion. We would have to more than double the tax. \nActually, it would be, in effect, almost tripling the Medicare tax \nwhich is presently 2.9 percent on all payroll, not just on the Social \nSecurity base of $80,000-some. This is on all payroll. You would have \nto increase it an additional 5.23 percent, according to Government \nsubmissions and budget submissions, to cover the 75-year projections.\n  Social Security would only have to be raised 1.87 percent. So, again, \nit shows that at least actuarially, Medicare is in much worse shape, \nabout three times worse shape as Social Security. And that is without \nus passing additional benefits on top of it. So I want my colleagues to \nbe aware of that. This is a very unstable house, and we are getting \nready to build another deck on top of it. That is the reason I am \nraising some of these concerns.\n  I want our colleagues to be aware. Maybe we will do it anyway. Maybe \nit is the popular thing to do. But at least I don't want it to go \nwithout saying: Wait a minute, did anybody not pay attention to the \nfact that these are enormous liabilities. They are going to be very \nexpensive and somebody is going to have to pay the bill sometime. In \nthe past, we paid for Medicare with the payroll tax. That has had some \nlimiting effect. When trust funds were drawn down, people said: We have \nto do something. So there would either be a tax increase or there might \nbe some reforms.\n  We passed Medicare reforms in 1997. We spent a lot of the last few \nyears maybe undoing some of those reforms, but it did save money. Now \nwe are getting ready to expand Medicare at a greater percentage than it \nhas ever been expanded since its creation in 1965.\n  Again, I favor making significant improvements in Medicare. I find \nthe system to be very obsolete in the benefits it provides. It has \nserious shortfalls. Medicare doesn't provide prescription drugs. It \nshould. Medicare doesn't have preventive care, ordinary, routine \ncheckups in many areas. It should. A good health plan certainly would \ndo that.\n  It has a hospital deductible of $840. That is way too high. Then it \nhas a different deductible for doctors. They should be a combined \ndeductible, and it should be much lower than $800 and $900 combined.\n  It is a system that leaves a lot to be desired. It doesn't have \ncatastrophic coverage. So if a person gets really sick and they are in \nthe hospital for a long time, after a certain number of days Medicare \ndoesn't pay it. That doesn't make sense. You really should have \ninsurance to pay for something you can't afford to pay for, and this \nsystem doesn't do that.\n  As a matter of fact, a lot of our health care system, in my opinion, \nis broken because we end up insuring for relatively almost first-dollar \ncosts, and we don't insure in some cases for the really expensive \nthings or at least that is the way Medicare is. That is not a good \nexample. We should change that. You should insure for those events that \nyou can't afford. You shouldn't be insuring for ordinary, routine \nthings that obviously individuals can pay for.\n  I make the analogy to automobiles. You should insure for the \naccidents, the collisions, for something very serious, something very \nexpensive. You should not insure to fill the car up with gasoline or to \nchange the oil.\n  In health care costs, I am afraid we insure for almost everything, \nand that greatly increases the cost. My major complaint with the bill \nbefore us is that I want to improve and expand and modernize Medicare. \nI want to improve Medicare. My mother is on Medicare. I want her to \nhave a better health care system. I want her to have a health care \nsystem that is comparable to what we have for Federal employees. I \nwould like for senior citizens to have a good base plan and then be \nable to choose any of a variety of other plans they wish to have--keep \nwhat they want or they can choose something better. They can have an \nintegrated benefit system.\n  Unfortunately, I am not sure that is what we are going to pass \nprobably tomorrow night. The bill we have before us--the reason I voted \nagainst it in Finance Committee, and I may vote against it on the floor \nof the Senate, is because I find the bill very expensive and very light \non reforms. It doesn't make as many reforms as I would like and it is \nexpensive on the subjects. I have mentioned we would have to increase \npayroll taxes by 5.23 percent just to make up for the shortfall. That \ndoesn't include the drug benefit. I have been told by tax estimators \nthat you would have to add another .7 or .8 percent to pay for the drug \nbenefit we are adding.\n  I am concerned that the drug benefit we are adding will be much more \nexpensive than anybody estimates. The budget resolution says it was \n$400 billion. I compliment the chairman and the House, who are staying \nwith the $400 billion estimate, but I would project that many years \nfrom now, it will not be a $400 billion expansion; it will be much \ncloser to $800 billion by the end of 10 years.\n  I am making this prediction and I mean it. This is not just a guess. \nMaybe it is a little more than a guess, but I think ultimately you will \nsee a few things happen, and I will talk about the basic benefit we are \noffering and why I think the cost will exceed our estimates.\n  In the first place, the subsidies are very large indeed. For people \nbelow 160 percent of poverty, the Federal Government is going to pay \nalmost all the drug expense. For individuals in this income category, \nas estimated by CMS--they estimate usage--drug usage is $3,200 for \npeople below poverty, and then a little less than $3,000 for \nincremental levels above that. But the beneficiaries at the lower \nincome levels pay very little. The Government pays almost all of it. I \nhave heard some people say, wait a minute, you want to change that. I \nam questioning, is this affordable? For income levels in this category, \nthe lowest income, the poorest of our seniors, an individual would pay \n$82 and the Federal Government would pay $3,214. An individual pays 2 \npercent and the Federal Government pays 97\\1/2\\ percent. That is a very \nhigh ratio.\n  The next level is not much different. The individual would pay 5 \npercent and the Federal Government pays 95 percent. The next level up--\nand this is with an income up to about 150 percent of poverty. For a \ncouple, the income is about $19,576. So the Federal Government would \npay 90 percent and the individual would pay 10 percent. Those are very \ngenerous subsidies.\n  Looking at the estimate, I would guess that if the Federal Government \nis going to pay 97 or 95 or 90 percent, you will have drug utilization \ngo up maybe well beyond these figures.\n  These figures come from CMS, and they say those are figures for \npeople with insurance, but I would guess the people who are on this \nlevel--Medicaid eligibles, and many States have a lot of restrictions \non the number of prescription drugs they can have. In many States you \nare limited to three a month. If the Government is paying 97\\1/2\\ \npercent, and there is not a limitation of three or so many a month and \nit doesn't have the limitations of the States because the States are \nrequiring cost sharing of 30, 40, or 50 percent, my guess is it will go \nup dramatically.\n  I think in all levels utilization will go up dramatically. Maybe I am \nwrong. I am concerned about it at least for these lower income levels, \nthe income levels below 160 percent of poverty. The bill we have before \nus is probably too generous, but maybe not affordable. I hope I am \nproven wrong. But I have been in business. I took over management of a \ncompany when the company had a health care plan where the company paid \n100 percent of health care premiums and costs. That really wasn't \nsustainable. I think a lot of other businesses found out, wait a \nminute, that is not affordable. Most businesses started putting in 80/\n20 ratios, where the beneficiary paid 20 percent, or 10 percent. I \ndon't mind lower income people having to pay a smaller copay; I am fine \nwith that. But I think we are starting out so generous that it will \nencourage overutilization, and costs will explode. Once you start out \nwith a percentage like that, it is hard--I can see starting at 80 \npercent and maybe going to 90, but I don't see going from 97 percent to \n90 percent. A future Congress may be forced to make those decisions. It \nmay not be affordable or sustainable. The demands may be so great that \nit is not sustainable.\n  Is this a good deal for seniors? Certainly, people on the low end, \nbelow the 100 percent of poverty level, with an income of $9,600 and, \nfor a couple,\n\n[[Page S8532]]\n\n$13,000, the copay is $82 and they will receive almost $3,300. Under \npresent law, according to CMS, they pay $734. So the amount they pay \ngoes down almost 80-some-odd percent. This is a great deal for low-\nincome if we can afford it. The next level would pay $150. Currently, \nthey are paying almost $1,200. Again, they are only paying about one-\neighth of what they were paying previously and getting a very nice \nreturn. This is 136 to 150 percent of poverty--that would be for \nindividuals with incomes, and for a couple it would be up to $19,500. \nThey would pay only $343. Presently, they are paying $1,300. So it is a \nbig improvement for them, and they are receiving about $3,000 in \nbenefits.\n  So there is a very good and generous benefit--maybe the most generous \nbenefit anybody could propose is for incomes below 160 percent of \npoverty. Above that, it is not such a good benefit. I have heard some \ncolleagues complain it is not so good for individuals with incomes \nabove 100 percent of poverty, with incomes of about $15,400 or, for a \ncouple, of about $21,000. Above that level, the formula changes. Then \nthey have to pay a premium of $35 a month. Then they have a deductible \nof $275 a month. Then they receive a drug benefit after they get \nthrough the deductible of 50 percent up to $4,500. Then above $4,500, \nfor the next $1,300, they would have to pay 100 percent. Above that \nlevel, they get 90 percent.\n  Well, that is not a great drug benefit. It is not great. It is OK, \nmaybe, but it is not as good as a lot of plans. Looking at a lot of \nplans people now have, at levels like this, an individual for this plan \ntoday would be paying, under the new bill, $1,600. The individual today \nis only paying about $1,162. They would pay about an extra $500 for \nmaybe a similar benefit, and it is estimated they would receive a total \nof about $3,000. Actually, if you look at the upper income--above \n$21,000 for a couple--in every category they pay more under the \nproposal we have before us than they are under current law. So it is \nnot a real good deal for them. It is voluntary. Maybe they will drop \nout. If they drop out--it depends on the health status, but if they are \nhealthy, it may make things worse for the taxpayers. They may not help \nsubsidize others who are less healthy. It is a very generous benefit \nfor lower income, below 160 percent of poverty, and it is not such a \ngood deal for upper income.\n\n  A lot of people above 160 percent of poverty have drug coverage. A \nlot of people below that have health care. Below 160 percent, you \ncannot beat this deal. Above it, you can beat it. A lot of people have \nbetter. You say what do you mean? They might have a union plan. We had \namendments to make sure those were made whole. We wanted to subsidize \nthem to make sure they didn't lose a dollar. The CBO estimated that 37 \npercent of the people who have private health care coverage are going \nto drop them and go into this Government plan. They have health care \nthrough their employer, and their employer is going to say if Uncle Sam \nis going to do this, why don't you get your health care and drug \nbenefits through Uncle Sam instead of through the employer.\n  A lot of employers are struggling to pay for retirees' health care \nbenefits, so they would welcome this. So you will see a lot of \ncompanies dumping or dropping their health care coverage, even though \nit may well be more generous than what we have proposed before us, the \nbill before us in the Senate. Likewise, many States have drug programs, \nmany of which may be more generous, not necessarily for low-income, but \nthey have a plan, or some system, or other type of entity that we will \nbe picking up. States were making a contribution, maybe it is a \ncombination of State and Federal, to Medicaid. They are dropping it. \nWhere the States were making a contribution in the past, we will be \nassuming that contribution. This is a big federalization, frankly, of \nthe benefit that is provided in the public sector and private sector.\n\n  Seventy-seven percent of seniors today have some type of drug \ninsurance. This is going to preempt most of that and say the Federal \nGovernment is going to take it over and, in some cases, not do as good \nas the private sector has done, maybe not even as good as most of the \npublic sector.\n  Is it affordable? The estimates are it is $400 billion. I already \nmentioned I am concerned, at least on the levels where the Federal \nGovernment subsidies are 97 percent or 95 percent or 90 percent, that \nutilization will exceed expectations. If the Government is going to pay \nmost of the cost of the drugs, my guess is people are going to say: \nGive me more of those drugs.\n  There is not a restriction that is going to say you can go to one \ndoctor, go to this specialist for whatever ails you, you can go to \nanother specialist for whatever ails you, and, frankly, if the \nGovernment is going to be picking up 95 percent of the drug care costs, \npeople are going to say: Give me some of those. They are going to see \nthe ads on TV. They may see Celebrex--it has a great rhyme to it--or \nsee some other ad that looks good, and they say: Doctor, give me some \nof that. And if Uncle Sam is going to be paying 97 percent of the cost, \nwhy not? That makes your patient happy. Maybe it will work, maybe it \nwill not.\n  My guess is we are going to see, where the third party or Government \nis paying 90-some-percent of drug care costs, that utilization will \nsoar and that will greatly drive up the cost.\n  I think in the drug benefit formula where we have basically a formula \nabove 160 percent of poverty where the Government says you pay your $35 \na month and you pay your deductible of $275 and then Government will \nmatch you 50 percent up to the first $4,500, a lot of people who might \nhave a drug annual expense in the neighborhood of $1,200 or $1,300 may \nsay: I do not get my money back until I use or consume $1,300 worth of \ndrugs, and I am paying a monthly premium; therefore, I am going to \nstart taking advantage of it. If Uncle Sam is going to be paying 50 \npercent, I want more. So their utilization may go up and may go up \ndramatically. So that could increase costs.\n  Then we have this so-called doughnut amounts above $4,500 to where \npresently individuals would have to consume or pay for 100 percent up \nto $5,813. A lot of people are going to say we need to fill that up.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, they are going to say we get 50 percent \nup to $4,500, and then it stops and we go to catastrophic, let's fill \nthat in. The estimates were by some, if you filled that in, it would \ncost you another $200 billion. My guess is we are not going to do it \nthis year, but we will do it sometime probably in the next 3 or 4 \nyears. That will cost a bunch of money.\n  Then people are going to be complaining: This is really not a good \ndeal. You get 90-percent subsidy over here but 50-percent subsidy over \nhere. We need to make that 60, 70 percent. Frankly, that 60 percent is \nnot high enough. Let's move that category up to 200 percent of poverty. \nLet's move it up higher.\n  When you make those kinds of incremental changes, and I know many of \nthe advocates want to do that--they stated that. I acknowledge it, and \neverybody around here should acknowledge that is their desire--I expect \nthey will be successful.\n  There are a lot of people who will say this is not near as good a \ndeal as I have right now, and they are going to lobby Congress: We need \na greater share; we need a greater match. Why not go 50/50? Can't we go \n60/40, 80/20? Can't we fill in the donut and insure that whole amount?\n  When you make a few of those changes, you have a bill that is not \ngoing to cost $400 billion, it is going to cost $800 billion. In that \nlast year, the line will be going straight up. I am concerned about \nthat situation. I am concerned about the expense of it.\n  People say: What do we do to make it more affordable? Did we make \nsome of the changes that would help make it more affordable? Did we \nmake some of the reforms, some of which are not easy?\n  I have been an advocate for increasing the eligibility age, making \nMedicare the same age as recipients of Social Security. Right now with \nSocial Security, you do not receive Social Security at age 65, you \nreceive full retirement Social Security at 65 and 10 months. By the \nyear 2022, you have to be 67 to receive Social Security.\n\n[[Page S8533]]\n\n  I happen to think because people are living a lot longer and because \nMedicare has such enormous financial problems, we should make the \nMedicare-eligibility age concurrent with Social Security. Basically, by \nthe year 2022, one would have to be 67 before receiving Medicare. I \nknow that is not an easy vote, but, frankly, this Senate voted for it \njust a few years ago. We voted for it, I believe, with 62 votes. We \npassed it. We can, could, and should pass it again. It will save our \nkids a lot of Medicare taxes. That is one reform. I doubt we are going \nto offer that amendment, but it has been proposed and discussed, and I \nthink it should be seriously considered.\n  Another amendment will be offered by Senator Feinstein, myself, and \nSenator Chafee tomorrow that basically means testing Part B premiums. I \nwill talk about Part B premiums, and it gets too confusing for a lot of \npeople. We subsidize Medicare. Most people think we pay for Medicare \njust with the payroll tax.\n  The payroll tax, I already mentioned, is very deficient. As a matter \nof fact, it is 2.9 percent of all income, not capped. If somebody has \nan income of $1 million a year--Michael Jordan, I think, makes a little \nmore than that--if they make an income of $1 million, they pay $29,000 \na year into Medicare. Yet we are still going broke. The actuaries say \nwe have to add another 5.2 percent on top. We have to have 8.1 percent \nto pay for the liabilities we currently have. That is without a drug \nbenefit. If we add a drug benefit, we would probably need to add 1 \npercent on top of that.\n\n  Now we are talking about real money; we are talking about 8 or 9 \npercent of the liabilities in Medicare. We need to make reforms. One \nwould be to means test Part B premiums. Payroll tax pays a lot of \nmoney, but general revenue pays a lot of money into Medicare.\n  To give an example, this year general revenue, not the payroll tax, \ngeneral revenue coming from all taxpayers in the year 2003 will put in \nabout $81 billion. In the year 2013, it will be $189 billion. So it \nmore than doubles in the next 10 years, and it does not keep up.\n  That general revenue portion is the individual recipient pays one-\nfourth of Part B. This is what pays the doctors. The recipient pays \none-fourth of it, and the taxpayer or the general revenue fund pays \nthree-fourths of it. What that means is we are asking our kids to pay \nfor three-fourths of our doctors visits.\n  At least for those with upper incomes we should not be asking our \nkids, who are maybe making $20,000 or $15,000 or $30,000, to be paying \npart of the doctor bills for at least the wealthier seniors. Not all \nseniors are low income. So the amendment we will be considering \nprobably tomorrow evening says instead of having a 25-percent copay for \nbeneficiaries on Part B, if your income is very high, it will be 50 \npercent; if it is much higher, it will be 100 percent.\n  I believe the levels are if an individual has an income of $75,000 \nand $100,000 for a couple, their percentage would increase from 25 \npercent to 50 percent. Likewise, for a couple, if an individual had an \nincome of $100,000 or the couple had an income of $200,000, they would \nhave to pay 100 percent of the premium. So we would not be subsidizing \nthem. That would take a lot of pressure off the system.\n  The most recent trustee report states that SMI, that is Part B \nrevenues, in 2002 were equivalent to about 7.8 percent of personal \nFederal income tax collected that year. If such taxes remain at their \ncurrent level relative to the national economy, then Part B general \nrevenue financing in the year 2077, 75 years from now, would represent \nroughly 32 percent of total income taxes. Now, that is staggering. \nAbout a third of all income taxes would have to be paid just to pay the \nPart B subsidies that we now have in the system. That is not \nsustainable.\n  My point is, we have to have a Medicare system that provides better \nbenefits. Yes, I agree. We also have to have a Medicare system that is \nsustainable for future generations, for our kids and grandkids. We want \nto have a system they can afford.\n  I mention these as two reforms, and there is one other one I am going \nto mention. The primary reform that is in the underlying bill provides \nfor a private sector health care plan--most of the time we call it a \nPPO, preferred provider organization--similar to many of the health \ncare plans that are all across America providing an integrated \nstructural benefit. They do not just provide drugs. They provide all \nhealth care benefits. They provide the hospital and the doctor, access \nto specialists and drugs. That is what is in most people's health care \nplans today.\n  That is not Medicare. We would like to update and upgrade Medicare to \nbring it into the 21st century so it has comparable benefits, so it can \nhave an integrated management system, so that individuals who are in \nthe system say, yes, they control your drugs and they control your \nvisit to the hospital and the specialist, and you have really good \nquality care.\n  We do not have that in Medicare today. The real reform and what many \nof us are hoping we can do is improve Medicare so people can have \npreventive health care, so they can have more screenings, catastrophic, \nand prescription drugs all as one part of a package like Federal \nemployees, like other health care, like a lot of the union plans that \nare out there today. We do not have that in Medicare today. So we are \ntrying to make that a viable alternative to the present system.\n  So if some individual wants to stay in the present system, they can, \nbut if they would like to choose a better, more modern system, more \nintegrated system, they can do that.\n  I very much hope to see that the PPO model will actually become a \nreality that is a real viable alternative. CBO estimates that in the \nunderlying bill only 2 percent would participate in the new PPOs. That \nis a failure. CMS, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid, estimates it \nmight be as high as 42 or 43 percent. I would like for that to be the \ncase. I think that may be overly optimistic.\n  I think we need to work to improve this section of the bill. I know \nthat Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus have an amendment to maybe \nmake a small step in that direction, and I compliment them for it. For \nthe life of me, I think if this is the only reform in the bill that we \nhave, and we do not even have competitive bidding until the year 2009, \nthat is not real reform.\n  I hope to be or expect to be a conferee on this bill, and I am going \nto work to try and see that we have real competition as a viable \nalternative to improve quality Medicare for all seniors. They should at \nleast have that option. I do not see it in the bill we have right now, \nbut I want to work to make that happen. That is one key we are hanging \non for reform in the bill that is before us. We do not have Part B \nmeans testing. We do not have eligibility age. We did not make the \ntough decisions to help save Medicare and make it more affordable for \nfuture generations. What we are doing is basically spending a lot of \ngeneral revenue money to provide benefits that frankly are long \noverdue.\n\n  I hope we would make some of these improvements in conference or \nmaybe on the floor. We are going to try and make one or two of these \ntomorrow, and I hope that they would pass to make this a better bill.\n  I want to support this package. I want to pass Medicare. I want to \nimprove Medicare for all seniors. I am afraid right now the bill is \nheavy on subsidies and short on reform, short on improvements, short on \nmaking real structural and substantial savings that will save the \nsystem for future generations. I want to save it for seniors today, and \nI want to save it for future generations tomorrow.\n  I will work with my colleagues both in the House and the Senate and \nthe conference to try to achieve that objective.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I begin by complimenting the \ndistinguished Senator from Oklahoma for his remarks and his very \nimportant contribution to this debate. He is one of the most \nknowledgeable members of our conference on this subject. I thank him \nfor the fine work he has been doing on this important bill.\n  Of course, Chairman Grassley and the ranking member, Senator Baucus, \nhave been doggedly pursuing this important legislation, not to mention \nour leader, the majority leader, the only physician in the Senate. He \nhas had this as a top priority for the last 4 or\n\n[[Page S8534]]\n\n5 years, really for all of his term in the Senate. These individuals, \nalong with Senator Kyl and Senator Lott, have made an important \ncontribution in getting this legislation to the stage that we find it \ntoday.\n  For almost 40 years, since Medicare was created, we have debated how \nto help our most frail citizens acquire the miraculous but expensive \nprescription drugs that they need. After all the talking for decades, \ntoday we are finally acting to provide to our seniors, the poor and the \nfragile of our society, the financial aid and means to acquire these \nwonder drugs.\n  As we move deeper into this debate to provide Medicare assistance to \nthose citizens most likely to need these miracle drugs but least able \nto afford them, some will ask, what took us so long? The question is \nreally not rhetorical. The reason it has taken so long is the same \nreason why I suggest today that this Medicare debate has not been easy, \nnor do I believe it is preordained that a quality Medicare prescription \ndrug and reform bill will pass this body.\n  The reason we have difficult work to do is because there is a riddle \nto Medicare drug benefits. The riddle of Medicare drug benefits is \nthis: How can Congress take the fastest growing Federal entitlement, \nwith the largest long-term funding gap, and add an expensive but needed \nnew benefit without overwhelming the fiscal solvency of the program or \nimposing a crushing payroll tax burden? Simply put, how can we add \nprescription drugs to Medicare today yet still preserve Medicare \ntomorrow?\n  Yes, it is possible, and the President has solved the riddle of \nMedicare. To understand how, we can look to another riddle from ancient \nGreek mythology. Legend holds that the ancient city of Thebes suffered \nfrom a creature called a sphinx: part woman, part lion, and part bird. \nThis creature would devour any who failed to solve the riddle of the \nsphinx.\n  The riddle asked: What animal walks in the morning on four feet, in \nthe afternoon on two feet, and in the evening on three feet? The answer \nis, of course, man, said the legendary Oedipus. In childhood, he creeps \non his hands and knees; in manhood, he walks upright; and in old age, \nhe walks with the aid of a cane.\n  Oedipus first considered man in all stages of life, but only by \nconsidering the common cane did Oedipus find the answer. Thus, he \nsolved the riddle, destroyed the sphinx, and ended his people's \nsuffering.\n  I suggest a similar approach to the riddle of Medicare. We must \nconsider Medicare as it relates to our people in all stages of life--\nyes, as seniors, but also as working adults and as children. The key is \nto consider the common cane, the ageless symbol of age, the cane. When \nthe Government buys this quad cane through Medicare, it pays $44 for \nthis cane. When the Government buys the same cane through the Veterans \nAffairs Department, it pays $15. Let's run that by us one more time. \nTwo different departments of the Government: Medicare buys the cane and \npays $44. Veterans Affairs buys the cane and pays $15. The same cane, \nsame Government, same patient but different Government program--$44 \nversus $15.\n  Solve this and we solve the riddle of Medicare. Solve this and \nMedicare prescription drugs will not come at the expense of Medicare \npreservation.\n  The General Accounting Office has documented how Medicare habitually \noverpays compared not just to what the private sector pays for medical \ngoods but what other parts of the Government pay for medical goods. \nMedicare pays $12 for a catheter that most Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Plans pay only $1. Medicare pays $9 for an infection drainage \nbag while Blue Cross/Blue Shield typically pays $2.25. Yet overpaying \nis only part of the problem. Fraud and abuse costs Medicare as much as \n$12 billion per year. Over 10 years that would equal almost one-third \nof the $400 billion we dedicate to Medicare in this bill we are \nconsidering.\n\n  Paperwork and redtape also waste Medicare dollars. With 110,000 pages \nof regulations, hospitals hire literally armies of clerks to handle \neverything but medical care. Some doctors are forced to spend as much \ntime on Medicare patients' paperwork as they do caring for the Medicare \npatient.\n  Medicare's regulatory burden is so great that the world-renowned Mayo \nClinic requested not to be named Medicare Center for Excellence because \nthe paperwork and redtape linked to such a distinction exceeded the \nbenefit of any additional funds, as well as the honor itself.\n  These are the aspects of Medicare that so many want to change yet so \nmany seem to ignore.\n  If we provide these drugs without fixing how we continuously overpay \nfor this cane, we will fail to fix Medicare. Medicare prescription \ndrugs for our parents will come as Medicare preservation for our \nchildren. There is an answer to the riddle. In a word, it is reform. \nThat is what the President's plan is all about and the key to the work \nwe began earlier this week: Provide prescription drugs for our parents \nand ensure preservation for our children.\n  The President has sent us the right plan at the right price. It will \nstrengthen and modernize the entire Medicare system.\n  As we continue to work on this modified version of the President's \nplan we must keep in mind that while the President likes what we have \ndone so far, he wants us to do more. That is a good goal for all. This \nis not a political game. This is for real. This is not about the next \nelection; it is about the next generation. This is not just about \nprescription drugs; this is also about preservation.\n  Yes, this is about our parents and grandparents, but this is also \nabout our children and grandchildren. If we keep in mind all of our \npeople and all that is at stake, I am confident we will produce a bill \nwe can all be proud of and that the President can sign. That challenge \ncontinues today.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 991\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, last week, I believe it was Friday, a \nnumber of amendments were laid down, one of them being an amendment \nthat I offered. It is cosponsored by Senator Smith of Oregon. It has \nbeen sitting there all week. I have not had much of a chance to say \nanything about it.\n  I thought, since there is a lull on the floor, I might take an \nopportunity to talk about that amendment and what it does, just so, \nwhen it comes up for a vote, I will not have to take a lot of time then \nto talk about it.\n  The amendment, I would say at the outset, is exactly the same as \nPresident Bush requested in his 2004 budget but for one small change. \nPresident Bush's budget requested $350 million a year for 5 years, \nunder Medicaid, to get people with disabilities out of institutions and \nnursing homes and into community living.\n  The problem is that the cost of this to the States is very high for \nthe first year. You can understand and appreciate, taking people out of \nan institution, out of a nursing home, means the State has to find \nhousing; it has to find, perhaps, qualified personnel to help, maybe \nattendant services. So there are a lot of preliminary things a State \nhas to do in order to provide for this transition from an institution \nto community-based living. Many States simply cannot afford it.\n  The good news is that States want to do this because it has been \nshown, in the States that have done this already, they save a lot of \nmoney. It is much cheaper to have a person with a disability in a \ncommunity-based or home-based setting than in an institution or a \nnursing home--much cheaper. In fact, in a couple or three States that \nhave already done this, we have had savings of over $40 million or $50 \nmillion a year to those States.\n\n  Again, the hurdle is that first year, getting people out of these \ninstitutions and into community-based living. What the President had \nrequested in his budget was $350 million over 5 years as an enticement \nto States to do this. What the Federal Government would do is it would \nprovide 100 percent of the funds per Medicaid beneficiary for that \nfirst year. After the first year, then the State would go back to the \nFederal/\n\n[[Page S8535]]\n\nState Medicaid match that the State had before. So, let's say a State \nhad a 60/40 Federal/State match on Medicaid right now. During the first \nyear, the State would have to come up with no money; the Federal \nGovernment would take 100 percent, would provide 100 percent. The State \ncould use that money, then, that extra money, to set up community-based \nliving systems for people and institutions and nursing homes. After \nthat first year, then the State would go back to the 60/40 split it had \nbefore.\n  That is what this amendment is. It is called ``Money Follows The \nPerson,'' and that is what President Bush called it in his proposed \nbudget also.\n  What our amendment would do would be to provide, in the 5-year \nprogram, $300 million in the first year and then $350 million in each \nof the following 4 years. Then that would be the end of it. It would be \n2004 to 2008.\n  Again, it has been 13 years since the Americans With Disabilities Act \nwas passed. We will celebrate that on July 26 this year. In the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act, we as a Congress, as a country, said \nno to segregation of people with disabilities. The Americans With \nDisabilities Act said: We are going to integrate people with \ndisabilities into our society. No longer are we going to exclude and \nsegregate them. However, our Medicaid Program today, 13 years later, \nstill says yes to segregation.\n  Here is what I mean by that. Recent data indicates that 70 percent of \nMedicaid funds are spent on institutional care and only 30 percent to \npay for community services. The thrust of our Medicaid spending today \nis for institution-based care. Our Medicaid system kind of flies in the \nface of the Americans With Disabilities Act in which we as a country \ncommitted ourselves to desegregate people with disabilities, fully \nintegrating them in our society.\n  I have been trying for the last 10 years to get this change made. It \nis a bipartisan effort. I am not the first to do this. Others have \ntried it also. I do commend President Bush for putting it in his budget \nproposal for this year. It is the right thing to do, and I commend the \nPresident for doing that.\n\n  Now, again, I want to make it clear, this amendment is about choice. \nNo one will be moved out of an institution who does not choose to be \nmoved. This is not mandatory. Under this amendment, a State will be \nrequired to ensure that individuals and their representatives have the \nnecessary information to make an informed choice as to whether they \nwant to live in community-based situations or whether they would prefer \nto remain in an institution.\n  Now, again, regarding the offset, our amendment is fully offset by a \nMedicare secondary payer provision that is supported by the Department \nof Justice and was included in the House bill.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter, dated June 17, from William E. \nMoschella, Assistant Attorney General. It is to the chairman of the \nHouse Committee on Energy and Commerce, Congressman Tauzin. The letter \nstates:\n\n       This is to advise you of the Department's support for a \n     provision in the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization \n     Act--\n\n  Which we are about now--\n\n     set forth in Title III, Section 301, which would protect the \n     integrity of the Medicare Trustee Fund by clarifying that \n     Medicare must be reimbursed whenever another insurer's \n     responsibility to pay has been established. The Section is \n     consistent with the litigation positions taken by this \n     Department and the Department of Health and Human Services in \n     numerous court cases.\n\n  So the Department of Justice, speaking for the administration, is in \nfavor of this offset.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter from William E. Moschella, Assistant Attorney General.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Legislative \n           Affairs, Office of the Assistant Attorney General.\n                                    Washington, DC, June 17, 2003.\n     Hon. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, U.S. House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This is to advise you of the \n     Department's support for a provision in the Medicare \n     Prescription Drug and Modernization Act, set forth in Title \n     III, Section 301, which would protect the integrity of the \n     Medicare Trust Fund by clarifying that Medicare must be \n     reimbursed whenever another insurer's responsibility to pay \n     has been established. The Section is consistent with the \n     litigation positions taken by this Department and the \n     Department of Health and Human Services (``HHS'') in numerous \n     court cases.\n       Congress enacted the Medicare Secondary Payer (``MSP'') \n     statute in 1980 to protect the fiscal integrity of the \n     Medicare program by making Medicare a secondary, rather than \n     a primary, payer of health benefits. To ensure that Medicare \n     would be secondary, Congress precluded it from making payment \n     when a primary plan has already made payment or can \n     reasonably be expected to pay promptly. Congress recognized, \n     however, that in contested cases, payments under such plans \n     would be delayed. To protect providers, suppliers, and \n     beneficiaries, Congress authorized Medicare to make a \n     ``conditional'' payment when prompt resolution of a claim \n     cannot reasonably be expected. The Medicare Trust Fund must \n     be reimbursed, however, once the primary insurer's obligation \n     to pay is demonstrated.\n       Some recent court decisions have held, however, that \n     Medicare has no right to reimbursement unless the primary \n     insurer could reasonably have been expected to make prompt \n     payment at the outset. See, e.g., Thompson v. Goetzmann, 315 \n     F.3d 457 (5th Cir. 2002). These rulings make the statute's \n     reimbursement mechanism inoperative in some jurisdictions. \n     Section 301 of this legislation would end this costly \n     litigation and provide clear legislative guidance regarding \n     Medicare's status as a secondary payer of health benefits. \n     The technical changes in Section 301 make clear that Medicare \n     may make a conditional payment when the primary plan has not \n     made or is not reasonably expected to make prompt payment.\n       The technical amendments of Section 301 clarify other \n     provisions of the MSP statute, as well. They make clear that \n     a primary plan may not extinguish its obligations under the \n     MSP statute by paying the wrong party (i.e., by paying the \n     Medicare beneficiary or the provider instead of reimbursing \n     the Medicare Trust Fund. The Section clarifies that a primary \n     plan's responsibility to make payment with respect to the \n     same item or service paid for by Medicare may be \n     demonstrated, among other ways, by a judgment, or a payment \n     conditioned upon the recipient's compromise, waiver or \n     release of items or services included in the claim against \n     the primary plan or its insurer; no finding or admission of \n     liability is required. In addition, Section 301 makes clear \n     that an entity will be deemed to have a ``self-insured plan'' \n     if it carries its own risk, in whole or in part. Finally, the \n     Section makes clear that the Medicare program may seek \n     reimbursement from a primary plan, from any or all of the \n     entities responsible for or required to make payment under a \n     primary plan, and additionally from any entity that has \n     received payment from the proceeds of a primary plan's \n     payment. These provisions of Section 301 will resolve \n     contentious litigation and are designed to protect the fiscal \n     integrity of the Medicare program.\n       We hope that this information is helpful. The Office of \n     Management and Budget has advised that there is no objection \n     to this report from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program. Please let us know if we may be of additional \n     assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             William E. Moschella,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. So again, we have an amendment that is exactly what the \nPresident had in his 2004 budget request. We have an offset supported \nalso by the administration. So this is truly a bipartisan effort.\n  This amendment Senator Smith and I have offered is widely supported \nby older Americans and people with disabilities. AARP, the Consortium \nof Citizens with Disabilities, ADAPT, the National Council on \nIndependent Living, the National Council on the Aging, and the National \nAssociation of Area Agencies on Aging all support this amendment.\n  Both parts of this amendment--the Money Follows Program and the \noffsets--are about fairness and justice. If this amendment is adopted, \nprivate insurers will pay their fair share of Medicare costs and people \nwith disabilities will have the opportunity to live in their own \ncommunities.\n  I will just talk about a constituent of mine, Ken Kendall. Ken was \ninjured in an accident and has a serious spinal cord injury. When he \nlost his health insurance, he was forced to go on Medicaid, and his \nonly choice was a nursing home almost 2 hours from his friends and \nfamily.\n  Ken recently wrote to me that he went to dinner and a movie for his \n30th birthday. No big deal, except he had not been to dinner and a \nmovie in the 2 years since he went into a nursing home. He said: ``I \nwas almost in tears. I felt like I had a real life again.''\n  This amendment would give people like Ken a real life again, and not \njust on their birthdays. Individuals with\n\n[[Page S8536]]\n\ndisabilities should not have to continue waiting to enjoy the \nopportunities all other Americans take for granted.\n  So again, that is the essence of the amendment.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 991, As Modified\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be modified \nwith the modification I send to the desk. This is a modification to \namendment No. 991.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 991), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n               TITLE __--MEDICAID DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS\n\n     SEC. __01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Money Follows the Person \n     Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In his budget for fiscal year 2004, President George W. \n     Bush proposes a ``Money Follows the Person'' rebalancing \n     initiative under the medicaid program to help States \n     rebalance their long-term services support systems more \n     evenly between institutional and community-based services.\n       (2) The President, by proposing this initiative, and \n     Congress, recognize that States have not fully developed the \n     systems needed to create a more equitable balance between \n     institutional and community-based services spending under the \n     medicaid program.\n       (3) While a few States have been successful at achieving \n     this balance, nationally, approximately 70 percent of the \n     medicaid funding spent for long-term services is devoted to \n     nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for the \n     mentally retarded. Only 30 percent of such funding is spent \n     for community-based services.\n       (4) As a result, there are often long waiting lists for \n     community-based services and supports.\n       (5) In the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, \n     Congress found that individuals with disabilities continue to \n     encounter various forms of discrimination, including \n     segregation, and that discrimination persists in such \n     critical areas as institutionalization.\n       (6) In 1999, the Supreme Court held in Olmstead v. LC (527 \n     U.S. 581 (1999)) that needless institutionalization is \n     discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n     1990, noting that institutional placement of people who can \n     be served in the community ``perpetuates unwarranted \n     assumptions that persons so isolated are unworthy of \n     participating in community life.'' (Id. at 600). The Court \n     further found that ``confinement in an institution severely \n     diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals, \n     including family relations, social contacts, work options, \n     economic independence, educational advancement, and cultural \n     enrichment.'' (Id. at 601).\n       (7) Additional resources would be helpful for assisting \n     States in rebalancing their long-term services support system \n     and complying with the Olmstead decision.\n\n     SEC. __03. AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT MEDICAID DEMONSTRATION \n                   PROJECTS.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Community-based services and supports.--The term \n     ``community-based services and supports'' means, with respect \n     to a State, any items or services that are an allowable \n     expenditure for medical assistance under the State medicaid \n     program, or under a waiver of such program and that the State \n     determines would allow an individual to live in the \n     community.\n       (2) Individual's representative;

\n     and\n       (3) with respect to whom there has been a determination \n     that but for the provision of community-based services and \n     supports, the individuals would continue to require the level \n     of care provided in a medicaid long-term care facility.\n       (c) Requirements.--A State is not eligible to conduct a \n     demonstration project under this section unless the State \n     certifies the following:\n       (1) With respect to any individual provided community-based \n     services and supports under the demonstration project, the \n     State shall continue to provide community-based services and \n     supports to the individual under the medicaid program (and at \n     the State's Federal medical assistance percentage (as defined \n     in section 1905(b) of the Social Security Act) reimbursement \n     rate), for as long as the individual remains eligible for \n     medical assistance under the State medicaid program and \n     continues to require such services and supports, beginning \n     with the month that begins after the 12-month period in which \n     the individual is provided such services and supports under \n     the demonstration project.\n       (2) The State shall allow an individual participating in \n     the demonstration project (or, as appropriate, the \n     individual's representative) to choose the setting in which \n     the individual desires to receives the community-based \n     services and supports provided under the project.\n       (3) The State shall identify and educate individuals \n     residing in a medicaid long-term care facility who are \n     eligible to participate in the demonstration project (and, as \n     appropriate the individual's representative) about the \n     opportunity for the individual to receive community-based \n     services and supports under the demonstration project.\n       (4) The State shall ensure that each individual identified \n     in accordance with paragraph (3) (and, as appropriate, the \n     individual's representative), has the opportunity, \n     information, and tools to make an informed choice regarding \n     whether to transition to the community through participation \n     in the demonstration project or to remain in the medicaid \n     long-term care facility.\n       (5) The State shall maintain an adequate quality \n     improvement system so that individuals participating in the \n     demonstration project receive adequate services and supports.\n       (6) The State shall conduct a process for public \n     participation in the design and development of the \n     demonstration project and such process shall include the \n     participation of individuals with disabilities, elderly \n     individuals, or individuals with chronic conditions who are \n     part of the target populations to be served by the \n     demonstration project, and the representatives of such \n     individuals.\n       (7) The Federal funds paid to a State pursuant to this \n     section shall only supplement, and shall not supplant, the \n     level of State funds expended for providing community-based \n     services and supports for individuals under the State \n     medicaid program as of the date the State application to \n     conduct a demonstration project under this section is \n     approved.\n       (d) Approval of Demonstration Projects.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary \n     shall conduct a competitive application process with respect \n     to applications submitted under subsection (b) (taking into \n     consideration the preferences provided under paragraph (2)) \n     that meet the requirements of subsection (c). In determining \n     whether to approve such an application, the Secretary may \n     waive the requirement of--\n       (A) section 1902(a)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1396a(a)(1)) to allow for sub-State demonstrations;\n       (B) section 1902(a)(10)(B) of such Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1396a(a)(10)(B)) with respect to comparability; and\n       (C) section 1902(a)(10)(C)(i)(III) of such Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1396a(a)(10)(C)(i)(III)) with respect to income and resource \n     limitations.\n       (2) Preference for certain applications.--In approving \n     applications to conduct demonstration projects under this \n     section, the Secretary shall give preference to approving \n     applications that indicate that the State shall do the \n     following:\n       (A) Design and implement enduring improvements in \n     community-based long-term services support systems within the \n     State to enable individuals with disabilities to live and \n     participate in community life, particularly with respect to \n     those practices that will ensure the successful transition of \n     such individuals from medicaid long-term care facilities into \n     the community.\n       (B) Design and implement a long-term services support \n     system in the State that prevents individuals from entering \n     medicaid long-term care facilities in order to gain access to \n     community-based services and supports.\n       (C) Engage in systemic reform activities within the State \n     to rebalance expenditures for long-term services under the \n     State medicaid program through administrative actions that \n     reduce reliance on institutional forms of service and build \n     up more community capacity.\n       (D) Address the needs of populations that have been \n     underserved with respect to the availability of community \n     services or involve individuals or entities that have not \n     previously participated in the efforts of the State to \n     increase access to community-based services.\n       (E) Actively engage in collaboration between public housing \n     agencies, the State medicaid agency, independent living \n     centers, and other agencies and entities in order to \n     coordinate strategies for obtaining community integrated \n     housing and supportive services for an individual who \n     participates in the demonstration project, both with respect \n     to\n\n[[Page S8537]]\n\n     the period during which such individual participates in the \n     project and after the individual's participation in the \n     project concludes, in order to enable the individual to \n     continue to reside in the community.\n       (F) Develop and implement policies and procedures that \n     allow the State medicaid agency to administratively transfer \n     or integrate funds from the State budget accounts that are \n     obligated for expenditures for medicaid long-term care \n     facilities to other accounts for obligation for the provision \n     of community-based services and supports (including accounts \n     related to the provision of such services under a waiver \n     approved under section 1915 of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1396n)) when an individual transitions from residing \n     in such a facility to residing in the community.\n       (e) Payments to States.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall pay to each State with \n     a demonstration project approved under this section an amount \n     for each quarter occurring during the period described in \n     paragraph (2) equal to 100 percent of the State's \n     expenditures in the quarter for providing community-based \n     services and supports to individuals participating in the \n     demonstration project.\n       (2) Period described.--The period described in this \n     paragraph is the 12-month period that begins on the date on \n     which an individual first receives community-based services \n     and supports under the demonstration project in a setting \n     that is not a medicaid long-term care facility and is \n     selected by the individual.\n       (f) Reports.--\n       (1) In general.--Each State conducting a demonstration \n     project under this section shall submit a report to the \n     Secretary that, in addition to such other requirements as the \n     Secretary may require, includes information regarding--\n       (A) the types of community-based services and supports \n     provided under the demonstration project;\n       (B) the number of individuals served under the project;\n       (C) the expenditures for, and savings resulting from, \n     conducting the project; and\n       (D) to the extent applicable, the changes in State's long-\n     term services system developed in accordance with the \n     provisions of subsection (d)(2).\n       (2) Uniform data format.--In requiring information under \n     this subsection, the Secretary shall develop a uniform data \n     format to be used by States in the collection and submission \n     of data in the State report required under paragraph (1).\n       (g) Evaluations.--The Secretary shall use an amount, not to \n     exceed one-half of 1 percent of the amount appropriated under \n     subsection (h) for each fiscal year, to provide, directly or \n     through contract--\n       (1) for the evaluation of the demonstration projects \n     conducted under this section;\n       (2) technical assistance to States concerning the \n     development or implementation of such projects; and\n       (3) for the collection of the data described in subsection \n     (f)(1).\n       (h) Funding.--\n       (1) In general.--There is appropriated to carry out this \n     section--\n       (A) $300,000,000 for fiscal year 2004;

MEDICARE SECONDARY PAYOR (MSP) PROVISIONS.\n\n       (a) Technical Amendment Concerning Secretary's Authority to \n     Make Conditional Payment When Certain Primary Plans Do Not \n     Pay Promptly.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 1862(b)(2) (42 U.S.C. 1395y(b)(2)) \n     is amended--\n       (A) in subparagraph (A)(ii), by striking ``promptly (as \n     determined in accordance with regulations)'';\n       (B) in subparagraph (B)--\n       (i) by redesignating clauses (i) through (iii) as clauses \n     (ii) through (iv), respectively; and\n       (ii) by inserting before clause (ii), as so redesignated, \n     the following new clause:\n       ``(i) Authority to make conditional payment.--The Secretary \n     may make payment under this title with respect to an item or \n     service if a primary plan described in subparagraph (A)(ii) \n     has not made or cannot reasonably be expected to make payment \n     with respect to such item or service promptly (as determined \n     in accordance with regulations). Any such payment by the \n     Secretary shall be conditioned on reimbursement to the \n     appropriate Trust Fund in accordance with the succeeding \n     provisions of this subsection.''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendments made by paragraph (1) \n     shall be effective as if included in the enactment of title \n     III of the Medicare and Medicaid Budget Reconciliation \n     Amendments of 1984 (Public Law 98-369).\n       (b) Clarifying Amendments to Conditional Payment \n     Provisions.--Section 1862(b)(2) (42 U.S.C. 1395y(b)(2)) is \n     further amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (A), in the matter following clause \n     (ii), by inserting the following sentence at the end: ``An \n     entity that engages in a business, trade, or profession shall \n     be deemed to have a self-insured plan if it carries its own \n     risk (whether by a failure to obtain insurance, or otherwise) \n     in whole or in part.'';\n       (2) in subparagraph (B)(ii), as redesignated by subsection \n     (a)(2)(B)--\n       (A) by striking the first sentence and inserting the \n     following: ``A primary plan, and an entity that receives \n     payment from a primary plan, shall reimburse the appropriate \n     Trust Fund for any payment made by the Secretary under this \n     title with respect to an item or service if it is \n     demonstrated that such primary plan has or had a \n     responsibility to make payment with respect to such item or \n     service. A primary plan's responsibility for such payment may \n     be demonstrated by a judgment, a payment conditioned upon the \n     recipient's compromise, waiver, or release (whether or not \n     there is a determination or admission of liability) of \n     payment for items or services included in a claim against the \n     primary plan or the primary plan's insured, or by other \n     means.''; and\n       (B) in the final sentence, by striking ``on the date such \n     notice or other information is received'' and inserting ``on \n     the date notice of, or information related to, a primary \n     plan's responsibility for such payment or other information \n     is received''; and\n       (3) in subparagraph (B)(iii), as redesignated by subsection \n     (a)(2)(B), by striking the first sentence and inserting the \n     following: ``In order to recover payment made under this \n     title for an item or service, the United States may bring an \n     action against any or all entities that are or were required \n     or responsible (directly, as an insurer or self-insurer, as a \n     third-party administrator, as an employer that sponsors or \n     contributes to a group health plan, or large group health \n     plan, or otherwise) to make payment with respect to the same \n     item or service (or any portion thereof) under a primary \n     plan.

In \n     addition, the United States may recover under this clause \n     from any entity that has received payment from a primary plan \n     or from the proceeds of a primary plan's payment to any \n     entity.''.\n       (c) Clerical Amendments.--Section 1862(b) (42 U.S.C. \n     1395y(b)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1)(A), by moving the indentation of \n     clauses (ii) through (v) 2 ems to the left; and\n       (2) in paragraph (3)(A), by striking ``such'' before \n     ``paragraphs''.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, all this modification does is it changes \nthe first year, but it leaves everything else the same. This was $350 \nmillion each of the 5 years. This is now $300 million in the first \nyear, and $350 million for each of the 4 years thereafter.\n  So again, as I said, 13 years ago we passed the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. We said no to segregation of people with \ndisabilities. Ever since that time, Medicaid still continues to \nsegregate people. When 70 percent of their money goes for institutional \ncare, and only 30 percent goes for community-based care, it is time to \nbreak that down and give people with disabilities the right to exercise \ntheir own choice about where they want to live. And that, really, is \nthe essence of the amendment.\n  I hope Senators will support the amendment overwhelmingly since, as I \nsaid, it was in the President's 2004 budget and the offset we have used \nis also fully supported by the administration.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk for \nmyself and Senator Baucus and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for himself and Mr. \n     Baucus, proposes an amendment numbered 1092.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in Today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. This is an amendment I have worked out with Senator \nBaucus after considerable consultation with many colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle. The amendment has two parts. First, it would permit \nthe Secretary, starting in 2009, to designate an alternative payment \nsystem for PPOs in a limited number of regions that the Secretary has \ndetermined to be highly competitive. This alternate payment system \nwould permit the Secretary to set the Federal contribution for \nparticipation plans solely based on the bids they submit to the \nSecretary. The Secretary would still be required to choose the three \nplans with the lowest credible bids to participate. The Federal \ncontribution would be set for the three plans participating by the \nsecond lowest bid submitted.\n  The second thing the amendment would do is authorize the Secretary, \nalso starting in 2009, to establish a number of projects in the fee-\nfor-service Medicare Program. These projects would be designed to \nprovide enhanced services or benefits to improve the quality of care \nprovided to Medicare beneficiaries, to improve the health care delivery \nsystem under the Medicare Program, and lower expenditures in that \nprogram. The enhanced services or benefits would include preventive \nservices, chronic care coordination, disease management services, or \nother services the Secretary determines will advance the purposes of \nthese projects.\n  The total cost of this amendment would be $12 billion starting in the \nyear 2009 and would be equally divided between the alternative payment \nsystem and the fee-for-service projects.\n  Mr. President, this amendment represents a very reasonable compromise \non the question of how to introduce into the Medicare Advantage Program \na more competitive payment system.\n  I thank everyone, and most especially Senator Baucus, for working so \nhard and in a cooperative spirit to develop this amendment now before \nthe Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n\n[[Page S8540]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, first, I thank my good friend and \ncolleague, the chairman of the committee, Senator Grassley, for his \nJob-like patience, as we have worked extremely hard with various \nSenators to try to come up with--and I think we have--a compromise, \nbalanced solution as to how we spend the newly discovered $12 billion.\n  I have a couple of points. The intent of this amendment and the \nlanguage of this amendment accomplish a couple of purposes: No. 1, to \nevenly divide the $12 billion--$6 billion and $6 billion--to be \navailable to be potentially used by PPOs in areas designated by the \nSecretary, and the other $6 billion to be spent in additional Medicare \nPrograms for disease management, chronic care, and other ways to help \nparticularly address the lack of coordination services for the \nchronically ill and those seniors who particularly need disease \nmanagement.\n  The amendment also has a couple other provisions, and to maintain the \nbalance, maintain the symmetry is so important. I will remind my \ncolleagues that in an attempt to get prescription drug benefits to \nseniors--something we all want to do--we are faced with two competing \nideas. One is competition and the other is traditional Medicare. So the \nunderlying bill is an attempt to work those two concepts together. This \namendment follows on that tradition. It follows the same spirit, the \nsame symmetry.\n  I mentioned the $6 billion and $6 billion. In addition, the amendment \nprovides the authority to continue in the applicable number of years--\nbeginning in 2009 through 2013--and the $12 billion is not available \nuntil then anyway. That is the problem we have. It doesn't start until \n2009. But it is $6 billion available for potential PPO use and $6 \nbillion for disease management, starting in 2009, for a 5-year period. \nIn addition, the authority for both under this amendment continues into \nthe future beyond the 5-year period.\n  In addition, the language is written so it is an absolutely clear, \nironclad guarantee that after the 5-year period no further dollars will \nbe spent on either side, either the $6 billion available for PPOs or \nthe $6 billion to be available for disease management, et cetera. It is \nvery important to maintain that symmetry and balance in order to \naccomplish the spirit of cooperation so that we get this program \nstarted, get the prescription drug program that we want delivered and \non its way.\n  This is not perfect, but I can tell you that many hours have been \ndevoted by many Senators on both sides of the aisle to come up with \nthis solution, which does achieve that balance.\n  I urge Senators to support this. This is going to break the logjam. \nThis is the key amendment which has been topic A. Many Senators are \nwondering about this as they are thinking about other amendments they \nmay or may not offer.\n  I hope with the passage of this amendment we will be able to take up \nother amendments Senators have tomorrow and debate them and finally, \nhopefully, by sometime tomorrow and Thursday--perhaps at a late time on \nThursday--pass this legislation and send it to conference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of this \namendment, which is a product of about 48 hours of discussion and \nnegotiation, in terms of packaging. I really speak in support of both \nof the parts of this amendment to which the managers have just spoken.\n  In the next couple days--hopefully maybe tomorrow night or the next \nmorning--we will indeed have a historic vote to provide America's \nseniors with coverage they simply don't have today, don't have access \nto today--prescription drugs, preventive care, and chronic disease \nmanagement. That is in the underlying bill.\n  Seniors will have the opportunity, for the first time, to choose the \nsort of coverage that best suits their individual needs. At the same \ntime, they will have access to a benefit they don't have today, and \nthat is in the underlying bill.\n  I support the amendment just introduced because it makes the bill \neven better for two reasons. No. 1--and this is where about $6 billion \nis spent--it strengthens the competitive model.\n  Ultimately, I believe--and I think the majority of people in this \nbody believe--the only way we are going to be able to increase quality \nover the long term, in 10, 20, or 30 years, at the same time we have \nthis unprecedented increase in the number of seniors in this country, a \ndoubling in the number of seniors over the next 30 years, is to take \nadvantage of the dynamism of the private sector where we can obtain the \nefficiencies that a command-and-control type plan, a Government-type \nplan simply cannot capture. It is the only way. Half of this amendment \nconcentrates just on that--about $6 billion--to make those competitive, \nprivate sector dynamic, marketplace principles, yes, regulated by \nGovernment, work.\n\n  The other half of the amendment, the other $6 billion, also does \nsomething which we stress in the underlying bill, but through this \namendment we will spend an additional $6 billion in supporting and \ninvesting in what we call preventive medicine, chronic disease \nmanagement, coordinated chronic disease management we know how to \naddress, but we have insufficiently invested in to maximize the care, \nthe health care security our seniors deserve.\n  I will refer to a couple charts to explain why I am so excited about \nboth aspects of this bill. I will first take the half of the bill that \nhas to do with chronic disease management, and it links with what I \nprefaced in my remarks; that is, doubling the number of seniors. The \nchallenge is going to be to sustain this long term; that is, Medicare \nlong term.\n  If we look at overall numbers of beneficiaries in Medicare today, we \nknow there are about 40 million beneficiaries, and this chart shows the \npercentage of beneficiaries. As we look at the total amount of moneys \nbeing spent today by those beneficiaries, those patients, those \nseniors, those individuals with disabilities who are a part of \nMedicare, we find that 6 percent, or about 1 in 20, account for 50 \npercent of all the money that is expended in Medicare today.\n  Since we know that health care is expensive, what we need to do, I \nbelieve, to make sure we get the best value for each health care \ndollar, each tax dollar that is paid to Government or that is paid for \nby the beneficiary, is to make sure this money is spent effectively and \nefficiently.\n  How do we do that? We ought to spend a lot of time focusing on this \n50 percent, which is really 1 out of every 20 people. So in this body \nof 100 people, there would be six--just these six desks around me--\naccounting for 50 percent of all the expenditures. So why don't we \nfigure out why these six people are so expensive?\n  Who are these six people? In this next chart, I will show you who \nthey are because once we identify them and give them the very best \ncoordinated care possible, I believe that number will reduce over time.\n  On this next chart, these ``CCs'' stand for chronic conditions. By \n``chronic condition,'' I mean heart failure, diabetes, chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease, or emphysema.\n  What we find if we look at all Medicare expenditures--say this pie \nchart is all the money we spend on Medicare--most of the expenses are \non individuals who have five chronic care conditions, and then those \nwho have four chronic care conditions is about 13 percent; three \nchronic care conditions about 10 percent; two chronic conditions, say \nheart failure and diabetes, 7 percent.\n  By concentrating on people with chronic conditions, and if we give \nthem coordinated care, seamless care, if we give them prescription \ndrugs, which this bill does for the first time, if we help them with \nmaybe a nurse calling once a week to help manage their care, use \nresources appropriately, over the long haul, this program will be \nsustainable.\n  I walked through these two charts because all of us know that \nMedicare is expensive, and we know that over time we need to fund \nwhatever program we do, so let's concentrate our policy on where the \nexpenses are, these six individuals, if we use this body as an example, \nand those are the people who have chronic care conditions.\n  Thus, this amendment, $6 billion of $12 billion, is being spent, \nfocused like a laser beam on people with chronic care conditions. That \nis what the amendment does.\n\n[[Page S8541]]\n\n  The underlying bill does that by setting up these PPOs, Medicare \nAdvantage and Medicare+Choice, which gives seamless coordinated care \nbuilt in a competitive marketplace. The underlying bill does that, but \nwhat this amendment does is focus an additional $6 billion on people \nwith chronic conditions.\n  Also, part of that money is to improve preventive care, and we all \nknow it is a lot cheaper to figure out who is going to get sick from \nheart disease and treat them accordingly than waiting until they get \nsick and are hospitalized and they develop what is called end stage \ncardiomyopathy. To me it is exciting.\n  I mentioned diabetes because diabetes is one of the conditions that I \nthink best demonstrates how modern medicine today can, if properly \nmanaged, both have better outcome and lower cost. Today there are about \n17 million Americans who suffer from diabetes. Another 16 million \nadults are at risk for developing the condition, and over the past \ndecade, the number of diagnosed cases of diabetes has risen sharply.\n  Just in the last several weeks, the American-Diabetes-Association-\nsponsored study indicated that one-third, one out of every three \nchildren born in the United States this year will develop diabetes in \ntheir lifetime--one out of every three. So if you are a parent and \nlistening to me now, and you have three children, one of those \nstatistically will develop diabetes over their lifetime. It is huge. \nThe National Health Interview Survey projects that 45 to 50 million \nAmericans will have diabetes by 2050.\n  If we ineffectively manage diabetes, if we do not have access to the \nlatest drugs, the appropriate management, the cost of managing and \ntreating diabetes is huge. According to the American Diabetes \nAssociation, $91.9 billion was spent last year just in direct medical \nexpenses for diabetics. Today, more than $1 in every $7 spent on health \ncare in the United States is spent on behalf of diabetic patients.\n  I mention all of this because we know that health care costs for \ndiabetes, if not managed in a coordinated system, are huge, and based \non the statistics I just said with this dramatic increase in diabetes \nwill increase over time.\n  How do we address it? We address it through an integrated health care \nmodel where you look at diet, you look at exercise, you look at drugs, \nyou look at the appropriate testing to monitor blood sugars, and you \nhave coordinated care. That is what we do in this Medicare PPO, \nMedicare Advantage model, and diabetes would fall into one of these \nchronic conditions. And we are going to be investing another $6 billion \nthrough this amendment in the overall management of conditions like \ndiabetes.\n  The other--and I will close in a minute or so--the other $6 billion \nof this amendment, the other half of this amendment, is invested in \nincreasing the competitive model.\n  I commented on this briefly, but what this allows us to do is to take \nadvantage of what we know is in the marketplace today. We know that \ncommand and control and price controls run out of Washington, DC, do \nnot work. We have tried it. We have seen it in Medicare in the past, \nand it resulted in a system that, yes, has been good for seniors, but \nit has not stayed abreast with the great advances we have seen in \nhealth care delivery or the new technology today. So we need a more \nresponsive system, one that takes advantage of new innovation, new \ntechnology in the marketplace, that captures those dynamics of market-\nbased competition. It is the private sector working in partnership with \nthe public sector.\n\n  I will close by saying that I feel strongly that this amendment will \nincrementally, greatly improve health care for our seniors today. It \nwill be debated, I am sure, over the course of the evening tonight and \nearly in the morning. It is a product of a lot of working together, \nDemocrats and Republicans, over the last 48 hours to put together the \nvery best ideas for improving competition and market-based fundamentals \nand, at the same time, focusing on preventive medicine, prevention of \ndisease, management of those chronic conditions, where many of the \nchallenges exist in Medicare today.\n  We are nearing a historic vote to provide America's current and \nfuture seniors comprehensive health care coverage. Friday, we will pass \nlegislation to improve and strengthen Medicare. The transformed program \nwill offer modern and innovative coverage for procedures ranging from \nphysical exams to hospital visits. And most significantly, the updated \nMedicare system will, for the first time, offer seniors prescription \ndrug coverage. As a doctor who has served thousands of Medicare \npatients, I am committed to ensuring health care security for our \nseniors. Prescription drugs must be a part of that security.\n  The bipartisan bill offers seniors more choice and flexibility. \nSeniors will be able to stay with traditional Medicare, or they will \nhave the option of being covered under Medicare Advantage. Medicare \nAdvantage will offer better benefits and up-to-date medical care, \nincluding: preventive care; disease management; and protection from \ncatastrophic costs. It will also, of course, offer comprehensive \nprescription drug coverage.\n  Seniors all across the country, including in rural areas, will have a \nMedicare plan that offers them similar types of benefits 8 million \ncurrent and retired Federal employees now enjoy. Medicare Advantage is \ndesigned to combine the best of the Government and private sector and \nprovide security, choice, quality, safety, flexibility and innovation. \nChronic health problems especially will be tackled with more resources \nand better results.\n  The amendment will significantly strengthen the bill in this regard. \nMost importantly, it allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nadditional flexibility to institute a true competitive bidding model \nfor PPOs and other Medicare Advantage coordinated health plans. It does \nthis by allowing payments to plans without regard to a benchmark linked \nto current payments under the Medicare+Choice or Medicare FFS system.\n  The second part of the amendment will devote up to $6 billion \nadditional funds, beginning in 2009, for the Secretary to conduct broad \ndemonstration projects that will likely lead to improvements in the \ndisease management, chronic care management, and preventive care \nprovided to seniors who choose to remain in the traditional Medicare \nprogram. This is great progress for seniors. We are modernizing \nMedicare to keep pace with modern medicine and tackle chronic disease.\n  Diabetes is a good example of how modern medicine, through \nprescription drugs, is offering both therapeutic benefits today as part \nof an integrated care regimen and promises effective treatments and new \ntypes of health care delivery in the future.\n  Approximately 17 million Americans--6% of the population--now suffer \nfrom diabetes. Another 16 million adults are at risk for developing the \ncondition. Over the past decade, the number of diagnosed cases of \ndiabetes has risen sharply. A recent American Diabetes Association \nsponsored study indicated that one third of children born in the United \nStates in the year 2000 will develop diabetes in their lifetimes. The \nNational Health Interview Survey projects that 45 to 50 million \nAmericans will have diabetic by 2050.\n  Undiagnosed and improperly treated, diabetes can cause a host of \ncomplications, including: kidney failure; heart disease; and loss of \nlimb. Medical expenditures for persons with diabetes are four times as \nhigh as their nondiabetic counterparts, in large part, because of these \ncomplications. According to the American Diabetes Association, $91.9 \nbillion dollars was spent last year just in direct medical expenses for \ndiabetics. Today, more than one in every seven dollars spent on \nhealthcare in the United States is spent on behalf of diabetic \npatients.\n  Indeed, the healthcare costs for diabetes threaten to add a \nsignificant financial burden to Medicare. But the good news is there is \nmuch we can do to prevent the illness. We know that patient education, \nweight control, exercise and treatment can significantly reduce the \nincidence of adult onset diabetes.\n  Meanwhile, since 1995, five new classes of medicine have been \nintroduced to treat diabetes. These medicines, coupled with health \nmanagement and coordinated care programs, are powerful tools to \nincrease a patient's health status and reduce complications due to the \nillness.\n\n[[Page S8542]]\n\n  For example, one comprehensive disease management program treated \napproximately 7,000 diabetic patients and produced savings of $50 to \n$100 per diabetic patient, per month. Pharmaceutical costs increased \nunder the program, but total health care spending declined.\n  Why? Because of fewer emergency room visits, substantially fewer \ninpatient hospitalizations and reduced lengths of stay. At the same \ntime, (HEDIS) measures of the quality of care these patients received \nsignificantly improved.\n  In other words, a modern, coordinated health approach to diabetes \nwhich included prescription drugs, led to reduced costs and improved \noutcomes. And diabetes is only one of many chronic conditions for which \nprescription drugs help clinicians optimize care and improve the \nquality of life for patients. This amendment will go far in advancing \nlife saving prescription drug approaches.\n  This is an exciting week for the Senate and for the American people. \nWe have built on years of research, discussion, and debate. We now have \na bill that reflects broad bipartisan support. Thanks to the leadership \nof my colleagues in the Senate, and the commitment of President Bush, \nAmerica's seniors will finally receive the health coverage they need \nand the security they deserve.\n  Medicine has come a long way since 1965. Now, so too, will Medicare.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1093 to Amendment No. 1092\n\n    (Purpose: To evaluate alternative payment and delivery systems)\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1093 to amendment No. 1092.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this is a second-degree amendment to the \nBaucus-Grassley amendment. I will explain it in just a moment, but \nwhile the majority leader is still in the Chamber, let me compliment \nhim, not only for the fine presentation he just made based upon his \npersonal knowledge of how the medical health care system in this \ncountry works but also for his leadership and the enormous amount of \ntime and effort he has put into crafting this legislation and working \nwith Members to try to resolve the many disputes that have arisen. I \nthink without the patience he has shown in dealing with all of the \nMembers, we would not be to this point that we are today, literally on \nthe brink of passing, in the Senate, very historic legislation. So I \ncompliment the majority leader and personally thank him for his \npatience in dealing with some of my concerns about the bill and the \ngood work he has done in working with those problems.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Grassley, who has shown a lot of \npatience and has worked hard in a very bipartisan way to put together a \nplan that could pass this body. I know that people on both sides of the \naisle would prefer that it be closer to their particular points of \nview, but the chairman was always cognizant of the fact that in order \nto get a bill passed, it had to be done in a bipartisan way. So I \ncompliment the chairman and ranking member for working in that fashion.\n  I also want to compliment and tell my colleagues a little bit about \nthe efforts of the Secretary of HHS, Tommy Thompson. He, too, has \nbecome very personally involved in this effort and has worked very hard \nto effect the President's goals and plans in ensuring that we can \nstrengthen, protect, improve and preserve Medicare. I appreciate his \nstrong role as well.\n  I say all of that to make it clear that the amendment I offer is in \nthe spirit of this bipartisan work, hopefully my work will be deemed to \nbe cooperative with our leadership, although there is one element of \nthe amendment Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus have laid down that \nI disagree with and this is what I am proposing to amend.\n  What I would like to do is explain the history of this and then come \nto my amendment. The amendment is very simple. It strikes a sunset \nprovision, but that does not mean anything unless one knows the \ncontext, so let me speak for a moment about that context.\n  When the President first proposed this year that we legislate to add \na new prescription drug benefit to Medicare, he said we should do it in \nthe context of a real effort to strengthen Medicare so that we can \npreserve and protect it for the future. It has served our seniors well, \nbut we are now in the 21st century and two things basically have \noccurred.\n  First, we now know that medicines, prescription drugs, are used as \nthe preferred treatment for many illnesses and diseases, which was not \nthe case back in 1965 when Medicare was first created. So all of us \nhave become convinced that we need to add a prescription drug benefit \nto Medicare. This was the President's first great goal.\n  The second thing he said was, there is no way we can sustain the \ncurrent promised benefits under Medicare if we do not create some new \nopportunities for Medicare beneficiaries, if we do not really \nstrengthen the Medicare system we have. Among the things we can do to \nensure that it will continue to work is to provide some choices for \nseniors, and so what he proposed was those people who would like to \nkeep the existing Medicare, with a new prescription drug benefit, would \nbe able to do that. But, especially for those younger seniors, people \nwho have been in the workplace and are familiar with a PPO, or \npreferred provider, insurance plan or perhaps an HMO or Medicare+Choice \nkind of plan, we would provide that alternative as well so that the \nsenior could choose. The idea was that a lot of the people that will be \ncoming into the senior market, being used to an employer-provided plan, \nmight like to keep that kind of plan rather than go into traditional \nMedicare. So we want to provide a choice, and it will be up to the \nsenior to decide. So that is the direction that we sat down to work in \nas we developed this legislation.\n  I would have preferred that in creating this private market \nalternative, or the preferred provider organization--which we will hear \nreferred to as PPOs--to the traditional Government Medicare system, we \nhad made it much more like the FEHBP, the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program. That is a medical insurance plan that most of the \npeople who are in this Chamber today have. It serves about 10 million \nFederal employees including family members and retirees. This is also \nthe health plan for Members of Congress.\n  I would like to tell my seniors, if it is good enough for Members of \nCongress, then the seniors ought to take a look at it. It is a pretty \ngood program. In fact, it is a very good program. I would have liked to \nhave made this new Medicare Program alternative very much in the mold \nof the FEHBP, especially in the way that the preferred provider \norganizations work, bid, and are paid. We could have done that.\n  The way it works in the FEHBP is we do not have any limit on what \nkind of a bid the PPOs have to have. If they meet the basic criteria, \nproviding the care we have mandated by statute, they can bid and \nprovide the service and they can try to sell it to us. The federal \ngovernment's share of the cost is determined by the use of a weighted \naverage of all the health plans' costs.\n\n  If it is a good deal, federal employees and Members of Congress will \nsign up. If it is not a good deal, we will not. Generally, we do not \ntell the PPOs how much they can bid or how much they can charge. If \nthey bid too much and charge too much, nobody is going to buy it. So \nthey all have pretty reasonable bids and pretty reasonable costs, but \ntheoretically they could bid themselves out of the market. It is up to \nthem.\n  These insurance actuaries are pretty smart. They know how they can \nmeet all of the requirements that they have. They have to be sure they \ncover the benefits they have promised. They have to provide those. They \nhave to make a little profit, of course. They have to make sure the \npremiums are low enough so that people will sign up and, of course, \nmost importantly in the beginning, they have to win the bid. If they do \nnot win the bid, if they are so\n\n[[Page S8543]]\n\nhigh that nobody will sign up, well, then, there is no reason for them \nto be in the game in the first place.\n  They look at all of those things, and they figure out how much they \ncan afford to bid, what the premiums will be, and so on. It is a pretty \ngood plan, and I wish we could have been able to offer that to our \nseniors. But instead, the determination was made by Chairman Grassley \nand others that we would take the key component of the President's plan \nwith respect to the PPOs and write that up into the legislation, draft \nit up, and that section of the legislation says we are going to limit \nthe number of bids because we really want to control the cost, and so \nwe are going to say only the three lowest bids are going to succeed, \nand then the President proposed to pay the PPOs at the middle bid of \nthe three bids.\n  So the insurance companies that bid have to figure out, how much is \nit going to cost us to provide care to each senior, and that is what \nthey bid, but they have to be sure the bid is low enough that they win \nbecause only the three lowest ones will be accepted.\n  That is what President Bush proposed, and it is deemed to be a way of \nboth providing a lower cost to the Government kind of care but a \nquality care because obviously people are not going to sign up and \nutilize it if they do not think it provides quality care.\n  There are a lot of things about the way PPOs operate that ensure good \nquality care. This is a good idea. The President proposed it, and that \nwas the original idea in drafting this.\n  But then a very arbitrary thing happened. The people in this building \nknow that everything we do has to be under the rules of the CBO, the \nCongressional Budget Office. Everything has to be scored by CBO. That \nis to say, we send it to CBO, and they tell us how much it is going to \ncost in their mind. When we said we were going to allocate $400 billion \nover 10 years to this new prescription drug benefit, we had to make \nsure that the CBO score fit within the $400 billion.\n  Well, CBO came along and they said this competitive bidding system \nwas going to cost a lot more money--it was over a $100 billion--it was \nway more than Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus wanted to allocate \nto the preferred provider organization part of the system.\n  So they said, we have to do something that does not cost anything or \ndoes not cost very much. So they decided to solve the problem CBO had \ncreated by simply writing in, in effect, a limitation that said this \nwill not cost anything because we are going to set it at the very same \nlevel as traditional Medicare payments. There is a complicated formula. \nI am not going to get into all the details, but essentially it is the \nhigher of the Medicare+Choice payment rate or the traditional fee-for-\nservice Medicare reimbursement level.\n  The bottom line is, they said we are going to cap the amount the PPOs \ncould be reimbursed. If you want the contract, you can bid anything you \nwant to bid, but you can't be reimbursed over a certain amount, and \nthat amount is defined in statute. By definition, therefore, the score \ndid not cost very much and therefore it could fit within this $400 \nbillion. So they thought that might solve the problem.\n  But the problem with this is, it will not work. A lot of people \nrealize it won't work, but we still have to comply with the CBO score, \nthey say. I will get to a solution in a moment.\n  How do we know it won't work? CBO, the same organization that did the \nscore, says all of 2 percent of seniors will sign up for this PPO \nalternative. Two percent. Why? Because this arbitrary capped rate is \nnot going to be enough to provide the coverage for them that we \npromise. So why would they want to sign up with a PPO when they can get \nthe coverage under traditional Medicare?\n  When I am eligible for Medicare, that is what I would do. I would not \nsign up if a plan cannot deliver the goods. CBO says only 2 percent \nwill sign up. As a result, obviously, we have to find an alternative.\n  Let's go back to this question that CBO raised by its scoring and \nwhether or not an arbitrary limit will actually work. CBO says it \nwon't; only 2 percent are going to sign up.\n  Why do they say that? First, we have the experience of Medicare \nreimbursement over the last many, many years. Sadly, the government has \na cap on what it pays the doctors and hospitals and other health care \nproviders, too. We do that by statute. We say we are only going to pay \nyou X amount if you do certain things and you cannot go above that.\n  What happens? After a while, there is so much upward pressure on that \namount because it does not begin to keep track with inflation, \nespecially health care inflation. Pretty soon the doctors are saying, \nwe not only cannot make any money getting reimbursed at this low level, \nbut we cannot pay our nurses, we cannot keep our doors open, there is \nno way we can stay in practice providing services to our senior \ncitizens if you are going to pay this ridiculously low amount. In fact, \na lot of doctors have retired, gotten out of the business, discouraged \ntheir kids from going into medicine, and we see real shortages, \nespecially in certain specialties. There are other factors that lead to \nthat as well, but this is a big one.\n  So every year or two, Congress, responding to that pressure, says: My \ngoodness, we have to change that reimbursement level. It is too low. So \nthen we have these big fits and starts where we hold it down for a \nwhile and then all of a sudden we raise it up to the level necessary to \ncompensate the hospitals and the doctors and nurses to take care of our \nsenior citizens. We did this for the physicians just a few months ago \nbecause they were getting cut significantly in the reimbursement rate \nand CBO said we paid $54 billion to fix the physician problem for \nbasically one year. That is one-eighth of the amount of this entire \nbill, over a 10-year period, just to make sure that the cut did not go \ninto effect last year for the doctors so they could stay in business.\n  We find there is supposed to be another cut in physician \nreimbursement levels this year, and again we are most likely going to \nhave to make an adjustment.\n  The problem is artificial government controls, price controls, do not \nwork. They do not work in Medicare any better than in rent control or \nthe gasoline price controls we had in the 1970's or any other price \ncontrols. Free market countries like the United States have learned \nthat lesson. Socialist countries have not. I would have thought we \nwould have learned the lesson. But that is the way the Medicare system \nworks. It is the perfect exhibit A if you want evidence of the fact \nthese controls in providing health care services do not work. Just look \nat the reimbursement providers in Medicare today.\n\n  I mentioned it is a lot like rent control. There is always the \ninexorable pressure. Is it any wonder when you finally remove the rent \ncontrols that in some places the rents actually go up? The owners get \nenough to refurbish the place to keep it up and people are willing to \nrent the places that look a lot nicer and better than back when there \nwere rent controls. Sometimes the prices do go up. That is the price of \nquality health care.\n  We should never get into the situation in this Congress where we are \ngoing to shortchange our seniors by trying to put artificial caps on \nwhat we pay the people who take care of them. It will not work.\n  There is no such thing as a free lunch. If you want quality health \ncare, you are going to have to pay for it one way or another. It may \nwork to have a price control for a little while, but it does not work \nfor very long. We found that out, and that is why every couple of years \nwe have to make the big adjustments.\n  So why would we think the price controls would work with the new \npreferred provider organizations that we are trying to establish as a \ncredible alternative to traditional Medicare? A lot of people will find \nthe benefits of those PPOs to their liking. Why do we think the price \ncontrols will allow them to work? CBO says it will not happen; only 2 \npercent will sign up. Clearly, we had to find a way out of this \ndilemma.\n  The bottom line is, under CBO's rationale, either nobody bids because \nthey cannot get reimbursed or we have to do the constant adjustment. \nThere is no adjustment provided for in this legislation. Or there is a \nmodest adjustment, but not an adjustment that will take care of this \nproblem.\n  What do we do to solve the problem? We do not want to create the PPO \noption and then destroy its effectiveness\n\n[[Page S8544]]\n\nbefore it can even work. I am very worried, to digress a moment, we \nwill create some expectations on the part of our seniors that we cannot \nsatisfy. That will be fundamentally wrong. It would be very wrong to \nsuggest that we are going to do something for our seniors that, in \nfact, we are not doing. I, for one, am simply not going to be part of \nthat. We cannot promise seniors an option that, in fact, we know, in \nadvance will not work.\n  What is the solution? Obviously, the solution is to go back to the \nway we were going to do this in the first place, back to the \nPresident's proposal, and not have the arbitrary cap. Simply allow \ncompetitive bidding. Let the market decide what the right levels are. \nThese people are smart. They will find the right level. It may be, in \nsome areas, some time, below the Medicare reimbursement. That is what \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the organization that \noversees these programs, believes. It may be the same. It may be more. \nIt will be different from region to region and year to year. Let the \nmarket decide that.\n  Now, there was not enough money in the $400 billion to do this. So \nwhat happened was Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus were able to \nconclude that about $12 billion was available in the bill to be \nallocated for some purpose.\n  Very candidly, many Democrats did not want to do what I am \nsuggesting. So they said you can only have half of the $12 billion to \ntry to make your plan work. We want to use the other half to do \nsomething we want to do. What they want to do in the bill is perfectly \nreasonable, and I don't have any objection to the Grassley-Baucus \namendment in that regard. In fact, I don't have any objection to most \nof the Grassley-Baucus amendment. I think it is a good amendment except \nfor one thing.\n  What the amendment does for the $6 billion I spoke of, it says, \nstarting in the year 2009, the Secretary of HHS can use competitive \nbidding that does not have this arbitrary payment cap on it, up to \nspending $6 billion if you have to spend it. The CBO scoring would \nsuggest you could probably cover one or two of the 10 regions of the \ncountry if there were going to be 10 regions during one of the bidding \ncycles. It does not give us much of a chance to do this, but at least \nit establishes the principle.\n  The Secretary will at least have one chance, in one region, during \none bidding period, to say at least in this situation we are going to \neliminate our caps and see what happens.\n  Theoretically, if the bids come in below that cap, he still has the \n$6 billion to do that in another region. It is like somebody \nguaranteeing a loan. If the loans get paid off, then the person who \nguaranteed it never has to pay off. This is like $6 billion to \nguarantee the loan. This is $6 billion to see that the preferred \nprovider organizations get paid, if in fact their bids exceed the \nMedicare cap level. It may exceed it; it may not.\n  Chances are, if it does not happen until 2009, which is the way the \namendment is written, it will exceed it because of this pressure that \ninevitably builds when you have price controls keeping the prices down. \nSo for 4 years the prices are going to be tamped down and finally then \nin the fifth year we get to go out to bids, and my guess is they \nprobably will be higher and the proponents of the competitive bidding \nwill say: See, we told you it would cost a lot of money. Of course. It \nmight. If you tamp down something that the market would cause to rise a \nlittle bit every year and you tamp it down for 5 years and don't have \nsome opportunity to adjust it, then naturally if you take the cap off \nit is going to rise. So CBO is probably correct, it probably will cost \nsome money. That is the inevitable result of lifting the price control \nafter you have kept things tamped down for too long.\n  The alternative, of course, is that there may not be any PPOs bidding \nbecause they cannot provide the services we have promised to seniors. \nBut there is a little bit of an opportunity here to provide this \nunrestricted opportunity for bidding. That is what the amendment \noriginally said that was drafted. I was originally going to be a \ncosponsor of the Grassley-Baucus amendment because even though it did \nnot reestablish the competitive bidding process very much, there is a \nlittle sliver in there and at least we could go to conference, to the \nconference committee between the House and Senate, and argue that we \nhad established the principle and we wanted to make sure that principle \ncould continue on.\n  But, again, a funny thing happened. There were objections on the \nDemocratic side to this process extending beyond the 5 years that it \nwas in effect. What they said was you have to spend the $6 billion in \nthat 5-year period. There will not be any money after that.\n  I said that's OK.\n  But then they said: And the authority to do this has to sunset at \nthat moment, after 5 years. You cannot have the authority to do this, \nregardless of the cost, later on.\n  Later they said: Well, as long as it is cost neutral, but as I \npointed out that is probably a false promise because of the price \ncontrols keeping the prices tamped down. So my amendment eliminates \nthat sunset clause. It says: No, if this is a good idea, let it \ncontinue.\n  Ironically, if the CMS is correct, then it is not going to cost any \nmore. And if CBO is correct, it is going to cost more and, as a result \nof that, we are going to have to have some alternative to the \ncompetitive bidding process with the price caps on it because there are \nnot going to be any PPOs to offer the health care benefits. If, in \nfact, they cannot make it work under the money that is then available, \nthere has to be an alternative available. That is why this should not \nsunset. It is why the authority to do this should continue on.\n  As to this point I just want to say I cannot imagine, after all the \nwork that has gone into this--people have looked at how complex this \nis--we would think that we are smart enough in the Senate to know \nexactly what the price of this insurance contract ought to be for every \nMedicare beneficiary 10 years down the road. How do we know that? We \ncannot possibly know that. How do we know what a fair price for a \nMercury automobile is going to be in 10 years? A price that is just \nexactly fair, that lets, say, Ford Motor Company make some money, just \nlow enough to entice us to buy the car. We don't know that. That is why \nwe have a free market. You charge whatever you want to charge and if it \nis a good deal, people will buy it; if it is not, they will not.\n\n  It is the same thing here. We are not smart enough to fix these \nprices and we are playing with the quality of health care of our senior \ncitizens.\n  My fear is we are going to keep this ratcheted down so much that we \nwill have an experience like we had not so long ago with the HMOs of \nthis country, where they were squeezing the benefits and patients got \npretty angry about it. They said, we don't want to have to go to a \ndoctor we don't know, we don't want to have them tell us they can't see \nus for 6 weeks. We don't want them to say it would be nice to have a \nMRI or CAT scan but all we can give you is a X-ray. That is where the \ncall for the Patients' Bill of Rights came in, and I supported it \nbecause I don't think patients should get squeezed down in their health \ncare just because we are trying to save money.\n  Of course we want to save money. We are talking about taxpayer money \nhere. But the whole concept of the preferred provider option, the \nprivate sector option, was to be able to save money in the long run for \nthe Medicare system. That is why the President proposed it and why we, \nespecially on the Republican side, said this is something we need to do \nto strengthen Medicare. We need to provide an option that will enable \nus to keep the costs of this under control as Medicare goes into the \nfuture. And for the reasons the majority leader articulated so well a \nmoment ago, we believe these preferred provider organizations will be \nable to do that. So they can balance good quality care with \nefficiencies and effectiveness at cost control as well. That was the \nwhole idea for it.\n  But we cannot get into a situation where we tie both hands behind \ntheir back and then tell them to go out and serve our senior citizens. \nWe say: You can go do that but you can't get paid any more than X, and \nX doesn't go up unless we cause it to go up.\n  That is the reason for the fix that I proposed. It was in the \namendment originally but then it was determined\n\n[[Page S8545]]\n\nthat this had to be sunsetted. My amendment eliminates the sunset, \nallows the authorization for the pure competitive bidding to continue \non. That is as simple as it is and is the primary reason why I did it.\n  Let me note a couple of other items. Some people, especially my \nfriends on the Democratic side, have said, wait a minute here, this has \nto be balanced. And I said I agree. The drug benefit, according to CBO, \nright now in the bill, the underlying bill, is $402 billion over 10 \nyears. It slightly exceeds the $400 billion. In the same bill we are \nspending $7.8 billion over 10 years on the PPOs and Medicare+Choice, \nwhich are the HMOs.\n  So it is $402 billion on the drug benefit, $7.8 billion on the PPOs \nand HMOs. I think we could afford to put a little bit more money toward \nensuring that the PPOs can be successful here, that they will bid and \nprovide these services to our senior citizens.\n  Another point: When we put these price controls on the providers, as \nwe do today under Medicare, as I said, there is no free lunch. Somebody \nhas to pay. What happens is that the private sector health insurance in \nour society is subsidizing Medicare. The hospitals and the doctors and \nall the other providers have to make it up somewhere and that is where \nthey make it up. This raises the cost of private insurance. A lot of \npeople find that very hard to pay. In fact, it takes some people out of \nthe private insurance markets. So, ironically, one of the reasons not \nas many Americans are insured as should be is because the premiums are \ntoo high because the private sector has to subsidize the care that we \nare providing on the Government side of the equation through Medicare \nand Medicaid.\n  This price cap is going to further that subsidization, ironically at \na time when millions of retirees are going to be leaving the private \nmarket because their employer will no longer want to provide a benefit \nthat the Government is providing for at a taxpayer subsidy. So there is \ngoing to be a lot smaller private sector market to subsidize a lot \nbigger amount, which will cause more people to lose their insurance \nbecause of the higher cost of premiums. It does not make sense to \nunderfund Medicare.\n  The final problem: Remember at the very beginning I mentioned the \nFEHBP, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. It is interesting \nthat throughout the history of the FEHBP we have not had any of the \nproblems I have been talking about here. Congress has rarely had to do \nanything to modify the FEHBP system. It works very well. Yet every year \nor so we have had to modify the reimbursement to Medicare providers in \nresponse to what we did through the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. We \nhave had to do it ever since because we are not smart enough to know \nwhat every doctor in this country and every hospital ought to get paid \nto take care of us. Yet that is what we tried to say in the statute. So \nwe have to keep changing it. Why would we want to not go with a system \nthat we know has worked very well? We can do that by allowing this open \nbidding and allow the free market to work.\n  I think for all of these reasons it would be very wise for us to \nremove the sunset on the Grassley-Baucus amendment and let this process \nwork, even a little bit, and show our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives and, frankly, all the country that we are committed to \nthis principle of the free market ensuring the best deal for the \nAmerican taxpayers but also the best deal for our senior citizens.\n  I am just going to close with this thought: Medicare is a mandatory \nsystem in the United States of America. There is essentially no option. \nWhen you are 65 years old, it is Medicare or no care. A doctor cannot \ntake care of you outside of Medicare after you turn 65. There is only \none exception, and that is if the doctor says: I will not treat any \nMedicare patients for a period of 2 years.\n  Now, we do not want to force our doctors into doing that. We want \nthem to stay in Medicare, taking care of Medicare patients. But the \nonly way a doctor can treat people outside of Medicare is to swear--\nthere is a formal process for doing it--that he will not treat any \nMedicare patients for 2 years. We do not want them to do that, but that \nis the only way. You would have to find such a doctor. If your \ncondition is diabetes, and that doctor is an orthopedic surgeon, you \nprobably will not have too good of luck.\n  So most seniors do not have the option of searching around trying to \nfind a doctor who works outside of Medicare because most of them do not \ndo it. Fortunately, most of them stay in Medicare. But this is the only \ncircumstance under which you can find a doctor outside of Medicare.\n  Since we are saying--literally mandating--that our moms and dads--\npretty soon some of us--have to take the Government program for our \nhealth care after we turn 65--and nothing is more important to us than \nour health and our family's health--my mom's health--it bothers me a \nlot that we are setting up a system to take care of my mother that we \nknow in advance is bound not to work. It promises a benefit it cannot \ndeliver. But because of the scoring problem, we have to do it that way.\n  There is a better alternative: to take the time to do it right, to \nmake the personal commitment to do it right, to understand there is no \nsuch thing as a free lunch--that I want to deliver the best quality \ncare for my mother as I can because she does not have an option.\n  If she had an option to go into some other system, as they do in \nGreat Britain, then I would not be quite as concerned.\n  But we are forcing everybody into a system, and then we are saying--\nas we tie its hands behind its back--now you make sure you can go out \nand serve, when CBO says only 2 percent of the people will sign up for \nthat. So that means everybody is going to continue on with traditional \nMedicare.\n  Now, maybe that works for them, but we know there are going to be \nsome huge problems not too far down the road with traditional Medicare. \nAre we going to be able to deliver the benefits we promised? If you \nlook at the numbers, we are going to have big tax increases or we are \ngoing to have to go deeply into debt in order to do that.\n  There is an alternative, and that is this option I have been talking \nabout. Because we are playing with real people's lives, and because the \nultimate value here is the quality of medical care we are going to \nensure our senior citizens get--because it is the only way they can get \nmedical care--we have the highest obligation to give this matter our \nmost serious attention and not simply rush it through because we want \nto finish the bill before the July Fourth recess--although I certainly \nunderstand the Secretary and our leadership's desire to try to do that \nto get the bill in conference--but to take enough time and to give it \nenough thought to do it right.\n  This is forever, in a sense. It is for a long, long time. And for \nthose friends of mine who say, ``Oh, don't worry about it; we are going \nto make a lot of changes in this,'' how many changes have we made in \nsome of the sort of ``sacred cow'' laws in the United States--things \nthat everybody supports and so nobody wants to even suggest to change: \nSocial Security, Endangered Species Act, Medicare itself?\n  It is easy to demagog these issues, and, as a result, Members are not \nvery keen to make changes with them; you are accused of trying to \ndestroy the program or whatever it might be. So I think my colleagues \nwho say, ``Oh, don't worry; we'll fix it later,'' miscalculate the \ncourage they are going to have later when they realize it has to be \nfixed.\n  The time to do it is now. The time to get it right is now. The \nPresident is right, this was the way to do it. And so, to support the \nPresident's program, I am offering this amendment to get back to what \nthat program was. I hope my colleagues will support me in this because \nnothing less than quality health care for my mother and the rest of the \nsenior citizens in this country is at stake.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate your patience, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to voice my support for the \ninclusion of disease management as a permanent part of the Medicare \nfee-for-service program. I consider disease management a way to reform \nthe fee-for-service program. I am concerned about the long-term fiscal \nviability of the Medicare program. As we add a much needed drug benefit \nto the Medicare program, we must do so in a way\n\n[[Page S8546]]\n\nthat seniors can afford and that our country can afford. Consistent \nwith a letter I signed to the President, I continue to look for ways \nthat we can take this opportunity to reform the current program and \nensure we keep the program strong for future beneficiaries.\n  I understand that the Medicare bill we are debating incorporates \ndisease management as part of the new Medicare Advantage Program, so \nthat private plans offer these services to beneficiaries and that there \nare several demonstrations to test out a variety of care management \ntechniques in the traditional, fee-for-service program. That is a \npositive step in the right direction. But I think we need to go \nfurther.\n  I believe strongly that seniors will get better care in a private \nplan option under this bill, and I encourage them to do so. But I also \nknow there will be seniors that choose to stay in traditional, fee-for-\nservice Medicare. And these will likely be older seniors, the ones that \ndo suffer from multiple chronic conditions and are in the most need for \nefficient management of their health care. I ask you, can we afford to \nallow these beneficiaries' health to worsen and to subsequently bear \nthe enormous costs of their care? We cannot. I believe that adding \ndisease management to the traditional-fee-for-service program is a way \nto reform the system, and to help bring down costs for these seniors. \nDisease management can reform the system to improve the long-term \nsustainability of Medicare.\n  Last week the House Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce Committees \nboth voted in support of legislation that would incorporate disease \nmanagement into all of Medicare--both private plans and the \ntraditional, fee-for-service programs. I ask that as we move into \nconference, I hope we can accept the House language that phases in \ndisease management as a permanent part of the Medicare fee-for-service \nprogram.\n  Without a doubt, it is critical to the health of seniors and to the \npockets of taxpayers that we implement effective reforms such as \ndisease management in Medicare now--to more rationally and effectively \nmanage care for beneficiaries with chronic conditions, and to ensure \nthe fiscal sustainability of the Medicare Program.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from North \nDakota in support of critical drug coverage for beneficiaries who \ncontend with the debilitating effects of multiple sclerosis.\n  This amendment would provide transitional coverage for the four FDA-\napproved therapies in the 2-year interim until 2006, when the \nprescription drug plan will take effect.\n  Approximately 400,000 Americans have MS. In my home State of Oregon, \nit is estimated that there are 5,800 people living with MS.\n  Currently, Medicare covers only one of the four FDA-approved MS \ntherapies and only when administered by a physician. This amendment \nwould cover all four MS therapies, including when they are administered \nby the patients themselves, providing better coverage and better care \nfor Americans with multiple sclerosis.\n  While these therapies do not cure MS, they can slow its course, and \nhave provided great benefit to MS patients. It is critical that MS \npatients have access to all approved drugs because some MS patients do \nnot respond well to, or cannot tolerate, the one MS therapy that is \ncurrently covered.\n  Currently, many Medicare beneficiaries with MS are forced to take the \nless effective therapy, to pay the costs out of pocket or forgo \ntreatment.\n  Equally, this amendment is important to rural Medicare beneficiaries \nwith MS. By administering drugs themselves, rural beneficiaries can \navoid the costs and hassles of traveling long distances to health care \nfacilities to receive their MS therapy.\n  In the spirit of providing all Medicare beneficiaries with increased \nchoice, MS patients need and deserve the full range of treatment \nchoices currently available and self-administration helps ensure access \nto needed medications.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in support \nof this amendment and to provide adequate and comprehensive drug \ncoverage for MS patients.\n\n\n              ADEQUACY OF MEDICARE PAYMENTS TO PHYSICIANS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to engage \nthe distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee in a colloquy \nregarding concerns about the adequacy of Medicare payments to \nphysicians.\n  Each year, Medicare payments to physicians are adjusted through use \nof a ``payment update formula'' that is based on the Medicare Economic \nIndex, MEI, and the sustainable growth rate, SGR. This formula has a \nnumber of flaws that create inaccurate and inappropriate payment \nupdates that do not reflect the actual costs of providing medical \nservices to the growing number of Medicare patients.\n  As discussed above, the formula has resulted in numerous payment cuts \nto Medicare physicians. Earlier this year, Congress passed legislation \nas part of the fiscal year 2003 omnibus appropriations bill, H.J. Res. \n2, that avoided an impending 4.4-percent cut in the Medicare conversion \nfactor. This was accomplished by adding 1 million previously missed \nMedicare beneficiaries to the mix and recalculating the appropriate \nformulas. Although this change resulted in a welcomed 1.6-percent \nincrease in the Medicare conversion factor for 2003, the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services', CMS, preliminary Medicare conversion \nfactor figure predicts a 4.2-percent reduction for 2004. The reason for \nthis latest reduction stems from the fact that the current formula that \noriginally resulted in the need to fix the 2003 conversion factor cut, \nis flawed. The latest scheduled round of payment cuts will make \nPennsylvania's Medicare practice climate untenable.\n  In its March 2003 report, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, \nMedPac, stated that if ``Congress does not change current law, then \npayments may not be adequate in 2003 and a compensating adjustment in \npayments would be necessary in 2004.'' We owe it to America's \nphysicians to fix the system so that they can continue to provide \nMedicare beneficiaries with the vital care they need.\n  With 17 percent of its population eligible for Medicare, the \nPennsylvania Medical Society has calculated that Pennsylvania's \nphysicians have already suffered a $128.6 million hit, or $4,074 per \nphysician, as a result of the 2002 Medicare payment reduction. If not \ncorrected, the flawed formula will cost Pennsylvania physicians another \n$553 million or $17,396 per physician for the period 2003-2005. They \nsimply cannot afford these payment cuts. I know you have worked very \nhard in preparing a bipartisan Medicare bill that represents a good \nsolid beginning to improving our Nation's health care system. However, \nI firmly believe this is an issue that Congress must address.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania \nfor raising this important issue. He is correct that I have been \nworking with the physician community, as well as the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, to obtain a fuller understanding regarding the \nadequacy of the current physician formula under Medicare. We have \nlearned that Medicare's current payment formula for physicians is \nproblematic, and I agree that this issue should be addressed. We will \ncontinue our discussion, and objectively evaluate proposals that will \nupdate the payment formula for physicians.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the chairman for his willingness to work with me \non this issue as the Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act \nmoves forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on July 12, the 5th U.S. Army will \ndemobilize the 129th Mobile Public Affairs Detachment of the South \nDakota National Guard. This unit, headquartered in Rapid City, was \namong more than 20 Guard and Reserve units from my State called to \nactive duty in support\n\n[[Page S8547]]\n\nof Operation Enduring Freedom/Noble Eagle and Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Today, these soldiers and their service become a part of South \nDakota's military heritage. Like those who served in the two World \nWars, in Korea, in Vietnam and numerous other places, this new \ngeneration has answered the call. They have offered to make every \nsacrifice, including life itself, to protect our freedom and security. \nWe must never forget them or the honor with which they served.\n  This unit participated in a mobilization with few precedents in South \nDakota history. Nearly 2,000 Guard and Reserve troops were called to \nactive duty in our State, by far the largest mobilization since World \nWar II. At the time the fighting began, units from more than 20 \ncommunities had been called up, from Elk Point in the South to Lemmon \nin the North, from Watertown in the East to Custer in the West. Indeed, \nour State's mobilization rate ranked among the highest of all the \nStates on a per-capita basis.\n  These soldiers were proud to serve, and their communities are proud \nof them. Across the State, thousands of citizens pitched in to \nparticipate in send-off parades, to lend a hand for families who \nsuddenly had to get by without a mom or dad, and even to assist with \nfinancial hardships caused by the mobilization. This mobilization was a \nstatewide effort, in many ways.\n  In addition to the service of this particular unit, I want to \nacknowledge the sacrifices and dedication of the families who stayed \nhome. They are the unsung heroes of any mobilization. They motivate and \ninspire those who are far from home, and they, too, deserve our \ngratitude.\n  Today, I join these families and the State of South Dakota in \ncelebrating the courage, commitment, and success of the members of the \n129th Mobile Public Affairs Detachment, and I honor their participation \nin this historic event in our Nation's history. Welcome home. Thanks to \nall of you for your courage, your sacrifice, and your noble commitment \nto this country and its ideals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/25/senate-section/article/S8547-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8547-S8548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL PEACE ESSAY CONTEST\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am honored today to present to my \ncolleagues in the Senate an essay by Collette N. Roberts of Rapid City, \nSD. Collette is a student at St. Thomas More High School, and she has \nbeen awarded first place in the 16th annual National Peace Essay \nContest for South Dakota. ``Justification of War: the Anglo-Zulu and \nKosovo Wars'' examines the Anglo-Zulu war of the late 19th century as a \nparadigm for understanding Kosovo's struggle against the military \ncampaign of Slobodan Milosevic's Serbia. Collette has tackled a vitally \nimportant subject with insight and maturity. I can only hope that she \ncontinues to share her wisdom with the world, and I commend her essay \nto my colleagues' attention. I ask unanimous consent that Collette \nRoberts's essay be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Justicifaction of War: The Anglo-Zulu and Kosovo Wars\n\n                        (By Collette N. Roberts)\n\n       ``. . . this has never been and never can be/one territory \n     under two masters'' (Judah, 2000, p. 4). The line in the poem \n     by Anne Pennington and Peter Levi holds the ring of truth. \n     Many wars have been waged over a piece of land such as the \n     Anglo-Zulu and Kosovo Wars. The circumstances surrounding \n     these wars are similar, but are justified only in part. In \n     both wars, one side had reached the last resort: either \n     defend their homeland or face subjugation. Both were waged by \n     legitimate authorities; however, nothing justifies the \n     genocide of a race and the slaughter of innocent civilians. \n     Upon examination, the justness of the Anglo-Zulu and Kosovo \n     Wars and NATO involvement in Kosovo is subjective, contingent \n     upon the motives and actions of each party.\n       The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries mark the \n     imperialistic age for Great Britain. by the 1870s, most of \n     South Africa had succumbed to British rule. Zululand, \n     however, one of the last independent African states in the \n     region, presented challenge to an advancing white frontier \n     (The Diagram Group, 1997, p. 105). Not only did the \n     independent state disrupt Britain's confederation plans for \n     the region, but also prevented sugar farmers from using the \n     spacious tracts of land within the boundaries of Zululand. \n     Furthermore, as long as the Zulu remained independent, they \n     could not be sued for cheap labor. Zululand became a dollar \n     sign in the eyes of the British. When the Zulu defied British \n     subjugation, war inevitably ensued (Gump, 1949, p. 3).\n       British military forces, commanded by Frederick Thesiger \n     (better known as Lord Chlemsford), began the invasion of \n     Zululand in 1879. The Zulu, under the rule of King Cetshwayo, \n     rose to defend their homeland. The first major battle \n     occurred at Islandhlwana. Losses were heavy to both armies; \n     but the Zulu, underestimated by the British, claimed victory. \n     To justify his actions, Dabulamanzi, a Zulu general, said, \n     ``It is the whites who have come to fight with me in my own \n     country and not I that do to fight with them'' (Gump, 1994, \n     p. 54).\n       Despite the intensity and valor with which the Zulu fought, \n     the battle oNdini marked the end of the Anglo-Zulu War. \n     Poorly provision and outgunned, the Zulu military system was \n     broken. Between six and ten thousand Zulu men died defending \n     their homeland (Knight, 1995, p. 270). Following the war, \n     the British began decentralizing the Zulu royal house. \n     Zululand was carved into thirteen regions, each headed by \n     British sympathizers. Finally subjugated, young Zulu men \n     soon found themselves traveling outside Zululand in search \n     of work. The system of migrant labor, as in other parts of \n     south Africa, had at last taken hold of Zululand. The \n     economic seeds of apartheid, the racist system of black \n     oppression, had been sown (Knight, 1995, p. 272).\n       Those, like the Zulu, who are invaded by a conquering power \n     are faced with only two choices: subjugation or was (Gump, \n     1994, p. 3). Though the chances for success were poor for the \n     Zulu, war was the only chance to defend their homeland and \n     preserve their way of life. When the British could not easily \n     lay their hands on what they wanted, they believed they had \n     reached the last resort, and therefore initiated war. These \n     attitudes are common throughout all imperialistic societies. \n     Britain justified its actions through claims to ``savage'' \n     Zulu; to expose them to a ``new and better way of living'' \n     (Gump, 1994, p. 14). However, war, from the imperialistic \n     standpoint not be the final option when a piece of land and \n     the promise of a profit are found to be superior to human \n     life.\n       The Anglo-Zulu War is not the only confliction history that \n     has occurred over a piece of land. For centuries, opposition \n     has brewed between the Serbs and Albanians of the Balkans. \n     The source of conflict is Kosovo, a province of Serbia, \n     sharing borders with Albania (Andryszewski, 2000, p. 9). The \n     claim of the area is bitterly disputed between the Serbs and \n     the Albanians. Serbs hold that, despite the ethnic shift only \n     a few generations ago, the people of Kosovo have been \n     primarily serbian. The Albanians, on the other hand, argue \n     that their ancestors, the ancient Illyrians and the \n     Dardanians, habituated the region prior to the Slavic \n     invasions of the sixth and seventh centuries. Therefore, they \n     believe, Albanians have the right to what they call ``first \n     possession.'' The truth concerning the claim of Kosovo is \n     unclear. However, as in most cases, the truth is not what \n     matters, but rather is what the people believe the truth to \n     be (Judah, 2000, p. 2).\n       In April, 1987, a politician from Belgrade delivered a \n     speech glorifying the Serbian nation. Because of high \n     tensions between the Albanians and the Serbs, biased \n     speechmaking had been against certain unspoken ``rules'' in \n     Yugoslavia. However, by the end of the year, he became the \n     most powerful politician in Serbia (Andryszewski, 2000, p. \n     18). In 1991, Milosevic began his war in Bosnia for a \n     ``Greater Serbia.'' By the time the Dayton Peace Agreement \n     had been approved and signed, hundreds of thousands of \n     Muslims and Croats had fallen victim to the program of \n     ``ethnic cleansing,'' driven from their homes, tortured, \n     raped, and murdered (Andryszewski, 2000, p. 20). Despite \n     the declaration of peace, Milosevic's ambitions for a \n     ``Greater Serbia'' had not been eliminated. His ambitions \n     soon turned toward Kosovo.\n       Kosovo remained under the harsh rule of Serbia. In 1997, \n     the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), a small guerrilla force, \n     began to wage a war against Serbian authorities. Alone, the \n     KLA's chances for a sweeping victory were slim. However, the \n     worthy cause of self-defense justifies their actions. The \n     occasional skirmishes between the KLA and Serbian authorities \n     culminated in the Serbian massacre in Drenica where dozens of \n     ethnic Albanian civilians were slaughtered (Andryszewski, \n     2000, p. 30). Despite NATO threats of airstrikes to end the \n     fighting, the violence between the Albanians and Serbs \n     continued to escalate. In January, 1999, Serbs massacred \n     forty-five ethnic Albanians in the Kosovar village of Racak. \n     NATO, acting as a peace-keeper gave the Serbs and Kosovar \n     Albanians an ultimatum: make peace or face NATO military \n     action. The Albanians were willing to make peace, but all \n     agreements proved futile when Milosevic refused to sign \n     (Andryszewski, 2000, p. 33).\n       Far from any kind of last resort, Milosevic, wielding the \n     power of a legitimate authority, instigated a massive Serb \n     military attack on Kosovo. Kosovar Albanians, both military \n     and civilian, were his paramount targets. A campaign of \n     ethnic cleansing, echoing that of Bosnia, was launched on the \n     Kosovar Albanians. Homes were burned, women were raped, and \n     men were slaughtered; mass graves, freshly dug, could be seen \n     from the air (Andryszewski, 2000, p. 48). Milosevic justified \n     his unjust actions through his call for a ``Greater Serbia.'' \n     Again, the desire for a piece of land was put before the \n     sanctity of human life.\n\n[[Page S8548]]\n\n       When peace became impossible and violence continued, NATO \n     was left with the last resort. As promised, NATO took \n     military action to halt the Serbian offensive and its mass \n     genocide of the Albanians. A reasonable chance for success \n     was existent. Furthermore, there was the belief that the \n     consequences of these aggressive actions would be better than \n     the situation that would exist had these actions not \n     been implemented. In March 1999, NATO airplanes and cruise \n     missiles began bombing Serbian military targets. \n     Ultimately, through the joint efforts of the KLA and NATO, \n     Serbia withdrew from Kosovo seventy-eight days later and \n     signed NATO peace agreements. By the time peace had been \n     achieved, 900,000 Albanians had been removed from their \n     homes in Kosovo (Andryszewski, 2000, p. 54). Another ten \n     thousand lay dead--murdered by Serbs during their ethnic \n     cleansing of Kosovo (Andryzsewski, 2000, p. 57).\n       Critics may argue that the decision to bomb Serbia may not \n     have been the most effective course of action. Regrettably, \n     serious mistakes were made and the bombings killed civilians, \n     both Serb and Albanian. Furthermore, a bomb hit the Chinese \n     embassy in Belgrade, killing three and wounding nearly two \n     dozen (Andryszewski, 2000, p. 50). Despite these tragic \n     events, had NATO not put pressure on Serbia to end its \n     campaign of ethnic cleansing, the number of genocide victims \n     would have only increased.\n       As demonstrated, one territory cannot serve two masters. \n     The Anglo-Zulu and Kosovo Wars were waged because two parties \n     tried to control one piece of land. Each party had reasons \n     for taking part in the fight. Many factors come into play \n     that do or do not justify these reasons. The Zulus and \n     Albanians were justified by reaching the last resort and \n     defense of their homeland. Though neither of these parties \n     had any reasonable chance of victory, the justness of their \n     cause is in no way lessened. NATO military action was \n     justified in its attempts to check the violence. Britain and \n     Milosevic, though legitimate authorities, valued land over \n     human life. Their motives were unjust. Justice is blind, but \n     will forever be weighed by our motives and actions.\n\n\n                               references\n\n       Andryszewski, T. (2000).

The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance.

Mr. President, on Monday, in a landmark decision, the \nSupreme Court made clear that colleges and universities can adopt \nadmissions policies that take students' racial and ethnic background \ninto account to achieve a diverse student body. The Court's decision is \na resounding vindication for the fundamental principle that affirmative \naction can be used in education to promote opportunity for all, and \nencourage interaction among students of diverse backgrounds.\n  Our diversity is our greatest strength, and this decision recognizes \nthe broad benefits of diversity in higher education. A diverse student \nbody benefits all students at our colleges and universities and helps \nprepare students for our increasingly diverse workforce and our diverse \nsociety.\n  As the opinion of Justice O'Connor states, ``Major American \nbusinesses have made clear that the skills needed in today's \nincreasingly global marketplace can only be developed through exposure \nto widely diverse people, cultures, ideas and viewpoints.'' High-\nranking military leaders, too, have stated that affirmative action is \nnecessary for promoting a ``qualified, racially diverse officer \ncorps,'' to enable the Armed Forces to protect national security.\n  The Court's decision supports the paramount importance of education \nas a gateway to equal opportunity, reaffirming once again the Court's \nhistoric decision nearly 50 years ago in Brown v. Board of Education. \nFew areas are as vital to sustaining our democracy that education. Our \ninstitutions of higher education, like our public schools, are \nindispensable in broadening the minds of young adults, and training \nthem for leadership.\n  As the Court stated in Brown, and emphasized again in Monday's \nopinion, ``Education is the very foundation of good citizenship.'' The \nNation is becoming increasingly diverse, and it is important for all \nour institutions to reflect that rich diversity.\n  The Court stated: ``In order to cultivate a set of leaders with \nlegitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry, it is necessary that the path \nto leadership be visibly open to talented and qualified individuals of \nevery race and ethnicity. Access to education must be inclusive of \ntalented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity, so that \nall members of our heterogeneous society may participate in the \neducation institutions that provide the training and education \nnecessary to succeed in America.''\n\n  The Supreme Court has made clear that a well-crafted affirmative \naction admissions program like that of the University of Michigan Law \nSchool is constitutional. It is flexible and allows for individualized \nreview of each applicant, and it is not a quota. The Court also made \nclear that States do not have to promote diversity only by relying on \npercentage plan programs which guarantee college admission to all \nstudents above a certain class-rank in every high school graduating \nclass in the State.\n  As the Court recognized, such programs do not work for graduate and \nprofessional schools. In fact, percentage plans can prevent colleges \nand universities from making the individualized assessment of \napplicants that is necessary to assemble a diverse student body.\n  Our country has made extraordinary progress over the past half \ncentury toward equality of opportunity in all aspects of our society, \nand affirmative action has been an indispensable part of that success. \nBut we all know that we have to do more to make the promise of Brown a \nreality. Even with affirmative action, vast inequities remain in access \nto higher education especially for African-Americans and Latinos.\n  We know that civil rights is still the unfinished business in \nAmerica. Half a century after Brown, our schools remain starkly divided \nalong racial and ethnic lines, and minority children are too often \nrelegated to inadequate schools. We have to do more to see that \nminority children are not forced to think of an institution like the \nUniversity of Michigan as an impossible dream. This decision by the \nSupreme Court is another major step by the Court to make that dream \npossible, and it is difficult to believe that either this Congress or \nthis President would approve a Supreme Court nominee who would reverse \nthat decision.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it has been nearly 50 years since the \nSupreme Court ruled segregation in schools unconstitutional in Brown v. \nBoard of Education of Topeka, Kansas. Then-Chief Justice Earl Warren \nsaid: ``We conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine \nof `separate but equal' has no place. Separate educational facilities \nare inherently unequal.''\n  This week, the tenet of equality that lies at the foundation of the \nBrown decision was reaffirmed and strengthened. In fact, it is becoming \nmore and\n\n[[Page S8549]]\n\nmore infused into our Nation's increasingly diverse identity.\n  This week, the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed the principle that \ndiversity is a compelling national interest and that race can be a \nfactor in higher education admissions decisions. The Court upheld the \nadmissions policy at the University of Michigan Law School in Grutter \nv. Bollinger.\n  Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, on behalf of the 5-to-4 majority and \nciting Brown, wrote: ``This Court has long recognized that 'education . \n. . is the very foundation of good citizenship.''\n  Justice O'Connor and the Supreme Court found the use of race in the \nMichigan Law School admissions policy consistent with the aspirations \nof the 1954 Supreme Court in deciding Brown. O'Connor stated for the \nCourt:\n\n       In order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in \n     the eyes of the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to \n     leadership be visibly open to talented and qualified \n     individuals of every race and ethnicity. All members of our \n     heterogeneous society must have confidence in the openness \n     and integrity of the educational institutions with which the \n     law interacts . . . Access to legal education (and thus, the \n     legal profession) must be inclusive of talented and qualified \n     individuals of every race and ethnicity, so that all members \n     of our heterogenous society may participate in the \n     educational institutions that provide the training and \n     education necessary to succeed in America.\n\n  The Court's decision keeps this country on a path toward the day when \nour children and our children's children will not be able to envision a \npre-Brown v. Board America. In fact, Justice O'Connor cites the Brown \nopinion in writing the Grutter decision. Justice O'Connor's words \nreflect a powerful American value that is really a strength of our \nNation--diversity. It is in the best interest of all Americans to seek \ndiversity in all segments of our society, including educational \ninstitutions, the military, and the workplace. To fail to do so, in \nfact, would be to misrepresent our national identity.\n  I am heartened, by the large number of amicus briefs filed in support \nof affirmative action. These briefs showed the Court the deep \nimportance of diversity to so many people and institutions across the \nNation. I am pleased to have had the opportunity to join Senator \nKennedy and several of our colleagues in signing one such brief, urging \nthe court to uphold the Bakke decision and support Michigan's admission \npolicies.\n  One of the greatest strengths of our Nation is its guarantee of equal \neducational opportunities for all students. Our Nation's colleges and \nuniversities are the envy of the world for their rigorous courses of \nstudy and high-caliber professors, but also for their enriching \nenvironment of students from a range of racial, ethnic, and social and \neconomic backgrounds representing every part of America, if not the \nworld. I am proud that the Court has affirmed the importance of campus \ndiversity and deemed it a constitutionally permissible governmental \ninterest.\n  In the Grutter case, the Court decisively allowed race and ethnicity \nto be considered in combination with other factors in an admissions \ndecision. I don't believe that the decision striking down the specific \npoint system used in the undergraduate admissions policy will be a \nserious impediment to the implementation of race-sensitive admissions \npolicies at colleges and universities.\n  In the 50 years since the walls of segregation began to crumble, we \nhave traveled many miles on the road toward guaranteeing civil rights \nto all Americans. But this week's decision affirming diversity as a \ncompelling national interest--and thus declaring affirmative action \nconstitutional and viable--confirms our Nation's progress in ways \nunmeasurable by miles or years. The Court's decision is more than a \nvictory. It is a milestone. It is a testament to the strength of Brown \nand our Constitution's equal protection guarantees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/25/senate-section/article/S8549-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8549-S8550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        HONORING AMERICAN AND KOREAN VETERANS OF THE KOREAN WAR\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

From the moment that the Korean peninsula was \ndivided in 1945, that battle had begun.\n  While Korea was one of the first examples of Imperial Japan's lust \nfor land when it became a Japanese possession in the wake of the Russo-\nJapanese War at the beginning of the twentieth century, it was a side \nshow in World War II. The U.S. had no plan for what to do with Korea \nwhen the war was over.\n  Although we had had U.S. representatives--governmental, business and \nmissionary--in Korea from 1882 until the outbreak of the war, we made \nno plans for what would happen when at war's end, we might return to \nKorea.\n  The United States remained committed to the December 1945 decision of \nthe Allied foreign ministers in Moscow that a trusteeship under four \npowers, including China, should be established with a view toward \nKorea's eventual independence. As a result, we were slow to draw-up \nlong-range alternative plans for South Korea.\n  We had made no decisions on how to govern Korea, or to assist Korea \nin governing itself. We had not made plans for the defense of the \ncountry, nor for its economic development. We didn't even have a plan \nfor how we might accept a Japanese surrender on the peninsula.\n  The most convenient way to deal with the surrender issue was to allow \nthe Soviets to accept the surrender in the north and for U.S. forces to \ntake the surrender in the south. Such a division of Korea, which to \nmodern eyes, seems so normal on our maps, was totally foreign to the \nlong history of Korea. Further, the division, which was drawn on a \nlarge-scale map in the Pentagon and had no rational basis on the actual \nterrain, did not represent any known political division of the \npeninsula. When it took place, it left freedom loving Koreans in the \nnorth and communist insurgents in the south.\n  The Korean war did not begin with the full scale invasion of the \nRepublic of Korea on June 25, 1950. It had been underway as an \ninsurgency in the south since, at least, 1946. One of the first tasks \nfacing the United States was to train and replace existing Japanese \npolice and security forces.

The young American officers, mostly \nreservists, with few regulars had little in the way of education, \nlanguage or experience for their task, but they had good will and a \ndevotion to duty which they infused in their Korean troops. In \ncontrast, the army that the North Koreans were forming north of the \ndivide was well equipped with Soviet equipment and led by well trained \nand well indoctrinated communist zealots.\n  While all out invasion would wait until 1950, substantial insurgency \nand guerrilla warfare was a constant theme in the southern half of the \npeninsula from 1946 to 1948.

Mr. President, 8 months ago I took the floor in this \nChamber to call attention to some disturbing trends with regard to \ndemocracy and civil liberties in Hong Kong. I said that Hong Kong's \nrulers, at the behest of Beijing, were set upon a path that risked \ndestroying the spirit and vitality that make Hong Kong unique. I urged \nthose who care about Hong Kong, and about freedom, to speak out and \nalert Hong Kong authorities to the error of their ways. Many did so.\n  Today, I regret to report, Hong Kong is one step closer to becoming \njust another Chinese city. Hong Kong's Legislative Council is expected \nto vote into law next month antisubversion legislation that would \nsignificantly erode the barriers that insulate Hong Kong's residents \nfrom the antidemocratic legal concepts and practices of the People's \nRepublic of China.\n  As I said here last October, China's leaders pressured their hand-\npicked Chief Executive in Hong Kong, Tung Chee-Hwa, to introduce this \nlegislation last year. Hong Kong authorities maintained that they had \nno choice but to comply, since Article 23 of the Basic Law that became \nHong Kong's constitution after the territory reverted from British to \nChinese control in 1997 required Hong Kong to adopt laws to protect \nnational security. Many Hong Kong legal experts disagreed. But be that \nas it may, the same Basic Law says the territory will move toward \nelecting its legislature and executive by universal suffrage. At \npresent, only one-third of the legislators were chosen by direct \npopular vote, and only 800 of Hong Kong's 7 million residents were \nallowed to cast ballots in Tung Chee-Hwa's reelection as Chief \nExecutive last year. The Government has yet to announce any plans to \nexpand suffrage.\n  The sequence of these steps is important. Pushing through legislation \ncurtailing civil liberties to comply with Article 23 before \nestablishing a democratic legislature per Article 68 violates the most \nfundamental tenet of popular rule--that governmental authority is \nderived from the consent of the governed. The Hong Kong authorities \ninvited public comments on the legislation, both in its initial outline \nform and later detailed drafts. But despite serious objections from \njournalists, lawyers, chambers of commerce, human rights activists, \nreligious groups, and other interested parties, the bill on which the \nLegislative Council is expected to vote next month reflects only minor \nrevisions from the Government's original draft. Without a legislature \naccountable to the citizenry, the people were free to speak their \nviews, but the Government was free to ignore them.\n  As a result, most of the concerns I raised about the legislative \nproposal last October remain unaddressed:\n  Definitions of offenses such as ``subversion,'' ``sedition'' and \n``secession'' are extremely vague, permitting security officials to \nprosecute people arbitrarily, as they do on the Mainland.\n  Merely ``handling'' publications the authorities consider to be \n``seditious'' would be a criminal offense, as would ``intimidating'' \nthe Government in Beijing or acting to ``disestablish'' the ``basic \nsystem'' of China--meaning the political monopoly of the Communist \nParty--or endangering China's ``stability.''\n  ``Inciting'' subversion, even if only through speech, would be \ncriminalized. In China, workers have been given long prison sentences \nfor ``inciting subversion'' for simply demanding to be paid. Others \nhave received 10-year terms for criticizing the Government on the \nInternet.\n  Hong Kong affiliates of organizations that Beijing decides threaten \nnational security may be banned. This provision is likely to be used to \nban Falun Gong, and conceivably it could be applied to the Roman \nCatholic Church if it does not renounce its ties to Rome. Hong Kong \ngroups that monitor human rights and labor conditions in China have \nalso been labeled ``hostile foreign elements'' by Mainland authorities \nand thus could be targeted.\n  Police will be permitted to enter and search private residences and \nseize property without a warrant.\n  Journalists and others could be prosecuted for the unauthorized \ndisclosure of official secrets or information related to Hong Kong \naffairs that are the responsibility of the Central Government. Recall \nthat for 5 months, Mainland authorities treated information about SARS \nas an official secret, and the world learned about the epidemic only \nafter it spread to Hong Kong. Disclosing that information was clearly \nin the public's interest. But this bill does not allow a public \ninterest defense, nor is there any counterbalancing right-to-know or \nfreedom-of-information legislation. If this bill becomes law, how long \nwill it take us to find out about China's next epidemic?\n  These proposed revisions to Hong Kong's laws, demanded by Beijing, \nrun counter to China's commitment in the 1984 Sino-British Declaration \nto preserve Hong Kong's civil liberties for at least 50 years following \nthe handover. They would significantly undermine such internationally \nrecognized basic human rights as freedom of expression, freedom of \nassociation, and freedom of conscience, and potentially threaten \nfreedom of religion and the right to due process as well.\n  Hong Kong's democratic politicians, activists, attorneys, \njournalists, and other professionals are understandably alarmed about \nthis legislation. To hear some of them tell it, passage of this bill \nwill mean the end of Hong Kong as we know it. In reality, I suspect \nmost Hong Kong residents would wake up on July 10 to find life in their \ncity essentially unchanged. The effects of this legislation will appear \nonly gradually and incrementally. The first to feel the impact will \nprobably be groups on the margins of Hong Kong society, such as Falun \nGong practitioners. Perhaps most Hong Kongers will say nothing, because \nthey are not Falun Gong practitioners. But over time, they will come to \nfind themselves living in a poorer place, and the world will be poorer \nas a result.\n  If this legislation passes in its present form, it promises to make \nHong Kong poorer in more ways than one. Last December, the American \nChamber of Commerce in Hong Kong wrote the Government to express its \nconcern about the bill's potential impact on the free flow of \ninformation, which it said was essential for the operation of Hong \nKong's markets and for maintaining its competitiveness as a business \nlocation. The letter came a few weeks after a senior analyst at Bank of \nChina International resigned after China's Premier criticized one of \nhis reports. The British Chamber of Commerce warned Hong Kong could \nbecome ``a much less favorable location for international business'' if \ninvestors could not obtain free and unfettered information. Some \nanalysts have suggested that investment on the Chinese Mainland could \nsuffer as well, since foreign firms operating in China often rely on \ntheir Hong Kong offices for uncensored information about the Mainland.\n  Through the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, Congress made \nsupport for human rights and democratization in Hong Kong a fundamental \nprinciple of United States foreign policy. As a concrete expression of \nsupport for Hong Kong's continued autonomy, the act stipulated that \nHong Kong would continue to receive the same treatment under most \nUnited States laws after the handover as it had before. However, it \nallowed the President to suspend that provision on a case by case \nbasis, whenever he determined that Hong Kong was no longer sufficiently \nautonomous to justify being treated differently from the rest of China \nunder a particular law. This is not a decision the President should \ntake lightly. However, if the proposed legislation compromises the \nindependence of Hong Kong's judicial system or the integrity of its \nfinancial markets, as some analysts fear, the President would have no \nchoice but to review specific United States statutes to evaluate \nwhether separate treatment for Hong Kong can still be justified.\n  I hope we never get to that point. I hope that Hong Kong's freedom \nand its creativity can be preserved and that its people will be given \nmore say in how they are governed, not less. For that reason, I urge \nthose in the Hong Kong Government and Legislative Council who care \nabout Hong Kong's future--and I am sure most of them do--to turn back \nfrom the course they are on before it is too late.\n\n[[Page S8551]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/25/senate-section/article/S8550-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8550-S8551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      CIVIL LIBERTIES IN HONG KONG\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, 8 months ago I took the floor in this \nChamber to call attention to some disturbing trends with regard to \ndemocracy and civil liberties in Hong Kong. I said that Hong Kong's \nrulers, at the behest of Beijing, were set upon a path that risked \ndestroying the spirit and vitality that make Hong Kong unique. I urged \nthose who care about Hong Kong, and about freedom, to speak out and \nalert Hong Kong authorities to the error of their ways. Many did so.\n  Today, I regret to report, Hong Kong is one step closer to becoming \njust another Chinese city. Hong Kong's Legislative Council is expected \nto vote into law next month antisubversion legislation that would \nsignificantly erode the barriers that insulate Hong Kong's residents \nfrom the antidemocratic legal concepts and practices of the People's \nRepublic of China.\n  As I said here last October, China's leaders pressured their hand-\npicked Chief Executive in Hong Kong, Tung Chee-Hwa, to introduce this \nlegislation last year. Hong Kong authorities maintained that they had \nno choice but to comply, since Article 23 of the Basic Law that became \nHong Kong's constitution after the territory reverted from British to \nChinese control in 1997 required Hong Kong to adopt laws to protect \nnational security. Many Hong Kong legal experts disagreed. But be that \nas it may, the same Basic Law says the territory will move toward \nelecting its legislature and executive by universal suffrage. At \npresent, only one-third of the legislators were chosen by direct \npopular vote, and only 800 of Hong Kong's 7 million residents were \nallowed to cast ballots in Tung Chee-Hwa's reelection as Chief \nExecutive last year. The Government has yet to announce any plans to \nexpand suffrage.\n  The sequence of these steps is important. Pushing through legislation \ncurtailing civil liberties to comply with Article 23 before \nestablishing a democratic legislature per Article 68 violates the most \nfundamental tenet of popular rule--that governmental authority is \nderived from the consent of the governed. The Hong Kong authorities \ninvited public comments on the legislation, both in its initial outline \nform and later detailed drafts. But despite serious objections from \njournalists, lawyers, chambers of commerce, human rights activists, \nreligious groups, and other interested parties, the bill on which the \nLegislative Council is expected to vote next month reflects only minor \nrevisions from the Government's original draft.

De Laine in recognition of \n     his contributions to the nation.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.

De \n         Laine in recognition of his contributions to the nation\n       S. 709 would authorize the President to award posthumously \n     a gold medal to Joseph De Laine Jr. to honor Reverend Joseph \n     Anthony De Laine on behalf of the Congress for his civil \n     rights contributions to the nation. The legislation would \n     authorize the U.S. Mint to spend up to $30,000 to produce the \n     gold medal. To help recover the costs of the medal, S. 498 \n     would authorize the Mint to strike and sell bronze duplicates \n     of the medal at a price that covers production costs for both \n     the medal and the duplicates.\n       Based on the costs of recent medals produced by the Mint, \n     CBO estimates that the bill would not significantly increase \n     direct spending from the U.S. Mint Public Enterprise Fund. We \n     estimate that the gold medal would cost about $25,000 to \n     produce in fiscal years 2003 and 2004, including around \n     $5,000 for the cost of the gold and around $20,000 for the \n     costs to design, engrave, and manufacture the medal. CBO \n     expects that the Mint would recoup little of its costs by \n     selling bronze duplicates to the public.\n       S. 498 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and \n     would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal \n     governments.\n       The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Matthew \n     Pickford. This estimate was approved by Peter H. Fontaine, \n     Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/25/senate-section/article/S8551-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO JANINE LOUISE JOHNSON\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I pay \ntribute to Janine Johnson, who for over 12 years served the Senate, its \nMembers and staff as an assistant counsel in the Office of Legislative \nCounsel. Janine died on May 29, 2003 at the far too young age of 37.\n  In reality, there is little my words can add to the memorial Janine \nherself built through her outstanding legal skills, extraordinary \ndedication and uncommon kindness and personal grace. She will be \nremembered for her positive impact on the laws she helped so much to \nenact and for the example and fond memories she has left her colleagues \nand friends.\n  Janine came to work in the Senate Office of Legislative Counsel with \nan already full set of accomplishments: first in her high school class \nof 333 in Winchester, Massachusetts; National Merit Scholar; cum laude \ngraduate of both Harvard College and Harvard Law School; a federal \ncircuit court clerkship with Judge Cecil F. Poole on the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit; member of the Massachusetts \nBar.\n  We are fortunate that Janine built on that record by bringing her \nexcellent qualifications and talent to the Senate. Beginning in \nFebruary of 1991, she drafted many bills and amendments for committees \nand individual members and their staffs. Her work, which was primarily \nin the areas of the environment, public works, agriculture, nutrition \nand natural resources, contributed to a long list of enacted \nlegislation.\n  In addition to numerous environmental and public works laws, \nincluding the Water Resources Development Acts of 1996 and 2000, and \nthe Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century of 1998, Janine \ncontributed greatly to writing the Federal Agriculture Improvement and \nReform Act of 1996 and the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of \n2002. And though her efforts helped better our Nation, and even other \nparts of the world, only a very few people have any idea or \nappreciation of Janine's work.\n  That is just the way Janine would have it. She was a private person \nwho did not seek the limelight. Instead, she quietly went about doing \nexcellent work as the consummate professional she was. She was \nmeticulous, detail-oriented and precise, as one would want someone \ndrafting important legislation to be, with an uncanny ability to take \nconcepts and ideas and shape them into exact language carefully crafted \nto fit into the federal statutory scheme. To cite an example, Janine \nwas the lead legislative counsel in drafting the nutrition title of the \n2002 farm bill. Especially in a bill as extensive and complex as the \nfarm bill, it is the rule that drafting errors are to be expected. To \nthis day, not one error has been found in the drafting of the 2002 farm \nbill's nutrition title.\n  Janine willingly put in the extra hours so often required to produce \nsuch high-quality work while meeting the demanding time constraints of \nthe legislative process. She was a very patient and stabilizing force \nin what are frequently pressurized circumstances--someone who also took \npride in cultivating and maintaining good relations with both sides of \nthe aisle and all sides of the various issues she worked on.\n  In short, Janine Johnson exemplified the fine professional qualities \nthat are characteristic of the Senate Office of Legislative Counsel. \nShe distinguished herself by setting a high standard within an office \nknown for its high standards.\n  Janine's death is a terrible loss, and yet as we consider her very \nsubstantial and lasting accomplishments and contributions--and more \nimportantly the memories of her that live on--it is fitting to recall \nthe words of John Donne:\n\n     Death be not proud, though some have called thee\n     Mighty and dreadfull, for, thou art not so,\n     For, those, whom thou think'st, thou dost overthrow,\n     Die not, poore death, nor yet canst thou kill me.\n\n  I offer my condolences and kind wishes to Janine's family, friends \nand colleagues as they mourn her passing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/25/senate-section/article/S8551-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8551-S8553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCREATING AN ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR MANUFACTURING IN THE DEPARTMENT OF \n                                COMMERCE\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues' \nsupport for legislation I have introduced creating the new position of \nAssistant Secretary for Manufacturing in the Department of Commerce.\n  In America we are blessed with ingenuity, gumption, and a can-do \nspirit that is recognized around the world. At the turn of the last \ncentury we helped lead the world into the Industrial age. American \ninventors gave electricity and air travel to the world.\n  As we enter the 21st century, American manufacturing has as much \npotential as it has ever had at any time in our Nation's history. \nAccomplishments in the high-tech industry have been rapidly integrated \ninto manufacturing to make our factories and our workers more \nproductive, reduce costs, and save time.\n  At the same time, substantial new trade, training, energy, labor, and \nforeign competition challenges have arisen. Helping our manufacturing \ninterests deal with these challenges is something that private sector \norganizations such as the National Association Manufacturers have done \nwell for years. It only stands to reason that we focus resources in the \nGovernment sector in support of manufacturing as well.\n  I am concerned about the slow economic recovery and our Nation's \ndeclining position in the global marketplace, particularly for \nmanufacturing, which is the backbone of our economy, both in Ohio and \nthe Nation. There is a genuine panic by the manufacturing community \nover their future and the jobs created from manufacturing. They feel \nthey are under siege from environmental regulations, rising health care \ncosts, litigation, escalating natural gas costs, and the prospect of \ndramatically higher electricity costs if energy reform legislation is \nnot passed.\n  First, health care costs continue to rise. Nationwide, we have seen \ndouble-digit increases in health care premiums over the last 2 years \nalone. In\n\n[[Page S8552]]\n\nOhio, the business community tells me they are seeing 20 to 50 percent \nincreases in their health care costs. These increases raise labor \ncosts, decreasing capital that otherwise would be available to make \ninvestments, and, ultimately, negatively impact our global \ncompetitiveness. In addition, these costs are being passed on to \nemployees, limiting their take-home pay and increasing the number of \nuninsured.\n  Second, high natural gas prices are also having a detrimental effect \non industry in Ohio and across the Nation. Many industries cannot \ncompete internationally because of these high prices. Over the last 10 \nyears, the average price for natural gas has been less than $3.00 per \nmillion cubic feet (Mcf). This year, companies in Ohio have been paying \nalmost $10.00 per Mcf, more than a threefold increase. These price \nspikes are felt the hardest by Ohio's agriculture, chemical, and \nmanufacturing industries. In order to be competitive, we cannot afford \nto hamper American companies in this manner.\n  Additionally, I have heard from companies in both the manufacturing \nand the chemical sectors that they cannot survive with these high \nprices. In particular, two chemical companies in Ohio have informed me \nthat they are considering moving their operations not only out of Ohio, \nbut outside of the United States because of these high costs. At the \nsame time, suppliers of these companies are considering temporary \nshutdowns because they cannot afford to operate. Ohio's companies have \nnot been able to budget and plan sufficiently because these prices have \nbeen so unpredictable this year.\n  As natural gas prices continue to rise, the President's National \nEnergy Policy Task Force projects that over 1,300 new power plants will \nneed to be built to satisfy America's energy needs over the next 20 \nyears. As a result of the emissions limits and regulatory uncertainty \ntriggered by the Clean Air Act, the Department of Energy currently \npredicts that over 90 percent of these new plants will be powered by \nnatural gas. Further, analysis by EIA and the EPA shows that a large \npercentage of coal-fired plants are likely to be replaced by natural \ngas-fired plants in the near future.\n  Third, manufacturers need reliable transportation infrastructure to \nbring in supplies and ship out their products. We are a ``just in \ntime'' economy and we are falling behind in our national investment in \nhighways and bridges. According to the U.S. Department of \nTransportation, for each $1 billion of Federal spending on highway \nconstruction, 47,500 jobs are created annually. Furthermore, the \nDepartment estimates that every dollar invested in our highways yields \n$5.70 in economic benefits due to reduced delays, improved safety and \nreduced vehicle operating cost. Clearly, transportation investment in \nneeded ``ready-to-go'' projects could go a long way in getting the \neconomy back on track.\n  Finally, manufacturing companies are distressed by the surge in \nforeign competition, particularly from China. As a matter of fact, if a \nvote were taken today among Ohio manufacturers, many would oppose \nnormal trade relations with China.\n  These are only a few of the challenges facing American manufacturers. \nTheir profitability and survivability is impacted by virtually every \npolicy and/or agency within the Federal Government. Moreover, the fact \nthat there has been limited coordination of Government policies and \nagencies that impact manufacturing has contributed to a prolonged, \nsteady decline of what I believe is the most critical sector of our \neconomy.\n  According to USA Today, U.S. manufacturers laid off 95,000 workers in \nApril--the 33rd consecutive month of decline and the largest drop in 15 \nmonths. Since July 2000, manufacturing has lost 2.6 million jobs. My \nown State of Ohio has lost 154,500 manufacturing jobs, over a 15-\npercent decline. New orders for manufactured goods in April decreased \nby $9.4 billion, or 2.9 percent, to $320 billion. This was the largest \npercent decline since November 2001. Shipments decreased by $7.1 \nbillion or 2.2 percent to $320.6 billion. This was the largest percent \ndecline since February 2002.\n  According to the National Association of Manufacturers, ``If the U.S. \nmanufacturing base continues to shrink at its present rate and the \ncritical mass is lost, the manufacturing innovation process will shift \nto other global centers. Once that happens, a decline in U.S. living \nstandards in the future is virtually assured.''\n  Unfortunately, up to now, there has been no senior level policymaker \nresponsible for examining prospective and existing Government policies \nto determine their potential impact on manufacturing. This is more than \nan unfortunate oversight; it is a potential economic disaster. \nGovernment policies are often developed without regard to their impact \non manufacturing. Too many Government decisionmakers view manufacturing \nas a ``dying sector'' that is better transferred overseas so Americans \ncan focus on the more profitable service sector. What these people fail \nto realize is that manufacturing is the foundation of the service \nsector.\n  There is no retail industry without manufactured products to sell. \nThere is no transportation industry without manufactured products to \ntransport. There is no repair industry without manufactured products to \nrepair. Even services such as accounting, financial management, \nbanking, and information technology sell their services to \nmanufacturers and could not remain profitable without a vibrant \nmanufacturing sector.\n  Manufacturing growth spawns more additional economic activity and \njobs than any other economic sector. Every $1 of final demand for \nmanufactured goods generates an additional 67 cents in other \nmanufactured products, and 76 cents in products and services from \nnonmanufacturing sectors.\n  In fact, manufacturers are responsible for almost two-thirds of all \nprivate sector Research & Development--$127 billion in 2002. In \naddition, spillovers from R benefit other manufacturing and \nnonmanufacturing firms.\n  Manufacturing productivity gains are historically higher than those \nof any other economic sector. For example, over the past two decades, \nmanufacturing averaged twice the annual productivity gains of the rest \nof the private sector. These gains enable Americans to do more with \nless, increase our ability to compete, and facilitate higher wages for \nall employees.\n  Manufacturing salaries and benefits average $54,000, which is higher \nthan the average for the total private sector. Two factors in \nparticular attract workers to manufacturing: one, higher pay and \nbenefits, and, two, opportunities for advanced education and training.\n  Manufacturing has been an important contributor to regional economic \ngrowth and tax receipts at all levels of government. During the 1990s, \nmanufacturing corporations paid 30 to 34 percent of all corporate taxes \ncollected by State and local governments, as well as Social Security \nand payroll taxes, excise taxes, import and tariff duties, \nenvironmental taxes and license taxes.\n  Furthermore, manufacturing is a secure foundation for future economic \nprosperity. Capital investments in factories and equipment tend to \nanchor businesses more securely to a community, a State or a nation. \nWhen a corporation owns property in a community, they are more likely \nto be an active participant in helping improve the quality of life, \nstability, and economic vitality of that community.\n  Our competitors recognize this and are moving rapidly to claim the \nmanufacturing preeminence that once characterized the U.S. economy. \nWhile America's industrial leadership is being squeezed by rising \nhealth care costs, runaway litigation, excessive regulation and some of \nthe highest taxes on investment in the industrialized world, our \nforeign competitors are taking a larger market share with less \nexpensive products that make it difficult to raise prices. The result \nis a dramatic decline in manufacturing cashflow that forces firms to \ncut back on R and capital investment, and to reduce employment. The \nU.S. manufacturing base is receding--and with it the all-important \ninnovation that is the seedbed of our industrial strength and \ncompetitive edge.\n  Unfortunately, while many countries support their manufacturing \nsector with favorable government policies, tax incentives, and even \nfinancial subsidies, the United States does not even coordinate \ngovernment initiatives that\n\n[[Page S8553]]\n\nmight impact our own manufacturers. Within the U.S. Government, \nhowever, we do have Cabinet level Departments to represent the \ninterests of agriculture, transportation, and energy. These three \nsectors combined do not generate as much economic activity, nor employ \nas many individuals as manufacturing. Nevertheless, there is no senior \nlevel policymaker anywhere in the Federal Government whose sole \nresponsibility is the health and growth of manufacturing. Is it any \nwonder we are losing market share to foreign competition?\n  The bill I am introducing today will help rectify this unfortunate \nsituation. It will establish an Assistant Secretary in the Commerce \nDepartment who will: one, represent and advocate for the interests of \nthe manufacturing sector; two, aid in the development of policies that \npromote the expansion of the manufacturing sector; three, review \npolicies that may adversely impact the manufacturing sector; and, four, \nassist the manufacturing sector in other ways as the Secretary of \nCommerce shall prescribe.\n  The new Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Manufacturing will also \nsubmit to Congress an annual report that contains: one, an overview of \nthe state of the manufacturing sector in the United States; two, \nforecast of the future state of the manufacturing sector in the United \nStates; and, three, an analysis of current and significant laws, \nregulations, and policies that adversely impact the manufacturing \nsector in the United States.\n  It is a small step forward but an important one. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to enact this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/25/senate-section/article/S8553-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8553-S8554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CONTROL OF STATE AND LOCAL POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I recently had the opportunity to read \na book cowritten by a friend and law school classmate of mine, \nProfessor Ross Sandler. The book, ``Democracy by Decree,'' cowritten by \nProfessor David Schoenbrod, is a fascinating discussion of an issue \nthat has bedeviled our democracy since the 1960's: the control of State \nand local political institutions by the Federal courts.\n  When I served as Governor of Tennessee, I had the opportunity to \nattend many meetings with my fellow Governors. I learned that at that \ntime, the prisons in virtually every State were under the control not \nof the Governor but of the Federal courts, whose decrees governed \nalmost all aspects of prison management. Many of these decrees had \nlasted for years and years, and most would continue in force past the \ntime I left the Governor's mansion.\n  Under our Federal system, the enforcement of criminal laws had been \nleft to the States. With all of these decrees in force, however, \ninstead of elected officials controlling a central aspect of law \nenforcement, a small group of lawyers and judges in each State could \nand would dictate penal policy by controlling the decrees. Nearly all \nthese cases started out with the salutary purpose of protecting the \nconstitutional rights of prison inmates to be free of prison brutality. \nThey ended up going much further than the Constitution required or even \npermitted. Federal judges in some States were deciding how hot the \ncoffee had to be in the prison commissary or how often the windows had \nto be washed. Judicial decrees of this nature had lasted so long that \nno one quite knew how to terminate them, and prison officials even got \nused to them. Not only had prison officials become comfortable with \njudicial management, they sometimes even colluded with litigants to \nforce elected officials to provide a greater percentage of government \nresources to the penal system, even when the Constitution did not so \nrequire.\n  When the situation of judicial abuse over the management of prisons \ncame to the attention of Congress, this body responded effectively by \nenacting the Prison Litigation Reform Act, codified at section 3626 of \ntitle 18 of the U.S. Code. This law, largely developed by Chairman \nHatch, Senator Specter, former Senator Abraham, and others, limits the \nperiod of time Federal judges could impose decrees managing State and \nlocal prisons. Under the act, a judicial decree governing prison \nconditions cannot remain in effect for more than 2 years, unless the \nissuing court reviews the conditions at the prison and affirmatively \ndetermines that the decree is still needed to remedy a current \nviolation of law or the Constitution. The burden of proving the need \nfor the continuation of the decree remains, as in the original suit, \nwith the plaintiffs. The 2-year time limit applies equally to consent \ndecrees and to decrees entered after trial.\n  I believe the Prison Litigation Reform Act has been effective at \nrestoring control of State and local penal facilities to the democratic \nbranches of the States. According to Professor Sandler, many of the 20 \nand 25-year-old decrees governing prison conditions have been \nterminated or modified. This very fact demonstrates that the \nconstitutional shortcomings that had initially prompted many of the \nlawsuits had been fixed, but there was no effective mechanism for \nallowing political actors to resume control over these institutions. At \nthe same time, however, there has been no evident impact on the ability \nof the Federal courts to protect prison inmates from current or ongoing \nviolations of the law or the Constitution.\n  What the Prison Litigation Reform Act accomplished so successfully \nand in a carefully balanced way should serve as a model for Congress to \nemulate in other areas of Federal law. Federal courts, prodded by \nactivists and plaintiffs' lawyers, have taken control through \nnegotiated consent decrees of multiple State and local social programs. \nThe same problems that bedeviled Governors, State legislators, and \nprison administrators before the Prison Litigation Reform Act now \nconfronts those democratically responsible actors who seek to manage \nfoster care, special education, mental health services, Food Stamps, \nand welfare programs. In many States and local communities, any number \nof these programs is under direct judicial supervision. As was the case \nwith prison decrees, many of the orders governing these myriad social \nprograms have been in place for many years, binding elected officials \nto obligations imposed for a different set of circumstances, with no \nrequirement that the court review the underlying facts to determine if \ncontinued judicial oversight is warranted or appropriate.\n  As a former law clerk to one of this Nation's most eminent Federal \njudges, I know that judicial oversight can often be a crucial tool, \nsometimes the only tool, with which to vindicate people's \nconstitutional or legal rights. I know that Federal judges did not seek \nto usurp the prerogatives of Governors, mayors, and legislators. Over \ntime and often incrementally, however, they did so.\n  Judges, in fact, were and are often reluctant to intrude into the \noperations of government programs. When they seek to encourage a \nnegotiated resolution, however, they empower plaintiffs' lawyers and \ngovernment lawyers to negotiate and decide the outcome. Often, the \nparties to the negotiation find that they can make common cause, \nparticularly in finding non-democratic means for improving programs and \nprying more money and authority from Governors, mayors, and \nlegislators. Working behind closed doors, and unaccountable to the \npeople, the lawyers and the activists negotiate elaborate decrees of \nhundreds of pages, often encrusted with horse trades that often have \nlittle or nothing to do with the law or the alleged violations but a \nlot to do with long-term agendas of the parties to the negotiations. \nOnly a small cadre of people is involved behind these closed doors. And \nat the end of the process, these self-interested negotiators present \nthe judge with a decree that reflects the ``consent'' of all parties \nbut bypasses the democratic process. These decrees are put into effect, \nand often no one ever reviews whether the legal bases on which they may \nbe founded remain viable. Instead, they remain in effect for years and \nyears, tying the hands of elected officials, even if there is no \nviolation of law to remedy.\n  Building on the proven model of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, \nCongress can and should limit the harm that institutional reform \ndecrees do to local democracy without precluding judges from \nvindicating legal and constitutional rights when necessary. Congress \nought to consider legislation in different areas to limit judicial \ndecrees in institutional reform cases to correcting only actually \nproven systemic\n\n[[Page S8554]]\n\nviolations of federal law or the Constitution. Further, Congress ought \nto allow courts to consider and make modifications of consent decrees \nin institutional reform cases any time a public official with an \ninterest in the case has a good and compelling reason to seek changes. \nFinally, Congress should compel termination of decrees after a fixed \ntime, unless plaintiffs demonstrate that current violations of law \nnecessitating the continuation of the decree exist.\n  Reform by Congress of the general procedures governing judicial \ndecrees in cases seeking reform of State and local government \ninstitutions along the lines suggested by Professor Sandler in his book \nwill strengthen our State and local democratic institutions while \nensuring the continued protection of constitutional and legal rights. I \nhope to look for opportunities to pursue and effectuate some of the \nproposals I have outlined above as the Senate considers relevant \nauthorizing legislation. I hope many of my colleagues will join me in \nthis effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/25/senate-section/article/S8554-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n IN HONOR OF THE NATIONAL UNDERGROUND RAILROAD FAMILY REUNION FESTIVAL \n                            AND ITS SPONSORS\n\n Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the \nHarriet Tubman Historical Society and the National Underground Railroad \nFamily Reunion Festival. The William Still Underground Railroad \nFoundation, Inc. sponsors this national festival. Celebrating the rich \nhistory of those that sought their freedom and the freedom of others by \nfollowing the North Star, the festival reunites families from \nthroughout the country--particularly descendants of the many men and \nwomen who bravely constituted the Underground Railroad.\n  Descendants of William Still, who is considered by many to be the \nfather of the Underground Railroad, have gathered to preserve their \nfamily's legacy for the past 133 years. They unite in celebration and \nin honor of Still and other pioneering gentlemen and gentlewomen who \nfought against the oppressive forces of slavery. William Still was a \nfreeborn black who became a prominent abolitionist, writer, and \nbusinessman. Working tirelessly to free the enslaved and to destroy the \nvery institution of slavery, William Still led perhaps the most \ndramatic system of protest our young Nation had ever seen.\n  As the birthplace of William Still and other notable abolitionists, \nNew Jersey played a significant role in the success of the Underground \nRailroad. Offering an excellent cover of dense forests and heavy \nwilderness, our State provided various routes for Underground \nconductors. After crossing the Delaware River under the cloak of \ndarkness, escaping slaves would travel from Camden to Burlington, and \nthen on to Bordentown. Runaways also came to Bordentown through the \ntowns of Swedesboro and Woodbury. This path to freedom then ran north \nthrough the woodlands of Princeton and on to New Brunswick, a hub in \nthe railroad that also received fugitives traveling from Trenton. \nConductors then bore their travelers across the Raritan River--a \nperilous but pivotal crossing. From Rahway these exhausted and \nterrified slaves and their devoted guides traveled to Jersey City and \ninto New York. These newly emancipated men, women, and children then \ncontinued their journey north, to Canada and to freedom. The \nUnderground Railroad carried the hopes and dreams of hundreds of \nthousands. Many Americans risked their own lives and the lives of their \nloved ones in order to defend the beliefs that all are created equal \nand that liberty is a universal right.\n  Families and communities throughout New Jersey were vital to the \nliberation of countless slaves. The National Family Reunion Festival, \nsponsored by the Still family, seeks to provide a forum for \ngenerations, not only to preserve their due sense of pride, but to pass \non the stories of their forebears' bravery to younger generations. The \nStill family boasts a proud American heritage that dates back 360 \nyears. Fittingly, the Stills have spearheaded this year's 3-day \nfestival. It is the first of its kind--a unique blend of history and \nculture, the past and the present, a commemoration of the historical \nfight against the enslavement of men and women and finally a \ncelebration of the unity we seek and strive to create in our Nation \nevery day. The National Underground Railroad Family Reunion Festival \nwill bring together descendants of conductors, abolitionists, \nstationmasters, and fugitives along with those who joyously recognize \nthe incredible courage with which the railroad ran and the invaluable \njustice for which it ran.\n  Mr. President, I invite you and my colleagues to join me in \ncommending The William Still Underground Railroad Foundation, Inc. and \nthe Harriet Tubman Historical Society for their spectacular efforts \nthat honor the valorous deeds of abolitionists and keep the history and \nlegacies of our great Nation alive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/25/senate-section/article/S8554-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF COWETA, OKLAHOMA.\n\n Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor and pay \ntribute to Mr. Stephen Cabell of Owensboro, KY. Earlier this year, \nStephen was named a Presidential Scholar in the Arts.\n  The Presidential Scholars in the Arts Program is administered by the \nU.S. Department of Education to honor some of our Nation's most \nartistic and creative high school seniors. Each year, the National \nFoundation for Advancement in the Arts recommends a small number of \nexceptionally gifted students to this program. This year, only 16 \nstudents from across the country were named a Presidential Scholar in \nthe Arts. This honor rewards individuals who excel in various \ndisciplines of the arts, including music, theater, dance, and visual \narts. Stephen was awarded this honor in recognition of his musical \ncomposition genius.\n  Stephen Cabell was born in Owensboro, KY. During his freshman year of \nhigh school he was accepted into the Interlochen Arts Academy in \nMichigan, a prestigious high school known for its contribution to the \nfine arts. While attending Interlochen, he studied horn, piano, and \nmusic composition. Stephen continues his love of music during his free \ntime, when he tutors students in music theory, researches composers, \nand collects musical scores. He is the son of Steve and Mary Cabell of \nOwensboro, who I know are very proud of Stephen and his talent and \ncommitment to music and perfection.\n  Since he was 8 years old, Stephen has been composing musical pieces. \nDuring his career he has won numerous awards. Stephen is a recipient of \nthe Morton Gould Young Composers Award from the American Society of \nComposers, Authors, and Publishers, ASCAP, as well as the Neil Robert \nMemorial Scholarship from the Interlochen Arts Academy. Groups such as \nthe Owensboro Symphony Orchestra, Imani Winds, and the Interlochen \nAcademy regularly perform his music. Most recently, Stephen performed \none of his pieces at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts \nin an event designed to showcase the talents of all 16 Presidential \nScholars. In the fall, Stephen plans to study composition at the Curtis \nInstitute of Music.\n\n[[Page S8555]]\n\n  Stephen Cabell has repeatedly proven his genius in the field of \nmusical composition. I would like to congratulate him again on being \nnamed a Presidential Scholar in the Arts, a tremendous honor indeed. I \nthank the Senate for allowing me to recognize Stephen and his \naccomplishments. He is a true source of pride for Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/25/senate-section/article/S8555-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DANNY PIPER\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to put into the \nCongressional Record a statement I made last year shortly after we lost \na great friend of mine and a true American success story, Danny Piper.\n  Danny Piper came into my life 13 years ago. I was the Chairman of the \nDisability Policy Subcommittee here in the Senate, and was the sponsor \nof the Americans with Disabilities Act. We were having a series of \nhearings leading up to the hopeful passage of this bill. Danny became \nthe first person with Downs Syndrome to testify before a congressional \ncommittee. I can't remember exactly how this came about, but I am sure \nthat Marietta Lane, Paul Marchand, and Bobby Silverstein had something \nto do with finding Danny and getting him and Sylvia and Larry to \nWashington.\n  I can remeber that day like it was yesterday. Danny was cool, \ncomposed, and very confident as a witness. I spoke with him later, and \nasked if appearing before the Senate was like being in his high school \nplay. ``Not so bad,'' Danny replied.\n  I followed Danny from then on. I was so proud when he got his high \nschool certificate, then got his first job. In fact, I spent one of my \n``workdays'' at the store with Danny. He showed me the ropes.'' He \nshowed me the correct way to stock shelves. He made sure I knew how to \nload the cardboard box machine so I wouldn't get hurt. We went to lunch \ntogether, and it was a day I will always cherish.\n  Evey once in a while I would run into Dan in one place or another. He \nalways hailed me as ``Hi, big guy.'' Once, I was visiting a school in \nAnkeny during the summer, and I was to meet with some teachers and \nadministrators. To my surprise, when I entered the room, there stood \nDan. So he gave me his usual, ``Hi, big guy'' routine. One of the older \npersons there said, ``This is Senator Harkin.'' Dan just sort of \nshrugged, and said, ``Yeah, yeah, I know . . . big guy''. This memory \nstill makes me smile.\n  Dan was always a part of all my campaigns, always there for my \nannouncements and always there for the victory parties. But perhaps my \nmost cherished moment with Dan was this spring. Dan set another first, \nI believe, when he introduced me at my announcement for reelection \nbefore a bank of TV cameras and a couple of hundred people. Sylvia told \nme how hard he practiced for this, and I could tell. He was poised, but \na little nervous as he forgot to introduce my wife, Ruth. I told Dan it \nwas no big deal, I still forget to do that sometimes myself. But he \ngave that introduction without missing a beat. He had it down pat. I \nwas so proud and honored that Dan would do that for me.\n  Sylvia and Larry, their family were pioneers in every sense of the \nword. Long before it was even grudgingly accepted, they made sure Dan \nwas fully integrated in with his peers in school, made sure he was not \n``sent away'' like my brother was so many years ago, to an institution \nwhere everyone was ``just like him.'' Dan was a pioneer, also, \nchallenging a system that wanted to deny him his individuality, deny \nhim his personal hopes and dreams, deny him his independence, deny him \nhis human right to meet challenges and set goals for himself.\n  When we visited Dan in the hospital, I was so certain that he was \ngoing to make it. He had that same positive upbeat attitude I have \nalways known. He was looking forward to helping me again this fall, as \nhe had always helped me.\n  Well, Dan, a tragic accident has meant that you will not be with us \nphysically. But the most powerful thing about you, Dan, was your \nspirit, and that will always be with us who were touched by your life. \nYour spirit commands us to lead on, break down barriers that separate \nus, provide that ladder or ramp of opportunity for all. We will enact \nMICASSA into law, Dan, and your example of overcoming challenges and \nmeeting goals compels us not to fall in this endeavor.\n  Thank you, Dan, for all the help you gave us during your brief life. \nYou helped us to be more understanding, more generous and more caring \ntoward one another. That is a great legacy. In whatever lies ahead, you \nwill be often on my mind, and always in my heart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/25/senate-section/article/S8555-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RON MICHAELSON: 29 YEARS AT THE ILLINOIS STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my \nfriend Dr. Ronald D. Michaelson. Ron Michaelson will retire in June \nafter 29 years of outstanding service to Illinois as the executive \ndirector of the Illinois State Board of Elections. I want to salute his \ndedication to public service and briefly share his story with you \ntoday.\n  Dr. Michaelson grew up in Chicago. He received a bachelor of arts \ndegree from Wheaton College in 1963, a master of arts degree in \npolitical science from Northwestern University in 1965, and a Ph.D. in \ngovernment from Southern Illinois University in 1970.\n  Dr. Michaelson went on to devote his life to public service. He began \nhis professional career working in State government as an assistant to \nformer Illinois Governor Richard Ogilvie. He then spent several years \nteaching at Sangamon State University. His interest in the political \narena remained, however, and in 1974 he returned to that arena to head \nthe newly created State board of elections. The board was formed to \ninterpret election laws and coordinate procedures for holding \nelections, and Dr. Michaelson became the board's first and so far only \nexecutive director.\n  Dr. Michaelson's drive and ambition helped him administer and \nsupervise the agency in a fair and bipartisan manner. He devoted \nhimself and his 65 staff members to creating one of the most respected \ncampaign disclosure systems in the Nation--one that requires candidates \nto report disclosure statements electronically, making them easily \naccessible to those interested in a candidate's campaign donations. Dr. \nMichaelson's success in creating a fair and effective system of \ncampaign disclosure in the tough political environment of Illinois \nprovided a heartening and instructive example for the cause of \npolitical openness nationwide.\n  In addition to his teaching and his work in government, Dr. \nMichaelson has authored numerous articles that have been published in \nleading state and national journals. He is the past national chairman \nof the Council on Governmental Ethics Laws and speaks frequently at \nconferences in the areas of election administration and campaign \nfinance. He currently serves as an appointee to the advisory committee \nof the Federal Election Commission and teaches as an adjunct professor \nof public affairs at the University of Illinois at Springfield.\n  Dr. Michaelson's dedication to public service will continue beyond \nhis retirement this month. He intends to assist the State board of \nelections on a part-time basis with the implementation of the recently \nenacted Help America Vote Act.\n  In a time of considerable cynicism about public officials, Ron \nMichaelson's career stands as a shining example of the finest tradition \nof honorable service to the public: an example of integrity, fairness, \nhard work, and high standards. I am truly pleased to honor Dr. \nMichaelson on his retirement from the Illinois State Board of Elections \nand to thank him for his service to the state of Illinois and for the \nexample he has set in the course of that service. I know my fellow \nSenators will join me in congratulating Dr. Michaelson on his \nremarkable career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/25/senate-section/article/S8555-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8555-S8556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO REBECCA WILLIAMS\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and pay \ntribute to Ms. Rebecca Williams of Henderson, KY. Rebecca was recently \nawarded a James Madison Memorial fellowship.\n  The James Madison fellowship, in its 12th year of competition, \nsupports the further study of American history by college graduates who \naspire to become teachers of American history, American government, and \nsocial studies in\n\n[[Page S8556]]\n\nthe Nation's secondary schools. Named in honor of the fourth President \nof the United States, the fellowship will fund up to $24,000 of Ms. \nWilliam's course of study toward a master's degree.\n  The award recognizes promising and distinguished teachers and \nencourages the strengthening of their knowledge of the origins and \ndevelopment of American government and history. Ultimately, the award \nacknowledges educators who will provide outstanding tutelage to \nstudents across the country.\n  Ms. Williams is a teacher at Bryan Station High School in Lexington, \nKY. She is one of 56 recipients of the fellowship, selected from \napplicants from across the United States. Ms. Williams has \ndistinguished herself as an exceptional and aspiring educator. Her \ndedication to the field of American history and to the education of \nKentucky's youth is remarkable.\n  Ms. Williams is a tribute to Kentucky, and I am proud of her \nachievements.

She is Kentucky at its \nfinest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/25/senate-section/article/S8556-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO THE EDUCATION ASSOCIATION OF McCRACKEN COUNTY\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to honor and pay tribute to \nthe McCracken County Education Association for the high ideals which \nthey have taught through example to the children of their county school \nsystem. The McCracken County Education Association of McCracken County, \nKY, generously took the initiative not only to raise $10,089 and donate \nit to Habitat for Humanity but also to give their time and effort in \nthe construction of a home in Paducah.\n  The initiative involved all 12 of McCracken County's public schools \nand the children that attend them. Each teacher was asked to raise $35 \nfrom their own classroom while the central office and each school \ncontributed $350. The ways in which the money was raised are just as \nadmirable for their originality and civic mindedness as they are for \ntheir charity. One teacher added a brick to a miniature house structure \nfor every dollar her students contributed, while one school of only 350 \nstudents held a bake sale and raised approximately $5,000. Overall and \nthroughout, the raising of funds was marked with a spirit of \ncooperation and team spirit. On June 6 the funds were presented to \nHabitat for Humanity of Paducah/McCracken County and on the 14th the \nteachers, administrators, and staff of McCracken County Education \nAssociation assembled at 1920 Broad St. in Paducah, KY, to donate time \nand labor in the construction of a house.\n  The altruism and generosity of the McCracken County Education \nAssociation ought to be highly commended and imitated by all who have \nseen its shining example. Such interest in the well-being of our \nneighbors combines the virtues of justice and compassion and enriches \nthe society in which it exists.\n  While it is true that the McCracken County Education Association's \nconcern for their neighbors and for a society in which all have shelter \nis truly virtuous, it is also true that the work they did was just as, \nif not more, valuable for the reason that they are the educators of \nAmerica's future. The children whom the McCracken County Education \nAssociation included in this fundraiser event learned more than just \nwhat books might have taught them in school. They learned that an \nactive interest in the well-being of others is important. They learned \nthat though they are children who are still in the process of learning, \ntheir voices will be heard if they work together with order and with \nthe good of society at heart. It is not only these children who stand \nto learn something from this notable example of generosity and civic \nresponsibility but all of us here today.\n  My Senate colleagues and all others would do well to imitate the \nconcern and initiative of the McCracken County Education Association. I \nthank the Senate for allowing me to laud the praises of the McCracken \nCounty Education Association.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/25/senate-section/article/S8556-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               BIRTHDAY TRIBUTE FOR MR. WILLARD ELDREDGE\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nextend a heartfelt birthday greeting to Mr. Willard Eldredge who turns \n80 years old today. On July 5, his friends and family will gather in \nIdaho Falls to honor this great man on the occasion of his birthday. \nMr. Eldredge has touched many lives over the years, and I am one of the \nfortunate ones to have benefited from his influence. You see, I was \ninvolved in Boy Scouts, and eventually became an Eagle Scout. Mr. \nEldredge was a Scout pack leader of mine many years ago. He taught me \nand other young men the values, work ethic, and commitment that it took \nto succeed in Scouts and in life. He served as a role model for me, and \ntaught me lessons about honor, duty, honesty, and patriotism that I \nhave carried with me throughout my life. It is now my honor to wish my \nformer mentor a wonderful, and very happy 80th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/25/senate-section/article/S8556-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/25/senate-section/article/S8556-4", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/25/senate-section/article/S8556-5", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:52 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 923.

A bill to reduce unsolicited commercial electronic mail and \nto protect children from sexually oriented advertisements; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, the \nRestrict and Eliminate the Delivery of Unsolicited Commercial \nElectronic Mail, REDUCE, Spam Act, to curb the influx of unwanted junk \ne-mail, or ``spam,'' that is clogging our inboxes and wasting the time \nand money of American consumers and businesses.\n  The flood of spam is growing so fast that it will soon account for \nmore than half of all e-mail sent in the United States. Spam already \naccounts for nearly 40 percent of e-mail traffic, and costs U.S. \nbusinesses $10 billion annually in lost productivity and additional \nequipment, software and manpower costs necessary to manage this burden. \nMicrosoft Inc. estimates that more than 80 percent of the more than 2.5 \nbillion e-mail messages sent each day to Hotmail users are spam. And \ndata suggests that the problem is only growing.\n  The problem of spam goes well beyond inconvenience and cost. The \nFederal Trade Commission examined a random sample of 1000 spam messages \nand, in a report issued on April 30, 2003, found staggering evidence of \nfraud. According to the report, 33 percent of the messages sampled \ncontained false routing information; 22 percent contained false \ninformation in the subject line; 40 percent contained false statements \nin the text; and a full 66 percent contained false information of some \nsort. Most alarmingly, in the case of spam touting business or \ninvestment opportunities, 96 percent contained some sort of fraudulent \ninformation.\n  In addition, pornographic spam is a growing problem for parents \ntrying to shield their children from such images. The FTC report found \nthat 17 percent of spam advertising pornographic websites included \nadult images in the body of the message. This is not acceptable when \nour children are using email more and more each day.\n  Unfortunately, it is very difficult to track down those who send \nspam. Often, spammers use multiple e-mail addresses or disguise routing \ninformation to avoid being identified. Finding spammers can take not \njust real expertise, but persistence, time, energy and commitment.\n  To attack the problem of spam, my proposal adopts a two-prong \napproach championed by the leading thinker about cyberlaw, Professor \nLawrence Lessig of Stanford Law School. Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren also \nhas introduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives. The \napproach is simple: first, anyone sending bulk unsolicited commercial \ne-mail would have to include on each e-mail a simple prefix--either \nADV: or ADV:ADLT. Second, anyone who finds a spam-source who has failed \nto properly label unsolicited commercial e-mail would be eligible for a \nmonetary reward from the FTC.\n  The first part of this proposal would enable Internet Service \nProviders, ISPs, employers and individual users to filter spam from \nbusiness and personal email. This would give people the ability to tell \ntheir Internet service provider to block ADV e-mail, or they could \nautomatically filter such e-mail into a spam folder on their own \ncomputer. This approach would enable far more effective filtering than \ncurrently possible.\n  The second part of my proposal would require the FTC to pay a bounty \nto anyone who tracks down a spammer who has failed properly to label \nunsolicited commercial e-mail. The proposal would invite anyone across \nthe world who uses the Internet to hunt down these law-violating \nspammers. The FTC would then fine them and pay a portion of that fine \nas a reward to the bounty hunter who found them. The FTC could use the \nremainder of the fine to track down and prosecute other spammers.\n  Creating incentives for private individuals to help track down \nspammers is likely to substantially strengthen the enforcement of anti-\nspam laws. And with proper enforcement, spammers would soon learn that \nneglecting to label spam does not pay. In the end, that will mean that \nmore spammers will label their spam or give up and stop spamming \naltogether. Either way, we will have fixed, or at least started to fix, \nthe problem.\n  Professor Lessig is so convinced that this approach will \nsubstantially reduce spam that he has pledged to resign from his job at \nStanford if it does not. While I will not hold him to that warranty, I \ndo share his enthusiasm about this innovative approach, which is likely \nto be much more effective than relying exclusively on government \ninvestigators to identify spammers.\n  Having said that, I recognize that any domestic anti-spam legislation \npotentially is subject to evasion by spammers who relocate overseas in \norder to continue sending spam. To respond to that possibility, my bill \nalso orders the Administration to study the possibility of an \ninternational agreement to reduce spam. This is an issue that affects \nus globally, and, in my view, we should consider a coordinated \nresponse.\n  In addition to these primary provisions, my bill would require \nmarketers to establish a valid return e-mail address to which an e-mail \nrecipient can write to ``opt-out'' of receiving further e-mails, and \nwould prohibit marketers from sending any further e-mails after a \nperson opts-out. The bill also would prohibit spam with false or \nmisleading routing information or deceptive subject headings, and would \nauthorize the Federal Trade Commission to collect civil fines against \nmarketers who violate these requirements. Furthermore, my proposal \nwould give Internet Service Providers the right to bring civil actions \nagainst marketers who violate these requirements and disrupt their \nnetworks, and, finally, the proposal would establish criminal penalties \nfor fraudulent spam.\n  I know that the Commerce Committee recently ordered reported \nlegislation to deal with the problem of spam, and I am hopeful that \nbill will come before the full Senate before long. When it does, it is \nmy intention to work with my colleagues to see if some of the concepts \nin the REDUCE Spam Act, such as the establishment of individual rewards \nfor bounty hunters, and a report on a possible international agreement \non spam, can be incorporated into the broader package, to ensure that \nany legislation sent to the President will actually be effective in \nreducing spam.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the\n\n[[Page S8563]]\n\nRecord at this point, along with a related article by Professor \nLawrence Lessig.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1327\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

For \n     purposes of this Act, more than 1 person may be considered to \n     have initiated the same commercial electronic mail message.\n       (7) Internet.--The term ``Internet'' has the meaning given \n     that term in section 231(e)(3) of the Communications Act of \n     1934 (47 U.S.C. 231(e)(3)).\n       (8) Internet access service.--The term ``Internet access \n     service'' has the meaning given that term in section \n     231(e)(4) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     231(e)(4)).\n       (9) Pre-existing business relationship.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``pre-existing business \n     relationship'', when used with respect to a commercial \n     electronic mail message, means that either--\n       (i) within the 5-year period ending upon receipt of a \n     commercial electronic mail message, there has been a business \n     transaction between the sender and the recipient, including a \n     transaction involving the provision, free of charge, of \n     information, goods, or services requested by the recipient \n     and the recipient was, at the time of such transaction or \n     thereafter, provided a clear and conspicuous notice of an \n     opportunity not to receive further commercial electronic mail \n     messages from the sender and has not exercised such \n     opportunity; or\n       (ii) the recipient has given the sender permission to \n     initiate commercial electronic mail messages to the \n     electronic mail address of the recipient and has not \n     subsequently revoked such permission.\n       (B) Applicability.--If a sender operates through separate \n     lines of business or divisions and holds itself out to the \n     recipient as that particular line of business or division, \n     then such line of business or division shall be treated as \n     the sender for purposes of subparagraph (A).\n       (10) Recipient.--The term ``recipient'', when used with \n     respect to a commercial electronic mail message, means the \n     addressee of such message.\n       (11) Sender.--The term ``sender'', when used with respect \n     to a commercial electronic mail message, means the person who \n     initiates such message. The term ``sender'' does not include \n     a provider of Internet access service whose role with respect \n     to electronic mail messages is limited to handling, \n     transmitting, retransmitting, or relaying such messages.\n       (12) Unsolicited commercial electronic mail message.--The \n     term ``unsolicited commercial electronic mail message'' means \n     any commercial electronic mail message that--\n       (A) is not a transactional or relationship message; and\n       (B) is sent to a recipient without the recipient's prior \n     affirmative or implied consent.\n\n     SEC. 3. COMMERCIAL ELECTRONIC MAIL CONTAINING FRAUDULENT \n                   HEADER OR ROUTING INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 63 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 1351. Unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n       containing fraudulent header information\n\n       ``(a) Any person who initiates the transmission of any \n     unsolicited commercial electronic mail message, with \n     knowledge and intent that the message contains or is \n     accompanied by header information that is false or materially \n     misleading, shall be fined or imprisoned for not more than 1 \n     year, or both, under this title.\n       ``(b) For purposes of this section, the terms `unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail message' and `header information' \n     have the meanings given such terms in section 2 of the REDUCE \n     Spam Act of 2003.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--The chapter analysis at the \n     beginning of chapter 63 of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``1351. Unsolicited commercial electronic mail.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. REQUIREMENTS FOR UNSOLICITED COMMERCIAL ELECTRONIC \n                   MAIL.\n\n       (a) Subject Line Requirements.--It shall be unlawful for \n     any person to initiate the transmission of an unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail message to an electronic mail \n     address within the United States, unless the subject line \n     includes--\n       (1) except in the case of an unsolicited commercial \n     electronic mail message described in paragraph (2)--\n       (A) an identification that complies with the standards \n     adopted by the Internet Engineering Task Force for \n     identification of unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     messages; or\n       (B) in the case of the absence of such standards, ``ADV:'' \n     as the first four characters; or\n       (2) in the case of an unsolicited commercial electronic \n     mail message that contains material that may only be viewed, \n     purchased, rented, leased, or held in possession by an \n     individual 18 years of age and older--\n       (A) an identification that complies with the standards \n     adopted by the Internet Engineering Task Force for \n     identification of adult-oriented unsolicited commercial \n     electronic mail messages; or\n       (B) in the case of the absence of such standards, \n     ``ADV:ADLT'' as the first eight characters.\n       (b) Return Address Requirements.--\n       (1) Establishment.--It shall be unlawful for any person to \n     initiate the transmission of an unsolicited commercial \n     electronic mail message to an electronic mail address within \n     the United States, unless the sender establishes a valid \n     sender-operated return electronic mail address where the \n     recipient may notify the sender not to send any further \n     commercial electronic mail messages.\n       (2) Included statement.--All unsolicited commercial \n     electronic mail messages subject to this subsection shall \n     include a statement informing the recipient of the valid \n     return electronic mail address referred to in paragraph (1).\n       (3) Prohibition of sending after objection.--Upon \n     notification or confirmation by a recipient of the \n     recipient's request not to receive any further unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail messages, it shall be unlawful for \n     a person, or anyone acting on that person's behalf, to send \n     any unsolicited commercial electronic mail message to that \n     recipient. Such a request shall be deemed to terminate a pre-\n     existing business relationship for purposes of determining \n     whether subsequent messages are unsolicited commercial \n     electronic mail messages.\n       (c) Header and Subject Heading Requirements.--\n       (1) False or misleading header information.--It shall be \n     unlawful for any person to initiate the transmission of an \n     unsolicited commercial electronic mail message that such \n     person knows, or reasonably should know, contains or is \n     accompanied by header information that is false or materially \n     misleading.\n       (2) Deceptive subject headings.--It shall be unlawful for \n     any person to initiate the transmission of an unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail message with a subject heading \n     that such person knows, or reasonably should know, is likely \n     to mislead a recipient, acting reasonably under the \n     circumstances, about a material fact regarding the contents \n     or subject matter of the message.\n       (d) Affirmative Defense.--A person who violates subsection \n     (a) or (b) shall not be liable if--\n       (1)(A) the person has established and implemented, with due \n     care, reasonable practices and procedures to effectively \n     prevent such violations; and\n       (B) the violation occurred despite good faith efforts to \n     maintain compliance with such practices and procedures; or\n       (2) within the 2-day period ending upon the initiation of \n     the transmission of the unsolicited commercial electronic \n     mail message in violation of subsection (a) or (b), such \n     person initiated the transmission of such message, or one \n     substantially similar to it, to less than 1,000 electronic \n     mail addresses.\n\n     SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 4 shall be enforced by the \n     Commission under the FTC\n\n[[Page S8564]]\n\n     Act. For purposes of such Commission enforcement, a violation \n     of this Act shall be treated as a violation of a rule under \n     section 18 (15 U.S.C. 57a) of the FTC Act prohibiting an \n     unfair or deceptive act or practice.\n       (b) Rulemaking.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Commission shall institute a \n     rulemaking proceeding concerning enforcement of this Act. The \n     rules adopted by the Commission shall prevent violations of \n     section 4 in the same manner, by the same means, and with the \n     same jurisdiction, powers, and duties as though all \n     applicable terms and provisions of the FTC Act were \n     incorporated into and made a part of this section, except \n     that the rules shall also include--\n       (1) procedures to minimize the burden of submitting a \n     complaint to the Commission concerning a violation of section \n     4, including procedures to allow the electronic submission of \n     complaints to the Commission;\n       (2) civil penalties for violations of section 4 in an \n     amount sufficient to effectively deter future violations, a \n     description of the type of evidence needed to collect such \n     penalties, and procedures to collect such penalties if the \n     Commission determines that a violation of section 4 has \n     occurred;\n       (3) procedures for the Commission to grant a reward of not \n     less than 20 percent of the total civil penalty collected to \n     the first person that--\n       (A) identifies the person in violation of section 4; and\n       (B) supplies information that leads to the successful \n     collection of a civil penalty by the Commission;\n       (4) a provision that enables the Commission to keep the \n     remainder of the civil penalty collected and use the funds \n     toward the prosecution of further claims, including for \n     necessary staff or resources; and\n       (5) civil penalties for knowingly submitting a false \n     complaint to the Commission.\n       (c) Regulations.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Commission shall conclude the \n     rulemaking proceeding initiated under subsection (b) and \n     shall prescribe implementing regulations.\n\n     SEC. 6. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.\n\n       (a) Action Authorized.--A recipient of an unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail message, or a provider of Internet \n     access service, adversely affected by a violation of section \n     4 may bring a civil action in any district court of the \n     United States with jurisdiction over the defendant to--\n       (1) enjoin further violation by the defendant; or\n       (2) recover damages in an amount equal to--\n       (A) actual monetary loss incurred by the recipient or \n     provider of Internet access service as a result of such \n     violation; or\n       (B) at the discretion of the court, the amount determined \n     under subsection (b).\n       (b) Statutory Damages.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of subsection (a)(2)(B), the \n     amount determined under this subsection is the amount \n     calculated by multiplying the number of willful, knowing, or \n     negligent violations by an amount, in the discretion of the \n     court, of up to $10.\n       (2) Per-violation penalty.--In determining the per-\n     violation penalty under this subsection, the court shall take \n     into account the degree of culpability, any history of prior \n     such conduct, ability to pay, the extent of economic gain \n     resulting from the violation, and such other matters as \n     justice may require.\n       (c) Attorney Fees.--In any action brought pursuant to \n     subsection (a), the court may, in its discretion, require an \n     undertaking for the payment of the costs of such action, and \n     assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' \n     fees, against any party.\n\n     SEC. 7.

EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to impair the \n     enforcement of section 223 or 231 of the Communications Act \n     of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 223 or 231), chapter 71 (relating to \n     obscenity) or 110 (relating to sexual exploitation of \n     children) of title 18, United States Code, or any other \n     Federal criminal statute.\n\n     SEC. 9. FTC STUDY.\n\n        Not later than 24 months after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Commission, in consultation with appropriate \n     agencies, shall submit a report to Congress that provides a \n     detailed analysis of the effectiveness and enforcement of the \n     provisions of this Act and the need, if any, for Congress to \n     modify such provisions.\n\n     SEC. 10. STUDY OF POSSIBLE INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT.\n\n       Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the President shall--\n       (1) conduct a study in consultation with the Internet \n     Engineering Task Force on the possibility of an international \n     agreement to reduce spam; and\n       (2) issue a report to Congress setting forth the findings \n     of the study required by paragraph (1).\n\n     SEC. 11.

Billions of unsolicited \n     commercial messages--constituting almost 50 percent of all e-\n     mail traffic--fill the in-boxes of increasingly impatient \n     Internet users. These messages offer to sell everything from \n     human growth hormones to pornography. And increasingly the \n     offers to sell pornography are themselves pornographic.\n       So far, Congress has done nothing about this burden on the \n     Internet. Many states have passed laws that have tried. \n     Virginia just passed the most extreme of these laws, making \n     it a felony to send spam with a fraudulent return address. \n     Other states are considering the same.\n       Yet all of these regulations suffer from a similar flaw: \n     Spamsters know the laws will never be enforced. The cost of \n     bringing a lawsuit is extraordinarily high. Most of us have \n     better things to do than sue spamsters. Thus, despite a \n     patchwork of regulation that in theory should be restricting \n     spam, the practice of spam continues to increase at an \n     astonishing rate.\n       But last week, U.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D., Calif.) \n     introduced a bill that, if properly implemented by the \n     Federal Trade Commission, would actually work. I am so \n     confident she is right that I've offered to resign my job if \n     her proposal does not significantly reduce the burden of \n     spam.\n       The Restrict and Eliminate Delivery of Unsolicited \n     Commercial E-mail (REDUCE) Spam Act has two important parts. \n     First, anyone sending bulk unsolicited commercial e-mail must \n     include on each e-mail a simple tag--either ADV: or ADV:ADLT. \n     Second, anyone who finds a spamster who fails properly to \n     label unsolicited commercial e-mail will be paid a bounty by \n     the FTC.\n       The first part of the proposal would enable simple filters \n     to block unwanted spam. Users could tell their Internet \n     service provider to block ADV e-mail, or they could \n     automatically filter such e-mail into a spam folder on their \n     own computer. These simple filters would replace the \n     extraordinarily sophisticated filters companies have been \n     developing to identify and block spam.\n       These complex filters, though ingenious, are necessarily \n     one step behind. Spamsters will always find a way to trick \n     them. The filters will be changed to respond, but the \n     spamsters will in turn change their spam to find a way around \n     the filters. Thus the filters will never block all spam, but \n     they will always block a certain number of messages that are \n     not spam.\n       But part one of the Lofgren legislation would never work if \n     it weren't for part two: A spamster bounty. Lofgren's \n     proposal would require the FTC to pay a bounty to anyone who \n     tracks down a spamster who has failed properly to label \n     unsolicited commercial e-mail. This proposal would invite \n     savvy 18-year-olds from across the world to hunt down these \n     law-violating spamsters. The FTC would then fine them, after \n     paying a reward to the bounty hunter who found them.\n       The bounty would assure that the spam law was enforced. \n     Properly enforced, the law would teach most spamsters that \n     failing to label spam doesn't pay. The spamsters in turn \n     would decide either to label their spam or give up and get a \n     real job. Either way, the burden of spam would be reduced.\n       No doubt no solution would eliminate 100 percent of spam. \n     Much is foreign; American laws would not easily reach those \n     spamsters. But the question lawmakers should ask is what is \n     the smallest, least burdensome regulation that would have the \n     most significant effect. If Lofgren's proposal were passed, \n     the vast majority of spamsters would have to change their \n     ways. Technologists could then target their filters on the \n     spamsters that remain.\n       What about free speech? Don't spamsters have First \n     Amendments rights?\n       Of course they do. And many of the laws proposed right now \n     go too far in censoring speech. Threatening a felony for a \n     bad return address, as the Virginia law does, is a dangerous \n     precedent. Laws that ban spam altogether are much worse.\n       But Lofgren's proposal simply requires a proper label so \n     consumers can choose whether they want to receive the speech \n     or not. And most important, by reducing the clutter of \n     unsolicited and unwanted spam, the law would improve the \n     opportunity for other speech--including political speech--to \n     get through.\n       More fundamentally, free speech is threatened just as much \n     by bad filters as by bad laws. A well-crafted law--narrow in \n     its scope, and moderate in its regulation--can in turn \n     eliminate the demand for bad filters. Lofgren's proposal \n     would have just this effect. Congress should act to follow \n     Lofgren's lead. In Internet time, not Washington time.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mrs. Clinton):\n\n[[Page S8565]]\n\n  S. 1328. A bill to provide for an evaluation by the Institute of \nMedicine of the National Academy of Sciences of leading health care \nperformance measures and options to implement policies that align \nperformance with payment under the Medicare program under title XVIII \nof the Social Security Act; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue of \nimportance to all Americans, the quality and safety of health care in \nthe United States.\n  Numerous studies have identified serious shortcomings in the quality \nand safety of health care. However, addressing these shortcomings and \nimproving health care outcomes in a complex health care system requires \nlong-range strategies and specific goals.\n  The Medicare program, as one of the largest purchasers of health \ncare, is ideally situated to take a leadership role in encouraging \nquality improvement. Currently, however, Medicare's payment methods and \nregulations provide few incentives to pursue innovative quality \nimprovement strategies and to reward those who achieve exemplary \nperformance.\n  Traditional Medicare pays most physicians according to a fee schedule \nand pays hospitals according to a DRG-based payment system. \nMedicare+Choice plans are paid a capitated rate and, in turn, pay \nphysicians using a range of approaches, from salary to capitation to \nfee-for-service, none of which directly reward enhanced quality.\n  Attempts to adjust Medicare payments to reward performance \nimprovements in safety and quality have been hampered, in part, by the \nlack of measures and data for assessing performance. Although the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently began an initiative \nto develop voluntary consensus performance measures for 10 clinical \nconditions for hospitals, standardized measures of quality for \nhospitals and providers do not otherwise exist.\n  As the Senate considers a new Medicare prescription drug benefit and \nadditional measures to reform the Medicare program, it is more \nimportant than ever that we consider also measures to ensure that these \nnew benefits are provided as safely and effectively as possible.\n  That is why I am today introducing a bill charging the Institute of \nMedicine with performing a study to evaluate leading health care \nperformance measures and options to implement policies that align \nperformance with payment in Medicare.\n  We have learned much about health care quality in the last several \nyears. The Institute of Medicine, in its studies entitled ``To Err Is \nHuman,'' and ``Crossing the Quality Chasm,'' has identified the health \ncare safety and quality shortcomings that exist and the need for \nimprovement. In a recent study performed at the request of Congress, \n``Leadership by Example,'' the Institute of Medicine identified the \nleadership role that Government can take in improving health care \nquality in government sponsored health care programs and those in the \nprivate sector.\n  The bill that I am introducing today, and the study that will result, \nrepresents the next step toward improving health care quality and \nsafety in the United States. It is an important step and one that we \nmust take in order to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries receive the \nhighest quality health care services available. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this legislation.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend from \nUtah, Senator Hatch, today in introducing a bill that will commission a \nstudy from IOM to identify performance measures and payment incentives \nthat reward high quality providers in Medicare.\n  Currently Medicare pays the same amount for good care as it does for \npoor quality care. It's easy to assume that the dollars that go to \nMedicare all yield high quality care, but the evidence is otherwise.\n  Take heart disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S. \nCholesterol management after a heart attack can mean the difference \nbetween disability and an active lifestyle. Yet we don't have adequate \ndata that show us whether most Medicare beneficiaries are getting this \nclinically appropriate care. And the only data that we do have, from \nNCQA, The State of Health Care Quality 2002, tells us that in 2001 \nalmost one-quarter, 23 percent, of Medicare beneficiaries in health \nplans did not have their cholesterol managed after a heart attack.\n  In New York, between 14 and 22 percent of diabetic beneficiaries in \nhealth plans did not get a blood sugar control test in 2001.\n  When Medicare and Medicare enrollees pay the same amount to providers \nthat give excellent care as it does to those who provide mediocre care, \nthat may unintentionally create incentives for providers to skimp or \ncut corners on quality. We debate endlessly over ways to control costs \nin Medicare, but we have not taken one of the simple steps that will, \nalmost certainly, drive quality up and assure that we are getting good \nvalue for the dollars we spend.\n  Medicare should be a leader in national efforts to improve quality. \nMedicare, with its $250 billion of purchasing power, 40 million \nenrollees, programs data, and professional experience can bring more \nresources to bear on these quality problems than any other purchaser.\n  The study we are proposing today would be the first step down this \npath. It would cost relatively little but yield great rewards as a \nguide to how to measure and pay for quality in the future. The study \nwould develop measures to assess quality, including outcome measures. \nIt would tell us what payment incentives have worked in the private \nsector. And it would identify approaches to use incentives to improve \nquality that can be implemented across all of Medicare.\n  So I am pleased that we are making this effort today, and hope that \nit is just the first step of many more that we will take down the path \nof improving Medicare for patients and consumers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1330. A bill to establish the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm \nNational Heritage Area in the State of Alaska, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm \nNational Heritage Area is one of the best examples for preserving the \nheritage of one of this Nation's first pioneer areas. This legislation \nwill create a national heritage corridor that covers an area from \nSeward to Anchorage.\n  This national heritage corridor will protect the natural and cultural \nresources of a well established region. The Kenai Mountains-Turnagain \nArm National Heritage Area will follow along a corridor that was \nestablished by pioneering Alaskans. This route will partially follow \ntwo nationally recognized treasures--the Iditarod Trail and the Seward \nHighway National Scenic Byway. It will honor Native traders, gold rush \nstampeders and the route of the Alaska Railroad. One of the biggest \ngold discoveries along this route was the Bear Creek gold find near \nHope in 1895. The route of the Alaska Railroad was finished in 1923.\n  Unlike many others, this national heritage corridor will not be \nmanaged by the Federal Government, but instead, by a group of local \ncommunity leaders. The preservation of historic areas depends largely \nupon the community and its support, and clearly, no one entity can \nprovide the adequate management, protection and preservation for these \nextensive resources. In fact, over the past five years, a group of \nlocal community leaders has been working hard for this national \nheritage designation. They have been successful in garnering support \nfrom communities throughout this entire route. These local folks have \nextensive knowledge of the resources; they are personally acquainted \nwith the area; they understand the ruggedness and the beauty of the \nland, and certainly appreciate the potential economic value this \ndesignation would bring to the area.\n  The preservation of history and heritage depends upon the mutual \nsupport and assistance from public and private groups. This national \nheritage designation has been a vision of many people from Seward to \nAnchorage, and comprises lands in the Kenai Mountains and the upper \nTurnagain Arm region. An 11-member board will be established and \ncharged with seeing the vision become a reality. This non-profit board\n\n[[Page S8566]]\n\nwill be tasked with coordinating and supporting the protection of trail \nresources; interpreting the trail, and identifying the cultural \nlandscapes of the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm historic transportation \ncorridor. A plan will also be developed for the management of the \nheritage corridor, and will complement existing Federal, State, borough \nand local plans. To ensure even greater support of this designation, \nthere will be opportunities provided to the public for their full \nparticipation as the plan is being developed.\n  The purposes of designating this national treasure are to: Enable all \npeople to envision and experience the heritage and impacts of \ntransportation routes used first by indigenous people, followed by \npioneers to the Nation's first frontier;\n  Encourage economic viability in the affected communities.\n  This national heritage corridor is significant for a whole host of \nreasons: Allow citizens to help preserve the heritage of the pioneers; \nprotect and honor the history of Native traders, gold seekers and \npioneers; decisions and management will be made by local citizens; \nsupport of several historical associations, the cities of Seward, \nGirdwood, Hope and Anchorage; an 11-member non-profit local board will \nplan and operate the heritage corridor; increase public awareness and \nappreciation for the natural, historical and cultural resources, and \nmodern resource development of the heritage corridor; restore historic \nbuildings and structures that are located within the boundaries of the \nheritage corridor; and, no additional lands will be acquired by the \nFederal Government or by the local management group.\n  Rarely ever do we have such an opportunity when whole communities, \nFederal, State and local governments agree on and support such a \nnational designation. Through adequate funding from the Department of \nthe Interior, interpretation signs and technical assistance to conduct \nlocal planning will help to preserve and protect natural, historical, \nlandscape and cultural resource values for current and future \ngenerations of the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm National Heritage \nArea.\n  And, finally, with the passage of this bill, visitors to the area can \nenjoy the shore lines of Turnagain Arm and watch the world's second \nlargest tidal range move 30 foot tides in and out. A traveler through \nthe mountain passes of the heritage area can view evidence of \nretreating glaciers and avalanches. Visitors will be amazed at the \nabundant wildlife that make their home in the area. The history of \nearly settlers will be preserved for current and future generations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1330\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to clarify the treatment of tax attributes under \nsection 108 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for taxpayers which \nfile consolidated returns; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill along with \nSenator Conrad that would close a gaping loophole in the Internal \nRevenue Code. This loophole involves the treatment of companies whose \ndebt is cancelled in a bankruptcy proceeding. Under existing law, these \ncompanies are not required to immediately pay tax on their income from \ndebt cancellation. The are, however, required to reduce their net \noperating losses, NOLs, and other tax attributes. These attribute \nreductions have the effect of allowing bankrupt companies to defer, but \nnot permanently avoid, paying tax on income from debt cancellation.\n  It has come to my attention that MCI/WorldCom and certain other \nbankrupt companies are attempting to circumvent these rules. In plain \nEnglish, MCI/WorldCom--the group of corporations that has perpetrated \nthe greatest business fraud--is trying to relieve itself of $35 billion \nof debt and yet emerge from bankruptcy with an NOL that is estimated to \nrange from $10 to $15 billion. Such an NOL will, post-bankruptcy, \neliminate federal income tax of $3.5 billion to $5.25 billion on MCI/\nWorldCom's first $10 to $15 billion of income.\n  Plainly, if this tax loophole is not eliminated, MCI/WorldCom will \nnot pay taxes for the foreseeable future. By attempting to utilize this \nloophole, MCI/WorldCom is demonstrating that it is not, in fact, a new \ncompany--instead, it is the same reckless company that we have come to \nknow. The legislation I am introducing today will assure that MCI/\nWorldCom doesn't get away with this outrageous behavior. It will also \nprevent other companies from imitating this approach.\n  Such results would be bad tax policy for two reasons. First, they \nwould clearly be contrary to the policy objectives that Congress \nintended to achieve when it enacted the current tax attribute reduction \nrules. Second, equivalent taxpayers would be treated differently under \nSection 108 based on their corporate structure and borrowing \npractices--factors that, form a tax policy standpoint, do not justify \nany difference in treatment.\n  Based on rulings and court cases, I believe this bill reflects the \ncurrent tax position of the Treasury Department with respect to NOLs. \nAlthough it is also clear that aggressive taxpayers and their lawyers \nhave utilized this tax loophole. The approach to this provision is \ncontrary to United Dominion Industries, Inc. v. United States, 532 U.S. \n822 (2001). Although not dealing directly with Section 108, the case is \nclear that the only NOL of a consolidated group is the group's entire \nNOL. I am introducing this bill with an effective date of today to \nprovide notice to MCI/WorldCom, and all similarly situated taxpayers, \nthat this Congress will not stand for this.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support closing this loophole to avoid \nsuch abuse in the future. I ask unanimous consent to have the Business \nWeek story from May 12, 2003, ``Why This Tax Loophole For Losers Should \nEnd,'' and the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n\n                                S. 1331\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CLARIFICATION OF THE TREATMENT OF TAX ATTRIBUTES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 108(b) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to reduction of tax attributes) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(6) Affiliated groups.--If the taxpayer is a member of an \n     affiliated group of corporations which files a consolidated \n     return under section 1501, the tax attributes described in \n     paragraph (1) shall be the aggregate tax attributes of such \n     group. The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may \n     be necessary under section 1502 to carry out the purposes of \n     this paragraph.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to discharges of indebtedness occurring after \n     June 25, 2003, except that discharges of indebtedness under \n     any plan of reorganization in a case under title 11, United \n     States Code, shall be deemed to occur on the date such plan \n     is confirmed.\n  There being no objection, the additional material ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Business Week, May 12, 2003]\n\n                            (By David Henry)\n\n              Why This Tax Loophole for Losers Should End\n\n       Is there no end to the ugly superlatives that fallen \n     telecom giant WorldCom Inc. is amassing? First, its top execs \n     reigned over the greatest alleged accounting fraud in \n     history. Then, the company filed the largest corporate \n     bankruptcy. Now, it is lining up to collect what could be one \n     of the biggest single corporate tax breaks of all time.\n       To the fury of its competitors, WorldCom is angling to \n     snare a $2.5 billion benefit from Uncle Sam. How? By \n     exploiting a provision in the Internal Revenue Service code \n     so it\n\n[[Page S8568]]\n\n     can hanging onto previous losses of at least $6.6 billion and \n     enjoy years of tax-free earnings. What's more, the ploy would \n     protect new management against any takeover for at least two \n     years. And, WorldCom could use the losses to offset even \n     income it picks up by taking over other companies. ``WorldCom \n     is in an enviable position,'' says Robert Willens, tax \n     accounting analyst at Lehman Brothers Inc. ``It will have a \n     copious tax losses and can be a powerful acquirer.''\n       WorldCom's new owners--the holders of its $41 billion of \n     dad debt--are driving a truck through a loophole that needs \n     to be closed pronto. It was left open by Congress when the \n     lawmakers overhauled IRS rules to stamp out a notorious trade \n     in corporate tax losses. At one time, owners of loss-making \n     businesses could sell their companies along with their \n     accumulated tax loss--often their only asssit--to profitable \n     companies. Now, tax losses are snuffed out when company \n     ownership changes hands.\n       So, WorldCom is going through hoops to avoid that fate. \n     Pending a final vote by creditors later this year, the \n     company is changing its bylaws to prohibit anyone from \n     building anyone from building a stake of more than 4.75 \n     percent in the company. They have to keep bidders at bay for \n     at least two years, otherwise the IRS would argue that \n     control of WorldCom has changed hands and that the tax \n     losses--which, assuming a 38 percent tax rate, could give a \n     $2.5 billion boost to earnings--should be wiped out. ``It is \n     the perfect poison pill,'' says Carl M. Jenks, tax expert at \n     law firm Jones Day.\n       The perverse tactic is increasingly popular. The former \n     Williams Communication Group put a similar 5 percent \n     ownership limit in place last fall when it became WilTil \n     Communications Group Inc. after a bankruptcy reorganization. \n     The bankruptcy judge overseeing UAL Corp. agreed on Feb. 24 \n     to a similar restriction on UAL securities in order to \n     preserve its $4 billion of tax losses. ``We will generally \n     recommend that any company with net operating losses worth \n     anything adopt these restrictions,'' says Douglas W. Killip, \n     a tax lawyer at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Field.\n       For WorldCom's rivals, the tax break is salt on a wound. \n     William P. Barr, a former U.S. attorney general and now \n     general counsel of Verizon Communications, fumes that \n     WorldCom is trying to ``compound its fraud by escaping the \n     payment of taxes.'' WorldCom's bankruptcy reorganization will \n     eliminate the cost of servicing some $30 billion of debt. \n     That, the company projects, will help it to make $2 billion \n     before taxes next year. By using the tax losses, it will be \n     able to keep about $780 million in cash it would otherwise \n     owe the government. In fact, it won't be liable for any tax \n     at least until the accumulated losses are worked through. \n     And, because it racked up the $6.6 billion in losses just \n     through 2001, WorldCom could have billions more to play with \n     once the numbers for 2002 are finally worked out.\n       What's more, the poison pill is likely to deter any company \n     from buying WorldCom and dumping some of the obsolete assets \n     still clogging and telecom industry. That will slow and \n     recovery in capital spending and hurt WorldCom's competitors. \n     ``It is bad when business decisions are motivated by tax \n     reasons and not based on sound economics,'' says Anthony \n     Sabino, bankruptcy law professor at St. John's University.\n       Rivals are likely to push the IRS to find a way to stop \n     WorldCom from utilizing the losses, observers say. But their \n     chances of success are slim because the IRS never issued \n     regulations that could have nullified the ploy. And the \n     courts generally rule against the agency when it attempts to \n     write rules retroactively, Willens says.\n       Still, it's time to close the stable door before any more \n     horses bolt. Besides, Uncle Sam could use the money right \n     now.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 1332. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide regulatory relief, appeals process reforms, contracting \nflexibility, and education improvements under the Medicare program, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, there is no question that our need to \nimprove the Medicare program by adding prescription drug coverage for \nbeneficiaries is extremely important, as this debate indicates.\n  But, our discussions would not be complete if we neglected another \nmajor Medicare improvement which is also long overdue, and that is the \nneed to improve the climate in which providers strive to provide high \nquality services to patients.\n  Medicare's anticipated regulations--three times longer than the U.S. \ntax code--prevent providers from delivering health care efficiently and \nbeneficiaries from receiving the care they need.\n  Complex Federal regulations and reams of paperwork require physicians \nto spend hours each day filling out government forms rather than caring \nfor their patients. The array of Federal Medicare rules with which \nphysicians must comply is overwhelming. Doctors are required to \ncomplete claims forms, advance beneficiary notices, certify medical \nnecessity, file enrollment forms, and comply with code documentation \nguidelines. Indeed, these rules and mandates are not only extensive, \nthey are constantly changing and they may be interpreted differently in \ndifferent regions of the country.\n  The complexity of the rules and the variation in their interpretation \nhas prompted outcries from all centers of our country. In fact, I have \nheard loud and clear from the physicians in my home State of Utah about \nthe severity of the problem.\n  Leon Sorensen, Executive Vice President of the Utah Medical \nAssociation, recently wrote to me and said:\n\n       ``The Utah Medical Association has long been concerned \n     about the unnecessary burdens placed upon physicians by the \n     voluminous regulations of Medicare. Not only does compliance \n     with these regulations take physicians' time away from \n     patients, but also the regulations contribute to the high \n     cost of medical care while contributing little of value. They \n     discourage physicians from participating fully in Medicare. \n     They are often punitive in nature rather than an educational. \n     They use tactics that would not be tolerated by businesses or \n     government if applied to them.\n       An example is the practice of extrapolating a small sample \n     of billing errors over the physician's entire practice, \n     making the physician liable for payback of thousands of \n     dollars of ``overpaid'' claims when demonstrated over \n     billings may amount only to a few dollars. If this process \n     were used by the IRS in a tax audit, the public outcry would \n     be deafening.\n       Medicare also requires that alleged ``overpayments'' to \n     physicians by repaid within 60 days, even if a physician \n     chooses to appeal Medicare's allegations. When assessed a \n     Medicare overpayment, the only way physicians can appeal is \n     to subject their practices to another audit, using a \n     ``statistically valid random sample.'' Statistical sample \n     audits can shut down a physician's practice for days, \n     preventing physicians from treating patients. Physicians are \n     forced to settle with Medicare rather than be subjected to \n     such unfair scrutiny.\n       Any defense against this kind of administrative abuse is \n     extremely costly, time consuming and often ineffective.\n\n  Indeed, failure to follow Medicare's complex rules--or just the \nperception of such failure--can result in an audit of a physician's \nbilling records, withholding of payments and crippling of a physician's \npractice.\n  And, physicians are not the only individuals affected by these rules. \nMedicare beneficiaries are affected--both directly and indirectly--by \nMedicare's onerous rules and burdensome paperwork. Both patients and \nproviders are confused by obscure paperwork and apparently conflicting \nrules. Physicians have difficulty understanding how to bill for their \nservices and beneficiaries find it difficult to understand the forms \nand billing information that they receive. Indeed, the administrative \ncosts associated with managing this paperwork and the fear of harsh \nconsequences in response to clerical errors has led some providers to \nconsider whether they should continue to participate in the Medicare \nprogram.\n  The problem has not escaped the attention of the administration and \naddressing it is a priority for President Bush and it should be for \nCongress also. Secretary Thompson has said, ``Patients and providers \nalike are fed up with voluminous and complex paperwork. Rules are \nconstantly changing. Complexity is overloading the system, \ncriminalizing honest mistakes and driving doctors, nurses, and other \nhealth care professionals out of the program.''\n  Congress has considered legislation over the past few years to \nprovide relief from this regulatory burden. Former Senator Frank \nMurkowski should be given great credit for drafting S. 452, the \n``Medicare Education and Regulatory Fairness Act of 2001''--legislation \nthat he introduced in the Senate on March 5, 2001 but which never came \nto a vote.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today, the ``Medicare Education \nRegulatory Reform and Contracting Improvement Act of 2003,'' MERCI, \nbuilds on that initiative. It will improve the Medicare program for \nbeneficiaries and providers alike by clarifying regulations, rewarding \nquality and by enhancing services. I am introducing this legislation \ntoday because the need for Medicare regulatory reform remains. In fact, \nthe need for Medicare regulatory reform has never been greater. In \naddition, the regulatory reform that I am proposing in MERCI fits hand \nin glove with the reforms that we have\n\n[[Page S8569]]\n\nproposed in S. 1, the ``Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act \nof 2003.'' The reformed Medicare program must include reformed \nregulations if it is to provide efficient service to beneficiaries.\n  Let me take a moment to review a few of the important provisions in \nthis bill. The educational provisions of the MERCI Act are designed to \ndecrease Medicare billing and claims payment errors by improving \neducation and training programs for Medicare providers. It includes \nalso provisions that will improve communication between the Department \nof Health and Human Services and Medicare providers. Furthermore, the \nbill will improve communication with Medicare beneficiaries by \nproviding for central toll-free telephone services to require free, \nappropriate referrals to individuals seeking information or assistance \nwith Medicare.\n  The MERCI Act includes regulatory reform provisions that are designed \nto reduce waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare; provisions that are just \nand fair for beneficiaries, contractors, and providers. Among other \nthings, the bill eliminates retroactive application of regulatory \nchanges and expedites the appeals processes for beneficiaries, \nproviders, and suppliers of Medicare services.\n  Finally, the MERCI Act will improve Medicare contracting; increasing \ncompetition, improving service and reducing costs by providing for a \ncompetitive bidding process for Medicare contractors that takes into \naccount performance quality, price and other factors that are important \nto beneficiaries.\n  Medicare beneficiaries and Medicare providers have been suffering \nfrom burdensome and confusing regulations for too long. It is time that \nthey received some mercy. The time for Medicare regulatory reform has \ncome and the bill that I am introducing today provides that mercy. \nMERCI, the ``Medicare Education, Regulatory Reform and Contracting \nImprovement Act of 2003'' takes a common sense approach to providing \nrelief for the Medicare beneficiaries and providers who have been \nsuffering this burden for so long.\n  I believe that MERCI will improve the delivery of health care \nservices to Medicare beneficiaries by enhancing the efficiency of the \nMedicare program for all concerned.\n  Finally, I would be remiss if I did not thank Chairman Grassley and \nSenator Baucus for working with me to include the MERCI legislative \nlanguage in S. 1, the ``Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act \nof 2003.'' Senators Grassley and Baucus have worked for many years to \nreform Medicare's complex regulations, as have I, and their agreement \nto include this language is appreciated greatly.\n  And so, it is with a great appreciation for my colleagues who have \nworked with me on this legislation and for those who have worked on \nsimilar legislation in the past, that I urge my colleagues in the \nSenate today to join me in addressing the needs of Medicare \nbeneficiaries and providers by supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bunning, Mr. \n        Daschle, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Baucus, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Thomas, \n        Mr. Smith, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Graham of Florida, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Breaux, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 1333. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the treatment of certain expenses of rural letter carriers; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the U.S. Postal Service provides a vital \nand important communication link for the Nation and the citizens of my \nhome State of Iowa. Rural Letter Carriers play a special role and have \na proud history as an important link in assuring the delivery of our \nmail. Rural letter carriers first delivered the mail with their own \nhorses and buggies, later with their own motorcycles, and now in their \nown cars and trucks. They are responsible for maintenance and operation \nof their vehicles in all types of weather and road conditions. In the \nwinter, snow and ice is their enemy, while in the spring, the melting \nsnow and ice causes potholes and washboard roads. In spite of these \nquite adverse conditions, rural letter carriers daily drive over 3 \nmillion miles and serve 24 million American families on over 66,000 \nroutes.\n  Although the mission of rural carriers has not changed since the \nhorse and buggy days, the amount of mail they deliver has changed \ndramatically. As the Nation's mail volume has increased throughout the \nyears, the Postal Service is now delivering more than 200 billion \npieces of mail a year. The average carrier delivers about 2,300 pieces \nof mail a day to about 500 addresses.\n  Most recently, e-commerce has changed the type of mail rural letter \ncarriers deliver. This fact was confirmed in a GAO study entitled \n``U.S. Postal Service: Challenges to Sustaining Performance \nImprovements Remain Formidable on the Brink of the 21st Century,'' \ndated October 21, 1999. As this report explains, the Postal Service \nexpects declines in its core business, which is essentially letter \nmail, in the coming years. The growth of e-mail on the Internet, \nelectronic communications, and electronic commerce has the potential to \nsubstantially affect the Postal Service's mail volume.\n  First-Class mail has always been the bread and butter of the Postal \nService's revenue, but the amount of revenue from First-Class letters \nis declining. E-commerce is providing the Postal Service with another \nopportunity to increase another part of its business. That is because \nwhat individuals and companies order over the Internet must be \ndelivered, sometimes by the Postal Service and often by rural letter \ncarriers. Currently, the Postal Service had about 33 percent of the \nparcel business. Rural letter carriers are now delivering larger \nvolumes of business mail, parcels, and priority mail packages. But, \nmore parcel business means more cargo capacity is necessary in postal \ndelivery vehicles, especially in those owned and operated by rural \nletter carriers.\n  When delivering greeting cards or bills, or packages ordered over the \nInternet, rural letter carriers use vehicles they currently purchase, \noperate and maintain. In exchange, they receive a reimbursement from \nthe Postal Service. This reimbursement is called an Equipment \nMaintenance Allowance, EMA. Congress recognizes that providing a \npersonal vehicle to delivery the U.S. Mail is not typical vehicle use. \nSo, when a rural letter carrier is ready to sell such a vehicle, it's \ngoing to have little trade-in value because of the typically high \nmileage, extraordinary wear and tear, and the fact that it is probably \nright-hand drive. Therefore, Congress intended to exempt the EMA \nallowance from taxation in 1988 through a specific provision for rural \nmail carriers in the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988.\n  That provision allowed an employee of the U.S. Postal Service who was \ninvolved in the collection and delivery of mail on a rural route, to \ncompute their business use mileage deduction as 150 percent of the \nstandard mileage rate for all business use mileage. As an alternative, \nrural letter carrier taxpayers could elect to utilize the actual \nexpense method, business portion of actual operation and maintenance of \nthe vehicle, plus depreciation. If EMA exceeded the allowable vehicle \nexpense deductions, the excess was subject to tax. If EMA fell short of \nthe allowable vehicle expenses, a deduction was allowed only to the \nextent that the sum of the shortfall and all other miscellaneous \nitemized deductions exceeded two percent of the taxpayer's adjusted \ngross income.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 further simplified the tax returns of \nrural letter carriers. That Act permitted the EMA income and expenses \n``to wash,'' so that neither income nor expenses would have to be \nreported on a rural letter carrier's return. That simplified taxes for \napproximately 120,000 taxpayers, but the provision eliminated the \noption of filing the actual expense method for employee business \nvehicle expenses. The lack of this option, combined with the dramatic \nchanges the Internet is having on the mail, specifically on rural \nletter carriers and their vehicles, is a problem I believe Congress \nmust address.\n  The mail mix is changing and already Postal Service management has, \nunderstandably, encouraged rural letter carriers to purchase larger \nright-hand\n\n[[Page S8570]]\n\ndrive vehicles, such as Sports Utility Vehicles, SUVs, to handle the \nincrease in parcel loads. Large SUVs are much more expensive than \ntraditional vehicles. So without the ability to use the actual expense \nmethod and depreciation, rural letter carriers must use their salaries \nto cover vehicle expenses. Additionally, the Postal Service has placed \n11,000 postal vehicles on rural routes, which means those carriers \nreceive no EMA.\n  These developments have created a situation that is contrary to the \nhistorical Congressional intent of using reimbursement to fund the \ngovernment service of delivering mail, and also has created an \ninequitable tax situation for rural letter carriers. If actual business \nexpenses exceed the EMA, a deduction for those expenses should be \nallowed. To correct this inequity, I am introducing a bill today that \nreinstates the ability of a rural letter carrier to choose between \nusing the actual expense method for computing the deduction allowable \nfor business use of a vehicle, or using the current practice of \ndeducting the reimbursed EMA expenses.\n  Rural letter carriers perform a necessary and valuable service and \nface may changes and challenges in this new Internet era. We must make \nsure that these public servants receive fair and equitable tax \ntreatment as they perform their essential role in fulfilling the Postal \nService's mandate of binding the Nation together.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senators Bingaman, Daschle, Bunning, \nRockefeller, Snowe, Thomas, Smith of Oregon, Conrad, Graham of Florida, \nKerry, Breaux, Lincoln and myself in sponsoring this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1333\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CERTAIN EXPENSES OF RURAL LETTER CARRIERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 162(o) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to treatment of certain reimbursed \n     expenses of rural mail carriers) is amended by redesignating \n     paragraph (2) as paragraph (3) and by inserting after \n     paragraph (1) the following:\n       ``(2) Special rule where expenses exceed reimbursements.--\n     Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(A), if the expenses incurred by \n     an employee for the use of a vehicle in performing services \n     described in paragraph (1) exceed the qualified \n     reimbursements for such expenses, such excess shall be taken \n     into account in computing the miscellaneous itemized \n     deductions of the employee under section 67.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--The heading for section 162(o) \n     of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking \n     ``Reimbursed''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2003.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I join Senator Grassley, the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, and several of our colleagues in introducing \nlegislation that will allow rural letter carriers to deduct their \nactual expenses when they use their own vehicle to deliver the mail. \nThis Tax Code correction will reduce the out-of-pocket costs currently \nincurred by our Nation's rural letter carriers, giving them comparable \ntax treatment enjoyed by others using their vehicles in their line of \nbusiness.\n  For many years, rural letter carriers were allowed to calculate their \ndeductible expenses by using either a special formula or keeping track \nof their costs. In 1997, Congress simplified the tax treatment for \nletter carriers, but disallowed them the ability to use the actual \nexpense method--business portion of actual operation and maintenance of \nthe vehicle, plus depreciation--for calculating their costs. \nUnfortunately, this has resulted in many letter carriers being unable \nto account for their real expenses when using their own vehicle to \ndeliver the mail. This problem is worse in more rugged parts of our \ncountry where road conditions and severe weather can require letter \ncarriers to use an SUV or four-wheel-drive vehicle that are more \nexpensive to maintain. This legislation will ensure that these mail \ncarriers are fully reimbursed for the costs associated with the \noperation of their vehicles.\n  Although the Internet has made the world seem smaller, purchased \ngoods must still be delivered. The benefits of Internet purchases in \nremote locations is limited if the purchased item cannot be delivered. \nFor this reason, in rural States, such as New Mexico, these letter \ncarriers play an important role in delivering the majority of the \nState's mail and parcels. On a daily basis across the Nation, rural \nletter carriers drive over 3 million miles delivering mail and parcels \nto over 30 million families. We need to be sure that we have not \ncreated a tax impediment for these dedicated individuals. I look \nforward to working with the chairman and my colleagues to get this \nlegislation passed this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord immediately following the statement of Senator Grassley on the \nintroduction of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Graham of Florida, Ms. \n        Mikulski, and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 1335. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nindividuals a deduction for qualified long-term care insurance \npremiums, use of such insurance under cafeteria plans and flexible \nspending arrangements, and a credit for individuals with long-term care \nneeds; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Long-Term \nCare and Retirement Security Act. This legislation, which I sponsored \nin the 106th and 107th Congress with my distinguished colleague from \nFlorida, Senator Bob Graham, would ease the tremendous cost of long-\nterm care.\n  The bill that Senator Graham and I are re-introducing today would \nallow individuals a tax deduction for the cost of long-term care \ninsurance premiums. Increasingly, Americans are interested in private \nlong-term care insurance to pay for nursing home stays, assisted \nliving, home health aides, and other services. However, most people \nfind the policies unaffordable. The younger the person, the lower the \ninsurance premium, yet most people aren't ready to buy a policy until \nretirement. A deduction would encourage more people to buy long-term \ninsurance.\n  Our proposal would also give individuals or their care givers a \n$3,000 tax credit to help cover their long-term care expenses. This \nwould apply to those who have been certified by a doctor as needing \nhelp with at least three activities of daily living, such as eating, \nbathing, or dressing. This credit would help care givers pay for \nmedical supplies, nursing care and any other expenses incurred while \ncaring for family members with disabilities.\n  One family that would benefit from this legislation is the Gardner \nfamily of Waterloo, IA. Ruth Gardner is a 70-year-old mother of nine \nwho suffers from a degenerative tissue disorder, Scleroderma, atrial \nfibrillation, congestive heart failure and is a breast cancer survivor. \nFor the last 3 years her nine children, their spouses and numerous \ngrandchildren have worked tirelessly to fulfill Ms. Gardner's wish of \nspending her last months with dignity and respect at home.\n  While Ms. Gardner's wish may seem small, the task of managing her \ncare is not. Each week family members meet to organize their schedules \nin an effort to provide over 20 hours of daily care for Ms. Gardner. \nWorking relentlessly, and at a considerable cost, the Gardner family \nmanages to provide around-the-clock care while balancing both work and \ntheir family lives. All this effort comes at a great cost, both \nemotionally and financially. The Gardners have been able to locate some \nfunding to help support the care for Ms. Gardner; however, the family \ncontinues to bear considerable costs. These costs include weekly \nnursing visits that cost $102 per visit, emergency response service at \n$30 a month, daily hospice service at $32 an hour and not to mention \nthe hours and hours of personal time donated by the family.\n  The Long-Term Care and Retirement Security Act would help the 22 \nmillion family caregivers like the Gardners. A $3,000 tax credit would \nhelp to pay for Ms. Gardner's monthly hospice care, weekly nurse visits \nor help to hire a nurse to cover some of the time that the family \ncurrently donates. This legislation would also help the increasing \nnumber of families placed in the difficult situation by allowing them \nto purchase long-term care insurance. Had this legislation been enacted \nearlier, long-term care insurance would\n\n[[Page S8571]]\n\nhave been an affordable option for Ms. Gardner, alleviating the \ndifficult situation that her family currently faces.\n  As it has in the past, the bill that Senator Graham and I are \nintroducing today has been endorsed by both the AARP and the Health \nInsurance Association of America. A companion bill sponsored by \nRepresentatives Nancy Johnson, Karen Thurman and Earl Pomeroy is \npending in the House of Representatives.\n  An aging nation has no time to waste in preparing for long-term care, \nand the need to help people afford long-term care is more pressing than \never. I look forward to working with Senator Graham and our colleagues \nin the Senate to get our bill passed into law as soon as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1335\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, there has been a renewed \ninterest in health issues, particularly the plight\n\n[[Page S8573]]\n\nof the uninsured. That issue presents lawmakers with significant \nchallenges, particularly finding the right mixes of programs to provide \nhealth care coverage to the vastly different populations that make up \nthis group.\n  There is an equally daunting health care issue facing our country, \nbut it is one that has received far less attention. That issue is the \nincreasing need for long-term care. Over 13 million people in the \nUnited States need help with basic activities of daily living such as \neating, getting in and out of bed, getting around inside, dressing, \nbathing and using the toilet. While many Americans believe that long-\nterm care is an issue primarily affecting seniors, the reality is that \n5.2 million adults between the ages of 18 to 64 and over 450,000 \nchildren need long-term care services. These numbers are expected to \ndouble as the baby boom generation begins to retire.\n  Most long-term is provided at home or in the community by informal \ncaregivers. However, in situations where individuals must enter nursing \nhomes or other institutional facilities, costs are paid largely out-of-\npocket. Such a financing structure jeopardizes the retirement security \nof many Americans who have worked hard their entire lives.\n  In order to help families address their long-term care needs, Senator \nGrassley and I are re-introducing the ``Long-Term Care and Retirement \nSecurity Act.'' This legislation provides two important tools to help \nAmericans and their families meet their immediate and future long-term \ncare needs--an above-the-line income tax deduction for the purchase of \nlong-term care insurance and a caregiver tax credit.\n  First, the bill provides an above-the-line deduction for long-term \ncare premiums to make long-term care insurance more affordable for a \ngreater number of Americans. Today, such premiums are deductible, but \nthe availability of the deduction is severely limited. First, the \ncurrent deduction is available only for the thirty percent of taxpayers \nwho itemize their deductions. That leaves the remaining seventy percent \nof taxpayers with absolutely no benefit. Second, the deduction is \nlimited to an amount, which in addition to other medical expenses \nexceeds 7.5 percent of the taxpayers adjusted gross income. This AGI \nlimit further decreases the utilization of the current deduction.\n  The Graham-Grassley legislation removes these restrictions and makes \nthe deduction for long-term care premiums available to all taxpayers.\n  In order to provide sufficient incentives for families to maintain \nlong-term care coverage, the deduction allowed under this bill \nincreases the longer the policy is maintained. The deduction starts at \n60 percent for premiums paid during the first year of coverage and \ngradually increases each year thereafter until the deduction reaches \n100 percent after at least 4 years of continuous coverage. This \nschedule is accelerated for those age 55 or older. For them, the \ndeduction starts at 70 percent for the first year and increases to 100 \npercent with at least two years of continuous coverage.\n  Second, the bill provides an income tax credit for taxpayers with \nlong-term care needs. The credit is phased in over 4 years, starting at \n$1,000 for 2003 and eventually reaching $3,000. To target assistance to \nthose most in need, the credit phases out for married couples with \nincome above $150,000, $75,000 for single taxpayers.\n  In addition to the deduction and tax credit, our bill allows \nemployers to offer long-term care insurance under cafeteria plans and \ninclude long-term care services as reimbursable costs under flexible \nspending arrangements. The bill also updates the requirements that \nlong-term care policies must meet in order to qualify for the income \ntax deduction. These updated requirements reflect the most recent model \nregulations and code issued by the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Grassley and me in cosponsoring \nthis legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1336.

A bill to establish an incentive program to promote \neffective safety belt laws and increase safety belt use; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nSafe, Efficient, Automobile Travel to Better Ensure Lives in Transit, \nSEAT BELT, Act of 2003.\n  This bill will establish an incentive grant program that rewards \nStates that have enacted or will enact primary seat belt laws. The bill \nalso gives a premium to those States that increase seat belt usage.\n  According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, \nNHTSA, motor vehicle crashes are responsible for 95 percent of all \ntransportation-related deaths and 99 percent of all transportation-\nrelated injuries. It is estimated that in 2002, 42,850 people were \nkilled in vehicle crashes and roughly 3 million more were injured. \nMotor vehicle crashes are ranked as the leading cause of death for \nAmericans ages 1 to 34.\n  In addition to the thousands of transportation-related deaths and \ninjuries, the economic costs associated with vehicle crashes constitute \na serious public health problem and significant fiscal burden to the \nNation. The total annual economic cost to the U.S. economy of all motor \nvehicle crashes is an astonishing $230.6 billion, or 2.3 percent of the \nU.S. gross domestic product. This translates into an average of $820 \nfor every person living in the United States.\n  Increasing seat belt usage is a guaranteed and proven way to lower \nthe number of transportation-related deaths and costs associated with \nvehicle crashes. In 2002, 59 percent of vehicle occupants killed were \nnot restrained by seat belts or child safety seats. Safety experts \nagree that the best short-term and most immediate way to reduce traffic \ncrash fatalities and serious injuries is to increase seat belt use.\n  Experience in the United States and other countries has shown that \nsound laws coupled with high-visibility enforcement are the keys to \nhigh seat belt use. Currently, the effectiveness of most State seat \nbelt laws is reduced by secondary enforcement provisions that preclude \nlaw enforcement from stopping an unbelted motorist unless another \ntraffic law violation is also observed.\n  Primary enforcement seat belt laws are significantly correlated with \nhigher seat belt usage levels. States with primary enforcement laws \nhave an average of 80 percent belt usage, compared to just 69 percent \nin States having secondary enforcement laws. Currently, only 19 \njurisdictions have primary seat belt laws. Nearly 4000 lives would be \nsaved each year if seat belt use were to increase from the national \naverage of 75 percent to 90 percent.\n  The SEAT BELT Act creates two grant programs to encourage seat belt \nuse. The first grant program rewards States that have or will have \nprimary seat belt enforcement. Forty percent of the available funds for \nthis program will be applied to the first grant category.\n  Every State that enacts a primary seat belt law or currently has one \nwill receive two times their Section 402 allotment. Those States that \nenact a primary seat belt law sooner will receive\n\n[[Page S8574]]\n\ntheir incentive grant sooner. Any funds not obligated by the end of FY \n2008 will be made available to States qualified to receive funds under \nthe second grant category.\n  The second grant program would reward States that increase their seat \nbelt usage. Sixty percent of the available funds for this program will \nbe applied to the second grant category. The Secretary of \nTransportation shall carry out this program which is designed to \nmaximize the effectiveness of the awarded funds and the fairness of the \ndistribution of such funds; increase the national seat belt usage rate \nas expeditiously as possible; reward States that maintain a seat belt \nusage rate above 85 percent, as determined by NHTSA; and reward States \nthat demonstrate an increase in their seat belt usage rates.\n  The SEAT BELT Act will ensure that funds are distributed fairly by \nrewarding the 19 jurisdictions, including my home state of Oregon, \nwhich took an early lead to enact a primary seat belt law. The Act also \nprovides sufficient financial incentives to persuade the States that \nhave not enacted a primary seat belt law to do so. And lastly, the Act \nprovides continuing incentives to States to encourage them to have high \nseat belt usage rates and rewards them for their persistence in \nstriving towards higher usage rates.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation and ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1337\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration (NHTSA), motor vehicle crashes are responsible \n     for 95 percent of all transportation-related deaths and 99 \n     percent of all transportation-related injuries.\n       (2) Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death \n     for Americans between the ages of 1 and 34.\n       (3) It is estimated that, in 2002, 42,850 people were \n     killed and approximately 3,000,000 people were injured in \n     vehicle crashes.\n       (4) NHTSA estimates that if safety belt use were to \n     increase from 75 percent to 90 percent, nearly 4,000 lives \n     would be saved each year.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 183\n\n       Whereas section 208 of the Department of Justice \n     Appropriation Act, 1953 (commonly known as the McCarran \n     Amendment) (43 U.S.C. 666) waived the sovereign immunity of \n     the United States so that it could be joined in comprehensive \n     State general adjudications of the rights to use water;\n       Whereas in United States v. District Court for Eagle \n     County, 401 U.S. 520, 524 (1971), the Supreme Court confirmed \n     that the McCarran Amendment was ``an all-inclusive statute \n     concerning `the adjudication of rights to the use of water of \n     a river system' which . . . has no exceptions and . . . \n     includes appropriative rights, riparian rights, and reserved \n     rights'';\n       Whereas in Colorado River Water Conservation District v. \n     United States, 424 U.S. 800, 819 (1976), the Supreme Court \n     concluded that the concern over ``avoiding the generation of \n     additional litigation through permitting inconsistent \n     dispositions of property . . . Is heightened with respect to \n     water rights, the relationships among which are highly \n     interdependent'' and that the ``consent to jurisdiction given \n     by the McCarran Amendment bespeaks a policy that recognizes \n     the availability of comprehensive state systems for \n     adjudication of water rights as the means of achieving these \n     goals'';\n       Whereas since the passage of the McCarran Amendment, \n     Federal and non-Federal users, along with numerous Western \n     States, have invested millions of dollars in water right \n     adjudications in those States to establish rights to the use \n     of water that will determine priority of use during times of \n     scarcity;\n       Whereas State water laws in the West have evolved to \n     accommodate instream values such as recreation and \n     environmental needs, while continuing to recognize and \n     protect traditional consumptive uses for the West's cities \n     and farms;\n       Whereas Federal claims for water have been recognized under \n     both Federal and State laws within State general \n     adjudications, thus enhancing the protection of Federal \n     interests, as well as the certainty and reliability of non-\n     Federal interests, in water in the West;\n       Whereas the significance of the McCarran Amendment, in \n     providing States with the ability to determine the extent of \n     federal claims to water resources, has become increasingly \n     apparent as many of the Western States are experiencing a \n     severe and sustained drought, where water supplies for all \n     purposes are severely restricted; and\n       Whereas now more than ever there is a pressing need to \n     recognize and support the availability of comprehensive \n     systems for quantification of rights to use water in those \n     Western States for all beneficial purposes: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, that the Senate--\n       (1) reaffirms the policies and principles of the McCarran \n     Amendment that have been recognized by Supreme Court \n     decisions and recognizes that, as a matter of practice, the \n     United States should adhere and defer to State water law; and\n\n[[Page S8575]]\n\n       (2) commends Western States that maintain comprehensive \n     systems for the quantification of rights to use water for all \n     beneficial purposes, including environmental protection and \n     enhancement.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise to submit a Resolution \ncommemorating 50 years of adjudicating water rights under the McCarran \nAmendment and commending Western States' management of water.\n  Rather than simply go into the Resolution itself, I would like to put \nthe Amendment in its proper historical context.\n  Unlike the Eastern United States, the history of the West, its \nsettlement, and even its founding, is closely linked to the Federal \nGovernment. We should remember that Lewis and Clark and so many other \ncourageous explorers who mapped the Western territories were funded by \nthe United States government. We should also be mindful that much of \nwhat we know as the West was purchased or otherwise acquired by the \nUnited States Government including the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and \nthe 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.\n  However, just because the Federal Government might have acquired the \nWestern territories didn't mean that people wanted to move there. The \nWest was a rough place, harsh land and harsher winters were enough to \nkeep most folks back East. Again, the United States took action to \npromote Westward expansion by implementing laws like the Homestead Act \nto encourage people to relocate.\n  Eventually, the dream of discovering gold and mining precious metals \nwas the catalyst that got people moving West, and eventual completion \nof the trans-continental railroad provided the means. Each Western \nterritory developed into a distinct State, based on the makeup of its \nconstituents, diverse as the Mormons of Utah to the Spanish and \nMexican-Americans of New Mexico and to the Great Plains Indians and \nother Tribes.\n  No matter the reason why people moved West, they all needed water as \nprecious and scarce a resource then as it is today. New industries and \ncities to sprout up that needed water to survive and a way to manage \nit.\n\n  Water law out West is as distinct from the East as are the histories \nof the two great regions of our Nation. In the West, water is a rare \ncommodity, and is therefore regarded as a property right under the law \nsold apart from the land.\n  Since water was such a scarce resource, each State managed water \nbased on its particular resources, geography, population, and municipal \nand industrial needs. Yet, Western States all recognized and favored \nwater adjudication systems according to the doctrines of prior \nappropriation and beneficial use.\n  State management of water worked rather smoothly for decades. Then \nafter World War II, during the new Deal's expansive programs, the \nFederal government sought to realign and trump the established States' \ninterest in water to some degree. On one hand, the Federal Government \nbelieved it to be acting in its own interest since Uncle Sam owned much \nof the West. The United States still owns thirty-seven percent of my \nState of Colorado.\n  The United States rode roughshod over State interests, often \ncompletely ignoring private property rights and resisting cooperative \nagreements to manage water. The States fought Federal arm twisting as \nbest as they could, but couldn't do much against the U.S. as sovereign. \nThe Federal bullying got so bad that in 1951, a Readers Digest article \ncriticized the U.S.'s strong arm tactics in the famous Santa Margarita \nwater conflict stating that, ``the lack of moral sensitivity in our \nGovernment has put into jeopardy thousands of our small landowners; \ntheir property, homes, savings and their future.''\n  Thankfully, Senator Patrick McCarran of Nevada along with other \nlikeminded Senators, successfully defended States' interests and got a \nvery simply provision passed into law. In short, the law that we are \ncelebrating today waives the United States' sovereign immunity so that \nit could be joined in general state adjudications of rights to use \nwater.\n  Although a simple concept, the McCarran Amendment effectively leveled \nthe playing field, requiring Uncle Sam to work within the State system \nhe implicitly helped to establish.\n  The breadth of the McCarran Amendment has been defined by U.S. \nSupreme Court cases. The Court concluded that although the amendment \nitself might be short in length, its effect war far reaching. The High \nCourt stated that McCarran was ``an all inclusive statute concerning \nthe adjudication of `the rights to the use of water of a river system' \n'' which ``has no exceptions'' and ``includes appropriat[ive] rights, \nriparian rights, and reserved rights.''\n  It is undeniable that the history of the West is linked to the \nFederal Government. Since the Federal Government maintains vast \nlandholdings, the future of the West will also be linked to Uncle Sam. \nSimilarly, the management of property and natural resources, of which \nwater is both, has been and shall remain a State function.\n  The purpose of the McCarran Amendment was to prevent federal bullying \nof private and state interests in managing water, and to recognize \nwater as a State resource. McCarran encourages the Federal Government \nto work together with the States.\n  I am submitting this resolution today at a time when much of the West \nis still under or will likely experience severe drought conditions. The \nFederal Government must remember the history of the McCarran amendment \nand look to the States in adjudicating water.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/25/senate-section/article/S8575-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8575-S8577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 184--CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S \n REPUBLIC OF CHINA IMMEDIATELY AND UNCONDITIONALLY TO RELEASE DR.

Res. 184\n\n       Whereas, according to the Department of State's 2002 \n     Country Reports on Human Rights Practices in China, the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China has ``continued \n     to commit numerous and serious [human rights] abuses,'' \n     including ``instances of . . . arbitrary arrest and \n     detention, lengthy incommunicado detention, and denial of due \n     process'';\n       Whereas according to the report, ``the country's criminal \n     procedures were not in compliance with international \n     standards,'' the ``lack of due process in the judicial system \n     remained a serious problem,'' and ``authorities routinely \n     violated legal protections in the cases of political \n     dissidents'';\n       Whereas Dr. Yang Jianli, an internationally renowned \n     scholar, pro-democracy activist, and president of the \n     Foundation for China in the 21st Century, is an alien \n     lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United \n     States who has been detained incommunicado by the Government \n     of the People's Republic of China since April 26, 2002;\n       Whereas according to the United Nations Commission on Human \n     Rights Resolution 1997/38 of April 11, 1997, ``prolonged \n     incommunicado detention may . . . itself constitute a form of \n     cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment,'' which is prohibited \n     by international law;\n       Whereas Dr. Yang Jianli has been deprived of his basic \n     human rights by being denied access to legal counsel and \n     contact with his wife and two children (who are United States \n     citizens), and has also been denied his right to trial within \n     a reasonable time or to release pending trial;\n       Whereas, on June 3, 2003, the United Nations Working Group \n     on Arbitrary Detention expressed the opinion that ``[t]he \n     non-observance of Mr. Yang Jianli's right to a fair trial is \n     of such gravity as to give his deprivation of liberty an \n     arbitrary character. Therefore, his arrest and detention is \n     arbitrary being in contravention of Article 9 of the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 9 of the \n     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.''; and\n       Whereas the arbitrary imprisonment of United States \n     citizens and permanent resident aliens by the Government of \n     the People's Republic of China and the continuing violations \n     by the Government of their fundamental human rights demands a \n     forceful response by Congress and the President of the United \n     States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONDEMNATION OF THE TREATMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT OF \n                   CHINA OF DR.

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the United States \n     should--\n       (1) make the immediate release of Dr. Yang Jianli by the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China a top priority \n     of United States foreign policy;\n       (2) continue to make every effort to assist Dr. Yang Jianli \n     and his family while discussions of his release are ongoing;\n       (3) ensure that the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China understands that the detention of United States \n     citizens and permanent resident aliens, and the infliction of \n     human rights violations on these groups, is not in the \n     interests of the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     because it will reduce the opportunities for cooperation \n     between the United States and the People's Republic of China;\n       (4) reiterate its deep concern regarding the continued \n     imprisonment of Dr. Yang Jianli and other United States \n     citizens and permanent resident aliens whose human rights are \n     being violated; and\n       (5) engage in discussions with the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China regarding the legal status and \n     immediate humanitarian needs of these United States citizens \n     and permanent resident aliens.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution calling \non the government of the People's Republic of China to release Dr. Yang \nJianli, an internationally renowned scholar and pro-democracy activist, \nwho has been detained in China since April 2002 without access to legal \ncounsel, contact with his family, or a trial. Dr. Yang, a U.S. \npermanent resident, is a mathematician and economist who lives in \nMassachusetts. He heads the Foundation for China in the 21st Century, a \ngroup that advocates democratization in China.\n  On June 3, the U.N.'s Working Group on Arbitrary Detention condemned \nChina's detention of Dr. Yang, finding that the Chinese government has \nviolated his rights as a citizen of China and as a resident of the U.S. \nThe panel declared that, ``The nonobservance of Dr. Yang's right to a \nfair trial is of such gravity as to give his deprivation of liberty an \narbitrary character. Therefore, his arrest and detention is arbitrary \nbeing in contravention of Article 9 of the Universal Declaration on \nHuman Rights and Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and \nPolitical Rights.''\n  In recognition of the U.N. working group's conclusions, as well as \nthe Chinese government's blatant rejection of them, the State \nDepartment officially called for Dr. Yang's release, stating, ``We are \nparticularly disturbed now by China's public rejection of an accepted \ninternational process and the findings of the independent and impartial \npanel of jurists, so we are urging China to comply fully with \ninternational obligations that it has assumed, and we urge that Dr. \nYang be released and allowed to return to his wife and children in \nBoston.''\n  The resolution that I am submitting with my colleagues goes hand-in-\nhand with the State Department's support for Dr. Yang. It expresses the \nsense of the Senate that the U.S. should: 1. make the immediate release \nof Dr. Yang Jianli a top foreign policy priority; 2. make clear to the \nChinese government that the detention of U.S. citizens and permanent \nresidents is not in its best interests; and 3. express the deep concern \nof the U.S. regarding the imprisonment of Dr. Yang and other U.S. \ncitizens and permanent residents, as well as discuss their legal status \nand humanitarian needs.\n  I would like to note that a similar resolution--submitted by \nRepresentatives Cox and Frank--is expected to be considered today by \nthe House of Representatives.\n  As I have stated repeatedly, if China wants to become a productive \nand respected member of the international community, it must begin to \nadhere to accepted norms of behavior. China's leaders seem to be \noblivious to the understanding that all people deserve certain basic \nfreedoms and that violation of such fundamental rights is an \nappropriate concern of the United States and the world at large. We \nshould make clear that the Chinese government's continued detention of \nYang Jianli and others--in violation of these international norms--will \nadversely impact our bilateral relations. Without such pressure, the \nbehavior of China's leaders is unlikely to change, and the voices of \nthose who have devoted their lives to the cause of freedom--like Yang \nJianli--will continue to be silenced.\n  I hope that my colleagues in the Senate will join me in strongly \nsupporting this resolution and in calling for Dr. Yang Jianli's \nrelease.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Kyl in submitting \na resolution calling for the immediate release of Dr. Yang Jianli. Dr. \nYang Jianli. Dr. Yang is a democracy activist who has since been held \nincommunicado in China for more than a year. Dr. Yang is being held in \nviolation of his human rights and international law. He should be freed \nnow.\n  Dr. Yang Jianli is a scholar and important democracy activist in his \nhome State of Massachusetts where he is founder and president of the \nFoundation for China in the 21st Century. Jianli is a permanent United \nStates resident who continues to work for democracy in his native \nChina.\n  Dr. Yang was taken into custody when he returned to China on April \n26, 2002. He has been held incommunicado since then. His family in \nMassachusetts and Maryland are understandably concerned about his \nwelfare.\n  The U.S. Department of State has called for China to release Dr. \nYang. So has the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. \nThe Chinese government refuses to admit to detaining this man \nillegally. However, the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention says, \n``The non-observance of Dr. Yang's right to a fair trial is of such \ngravity as to give his deprivation of liberty an arbitrary character. \nTherefore, his arrest and detention is arbitrary being in contravention \nof Article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human rights and Article 9 \nof the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights.'' In other \nwords, the Chinese government never bothered to charge Yang Jianli with \na crime--they just locked him up and threw away the key.\n  We can assist by increasing the pressure of the Chinese government \nand support the U.N. petition on Dr. Yang's behalf. Being deprived of \nhis basic human rights of access to legal counsel and contact with his \nwife and children is wrong. When China wanted most-favored-nation trade \nstatus, we heard a lot of lip service to human rights and democracy. \nDr. Yang Jianli's case shows the true face of China's government. They \nlocked him up because he wanted to speak out about democracy and human \nrights.\n  I strongly urge the Chinese government to respond to the continual \nrequests for Yang's freedom by the United States government and human \nrights groups around the world. The House is taking up a similar \nresolution today. I hope that the Senate will act quickly to add our \nvoices in calling for freedom for Yang Jianli.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, after more than a year of suffering \nabuse and incommunicado detention, I urge this body to call for the \nimmediate and unconditional release of Chinese democracy activist, Dr. \nYang Jianli.\n  Dr. Yang, a permanent resident of the United States, a respected \nscholar, a pro-democracy advocate, president of the Foundation for \nChina in the 21st Century, as well as a loving husband and father, is \nnow a prisoner and victim of shameless abuse by the Chinese government.\n  Following his participation in the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-\ndemocracy student protests, Dr. Yang was added to an unofficial \nblacklist of expatriate Chinese dissidents. Upon his return to the \ncountry in 2002, Dr. Yang was detained and has been denied access to \nhis family, legal counsel and due process.\n  The resolution submitted today in the Senate coupled with H. Res. \n199, strongly calls for the release of Dr. Yang Jianli and condemns the \nPeople's Republic of China for ongoing deplorable human rights abuses. \nClearly, it is not in their interest to deny human rights to any United \nStates citizen or U.S. permanent resident alien.\n  Let this also be an additional chance to voice our regret and deep \nconcern for the continual abuse of the people in China. Dr. Yang Jianli \nunderstands this better than most. He has devoted his life to the cause \nof democracy and freedom for the people for China and has been, once \nagain, silenced.\n\n[[Page S8577]]\n\n  China must know and the world must know that denial of basic human \nrights will no longer be tolerated. Dr. Yang is just one of the many, \nwho suffer daily under the harsh rule of those who refuse to embrace \ndemocracy.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PAYMENT REDUCTIONS UNDER \n                   MEDICARE PHYSICIAN FEE SCHEDULE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the fees Medicare pays physicians were reduced by 5.4 \n     percent across-the-board in 2002;\n       (2) recent action by Congress narrowly averted another \n     across-the-board reduction of 4.4 percent for 2003;\n       (3) based on current projections, the Centers for Medicare \n     & Medicaid Services (CMS) estimates that, absent legislative \n     or administrative action, fees will be reduced across-the-\n     board once again in 2004 by 4.2 percent;\n       (4) the prospect of continued payment reductions under the \n     Medicare physician fee schedule for the foreseeable future \n     threatens to destabilize an important element of the program, \n     namely physician participation and willingness to accept \n     Medicare patients;\n       (5) the primary source of this instability is the \n     sustainable growth rate (SGR), a system of annual spending \n     targets for physicians' services under Medicare;\n       (6) the SGR system has a number of defects that result in \n     unrealistically low spending targets, such as the use of the \n     increase in the gross domestic product (GDP) as a proxy for \n     increases in the volume and intensity of services provided by \n     physicians, no tolerance for variance between growth in \n     Medicare beneficiary health care costs and our Nation's GDP, \n     and a requirement for immediate recoupment of the difference;\n       (7) both administrative and legislative action are needed \n     to return stability to the physician payment system;\n       (8) using the discretion given to it by Medicare law, CMS \n     has included expenditures for prescription drugs and \n     biologicals administered incident to physicians' services \n     under the annual spending targets without making appropriate \n     adjustments to the targets to reflect price increases in \n     these drugs and biologicals or the growing reliance on such \n     therapies in the treatment of Medicare patients;\n       (9) between 1996 and 2002, annual Medicare spending on \n     these drugs grew from $1,800,000,000 to $6,200,000,000, or \n     from $55 per beneficiary to an estimated $187 per \n     beneficiary;\n       (10) although physicians are responsible for prescribing \n     these drugs and biologicals, neither the price of the drugs \n     and biologicals, nor the standards of care that encourage \n     their use, are within the control of physicians; and\n       (11) SGR target adjustments have not been made for cost \n     increases due to new coverage decisions and new rules and \n     regulations.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) \n     should use its discretion to exclude drugs and biologicals \n     administered incident to physician services from the \n     sustainable growth rate (SGR) system;\n       (2) CMS should use its discretion to make SGR target \n     adjustments for new coverage decisions and new rules and \n     regulations; and\n       (3) in order to provide ample time for Congress to consider \n     more fundamental changes to the SGR system, the conferees on \n     the Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003 \n     should include in the conference agreement a provision to \n     establish a minimum percentage update in physician fees for \n     the next 2 years and should consider adding provisions that \n     would mitigate the swings in payment, such as establishing \n     multi-year adjustments to recoup the variance and creating \n     ``tolerance'' corridors for variations around the update \n     target trend.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1086.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 185 which was \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 185) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate with respect to raising awareness and encouraging \n     education about safety on the Internet.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of this resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Senate with respect to raising awareness \nand encouraging education about safety on the Internet and supporting \nthe goals and ideals of National Internet Safety Month.\n  The Internet has become one of the most significant advances in the \ntwentieth century and, as a result, it affects people's lives in a \npositive manner each day. However, this technology is fraught with \ndangers that need to be brought to the attention of all Americans.\n  Never before has the problem of online predatory behavior been more \nof a concern. Consider the pervasiveness of Internet access by children \nand the rapid increase in Internet crime and predatory behavior. Never \nbefore have powerful educational solutions--like Internet safety \ncurricula for grades kindergarten through 12, youth empowerment \nInternet safety campaigns and community-based Internet safety awareness \npresentations with the formation of community action teams, such as \nwhat I-Safe America, a non-profit Internet safety foundation, does--\nbeen more critical and readily at hand. It is imperative that every \ncommunity in every state be apprised of the increase in Internet-based \ncriminal activity so that all Americans may learn about the Internet \nsafety strategies which will enable them to keep their children safe \nfrom victimization. Consider the facts: Worldwide, 70 million youth \nunder the age of 18 are online. This is considered to be a conservative \nestimate since it is projected that there are two million new Internet \nusers per month in America alone. The Family/PC Survey in 2000 reported \nthat 1 in 4 kids participate in real-time online chats. The Pew Study \nreported in the Journal of the American Medical Association in June \n2001 that 13 million youth use Instant Messaging and that 89 percent of \nsexual solicitations were made in either chat rooms or Instant \nMessages. One in five teenagers who are online note that they have \nreceived unwanted sexual solicitations, according to the Crimes Against \nChildren Research Center in a study completed in 2000.\n  It's important to note that while it's reported that 90 percent of \nteens and young adults ages 15 to 24 go online and half of them go \nonline once a day or more, three out of four young people have access \nat home and nearly one in three has access from their own bedroom, \naccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation. According to a 1999 Arbitron \nNew Media study, the majority of teenagers' online use occurs at home, \nright after school, when working parents are not at home. Thirty \npercent of the girls responding to a 2002 Girl Scout Research Institute \nstudy, ``The Net Effect: Girls and New Media,'' said they had been \nsexually harassed in a chat room, but only seven percent told a parent \nabout the harassment, most fearing their parents would overreact and \nban computer usage altogether.\n  From a parental perspective, 75 percent of parents say that they know \nwhere their children spend time online. The truth about kids' Internet \nhabits, according to WebSense, USA Today, and the National Foster \nParent Association show that 58 percent of teens say they have accessed \nan objectionable website. A 2000 Time/CNN poll indicated that 43 \npercent of children say they do not have rules about Internet use in \ntheir homes. Also, 62 percent of parents of teenagers are unaware that \ntheir children have accessed objectionable websites, according to a \nYankelovich Partners Study. According to the London School of \nEconomics, 9 out of 10 children between the ages of 8 and 16 have \nviewed pornography on the Internet. In most cases, sex websites were \naccessed unintentionally when a child, often in the process of doing \nhomework, used a seemingly innocent sounding word to search for \ninformation or pictures.\n  Most disturbing, however, are the patterns of Internet crimes against \nchildren. In 1996, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was involved in \n113 cases involving Internet crimes against children. In 2001, the FBI \nopened 1,541 cases against people suspected of using the Internet to \ncommit crimes involving child pornography or abuse. The U.S. Customs \nService now places the number of websites offering child pornography at \nmore than 100,000. Moreover, there was a 345 percent increase in the \nproduction of these sites just between February 2001 and July 2001, \naccording to a recent study. The FBI notes that child pornography and \nthe sexual exploitation of children through online means is the most \nsignificant crime problem it confronts.\n  Now is the time for America to focus its attention on supporting \nInternet safety, especially now that children are now on summer \nvacation and will subsequently spend more time online. Recent Internet \ncrime trends indicate a call to action as it pertains to national \nInternet safety awareness at all levels.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to this \nmatter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 185) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 185\n\n       Whereas, in the United States, 48 million children between \n     the ages of 5 and 17 use computers;\n       Whereas 5 to 17 year-olds in the United States currently \n     spend 5 billion hours on-line annually;\n       Whereas 70 million youth under the age of 18 worldwide are \n     on-line;\n       Whereas the majority of teenagers' on-line use occurs after \n     school, at home, when working parents are not at home;\n       Whereas 90 percent of those age 15 to 24 use the Internet, \n     with almost half of them using it once a day or more;\n       Whereas approximately 3 out of 4 young people have access \n     to the Internet at home,\n\n[[Page S8600]]\n\n     and nearly 1 in 3 has access from their own bedroom;\n       Whereas 9 out of 10 children between ages 8 and 16 have \n     viewed pornography on the Internet, with most being accessed \n     unintentionally when, often in the process of doing homework, \n     a child used a seemingly innocent sounding word in an \n     Internet search for information or pictures;\n       Whereas 62 percent of parents of teenagers are unaware that \n     their children have accessed objectionable websites;\n       Whereas 89 percent of sexual solicitations were made in \n     either chat rooms or Instant Messages;\n       Whereas 30 percent of the girls responding to a Girl Scout \n     research study reported that they had been sexually harassed \n     in a chat room, but only 7 percent told a parent about the \n     harassment, most fearing their parents would overreact and \n     ban computer usage altogether;\n       Whereas, in 1996, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was \n     involved in 113 cases involving Internet crimes against \n     children, but in 2001, the FBI opened 1,541 cases against \n     suspects of Internet crimes involving child pornography or \n     abuse; and\n       Whereas June as National Internet Safety Month will provide \n     national awareness of the dangers of the Internet while \n     offering education about how to be safe, responsible, and \n     accountable on the Internet: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) National Internet Safety Month provides an opportunity \n     to educate the people of the United States on the dangers of \n     the Internet and the importance of being safe and responsible \n     on-line;\n       (2) national and community organizations should be \n     recognized and applauded for their work in promoting \n     awareness of the dangers of the Internet and for providing \n     information on developing the critical thinking and decision-\n     making skills to be safe on-line; and\n       (3) Internet safety organizations, law enforcement, \n     educators, and volunteers should increase their efforts to \n     raise the awareness of on-line safety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/25/senate-section/article/S8600-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION ADVANCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. TALENT.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Reverend Joseph Armstrong De Laine, one of the true \n     heroes of the civil rights struggle, led a crusade to break \n     down barriers in education in South Carolina;\n       (2) the efforts of Reverend De Laine led to the \n     desegregation of public schools in the United States, but \n     forever scarred his own life;\n       (3) in 1949, Joseph De Laine, a minister and principal, \n     organized African-American parents in Summerton, South \n     Carolina, to petition the school board for a bus for black \n     students, who had to walk up to 10 miles through corn and \n     cotton fields to attend a segregated school, while the white \n     children in the school district rode to and from school in \n     nice, clean buses;\n       (4) in 1950, these same parents sued to end public school \n     segregation in Briggs v. Elliott, 1 of 5 cases that \n     collectively led to the landmark 1954 Supreme Court decision \n     of Brown v. Board of Education;\n       (5) because of his participation in the desegregation \n     movement, Reverend De Laine was subjected to repeated acts of \n     domestic terror, in which--\n       (A) he, along with 2 sisters and a niece, lost their jobs;\n       (B) he fought off an angry mob;\n       (C) he received frequent death threats; and\n       (D) his church and his home were burned to the ground;\n       (6) in October 1955, after Reverend De Laine relocated to \n     Florence County in South Carolina, shots were fired at the De \n     Laine home, and because Reverend De Laine fired back to mark \n     the car, he was charged with assault and battery with intent \n     to kill;\n       (7) the shooting incident drove him from South Carolina to \n     Buffalo, New York, where he organized an African Methodist \n     Episcopal Church;\n       (8) believing that he would not be treated fairly by the \n     South Carolina judicial system if he returned to South \n     Carolina, Reverend De Laine told the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, ``I am not running from justice but \n     injustice'', and it was not until 2000 (26 years after his \n     death and 45 years after the incident) that Reverend De Laine \n     was cleared of all charges relating to the October 1955 \n     incident;\n       (9) Reverend De Laine was a humble and fearless man who \n     showed the Nation that all people, regardless of the color of \n     their skin, deserve a first-rate education, a lesson from \n     which the Nation has benefited immeasurably; and\n       (10) Reverend De Laine deserves rightful recognition for \n     the suffering that he and his family endured to teach the \n     Nation one of the great civil rights lessons of the last \n     century.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The President is authorized, \n     on behalf of Congress, to award a gold medal of appropriate \n     design to Joseph De Laine, Jr. to honor his father, Reverend \n     Joseph Armstrong De Laine (posthumously), for his \n     contributions to the Nation.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') \n     shall strike a gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and \n     inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 3.
