Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume debate \non S. 925, the State Department authorization bill. During yesterday's \nsession, we were able to dispose of a number of amendments to the \nmeasure, and we will continue working aggressively through amendments \nthis morning.\n  I encourage any Member who does have an amendment to the bill to \ncontact the chairman or the ranking member as soon as possible so we \ncan organize an orderly schedule for the consideration of the \namendments. I do ask my colleagues that they bring forward amendments \nthat are relevant to the underlying legislation. Unfortunately, over \nthe course of yesterday afternoon and yesterday evening, a number of \nnonrelevant issues were mentioned and talked about as possible \namendments. It is important that we complete action on this very \nimportant bill--really these three very important bills together--after \nwhich we will go to the appropriations process.\n  In order to accomplish that, we need to focus on the bill itself. I \nask and make that plea to my colleagues that we stay, through an \norderly process, on the bill with relevant amendments.\n  I am aware of every Senator's right to amend and to bring anything to \nthe floor they would like but out of consideration for an orderly, \nthoughtful schedule that allows us to continue with the authorization \nprocess underway and then proceed to the very important appropriations \nprocess, we do need people to be as cooperative as possible with the \nchairman and ranking member.\n  We will have rollcall votes throughout the day. Senators will be \nnotified when that first vote is scheduled. It is expected that we will \nconsider and complete action, as I mentioned earlier, on appropriations \nbills this week. We will initially go to, after completion of the bill \nthat is on the floor, the legislative branch appropriations to be \nfollowed by the military construction appropriations bill.\n  As I said clearly earlier in the week, we will be voting on Friday. \nSo I do want our colleagues to expect rollcall votes tomorrow. \nDepending on how things go over the course of the morning and the \nafternoon and this evening, we will have a much better idea as to \nwhether we will be voting late in the day on Friday or earlier in the \nday.\n  Again, I have tried to make it very clear through an orderly process \nthat we can get through the schedule that is set out, which includes \nthese appropriations bills.\n  There is a lot of work to do this week, and Members should prepare \nfor a busy session today and tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/10/senate-section/article/S9161-6", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, while the majority leader is on the floor, I \nhave something that is not directly on point but I wish to say for the \nentire Senate. I congratulate the majority leader and the Democratic \nleader. It is so rare that we, as a Senate, are able to get together at \na social event. Last night, we were able to have an event where we went \nto an exhibit at the National Gallery of Art to see paintings by a \ngreat western artist, Remington.\n  I applaud and congratulate the two leaders for bringing this together \nbecause so much of what we do is adversarial in nature. It was a \ntremendous evening last night to be able to have our spouses and to sit \ndown to dinner and listen to some short, but good, speeches and look at \ngreat exhibits that were painted almost 100 years ago by this great \nartist.\n  I speak for the whole Senate and extend my congratulations to the two \nleaders for arranging that event last night.\n\n\n                    Foreign Relations Authorization\n\n  Mr. President, through you to the majority leader, we have an \namendment about which I have talked with the two managers of the bill \nthat is going to be offered this morning dealing with Mexico. We will \ndo that as\n\n[[Page S9162]]\n\nsoon as there are amendments cleared. We have an amendment by Senator \nMurray. We have already hotlined our Members as to what amendments they \nhave.\n  As I indicated, either I or the Democratic leader will be in touch \nwith the majority leader this morning to go over generally the list of \nthese amendments so he has an idea of what we have at this time. That \ncertainly would not prevent people offering them at a later time. But I \nthink we have a pretty good list of all the amendments that are going \nto be offered. At that time, the majority leader can make a decision as \nto how we proceed.\n\n  We believe this is an important bill, and we think it should be \ncompleted. We think it should be completed as soon as possible, and as \nthe leader indicated, every Senator has a right to offer amendments on \nany subject they want, and a few of them are going to do that. We hope \nthat will be kept to a minimum so we can move to the amendments that \nare germane and relevant to this matter, not because it is required by \nSenate rules but because we want to try to move this bill along.\n  I have a couple of housekeeping issues. We have a briefing at 4 \no'clock today by Secretary Rumsfeld. I am sure a lot of the Senators \nneed to go to it, including the two managers of this bill. I ask that \nthe leader consider, as the day progresses, maybe putting us in recess \nduring that period of time--whatever decision you make in that regard.\n  We have spoken at length with the two managers. They have a pretty \ngood idea of where we are coming from on this side.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we will have to make some big decisions \nthis morning in terms of planning for the day, and we will be in touch, \nboth on the floor and off the floor, out of respect for completion of \nthis bill as soon as possible. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was just told Secretary Rumsfeld's meeting \nhas been rescheduled for a later time. It is not going to be this \nafternoon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/10/senate-section/article/S9162-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, before starting the bill, I will take 2 \nminutes on leader time to comment on an issue that is important to me \npersonally but that I think is important to our concerns for people \naround the world, and that is the President's trip right now to Africa.\n  On Tuesday of this week, on Goree Island, President Bush spoke about \nthe extraordinary contributions of Africa's sons and daughters to \nAmerica's culture and ideals. The moral vision of such leaders as \nFrederick Douglas--many of us have had the opportunity to visit his \nwonderful home that sits on a hill in Washington just a few miles from \nwhere we stand now--Booker T. Washington, W.E.B. DuBois, Sojourner \nTruth, Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, and the list goes on, have \npenetrated deep into America's consciousness and illuminated America's \ncore principles. Africans who were brought to America in chains, and \ntheir descendants who subsequently suffered cruelty and injustice, \nhelped set America free. It is a story that must be told and be told to \nfuture generations so that we will always work toward realizing our \nNation's great purpose--in a word: Freedom.\n  America and Africa are working together to expand freedom across the \nglobe. The President is celebrating much of that in his current trip. \nIn late August, I will be taking a delegation of Senators back to \nAfrica once again.\n  On the Senate floor today, and yesterday, is very important and \nsignificant legislation, the Millennium Challenge Account, which \npromises to invest in the continent's abundant political and economic \nopportunities. We all celebrate the $15 billion commitment in global \nHIV/AIDS relief by the President, which the Senate confirmed under the \nleadership of Chairman Lugar last month. We know that will help turn \nthe tide against HIV/AIDS and, I should add, malaria and tuberculosis.\n  The African Growth and Opportunity Act, which we addressed 3 years \nago now, is alleviating poverty in Africa. Those of us who travel \nregularly hear again and again that it is having an impact that \nstimulates and spurs on that African entrepreneurship.\n  So I take this moment to commend President Bush for his bold and \nsubstantive leadership in helping Africa's leaders meet their nation's \nchallenges and to realize the nation's opportunities, and also to \nrecognize the leadership of Chairman Lugar on each of these other \nissues that I mentioned: The Millennium Challenge Account, the global \nfight against HIV/AIDS, the African Growth and Opportunity Act. These \nefforts, and many others--bipartisan, both sides of the aisle--will \nhelp set Africa on a course to maximum freedom and opportunity for all \nof its people and strengthen those historic ties that bind our two \ngreat lands.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/10/senate-section/article/S9162-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         FOREIGN RELATIONS AUTHORIZATION ACT, FISCAL YEAR 2004\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, along with Senator Mikulski, I offer the \nfollowing sense of the Senate amendment with respect to condemning \nviolence against women. It states that the United States should \ncontinue to:\n\n     condemn violence against women and should urge states to \n     refrain from invoking any custom, tradition or practice in \n     the name of religion or culture as a means to avoid \n     obligations regarding the elimination of violence against \n     women referred to in Article IV of the Declaration on the \n     Elimination of Violence against Women.\n\n  In this year's session of the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women, \nthe United States sided with Iran, Pakistan and Sudan in opposing the \nabove language in the final report of the Commission's session.\n  We ought to wonder why. The language was important, critical to \nsupport, on its merits and furthermore, it was hardly groundbreaking.\n  The United States supported it in the 1993 U.N. Declaration on the \nElimination of Violence Against Women and in the 1995 Beijing Platform \nof Action.\n  This year, the U.S. delegate justified the position of not supporting \nthe language on customs and religious practices by claiming that the \nUnited States was seeking consensus in the commission, because some \nother nations perceived the language as casting religion in a negative \nlight.\n  This is absurd. Violence against women is an outrage. It happens \nevery day, in America and around the world. It is never justified, and \nthe United States should never miss an opportunity, here and abroad, to \ncondemn it.\n  Therefore, I have offered this amendment to reiterate the need for \nthe United States to continue to take a stand in condemning violence \nagainst women in all forms, and under all circumstances.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1154\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to support Senator Feinstein's \namendment to the Fiscal Year 2004 State Department Authorization bill \nthat would require the State Department to submit an annual report on \nnations that are not cooperating with programs concerning small arms \nand light weapons.\n  The U.N. estimates that there are more than 500 million small arms \nand light weapons in the world and about half of these are illicit. Of \nthe 49 major conflicts fought during the 1990s, small arms were used in \n47 of them, causing four million deaths. Ninety percent of the deaths \nwere civilians and eighty percent of those were women and children. The \ndeath and destruction caused by small arms and light weapons has led \nU.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to characterize them as a ``global \nscourge.''\n  In July 2001 a United Nation's conference took place on the illicit \ntrade in small arms and light weapons. The conference adopted a program \nof action to eliminate these weapons. The first review of the program \nof action is taking place this week in New York.\n  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs \nLincoln Bloomfield echoed Secretary-General Annan's comments in his \naddress to the conference. Mr. Bloomfield told the delegates that, \n``the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons poses a serious \nthreat to stability and security in this hemisphere as well as parts of \nAfrica, South Asia, the Middle East, and elsewhere.'' Mr. Bloomfield \ncalled on all nations to ``work even more energetically to curb the \nillicit trade in small arms and light weapons.''\n  The United States has made a substantial contribution to this effort. \nOver the past two years, some five million dollars have been spent on \ndestruction assistance programs. U.S.-supported programs in 10 \ncountries have led to the destruction of over 400,000 excess or illegal \nweapons and 44 millions rounds of ammunition.\n  The size of the problem means there is much work left to be done. \nPresident Bush in a speech last month outlining his agenda for his trip \nto Africa said that his ``first great goal in our partnership with \nAfrica is to help establish peace and security across the continent.'' \nHe underscored, ``Many thousands of African men and women and children \nare killed every year in regional wars.'' Africa has suffered terribly \nfrom the scourge of small arms. I urge the President to make the \ncontrol of small arms and light weapons an even greater priority, and I \nhope the administration will continue to emphasize the importance of \ncontrolling and eliminating small arms and seek additional funding when \nit is needed.\n  Senator Feinstein's amendment will assist the United States in its \nefforts to encourage other countries to participate in programs to \ncontrol these weapons. An annual report on illicit small arms will \nallow the government to better track countries that are not yet \ncooperating. It will also allow Congress to be better informed about \nthe State Department's efforts to gain cooperation of those countries.\n  I thank the Senator for her efforts. We should do as much as possible \nto address the scourge of small arms that is taking the lives of so \nmany innocent people throughout the world.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1155\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to support Senator Biden's \namendment to the Fiscal Year 2004 State Department Authorization bill \nconcerning sharing information about the export of small arms with the \nState Department office responsible for the collection and destruction \nof small arms.\n  In July 2001 a United Nation's conference took place on the illicit \ntrade in small arms and light weapons. The conference adopted a program \nof action to eliminate these weapons. After two years, the first \nmeeting to review progress on this program of action convened this week \nin New York. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in a message sent to the \nconference said, ``It is difficult to overstate the importance of \nimplementation of the program of action.'' He noted, ``After all, small \narms and light weapons cause mass destruction. They kill about 60 \npeople an hour or half a million people a year, 90 percent of them \nwomen and children.''\n  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs \nLincoln Bloomfield described to participants the significant \ncontribution the United States has made in the area of destruction \nassistance programs. Commendably, since early 2001, U.S.-supported \nprograms in 10 countries have led to the destruction of over 400,000 \nexcess or illegal weapons and 44 million rounds of ammunition.\n  Senator Biden's amendment will add needed rationality to U.S. policy \nin this area. If the United States permits the export of small arms or \nlight weapons, the office within the State Department responsible for \nthe collection and destruction of these arms should be informed. \nOtherwise we may unknowingly pay states to destroy small arms at the \nsame time that we are giving them more weapons.\n  I thank the Senator from Delaware for this amendment. It is important \nthat the right hand of the government knows what the left hand is \ndoing. The U.N. estimates that there are more than 500 million small \narms and light weapons in the world and around half of these are \nillicit. We have far to go in our global effort to control and \neliminate these illicit arms. Every step we can take to achieve this \ngoal should be pursued.\n\n[[Page S9166]]\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to update the Senate on where we \nstand on the State Department authorization bill. We were successful in \nworking through many issues yesterday. In fact, we came to a conclusion \non three of the most difficult issues that we expected in the bill, the \nstructure of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, support for Iranian \ndemocracy, and the Mexico City policy. This morning, by action of the \nSenate, we have cleared and passed 14 amendments. We have passed about \n20 amendments in less than 24 hours. In addition, 15 to 20 amendments \nthat were mentioned as possibilities will either not be offered or will \nbe worked out. This leaves a declining list of foreign policy \namendments that we believe we can resolve today.\n  I want to encourage Members to come to the floor to offer their \nrelevant amendments. We are in range of finishing the bill. I thank \nSenator Biden again for all he has done to advance the Senate's foreign \npolicy agenda. I likewise thank the majority and minority leaders, and \nSenator Reid especially for his cooperation.\n  Yesterday, it was announced that State Department authorization bills \nhave traditionally taken much longer than 2 days. While that may be \ntrue, it does not have to be the case this time. The two bills that \ncomprise most of the substitute amendment were passed out of the \nForeign Relations Committee by a vote of 19 to 0. Republicans and \nDemocrats have worked together closely on these issues. While we have \nsome differences, the members of our committee are united in our belief \nthat the substitute before us will enhance U.S. national security and \nis vital to our national interests.\n  The Senate's record this year in moving foreign policy items has been \nexcellent. We have passed a global AIDS bill, the Moscow Treaty, NATO \nexpansion, and other items. The Senate has moved decisively on the \nNation's foreign policy business because we recognize as a body that in \nthese perilous times it was our duty to do so. America's national \nsecurity is at risk and its leaders, entrusted with passing legislation \nto keep America secure, must continue to do our duty.\n\n  Today Senators have an opportunity, as always, to be senatorial. I am \nhopeful that all Senators with an amendment will come to the floor and \nhelp us pass this bill quickly and provide our diplomats the tools they \nneed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The deputy leader.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1164 to Amendment No. 1136\n\n  Mr. REID. I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of Senator Reid \nof Nevada and Senator Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself and Mr. \n     Daschle, proposes an amendment numbered 1164.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide support regarding the rural development crisis in \n                                Mexico)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title XXI, add the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC. 2113. SUPPORT REGARDING RURAL DEVELOPMENT CRISIS IN \n                   MEXICO.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should continue working closely with \n     the Government of Mexico to help minimize the impact of the \n     current rural development crisis in Mexico; and\n       (2) that crisis creates a humanitarian, economic, and \n     security imperative for the United States Government to \n     support additional programs focused on the underfunded rural \n     communities of Mexico.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to the President for fiscal year 2004, \n     $100,000,000 for programs in Mexico that promote the \n     following:\n       (1) Micro credit lending.\n       (2) Small business and entrepreneurial development.\n       (3) Small farms and farmers that have been impacted by the \n     collapse of coffee prices.\n       (4) Strengthening the system of private property ownership \n     in the rural communities.\n\n  Mr. REID. The amendment offered on my behalf and that of the \nDemocratic leader concerns a country, regrettably, that does not get a \nlot of attention in the Senate. In recent months--and rightfully so--we \nhave focused intently on Iraq, Afghanistan, North Korea, Iran, \nColombia, Pakistan, and many other countries scattered around the \nglobe. Our close neighbor and critical friend to the south, Mexico, too \noften receives little, if any, attention.\n  In some respects, the lack of attention may be a good thing. Last \nSunday, for example, Mexico held midterm elections that resulted in \nPresident Fox's party losing 40 seats in the Mexican Congress in an \nelection that was uniformly recognized as free and fair. It was not too \nlong ago that elections in Mexico would have been front-page news in \nthe United States, and the news would have not been good. In all \nlikelihood, the reports would have told of rigged elections and another \npower grab by the long-ruling PRI.\n  So the lack of attention to our friend Mexico is in one sense good \nnews, but in a much larger sense it is a serious problem. The \nlegislation we consider today will authorize billions of dollars for \ncountries, regions, and programs around the world. But we will do very \nlittle for the country with whom we share a 2,000-mile border--Mexico.\n  That is a disappointment, especially in light of that hopeful South \nLawn ceremony with President Fox less than 2 years ago with our \nPresident. This amendment makes one simple thing very clear: what \nhappens in Mexico is in the national security interests of our country. \nWe should be doing more to help Mexicans who are working hard to help \nthemselves. I believe President Bush summed it up very well last year \nwhen he said: ``The United States has no more important relationship in \nthe world than the one we have with Mexico. Good neighbors work \ntogether and benefit from each other's successes.'' I agree with our \nPresident. It is a special relationship with great economic importance \nto both nations. But I am disappointed that the President has not \nbacked up his words with action.\n  Mexico is now the second largest trading partner we have. It is among \nthe top 10 export markets for 43 of our States. It is the ninth largest \neconomy in the world. But this special relationship we share with \nMexico is in desperate need of repair. As we have turned our attention \naway from Mexico in recent years, economic troubles within the country \nhave grown increasingly serious.\n  A few years ago, Mexico seemed on the verge of an economic \nbreakthrough. Today, however, Mexico's growth rate is half of what it \nwas in the mid-1990s. This has hurt both their nation and our Nation. \nMexico has a poverty rate of almost 40 percent. There are a little over \n100 million people in Mexico. That means almost 40 million Mexicans \nlive in poverty. Fifty-three percent of all Mexicans--more than 50 \nmillion people--have an annual income of less than $1,400. Twenty-three \npercent of all Mexicans have an annual income of less than $720. That \nis less than $2 a day. Income distribution within the country remains \nespecially unequal, and unemployment and underemployment continue to \nhamper our southern neighbor.\n  The problems are especially acute in rural areas of Mexico, which \nhave been chronically underdeveloped and underfunded. Rural poverty \nremains one of the most persistent and serious economic problems facing \nMexico. This rural economic crisis threatens the health and well-being \nof people in Mexico and puts our own economy and security in jeopardy.\n\n  Take, for example, coffee growing. Coffee growers in Mexico thrived \njust a short time ago. They became an indispensable component of \nMexico's rural economy. But they have seen the price of their crop drop \nby 70 percent in just 5 years. These failing commodity prices have led \nmany of these farmers to seek another crop to feed their families. What \nis that crop? Opium poppies, which are used to make heroin that \nultimately makes its way into our country.\n  I understand that when people have no money, when their families are \nhungry, and when their livelihood is vanishing before their eyes--think \nof\n\n[[Page S9167]]\n\nMexico's coffee growers--they look for other ways to survive. Some grow \npoppies, but others take unbelievable risks to come to America.\n  Now, I am opposed to illegal immigration. I think everyone should \ncomply with the law. But it has to tear at your heartstrings to see \npeople who are so desperate that they risk their lives to come across \nthe Rio Grande River. They freeze to death in the mountain passes; they \ndie in the deserts of Arizona, New Mexico, and California trying to \ncome to America. They pay what little money they have to demons who \ntell these people, ``We have a way for you to get to America.'' They \ncram innocent Mexicans in boxcars and trucks, and subject them to \ninhumane conditions. This is an all-to-familiar scene that takes the \nlives of too many innocent human beings.\n  So while I am opposed to illegal immigration, I understand why \ndesperate people do everything in their power to try to come to \nAmerica. They risk their lives to cross our border illegally. This \nplaces additional strains on our border security officers, who are \nalready overextended. Those who manage to sneak past the Border Patrol \nand survive the desert and the mountain passes arrive here with few, if \nany, job skills, so they take any job they can find. They compete for \njobs with those who are here legally and tax our social services.\n  Clearly, this crisis in rural Mexico is not only the business of \nMexico; it is our business, too. Should we be concerned about what has \ngone on in Iraq? Of course we should. Should we be concerned about what \nis going on in Afghanistan? Of course we should. Should we be concerned \nabout what is going on in Pakistan today? Bangladesh? India? Of course \nwe should. Should the President of the United States be in Africa \ntoday? Of course he should.\n\n  I traveled to Africa last August. It is an eye opener. As the world's \nonly superpower, we have tremendous obligations. The President is going \nto commit this Congress to new obligations as he makes his trip around \nAfrica. We have an obligation to do our best to live up to the \ncommitments our President makes as he travels throughout the world.\n  I do not in any way denigrate what we have done and what we are doing \naround the rest of the world. I am criticizing what we have failed to \ndo. We have ignored Mexico, and that is wrong. We must remember that \nwhat goes on in Mexico concerns our Nation, because in today's world, \nproblems like drugs and poverty do not grind to a halt at our borders. \nThe Rio Grande River is not sufficient to stop the flow of illegal \ndrugs into our country. The Rio Grande River is not sufficient to stop \nthe poverty that comes across our borders in the form of illegal \nimmigration that taxes our social services, our law enforcement \nofficers and our educational system.\n  But we also share many positive things with Mexico. We have a shared \nhistory, a shared culture, even a shared language--I have three sons \nwho speak fluent Spanish. Mexican Americans have helped shape our great \nNation. Twenty million people of Mexican ancestry live in the United \nStates today, an increase of 53 percent from ten years ago.\n  Mr. President, if you still doubt that we have a shared culture with \nMexico, look at Nevada. What does the word ``Nevada'' mean? In Spanish \nit means ``snowcapped.'' ``Las Vegas,'' what does that mean? In Spanish \nit means ``the meadows.''\n  In the State of Nevada, which is the fastest growing State in our \nNation, Mexican Americans now account for more than 15 percent of the \npopulation. That is a 300 percent increase since the early 1990s. \nOverall, we have seen a 53 percent increase in our country's Mexican \nAmerican population, but in Nevada it has been 300 percent. That \ndoesn't take into consideration the approximately 5 percent of the \npopulation in our state who came from Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras, \nand other places in Central and South America. So as you can see, Mr. \nPresident, the connections between our two nations are real.\n  But I want to do more than talk about this relationship. Actions \nspeak louder than words. It is time this Congress acted. I want to \nfollow through on President Bush's promise to work, and work together \nwith Mexico. I want to address the very real crisis affecting Mexico's \nrural communities.\n  Some of my colleagues have said: Your amendment has some merit, but \nwon't it cost too much money? Well, this legislation we are dealing \nwith here in the Senate today is worth billions of dollars. I think our \nneighbor to the south deserves part of that largesse.\n  In recent years we have helped many countries around the world in \ntheir hour of need, whether through economic or military assistance. \nThe American people have responded time and time again to crises in far \ncorners of the world. Surely we can answer the call to help our largest \ntrading partner and close ally. I don't think we have a choice. That is \nwhy I am proposing this plan to help Mexico lift herself up.\n  This amendment will not drop money on Mexico's doorstep and hope it \ngets spent wisely. No, we are not doing that. Any expert who is \nfamiliar with what is going on in Mexico will tell you one thing--that \nthe way to stop illegal immigration from that country is to give \nMexicans an opportunity to succeed in their own economy. That is what \nthis amendment is all about. And so we are proposing a plan to help \nMexico lift herself up by providing the resources for a program to \nspark redevelopment in rural areas. This amendment would authorize $100 \nmillion for microcredit lending, small business entrepreneurial \ndevelopment, aid to small farmers who have been affected by the \ncollapse of prices, and support for Mexico's private property ownership \nsystem, which is in bad need of repair.\n\n  President Fox is confronted with problems all over Mexico, but none \nare more difficult than those of rural Mexico. Commodity prices have \nfallen through the floor--not only coffee, but others, as well. \nMexico's young people are fleeing its historic farming areas for Mexico \nCity.\n  Mexico City is the largest city in the world, with 21 million people \nat last count. It is also the most polluted city in the world. I went \nthere and met with State Department officials. Our State Department \nofficials receive hazard pay for living in Mexico City, but not because \nanybody is shooting at them. They receive it because the city's air is \nso detrimental to their health. And each day, more desperate people \ncome to this overcrowded, polluted city from rural Mexico. The country \nis trading its rural future for increased unemployment in Mexico City. \nThat is a bad switch.\n  Let me talk briefly about each of the provisions of this amendment. \nFirst, microcredit lending programs have been enormously successful \nthroughout the world. The goals of these programs are to provide small \nloans to nontraditional sectors of the economy that would ordinarily \nnot be supported by the main financial institutions of the country. \nFlexible repayment procedures and low interest rates are hallmarks of \nmicrocredit enterprises.\n  Our distinguished chairman of this committee has had such a \nsignificant impact on the world as a result of his involvement in this \ncommittee on which he serves, the Foreign Relations Committee. There \nare programs that have his name attached to them. The first one that \ncomes to almost everyone's mind, of course, is Nunn-Lugar, which was a \nprogram that was introduced by two great statesmen--Nunn from Georgia, \nLugar from Indiana--to work on a problem in the former Soviet Union \nthat seemed to be unsolvable. Nunn-Lugar made tremendous strides in the \ndirection of solving the problems we had with nuclear programs in the \nformer Soviet Union.\n  So I say to my distinguished Chair of this committee, I know the \nSenator from Indiana understands and has seen examples of how a few \ndollars, with our microlending programs in other countries, have been \nmagnified and have helped individuals and regions and entire countries.\n  That is what we are trying to do here.\n  The evidence of microcredit lending clearly suggests that a small \namount of money can have a huge impact on an economy by helping \nsignificantly in villages and rural communities and with small \nbusinesses. These programs ought to be rolled out to rural parts of \nMexico, as they have been in other parts of the world where the need \nfor such innovative lending was clear. My amendment would start this \nprocess.\n  Second, there is a lot of business activity just above the \nmicroenterprise\n\n[[Page S9168]]\n\nlevel which large banks and financial institutions simply won't support \nbecause of lack of collateral or creditworthiness. These are typically \nsmall businesses and entrepreneurs who are trying to get started and \nwho many times do not even have money for further training. This \namendment supports efforts to boost programs directed at small \nbusinesses and entrepreneurial development, which is critical for \nmaintaining a diversified and balanced rural economy. When small \nbusinesses and entrepreneurs leave the rural communities for larger \nMexican cities or even the United States, that spells the beginning of \nthe end for parts of rural Mexico.\n  The third part of this amendment would implement programs to help the \nMexican farmers who have been hurt by the falling prices of coffee and \nother commodities. On average, Mexican coffee farmers are being paid 70 \npercent less than they were just 5 years ago. As a result, these once \nthriving farmers and farmhands are seeking work in larger cities.\n  But when they come to these larger cities, they do not check into an \napartment with air-conditioning or inside toilets. They cannot stop at \nthe 7-Eleven and buy something for dinner. They live in shantytowns--\nhomes made of cardboard. We all have seen shantytowns. It is \ndisgraceful that people have to live that way. But many of the 21 \nmillion people living in Mexico City live in shantytowns. Agencies \nshould be helping rural farmers to keep cultivating their usual crops, \nso they don't turn to illegal crop production or become desperate and \nabandon rural Mexico entirely.\n  Finally, the fourth component of this amendment--and I believe it is \nan important part--is to support private property ownership in rural \ncommunities, and to do it through increased mortgage financing.\n  If you want to sell your home in this country, it is very simple. If \nsomeone wants to buy it, they go to a title company. They go to \nsomebody who has abstract deeds, and they run that through the legal \nprocess to find out if you really own that home, and if you do, whether \nthere are any liens against your property in the way of debt which you \nhaven't paid. By the time that person sells that home, the person who \nbuys it knows everything about that real estate he wants to buy from \nyou. You can't do that in most places in Mexico. They have no legal \nsystem to do that.\n  If you live in rural Mexico and you own a home, you live in that home \nfor the rest of your life. You can't borrow money to fix it up. It is \nworth nothing because you can't sell it. It is, in effect, debt capital \nin more ways than one.\n  Sound and secure property rights are a fundamental part of any market \neconomy. But the framework of property rights in Mexico is in a state \nof disrepair. The lack of security in property transactions has \nresulted in a substantial decrease in the availability of credit.\n  For example, mortgage financing funds only about 40 percent of new \nhouseholds in Mexico. Why? No one will lend money to people who do not \nown homes or have liens against a home. Families do not have equity in \ntheir homes, and the homes can't easily be sold unless cash is paid \nupfront. The impact of all this is particularly severe in rural \ncommunities, where the only alternative to living in the same \ndilapidated home for the rest of your life is to flee to a big city. \nThe United States should act expeditiously in this area to help Mexico \nget its property rights back on track. We can do that today by passing \nthis amendment.\n\n  So to summarize, Mr. President, the four components of this amendment \nare microcredit lending, small business and entrepreneurial \ndevelopment, assisting small farms, and supporting an enhanced system \nof private property ownership.\n  As I indicated earlier, some of my colleagues have already said this \nwill cost too much money. I agree that it will cost a lot of money, \neven by Washington standards. But I also recognize that Mexico is in a \ndire crisis. Mexico is our friend, and it is in our interest to help \nMexico. By doing this, we will help Americans as well as Mexicans.\n  I recognize that immigration and drug trafficking from Mexico present \na real problem for the United States. I have talked about that. \nEspecially for States, such as Nevada, that are on the front line of \nthis battle, it is a very difficult problem.\n  I don't think this is a typical aid package. As I mentioned earlier, \nit is no handout. It is a commitment to free-market-based programs that \nwill spur long-term development and growth in rural areas of Mexico. It \nis not only the right thing to do, but it also will have a positive \nimpact on the United States by reducing the strain upon our society \ncaused by illegal immigration and the deadly flow of drugs. \nFurthermore, a stronger and more economically sound Mexico will be a \nbetter trading partner for the United States. The better off Mexico is \neconomically, the better off we are, because we will have a greater \nopportunity to sell them products we develop here.\n  I have always supported aid to Mexico. Others have objected to it and \nsaid it is not necessary, but I have always supported it. It was \nnecessary then, and it is necessary now. It is in our humanitarian \ninterests, our economic interests and our security interests. That is \nwhy I say we have to make these investments in Mexico today. If we can \nafford to help so many other countries in the world, we ought to be \nable to help our friend with whom we share so much and with whom we \nshare a 2,000-mile border.\n  As President George W. Bush said:\n\n       We have no more important relationship in the world than \n     the one we have with Mexico.\n\n  This amendment will prove whether the United States will do more than \njust talk about our relationship with Mexico. As I said earlier, are we \ngoing to talk, or are we going to act? Actions speak louder than words.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. This is so important \nfor our country and for the country of Mexico.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator for his \nanalysis of Mexico. Certainly we ought to underline the importance of \nthe relationship. I believe it is deeply felt by most Americans who are \ninterested in our neighbors to the south and to the north.\n  Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, we have been trading a \ngreat deal more, much to the benefit of both of our countries. There is \nincreased wealth in Mexico; likewise, its distribution and whether it \nis getting to the rural people the Senator from Nevada has discussed.\n  I would say, first, in perspective, in the fiscal year 2003 budget of \nthe United States, about $43 million was allocated in foreign \nassistance to Mexico. The President has requested that for fiscal year \n2004--the one we are now discussing--that be increased now to a total \nof $67.5 million. So the United States, in its foreign assistance, \nrecognizes a number of ways in which our country can work with the \npeople of Mexico for the betterment of people on both sides.\n  But let me say generally about all of this that the analysis that the \nSenator has given would be important as testimony in our committee \nprocess, as dialog with our Department of State, to try to think \nthrough the priorities of how U.S. assistance to Mexico should best be \nspent.\n  The Senator has offered some excellent items in terms of microloans, \nrural development prospects. There are numerous areas in Mexico that \nrequire our retention and our cooperation. I would say, once again very \ngenerally, committing $100 million to any country in addition to that \nwhich we are now expending is a matter of no small moment. It is worthy \nof the attention of the committee and the proper procedures of \nconsultation with our diplomats and with those in the State Department \nwho have responsibility for that country and that portfolio.\n  Furthermore, we face an important point as Senators in looking at \nthis amendment. As I commenced the debate on the State Department \nauthorization bill and foreign assistance authorization bill, we \npointed out we have been careful to observe the budget agreement, the \nbudget we all came to in the Senate. Clearly, the $100 million that \nwould be authorized by this amendment is not a part of that budget. It \nwas not requested by the President. It clearly would be money that\n\n[[Page S9169]]\n\nwould have to be subtracted from other programs for other countries or \nfrom American diplomacy generally. In essence, it is not money that can \nbe added on at this particular juncture.\n  There was a point in which we were having the budget debate in which \nSenators could have indicated more money for foreign assistance, more \nmoney for the State Department or American diplomacy. As I have \nreviewed the bidding from that procedure, I pointed out and commended \nall of the Senators who worked with me to restore in the budget $1.15 \nbillion that the President asked for to begin with. So at least we \nbegan the procedure with the moneys the President requested.\n  The $100 million committed to authorization in this amendment is \nclearly not a part of that process. Therefore, I am going to oppose the \namendment on the basis that I think the worthy objectives of the \namendment require discussion through the committee system and in \nconsultation with the State Department and with the administration.\n  Secondly, I think there is a budget problem Senators have to look at \nsquarely. I appreciate in the past it may have been the habit of the \nSenate, during these authorization processes, to simply authorize money \nwith the hopes that somehow or other appropriators, at the next stage, \nwould either find the money, subtract it from somebody else's program, \nor generally ignore the request.\n  Authorization, as we know, is not appropriations, not expenditures; \ntherefore, sometimes Senators, from time to time, have offered an \nauthorization with the hope that somehow in the process the money might \nbe forthcoming or a portion of it. I understand that.\n  But I would say, in view of the fact that our country is committing \nin this budget process $67.5 million to Mexico, we are already taking \nnote of obligations and opportunities that we have. The authorization \nof an additional $100 million in the Reid amendment, without the \ncommittee process, and in negotiation with the State Department, in my \njudgment, is inadvisable. Therefore, I oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished Senator from \nNevada in a short colloquy.\n  May I ask the Senator if he is prepared to proceed to a vote on his \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. I am. I would like 5 minutes more in which to speak.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Boxer be added as \na cosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me just say that I have already stated \nin my remarks the great admiration I have for the distinguished chair \nof this committee. He is a good man, a good Senator, but I certainly \ndisagree with the statements he made that this matter was not brought \nbefore the committee in the form of an amendment. I have not been here \nas long as the Senator from Indiana but I have been here quite a while, \nand I understand that not all Senators have the opportunity, if they do \nnot serve on a committee, to offer amendments.\n  I know Senator Biden and Senator Lugar do the best they can to bring \na bill they think is responsible before the Senate. But had I been on \nthe committee--which I am not--I would have offered an amendment such \nas this. I do not think there is a higher priority we have, not only \nfrom our security interests but from the simple merit of any proposal, \nthan this one right here. I think it is very important that we \nrecognize Mexico.\n  I am now one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee, \nand I do not quite understand why we are being so frugal with Mexico. \nWe are not so frugal with other countries. I think Mexico deserves \nthis. I ask Members of the Senate to understand there is no budget \npoint of order against what I am doing. If this were an appropriations \nbill or had some budget implications other than that, that might be the \ncase, but Senators can vote for this amendment. If the appropriators \ncan't find enough money, then fine, that is the appropriators' problem.\n  This body has a leading role to play in foreign affairs. We cannot be \ndictated to by the administration. President George Bush is President \nGeorge Bush; he is not King George Bush. We have three separate but \nequal branches of Government: the judicial, the legislative, and the \nexecutive; and we are equal. I have a different philosophy than the \nPresident about what we should do for Mexico. He believes we should \ntalk about it and not do a great deal about it. I believe actions speak \nlouder than words. Now, maybe I am wrong but that is how I feel, and I \nhave a right to feel that way.\n  I am 1 of 100 Senators. If the Senators want to walk in here and say \nthumbs down to Mexico, I think it is too bad for this Senate but they \nare going to have an opportunity to vote to help our neighbor.\n  Congress has a leading role to play in foreign affairs. We cannot \ndefer to what the State Department wants to do. The State Department, \ndirected by this administration, has not done a good job in taking care \nof Mexico. It has been all talk. There are some who have written, since \nthe elections in Mexico a few days ago, that the reason President Fox \ntook a drubbing in the elections is because the United States has not \ndone anything to help Mexico.\n  Maybe, when this bill goes to conference, there should be some \nrearranging. If this amendment is adopted, maybe the people who serve \non these committees in the House and the Senate will have to do some \nrearranging of priorities but that is what we do in conference all the \ntime.\n  I think anything we can do to help the Mexican people is a direct \nhelp for us. Anything we can do to stop people from being forced to \nleave--Mr. President, people do not suddenly say in Mexico: Well, I \nguess I'm going to head for the United States. I haven't anything \nbetter to do. They are driven to the United States out of poverty, out \nof desperation. This amendment will allow these people to stay home. It \nwill help Mexico City. It will help stop the tremendous flow of people \ninto that city, the largest city in the world.\n  This is the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do morally. \nIt is the right thing to do for the security of the Nation--I mean the \nsecurity of this Nation. It means more than just less crime, less \nburden on our education system, our health services, but it is economic \nsecurity in many other ways. This is good for both countries.\n  I respect my friend from Indiana, the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee. I can't believe that in his heart he believes there is \nanything wrong with this amendment. I ask my friends to support it.\n  I have nothing more to say.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I would \nlike to suggest to him that in view of testimony occurring before the \ncommittees presently, the Senator might consider laying the amendment \naside temporarily and that it might be voted upon perhaps at 11:30 this \nmorning. Would the Senator be amenable to that idea?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to enter an agreement with the Senator \nthat at 11:30 today the Reid-Daschle amendment would be voted on. I \nwould like an up-or-down vote on the amendment, and there would be no \nsecond-degree amendments in order. I so ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I agree that it is an up-or-down vote at 11:30.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so that I may offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1170 to Amendment No. 1136\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for herself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Durbin,\n\n[[Page S9170]]\n\n     Mr. Daschle, Mr. Sarbanes, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Reed, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1170.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, in May, after weeks of Democratic \nefforts, Congress extended unemployment benefits for the 2\\1/2\\ million \nAmericans who have been laid off due to the economic downturn in this \ncountry. So far, our Republican colleagues have refused to include \nassistance for the 1.1 million Americans who have been hit hardest by \nthis economic crisis--those long-term unemployed who have already run \nout of their unemployment benefits.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor to offer this amendment before the \nSenate. The amendment will provide additional unemployment insurance \ncompensation to more than 1 million Americans who have exhausted all of \ntheir unemployment insurance benefits.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senators Kennedy, Durbin, Daschle, \nSarbanes, Clinton, and Reed as cosponsors of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Murray amendment provides an additional 13 weeks of \nbenefits for unemployed Americans who have exhausted all of their \nFederal unemployment benefits. That means we will be giving additional \nassistance to American workers who have been out of work for 9 months \nor more.\n  My amendment provides 7 additional weeks of benefits for unemployed \nAmericans who have already received 26 weeks of benefits because they \nlive in a State hit hardest by the ongoing recession.\n  Finally, my amendment provides parity to railroad workers currently \nineligible for extended benefits.\n  The amendment before us would cost $2.5 billion, but it would help \nmore than a million American workers and their families.\n  Mr. President, we are talking about the people in this country who \nhave been hit hardest by this recession. We are talking about workers \nwho have run out of options but still have to pay their mortgage; they \nstill have to pay their medical bills; they still have college tuition \nto pay.\n  One recent study concluded that unemployed workers do not have \nsignificant savings to carry their families through an extended period \nof unemployment. Unemployment rates normally replace less than half--50 \npercent--of lost wages. What this means is unemployed workers are \ndraining their savings accounts just to survive. The problem is even \nmore acute for the long-term unemployed. Many of those have drained \ntheir savings entirely. They have nothing left.\n  Last week's June 2003 unemployment report clearly demonstrates the \nneed for this amendment at this time: 30,000 jobs were lost in the \nmonth of June; jobs have been lost for the last 5 consecutive months in \nthis country; more than 394,000 jobs have been lost since January of \nthis year; 9.4 million Americans are now unemployed; 3.4 million \nAmericans have lost their jobs just since President Bush took office.\n  Mr. President, we will soon be in the longest job recession since the \n1930s and the Great Depression. My State of Washington has the second \nhighest unemployment rate in the Nation. The unemployment rate in my \nState is 7.3 percent, and that is just the official unemployment rate.\n  One recent business columnist suggested the actual unemployment rate \nfor the State of Washington could be as high as 11.8 percent if you \ncount all of Washington's unemployed workers.\n\n[[Page S9171]]\n\n  All across Washington--in every sector and every region--we are \ncontinuing to see job losses. One recent economic report predicted it \nwould be 2005 before any real job creation occurs in Washington State. \nThat is a long time for people who have been out of work for 9 months \nor more.\n  My colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, is in the Chamber. He and I \nshare the distinction of being in States with the highest unemployment \nfor the last number of years.\n  We know when we go home that we are going to be faced by neighbors, \nby friends in every community across our State who will have been on \nunemployment, through no fault of their own. They want to be at work. \nThey want to support their families. They want to send their kids to \ncollege. They want to pay their mortgages. They want to pay for health \ncare. They do not have jobs. They do not have opportunities. And we \nhave a responsibility to make sure they do not lose everything because \nof a recession that has been no fault of their own.\n  Despite the rosy projections of economic growth and recovery that we \nkeep hearing from this administration, we have to tell you there are \nmany real Americans who are suffering through this economy every day.\n  In my State, there are about 20,000 workers who would benefit from \nthe amendment that is now before the Senate. I have met with these \nworkers who are struggling today. We have lost 35,000 Boeing \nmanufacturing jobs in the last 2 years alone. On an almost daily basis, \nmy office gets calls from workers who are desperate, who have lost \ntheir benefits or who will soon lose their unemployment insurance \ncompensation. In fact, yesterday I received a phone call from a \ngentleman named Richard, and I want to read the message he left my \noffice: He said:\n\n       I live on Camino Island. I'm a laid off Boeing worker. I \n     got laid off a year and a half ago. And I'm in school right \n     now. My unemployment insurance just ran out. I have 8 months \n     left of school. . . .I'm really concerned right now. . . \n     .That money would have been a godsend. I worked for Boeing \n     for over 12 years.\n\n  This could be anyone working hard, raising their family, working for \nBoeing for 12 years and, through no fault of their own, through an \neconomic recession in this country, through September 11, through a \ndownturn in our airline industry, this gentleman was laid off. He is \nnow trying to get his life back together. He is going to school. He \ndoes not want to lose everything. He wants to contribute back to this \neconomy and to this country. He needs us to extend unemployment \ninsurance to give him that kind of assurance that this country is there \nfor him in the good times and in the tough times.\n  There are a lot of workers, such as Richard from Camino Island, in my \nState who are losing their benefits. Many of these workers are losing \nhope in this current economy. This amendment gives more than 1 million \nAmerican workers and their families new hope, new assurance that their \ncountry is there for them.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I urge its adoption \nthis morning on this bill. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Washington has offered this \nvery timely amendment. We have spoken to the two managers of the bill. \nWe are awaiting instructions from the leadership as to whether we would \nhave a vote following the amendment that is pending, the Reid-Daschle \namendment.\n  In the meantime, Senator Allen and Senator Harkin wish to offer an \namendment, and Senator Clinton and Senator Wyden. Senator Allen wishes \nto speak, he said, for 5 minutes; is that correct?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, 10 minutes and 5 minutes for Senator \nHarkin.\n  Mr. REID. And Senator Wyden and Senator Clinton wish to speak for 5 \nminutes. We could do that and make that just right for about an 11:30 \nvote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I object for the moment. I want to respond.\n  Mr. REID. Let's get this resolved first.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I object temporarily to the request for the yeas and nays. \nI will go along with that shortly. I am just trying to work with the \ndistinguished leader on procedure.\n  Senator Nickles requires 10 minutes for debate on the Murray \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, that would put us to 5 after. Senator Murray \nasks for 5 minutes to respond. We have Senator Allen who wishes to \nspeak for 10 minutes, Senator Harkin for 5 minutes, and then we have \nSenator Clinton for 5 minutes and Senator Wyden for 5 minutes, and that \nputs us at 25 to the hour. Then I am sure we can have the vote at 11:35 \na.m. or 11:40 a.m. and get everyone in to speak.\n  I ask that the Senator from Washington be given the opportunity to \nhave her amendment seconded so she can have a vote on it; Otherwise, we \nwill just go into a quorum call. I have the floor. We ought to vote on \nher amendment at some time agreed to by the leadership.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I agree the distinguished Senator should have a rollcall \nvote on the amendment. I will probably make a motion to table at the \nappropriate time.\n  Mr. REID. We understand that. We understand it will be on or in \nrelation to the Murray amendment.\n  Mr. LUGAR. We on our side are trying to work out an agreement. \nPresently it is being drafted. Both sides are attempting to work out \nvoting arrangements. It might be available. It might be useful to set \naside the Murray amendment temporarily to listen to Senator Allen.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that when we go to the Allen-Harkin \namendment, the Murray amendment be set aside temporarily and that he be \nallowed to speak for 10 minutes and Senator Harkin for 5 minutes, and \nthat following his remarks, as in morning business, the Senators from \nOregon and New York be recognized for 5 minutes each; that we then go \nto Senator Nickles and Senator Murray and finish debate on her \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1165 To Amendment No. 1136\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1165.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Allen], for himself and Mr. \n     Harkin, proposes an amendment numbered 1165.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To clarify the definition of blocked assets for purposes of \n               the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 815. CLARIFICATION OF BLOCKED ASSETS FOR PURPOSES OF \n                   TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002.\n\n       (a) Clarification.--Section 201(d)(2)(A) of the Terrorism \n     Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-297; 116 Stat. \n     2339; 28 U.S.C. 1610 note) is amended by inserting before the \n     semicolon the following: ``, any asset or property that in \n     any respect is subject to any prohibition, restriction, \n     regulation, or license pursuant to chapter V of title 31, \n     Code of Federal Regulations (including parts 515, 535, 550, \n     560, 575, 595, 596, and 597 of such title), or any other \n     asset or property of a terrorist party''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect on the date of the enactment of the \n     Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, to which such amendment \n     relates.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague, Senator Harkin of \nIowa, to present amendment No. 1165 which simply clarifies the \ncongressional intent of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act passed last \nyear by this Chamber. This amendment will finally allow American \nvictims of terrorism the opportunity for justice and the compensation \nthey deserve.\n  Unfortunately, despite repeated action taken by the Senate and by the \nCongress, many American victims are still debating with their own \nGovernment to seek compensation from states supporting terrorist \nactivities.\n  Last year, the Senate approved an amendment that Senator Harkin and I\n\n[[Page S9172]]\n\noffered to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act that was intended to permit \nvictims of state-sponsored terrorism to satisfy their court-ordered \njudgments for compensatory damages. That amendment was resoundingly \napproved by a vote of 81 to 3.\n  We sent a clear message that we are committed to stand beside the \nU.S. victims of terrorism and make sure they attain justice to which \nthey are entitled. Indeed, several hundred Americans successfully \nsatisfied their judgment under last year's law under assets of \nterrorist nations that were held by our Government. However, some \nexecutive branch officials have attempted to prevent American victims \nof terrorism from using Iranian assets held by the U.S. Government to \nsatisfy their judgments against Iran for their complicit terrorist \nactivities.\n  Some misguided and apparently confused Government officials are under \nthe impression that Iranian assets fall outside the definition of \n``blocked assets'' and, therefore, cannot be used to satisfy judgments \nawarded to American victims.\n  For some reason, there are some in the State Department who have \nfound that the assets of terrorist states, such as Libya, Sudan, North \nKorea, and Cuba, are blocked but assets specific to Iran are merely \nregulated, and therefore not eligible for American victims to receive \nawards.\n  This maladroit bureaucratic interference is once again preventing \nthese funds from being used to compensate American victims who have \nbrought lawsuits in our Federal courts. The cases have been heard. The \nevidence has been presented. They have won their cases and they have \nsecured court-ordered judgments. They are real human beings, such as \nEdwina Hegna of Virginia. In the 1980s, Mrs. Hegna's husband, Charles \nHegna, was an employee of the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment. In 1984, he was on a commercial airplane flight from \nKuwait City to Karachi, Pakistan. That plane was hijacked by Hezbollah, \nan Iranian-backed organization. The terrorists demanded that all \nAmericans reveal themselves. Mr. Hegna stepped forward. The terrorist \nthen beat and tortured him.\n  Upon landing, they forced him to kneel. In testimony, witnesses \ntalked about hearing Mr. Hegna praying for his life. He was then shot \nin the stomach and thrown 20 feet to the tarmac below. He was still \nalive, though, on that tarmac. Although many bones were broken in his \nlower body, he did not die. He laid in agony on the tarmac for over an \nhour. An ambulance finally arrived. The terrorists, when seeing the \nambulance coming, leaned out of the airplane door and shot him \nrepeatedly. He died in that ambulance at the age of 50.\n  He is survived by his wife and their four children. The Hegna family \ncurrently has been awarded a compensatory judgment but is unable to \nreceive any compensation from Iran's estimated $237.5 million of net \nassets reported in this year's Treasury Department report on terrorist \nassets.\n  The Senate and Congress must restate the congressional intent, and we \nmust restate it a second time so the Hegna family and all victims--\nwhether they are in Iowa, New York, New Hampshire, all across our \nNation--ought to be compensated from the blocked or regulated assets of \nterrorist nations, and their sponsors must be held responsible and \naccountable for their vile acts. However, since Congress enacted \nlegislation covering these assets, mistaken bureaucratic \ninterpretations maintain those assets are not subject to the provisions \nin the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act passed last year.\n  Let's stop playing games. Let's allow these victims and their \ndevastated families the right to get after these assets.\n  Let me be clear with my colleagues about what this amendment does not \ndo because we possibly will hear some arguments on this. What this \namendment does not do, No. 1, it does not in any way change or expand \nthe definition of blocked assets as defined in the Terrorism Risk \nInsurance Act, which this amendment was passed last year, 81 to 3. The \ndefinition has always intended to include these so-called regulated \nassets.\n  No. 2, it does not expand the scope of entities which could be held \nliable. To the contrary, existing law is broad enough and already \nensures that all agencies and instrumentalities of state sponsors of \nterrorism are subject to the terms of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. \nNothing in this amendment changes that definition.\n  No. 3, it does not eliminate or make any changes to the executive \nbranch's flexibility or managing of sanctions. The amendment simply \nprevents bureaucrats from undermining the intent of the Terrorism Risk \nInsurance Act.\n  Lastly, this amendment does nothing to change the policy established \nby the provisions of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act and the Harkin-\nAllen amendment passed last year by an 81-to-3 vote. We must send a \nclear message that, regardless of confused bureaucracy, we are going to \nstand strong for justice and hold terrorists responsible for their vile \nactions. Therefore, I respectfully ask my colleagues to stand with \nthese victims of state-sponsored terrorism, stand with their families \nand allow them to get some kind of satisfaction, compensation, and \nproper recourse to justice. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n\n  After Senator Harkin speaks on this amendment, I will ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Virginia \nfor his statement and his persistence. I remember him pushing this \namendment last year. I was privileged to cosponsor the amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I compliment my colleague from Virginia for his efforts.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma. It \nmeans a great deal to our efforts to have his leadership and support \nbehind this amendment.\n  Seeing that my colleague from Iowa, the cosponsor of this amendment, \nhas not yet arrived, and in the effort to have things move along, I \nyield the floor but reserve for him 5 minutes. Then, at the conclusion \nof his statement, I will ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia for offering his amendment. As the Senator from Oklahoma has \nsaid, his has been persistent on behalf of the victims.\n  The administration has proposed a comprehensive program for \naddressing compensation for all U.S. victims of terrorism. I have \nintroduced that proposal, by their request, as S. 1275. The Committee \non Foreign Relations will hold hearings on the proposal on July 17. I \nhope our committee will have the benefit of considering the proposal, \ndeliberating on it, and offering its best advice to the Senate.\n  Senator Biden and I are prepared to accept the amendment. We would \nlike to do so at this stage as opposed to having a rollcall vote, or a \nvoice vote for that matter.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I certainly would not object to a voice vote. I ask my \nchairman, Senator Lugar, if we could have a voice vote. I think it is \nimportant we have a voice vote to make sure those in the bureaucracy \nbest understand the intent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask sometime that Senator Harkin be recognized for up to \n10 minutes to speak on the amendment. He is in the Chamber, and that is \nfine. I ask if Senator Harkin would have any objection to our passing \nthe amendment and then he be recognized to speak on the amendment that \nis approved. We have a UC we are trying to get through.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is fine.\n  Mr. LUGAR. If the Chair would proceed to the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1165.\n  The amendment (No. 1165) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nSenators be recognized to speak prior to the sequence of votes: Senator \nHarkin for 5 minutes, Senator Nickles for 10 minutes, Senator Murray \nfor 5 minutes, Senator Kennedy for 5 minutes,\n\n[[Page S9173]]\n\nand that following the debate the Senate proceed to the vote on the \nReid amendment to be followed by a vote in relation to the Murray \namendment No. 1170; provided that there be 2 minutes equally divided in \nthe usual form for debate prior to each of the two votes.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I remind everyone that Senators Clinton and Wyden have \nalready been recognized in a previous order to speak for up to 10 \nminutes. They will each take 5 minutes. I also ask that the Senator \nfrom Maryland be recognized for 5 minutes. He has called and wishes to \nspeak. I also ask that there be no second-degree amendment in order \nprior to a vote on or in relation to the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Washington. Part of this consent, if everyone uses their \ntime, would bump up the vote for a few minutes but not much.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, I \nbelieve the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, may wish to speak. I am \nnot positive about that but I reserve 5 minutes for him since this \ndeals with the committee of which he is chairman.\n  Mr. REID. We would accept that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I compliment and commend my friend and \ncolleague from Virginia for his unrelenting efforts to make sure \nvictims of terrorism and their families are duly compensated for the \nacts of terrorism done to them and to their families by various \ngovernment entities abroad. Senator Allen has been in the forefront of \nthis fight. I am proud to join him as a cosponsor of this amendment to \nagain reinforce our commitment to the American victims of State-\nsponsored terrorism.\n  We are united as Americans to meet the threat of terrorism. Even as \nwe track down the terrorists and defend America, we must never forget \nthat terrorists acts are ultimately stories of human tragedy. We must \nnever forget the victims, victims such as Kathryn Koob from Waverly, \nIA, who sought to build cross-cultural ties between the Iranian people \nand the American people, only to be taken hostage in the U.S. Embassy \nin Tehran and held captive for 444 nightmarish days in Iran.\n  This amendment by Senator Allen and myself and others will enable \nAmerican victims of terrorism to receive compensation from blocked or \nfrozen assets of foreign governments that sponsored the attacks upon \nthem.\n  Despite repeated provisions passed by Congress and enacted by the \nPresident most recently as part of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of \n2002, again the amendment on which both Senator Allen and I had worked, \nAmerican victims of terrorism continue to be denied court-awarded \ncompensation.\n  Last year, Congress passed this amendment that Senator Allen and I \ncosponsored 81 to 3 as part of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. This \nlaw required that compensation to American victims of Iran-sponsored \nterrorism be made from all blocked Iranian assets. Unfortunately, the \nState Department has decided to play semantics in order to get around \nthe law, saying Iranian assets held by the United States are \n``regulated,'' not ``blocked.''\n  This amendment offered today by Senator Allen and myself and others \nmakes explicitly clear the meaning of ``blocked.''\n\n       Regulated, frozen, seized, held, licensed, restricted or \n     anything of similar meaning, no matter by what specific legal \n     authority Iranian funds are held by the U.S. Government.\n\n  So this should clear it up. It is a matter of fairness to the \nvictims. It is also a matter of fairness for the American taxpayer. The \nexecutive branch of the Government actively opposes the use of blocked \nor frozen assets to pay court-ordered compensation but calls, instead, \nfor compensation to be paid with U.S. tax dollars. I believe this is \nbackwards. State sponsors of international terrorism, not the American \ntaxpayer, must be compelled to pay these costs first and foremost.\n  I don't know how Congress can make itself more clear. But let's try \nto make it clear again that we will continue to speak on the Senate \nfloor about this issue until all American victims of State-sponsored \nterrorism receive the compensation they were awarded from those who \nperpetrated the attacks upon them.\n  I am honored to join Senator Allen and others today and to send a \nstrong message to State sponsors of terrorism that they will pay for \nwhat they have done, and an equally strong message to American victims \nof terrorism that their country supports them.\n  I ask unanimous consent I be added as a cosponsor to the Murray \namendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I notify my colleagues I plan to offer another amendment \nlater today that will be dealing, again, with aspects of reconstruction \nin Iraq regarding people with disabilities having access to places \nbeing rebuilt.\n  Finally, I compliment my friend and colleague from Virginia, again, \nfor his untiring, unrelenting effort to make sure that victims of \nterrorism are awarded compensation. These are not people who just get \nthe money; they have to go to court. They have to prove their case. If \nthey are successful, then they will be awarded compensation from the \ncountries that sponsor this State-sponsored terrorism. I am proud to \njoin as a cosponsor.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I say to my colleague from Iowa, I know the Senator's \npassionate leadership on this issue has been truly a key in propelling \nthis forward. It is a pleasure to work together. It is good to see \nsomebody who cares strongly about justice. And as with so many efforts \nin the Senate, we need bipartisan leadership. I very much appreciate \nyour vigor, your strength, your courage. You keep us going. You are a \ngood captain of this team. We will keep fighting for those victims and \nagainst those terrorist states.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for his kind words.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, under the earlier unanimous consent request \nI was given 5 minutes and Senator Clinton was given 5 minutes to \naddress the matter of competitive bidding for Iraqi reconstruction \ncontracts. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed that full 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n     Amendments Nos. 1171 and 1172, En Bloc, to Amendment No. 1136\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I send to the desk two amendments, one by \nSenator Leahy and one by Senator Biden, that have been agreed to by \nboth sides, and I ask for their immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nlaid aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], for Mr. Leahy, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1171.\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], for Mr. Santorum, for \n     himself and Mr. Biden, proposes an amendment numbered 1172.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1171\n\nPurpose: To ensure that eligibility for assistance under the Millennium \nChallenge Account includes a demonstrated commitment to the sustainable \n                        use of natural resources\n\n       On page 250, line 4, insert the following before the semi-\n     colon; and the sustainable use of natural resources\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1172\n\n     (Purpose: To make a technical correction to the United States \n  Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. TECHNICAL CORRECTION RELATING TO THE ENHANCED HIPC \n                   INITIATIVE.\n\n       Section 1625(a)(1)(B)(ii) of the International Financial \n     Institutions Act (as added by section 501 of the United \n     States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria \n     Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-25)) is amended by striking \n     ``subparagraph (A)'' and inserting ``clause (i)''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the \namendements.\n\n[[Page S9174]]\n\n  The amendments (No. 1171 and 1172) were agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment No. 1171\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of the bill \nfor accepting this amendment, and I also want to thank the White House \nfor its support.\n  This is an amendment of few words--only seven, in fact, but they are \nimportant words. The Millennium Challenge Account, MCA, authorized in \nthis bill, provides for a determination by the Millennium Challenge \nBoard of eligibility of candidate countries for assistance. The Board \nis to determine whether such a country has demonstrated a commitment to \nseveral things, including ``just and democratic goverance,'' ``economic \nfreedom,'' and ``investments in the people of such country.'' I support \nthis. It is long overdue for our foreign assistance to be linked to \nconcrete benchmarks like these. Too often, we have squandered U.S. \ntaxpayer dollars on corrupt, autocratic governments that do not share \nour values or a commitment to democratic and economic reform.\n  However, as orignally drafted, the criteria for MCA eligibility do \nnot include a country's commitment to protect the environment. Many \ngovernments of developing countries have turned a blind eye or even \nparticipated in the wholesale destruction of the timber, mineral and \nfossil resources that are among a country's greatest source of wealth. \nIn Indonesia and parts of South America, the forests and wildlife are \nbeing destroyed at an astounding rate. In Angola, billions of dollars \nin oil revenues have been stolen by corrupt officials, and this \ncontinues today. Other countries are rapidly depleting their scarce \nwater resources, or poisoning their rivers and lakes with toxic \npollutants. Fisheries are being mismanaged, and valuable arable land is \nbeing lost to erosion.\n  Economic development cannot be sustained without the sustainable \nmanagement of a country's natural resources, yet few developing \ncountries have adopted laws or policies which adequately reflect the \nirrevocable link between economic growth and environmental protection. \nAnd some countries that have such laws or policies do not enforce or \nimplement them. My amendment addresses this issue by ensuring that in \norder to qualify for assistance under the MCA, a country must have \ndemonstrated a commitment to ``the sustainable use of natural \nresources.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, for some time now a bipartisan group of \nSenators expressed concern about the letting of billions of dollars in \nIraqi reconstruction contracts without competitive bidding. We have \nworked very closely with the chair of the Armed Services Committee, \nChairman Warner, and with Senator Collins, who chairs the Governmental \nAffairs Committee. We have been able to attach an amendment to the \nDefense authorization bill requiring the disclosure of awards that \ninvolve closed-bid or no-bid accounts.\n  But the fact is, as the legislative process goes forward, too much \nmoney is now moving out of public coffers into private hands with too \nlittle assurance that those hands have won their contracts fairly.\n  As a result, today Senator Clinton and I are requesting the immediate \npublic disclosure of all documents relating to USAID's decision to \nexempt Iraqi contracting from full and competitive bidding. In \naddition, Senator Clinton and myself are asking Defense Secretary \nRumsfeld for explanations regarding particularly troubling contracts \nthat have recently come to light and have been awarded by his \nDepartment.\n  Recently, a number of Senators have returned from Iraq. Every one of \nthem I have heard discussing their trip, Democrats and Republicans \nalike, have concluded that the U.S. military will be spending more time \nin that country than originally calculated. The work to rebuild that \nravaged nation will be more difficult rather than less so. Certainly, \nthe billions of dollars of costs to the American people seem only to be \ngoing up.\n  This week, Civil Administrator Paul Bremmer said that just over the \nnext 6 months, Iraqi oil revenues will be $2 billion short of what will \nbe needed to finance occupation and reconstruction. U.S. taxpayers are \nbeing asked to fund the difference. They are being asked to fund the \ndifference for the 6 months and presumably for the foreseeable future. \nYet the rationale behind much of this cost remains unknown to the \nAmerican people and even to the Congress. Companies have been given \ncontracts for work in Iraq with little or no competition and no \nexplanation.\n  The history of this, documented by the General Accounting Office, is \nsuch that this is a very unwise approach. The General Accounting Office \nhas repeatedly said sole source or limited source contracts are not the \nbest buy. They found that military leaders have often simply accepted \nthe level of services given by a contractor without once asking if it \ncould be done more efficiently or at a lower cost. Yet these \nnoncompetitive contracts now seem to be the rule rather than the \nexception when it comes to Iraqi reconstruction.\n  In my view, when Federal agencies employ a process that may expose \ntaxpayers to additional costs, the need for explanation increases \nmanifold.\n  There is a crying need for transparency in how these billions of \ndollars are being spent. On April 19 of this year, a $50 million \npolicing contract was awarded through closed bidding. On the same day \nit was reported that an $8 million contract for personnel services had \nbeen awarded nearly a month before the war began.\n  Think about that--awards actually before the conflict began. By the \ntime the end of hostilities was officially declared in May, billions of \ndollars of contracts had already been awarded.\n  Fortunately, the news media has helped to get out the word about some \nof these issues. Right now the media is the American people's only \nsource, apparently, for insight into these contracts. The more we learn \nabout this, the more troubling the pattern is. Just recently the New \nYork Times ran a feature-length article describing the letting of a \nmultimillion dollar oil field contract to Kellogg Brown & Root.\n  I ask unanimous consent that important article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the New York Times Magazine, June 22, 2003]\n\n                        Nation Builders for Hire\n\n                             (By Dan Baum)\n\n       The huge effort to restore Iraq's oil industry begins every \n     day two hours south of the Iraq-Kuwait border, at the lavish \n     Crowne Plaza Hotel in Kuwait City. No sooner does the lobby \n     restaurant open at 5 a.m. than a line of middle-aged men in \n     jumpsuits, golf shirts and identical tan caps forms at the \n     breakfast buffet, eschewing the mezzeh and labneh for French \n     toast, home fries and beef bacon. Outside, a couple of dozen \n     silver S.U.V.'s are lined up, and after a quick breakfast the \n     men are off in a swift northbound convoy, each car marked \n     with the sideways V of duct tape that designates American and \n     British vehicles. The road knifes across a packed pebble \n     desert as flat as a griddle, with hardly a plant or a rock \n     gentling the view to a hazy 360-degree horizon. But nobody's \n     minding the scenery.\n       The men in the S.U.V.'s are all talking at once, handing \n     clipboards and calculators back and forth, trying to make \n     10,000 impossible things happen in Iraq's oil fields in \n     exactly the right order. A couple are getting in last-minute \n     calls to headquarters in Houston before leaving Kuwaiti \n     cellphone coverage. Though they speak with the drawling soft \n     consonants of the Texas-Oklahoma oil patch, these are truly \n     citizens of the world--or at least the petroleum-producing \n     corners of it.\n       For they are the legions of Kellogg Brown & Root, \n     subsidiary of the oil-services giant Halliburton, which in \n     March won an open-ended Army contract to restore Iraq's oil \n     fields to working order. Most have spent years toiling in the \n     raw, scraped and sometimes violent places where oil lurks, \n     and each hews to the oilie's ethic: no place is a hardship. \n     How were your 12 years in Algeria? ``Not bad.'' Your six \n     years at Prudhoe Bay? ``Not bad.'' Your 14 years in Nigeria? \n     ``Not many of whom fought the hard battles for Basra and Umm \n     Qasr, pile into Land Rovers and fall in behind.\n       When Dwight Eisenhower warned in 1961 of the ``military-\n     industrial complex,'' he never imagined the regimental \n     descendants of Monty's boys at El Alamein tenting in the \n     desert to baby-sit corporadoes earning $10,000 tax-free a \n     month. This, however, is modern might. The military has \n     become the industrial, and vice versa.\n       Representative Henry Waxman, a Democrat from California, is \n     in high dudgeon lately, suggesting that Vice President Dick \n     Cheney's former chairmanship of Halliburton gave KBR the \n     inside track on the Iraqi oil-fields contract, which could be \n     worth as much as $7 billion. But the reality is subtler: KBR \n     didn't need any help. It is by now so enmeshed with the \n     Pentagon that it was able essentially to assign the contract \n     to itself.\n\n[[Page S9175]]\n\n       KBR was founded in 1919 as Brown & Root, and quickly \n     acquired a reputation for taking on the kinds of projects \n     that tend to recall the building of the pyramids. It \n     constructed the gigantic Mansfield Dam in Texas, New Orlean's \n     24-mile Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, Colorado's Eisenhower \n     Tunnel and the Johnson Space Center, among many other mega-\n     projects. Halliburton acquired it in 1962, and in 1998 merged \n     it with the petrochemical company M. W. Kellogg to form \n     Kellogg Brown & Root. KBR now accounts for almost half of \n     Halliburton's annual $12.5 billion annual revenue.\n       The Army says KBR got the Iraqi oil-field contract without \n     having to compete for it because, according to the Army's \n     classified contingency plan for repairing Iraq's \n     infrastructure, KBR was the only company with the skills, \n     resources and security clearances to do the job on short \n     notice. Who wrote the Army's contingency plan? KBR. It was in \n     a position to do so because it holds another contract that is \n     poorly understood yet in many ways more important, and \n     potentially bigger, than the one to repair the oil fields: \n     the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program, or Logcap, which \n     essentially turns KBR into a kind of for-profit Ministry of \n     Public Works for the Army. Under Logcap, which KBR won in \n     open bidding in 2001, KBR is on call to the Army for 10 years \n     to do a lot of the things most people think soldiers do for \n     themselves--from fixing trucks to warehousing ammunition, \n     from delivering mail to cleaning up hazardous waste. K.P. is \n     history; KBR civilians now peel potatoes, and serve them, at \n     many installations. KBR does the laundry. It fixes the pipes \n     and clean the sewers, generates the power and repairs the \n     wiring. It built some of the bases used in the Iraq war.\n       Writing the oil-field contingency plan was only one of a \n     thousand things KBR did for the Army last year under Logcap. \n     (KBR has a similarly broad contract with the Navy, under \n     which it built, among other things, the cages for suspected \n     terrorists at Guantanamo Bay.) The technical term for Logcap \n     is ``cost-reimbursement, indefinite-delivery)/indefinite \n     quantity,'' or ``cost-plus,'' meaning KBR spends whatever it \n     believes necessary to get a job done, then adds from 1 to 9 \n     percent as profit. There's practically no limit on how \n     lucrative Logcap can be, and as the awarding of the Iraqi \n     oil-field contract--by KBR, to KBR--demonstrates, Logcap can \n     become a generator of yet more contracts. Nothing like it \n     exists elsewhere in government. That KBR wrote the oil-field \n     plan wasn't considered by the Army a disqualifying conflict \n     of interest--in fact, just the opposite. ``They were the \n     company best positioned to execute the oil-field work because \n     of their involvement in the planning,'' said Lt. Col. Gene \n     Pawlik, an Army spokesman.\n       The military has relied on civilian contractors ever since \n     George Washington hired farmers to haul supplies for the \n     Continental Army, and the use of mercenaries is as old as \n     time. But the KBR-style blending of corporations into the \n     fabric of the military is relatively recent. Its genesis is \n     one of the unsung but seminal ideological documents of the \n     Reagan era, a revolution-on-paper that goes by the dry title \n     Circular No. A-76. Issued in 1983 by the budget director, \n     David Stockman, A-76 mandates that government should ``rely \n     on commercial sources to supply the products and services the \n     government needs.''\n       Circular No. A-76 wasn't written specifically for the \n     Defense Department, and the military was slow to adopt the \n     approach. It took the end of the cold war for the Pentagon to \n     discover the benefits of outsourcing. The times demanded that \n     the military shrink--remember all the talk about a ``peace \n     dividend''? Oddly, though, the end of the cold war uncorked a \n     froth of conflicts from Africa to the Balkans that the \n     military had to monitor and, in the case of the former \n     Yugoslavia, fight. By one count, the Army has deployed \n     soldiers more than three times as often in the 14 years since \n     the cold war ended than in the cold war's four-decade \n     history, even though it is today down to only two-thirds the \n     size of its cold war peak.\n       Downsizing the military not only meant doing more with \n     less; it also meant that a lot of former soldiers, sailors, \n     airmen and officers were suddenly on the street looking for \n     the kind of work for which their particular skills would be \n     valuable. The Pentagon still needed those skills. So the \n     downsized warriors joined a constellation of corporations \n     that sold those skills--everything from data processing to \n     interrogation to bomb disposal--back to the military at \n     private-sector prices.\n       In 1992 the Defense Department, under Dick Cheney, hired \n     Brown & Root to write a classified report detailing how \n     private companies could help the military logistically in the \n     world's hot spots. Not long after, the Pentagon awarded the \n     first five-year Logcap--to Brown & Root. Then Bill Clinton \n     won the election, and Cheney, in 1995, became C.E.O. of \n     Halliburton, Brown & Root's parent company. A lot of \n     Halliburton's business depends on foreign customers getting \n     loans from U.S. banks, which are in turn guaranteed by the \n     government's trade-promoting Export-Import Bank. In the five \n     years before Cheney took the helm, the Ex-Im Bank guaranteed \n     $100 million in loans so foreign customers could buy \n     Halliburton's services; during Cheney's five years as C.E.O., \n     that figure jumped to $1.5 billion.\n       ``Clearly Dick gave Halliburton some advantages,'' a \n     Hilliburton vice-president, Bob Peebler, told The Chicago \n     Tribune in 2000. ``Doors would open.''\n       Doors continue to swing freely between the corporate boards \n     of companies like KBR, whose livelihood depends on U.S. \n     energy and military policy, and the upper echelons of \n     government, where those policies are set. In addition to its \n     connection to Dick Cheney--who as vice president continues to \n     be paid ``less than $180,000 a year'' in deferred \n     compensation by Halliburton, according to a company \n     spokeswoman--Halliburton has on its board former Secretary of \n     State Lawrence Eagleburger, who has sits on the board of \n     Phillips Petroleum alongside a former chairman of the Senate \n     Select Committee on Intelligence, David Boren. Among the vice \n     presidents of Booz Allen Hamilton--another does-everything \n     company that has received millions in military contracts--is \n     the former Director of Central Intelligence James Woolsey. Of \n     the 30 members of the Defense Policy Board--the influential \n     Pentagon advisory panel from which Richard Perle was recently \n     forced to resign--at least nine are directors or officers of \n     companies that won $76 billion in defense contracts in 2001 \n     and 2002, according to the Center for Public Integrity. \n     Lieut. Gen. Jay Garner, who served as chief civilian \n     administrator of Iraq, ran a subsidiary of L-3 Communications \n     that makes missile systems used in the Iraq war; and L. Paul \n     Bremer III, who took over from Garner, was plucked from a new \n     unit of the insurer Marsh & McLennan that was created a month \n     after 9/11 to profit from the new concern over catastrophic \n     risk.\n       I am unabashedly an admirer of outsourcing,'' Army Gen. \n     Barry McCaffrey told The Dallas Morning News three years ago. \n     ``There's very few things in life you can't outsource.'' \n     McCaffrey now serves on the boards of the weapons makers \n     Raytheon Aerospace and Integrated Defense Technologies, \n     among others.\n       It's a relatively small club that has both guided U.S. \n     military, energy and Middle Eastern policies over the past \n     three decades and then run the corporations that benefit from \n     those policies. And it's a club that had a long history with \n     Saddam Hussein. A sheaf of declassified 1980's State \n     Department cables demonstrate that in 1983 Secretary of State \n     George Shultz--former president of Bechtel--sent Donald \n     Rumsfeld to meet personally with Saddam Hussein several \n     times, in part to promote an oil pipeline to the Red Sea port \n     of Aquaba. (The accompanying State Department photo of the \n     two men warmly shaking hands is startling, given the recent \n     vitriol between them.) In the midst of negotiations with \n     Rumsfeld, Hussein used poison gas against the Iranian Army. \n     While cables demonstrate the State Department discouraged \n     this, a memo to Eagleburger, then the under secretary of \n     state, noted it may have been American firms that sold \n     Hussein the gas, and outlined the need ``to avoid \n     unpleasantly surprising Iraq'' with public statements.\n       By July 2000, Cheney claimed on ABC's ``This Week'' that \n     neither Halliburton nor its subsidiaries dealt with Iraq at \n     all. ``Iraq's different,'' Cheney said at the time. ``I had a \n     firm policy that wouldn't do anything in Iraq, even \n     arrangements that were supposedly legal.'' But in fact from \n     1997 to 2000, when Cheney was running Halliburton, two of its \n     subsidiaries sold Saddam Hussein's government a total of $73 \n     million in oil-field supplies. The deal didn't violate U.S. \n     sanctions because the subsidiaries, Dresser-Rand and \n     Ingersoll Dresser Pump Company, were foreign.\n       KBR/Halliburton, then, has rounded the bases when it comes \n     to Iraq. It got rich doing business with Iraq, it got rich \n     preparing to destroy Iraq and it's now getting rich \n     rebuilding Iraq.\n       Proponents of contracting make the point that as the \n     overall size of the military shrinks, the ``tooth'' needs to \n     increase relative to the ``tail,'' or, as one analyst put it, \n     ``You want the 82nd Airborne training to kill people and blow \n     things up, not cleaning latrines or trimming hedges.'' They \n     also argue it's cheaper to hire contractors to do short-term \n     work rather than have the military maintain full-time \n     capabilities it needs only briefly.\n       A good example is Camp Arifjan, a U.S. Army base about 90 \n     minutes southwest of Kuwait City. Six months ago, this was \n     nothing but a small collection of buildings that was supposed \n     to be a training base. On Oct. 11--the day Congress gave \n     President Bush authority to wage war on Iraq--someone in the \n     Pentagon picked up a phone and told KBR it had nine weeks to \n     run Arifjan into a full-blown Army base for 7,000 people. The \n     job went to Robert (Butch) Gatlin, a wizened 59-year-old \n     Tennessean who served 32 years in the Army Corps of Engineers \n     before coming to perform the same work, at much greater pay, \n     for KBR.\n       ``When we got here, there was no power or water,'' Gatlin \n     said as we stepped from the air-conditioned trailer that is \n     KBR's Arifjan headquarters into the blinding desert sun. \n     Within about 72 hours of the Pentagon's call, Gatlin had a \n     handful of KBR specialists--electricians, carpenters, \n     plumbers--on planes headed here. Most of the rest were \n     hired locally. ``I had a thousand people working here in \n     24 hours,'' he said. ``The Army can't do that.''\n       KBR essentially took an entire Army base out of containers \n     and made it rise in the middle of the Kuwaiti desert two days \n     ahead of schedule: air-conditioned tents complete with 110-\n     volt outlets for the soldiers' boom\n\n[[Page S9176]]\n\n     boxes, male and female shower blocks, kitchens, a laundry, \n     Pepsi machines, a Nautilus-equipped health club with an \n     aerobics room (``Latin Dance Thurs & Sat!''), a rec center \n     with video games and a stack of Monopoly sets, a Baskin-\n     Robbins and a Subway sandwich shop. (No beer, though; alcohol \n     is illegal in Kuwait.) To conjure Camp Arifjan in a twinkling \n     amid one of the most hostile environments on the planet was \n     by any measure a stunning logistical achievement. And now, as \n     at many bases in the U.S., it's KBR civilian employees, not \n     soldiers, who cook, do the laundry, shuttle supplies and \n     control the airspace overhead. KBR does everything but fight. \n     Though it looks like an Army base, Camp Arifjan effectively \n     is a subsidiary of Kellogg Brown & Root. The Army is merely--\n     to use Gatlin's term--the ``client.''\n       The advantage to the Pentagon of using contractors goes \n     beyond logistics. Had the Army tried to build Camp Arifjan \n     itself last October, it would have had to mobilize \n     reservists, said Lt. Col. Karen LeDoux, the Logcap commander \n     at Arifjan. Activating reservists means disrupting families \n     and businesses and generating TV coverage of men and women \n     leaving home in uniform. In October, the war was still being \n     debated at the United Nations and in the streets. ``It's a \n     political decision to use contractors,'' LeDoux said. ``The \n     Army can get a delicate job done quietly.''\n       Outsourcing military missions also lets the Pentagon do \n     things Congress might not approve. Congress, for example, has \n     said the military can have only 400 U.S. soldiers in \n     Colombia, an oil-rich country destabilized by guerrillas and \n     the cocaine trade. But for years, civilian pilots employed by \n     DynCorp, a KBR competitor, have been flying what amount to \n     combat missions in Colombia under contract to the State \n     Department, spraying coca crops with defoliant and \n     occasionally getting shot at. Representative Janice \n     Schakowsky, Democrat of Chicago, has been trying to put a \n     stop to this kind of end run around Congressional oversight, \n     but in the bellicose post 9/11 atmosphere on Capitol Hill, \n     she can't get traction. Congress would never authorize the \n     U.S. military to perform such a politically explosive mission \n     as the Colombian spraying, Schakowsky argues, and if an \n     American soldier was killed in Colombia it would be Page 1 \n     news.\n       ``Is the U.S. military privatizing its missions to avoid \n     public controversy or embarrassment--to hide body bags from \n     the media and shield the military from public opinion?'' she \n     asks. Iraq, Schakowsky says, is no different. ``We talk a lot \n     in Congress about how many U.S. troops are there and for how \n     long, but not at all about the contractors,'' she said. \n     ``They don't have to follow the same chain of command, the \n     military code of conduct may or may not apply, the \n     accountability is absent and the transparency is absent--but \n     the money keeps flowing.''\n       The General Accounting Office and several watchdog groups \n     say it's not yet even clear that Pentagon contractors are \n     cheaper in the long run than a larger military; the \n     experiment is still too young. And there are other concerns, \n     first among them the uncomfortable fact that the military can \n     find itself dependent in wartime on people it doesn't \n     control. Often, the only people who know how to run the \n     military's new high-tech gear are the geeks of the company \n     that makes it, so the soldiers manning, say, an Abrams \n     tank don't necessarily know how to fix it if it breaks. \n     After visiting Arifjan I met a reserve Air Force colonel \n     in the lobby of the Kuwait Hilton who told me the \n     communications gear on which his job depends is entirely \n     maintained by civilian employees of the manufacturer (he \n     wouldn't tell me which). ``We had a problem in the middle \n     of the night and called down for the contractor; they told \n     us he doesn't come in until 9 a.m.,'' the officer told me. \n     ``We're fighting a war, and the contractor doesn't come in \n     until 9 a.m.!'' And really, there's no guarantee the \n     contractor will be there at all if things get ugly. \n     Soldiers have to stay put when the shells start falling or \n     face punishment for desertion; contractors who decide the \n     high pay isn't worth the risk can simply leave. As the \n     Defense Department itself put it in a 1991 report, \n     ``D.O.D. Components cannot ensure that emergency-essential \n     services performed by contractors would continue during \n     crisis or hostile situations.'' And that was before the \n     big increase in Pentagon contracting.\n       From the public's point of view, the increasing use of \n     contractors makes it harder to know what the military is \n     really doing. The Pentagon has lots of maddening rules that \n     citizens have to follow if they want information, but while \n     the Pentagon has secrets, it also fundamentally recognizes \n     that it is a public institution. Not so the contractors, \n     whose first allegiance is to their shareholders and who have \n     little incentive to share information about how they operate. \n     Take salaries. An Army sergeant with four years' service \n     earns $48,292.03 a year, a captain with two years' service \n     earns $60,500.47 and a lieutenant colonel with six years' \n     service earns $87,299.81; the salaries are even posted on the \n     Internet. But when I asked a KBR spokeswoman how much her \n     people were earning for their hard, beerless months in the \n     desert, she said, ``We absolutely don't discuss salaries.''\n       ``Why not?'' I asked. ``You're paying them with taxpayer \n     money.''\n       ``We absolutely don't discuss salaries,'' she repeated. \n     (Later, a KBR manager told me on the sly that because he and \n     his colleagues have all their expenses paid by KBR and \n     Americans abroad pay no income tax on the first $80,000 they \n     earn annually, they expect to net $120,000.)\n       At Camp Arifjan, Butch Gatlin spoke of the good old days of \n     the late 90s, when he had signing authority for any purchase \n     up to half a million dollars. Then came the U.S. involvement \n     in Bosnia and Kosovo from 1995 to 2000, when one of every \n     seven Pentagon dollars passed through KBR and both the \n     company and the Pentagon got dinged by the General Accounting \n     Office for overspending. The G.A.O. said it found ``no \n     evidence that cost was taken into consideration.'' Last year, \n     KBR paid $2 million to settle federal fraud charges that it \n     inflated the cost of an Army contract in California and ``in \n     doing so, it increased its profits at the government's \n     expense.''\n       Now when Gatlin wants to buy anything over $2,500--which is \n     almost everything--he has to get a signature from an Army \n     officer living at Arifjan. ``He signs a lot,'' Gatlin sighed. \n     Cost-plus contracting offers the Army maximum flexibility; in \n     an emergency or a politically sensitive moment, KBR can \n     quietly throw as much money as necessary at a problem. But \n     the more KBR spends, the more it earns.\n       Bechtel, another hydra-headed American giant, won what's \n     often called the ``mother contract'' from the U.S. Agency for \n     International Development to revive Iraq's water, power and \n     electricity and the port of Umm Qasr. Unlike KBR, which fills \n     the Crowne Plaza with a huge regiment of Texans who actually \n     turn wrenches, Bechtel keeps fewer than 50 engineers and \n     managers quartered at the Kuwait Sheraton. Bechtel's client \n     is USAID, not the military, so none of its work is \n     classified, and that makes it easier to hire its muscle \n     locally. So while the lobby of the Crowne Plaza feels like a \n     particularly high-rent sergeants' club--noisy and smoky, men \n     clumping in work boots across the faux-Persian carpets--the \n     cool marble lobby of the Sheraton plays the role of officers' \n     billet to the reconstruction campaign. On the Sheraton's \n     black leather sofas, British businessmen perch primly in no-\n     wrinkle blazers, sample cases ready, watching for the \n     company golf shirt of a Bechtel executive to emerge from \n     the elevators.\n       Robert Sedgbeer, who works for a smallish British company \n     that makes cellphone towers, was fighting jet lag to stay \n     awake. ``If I can just get these into the right hands, my \n     trip will be worth it,'' he said, fingering a stack of \n     company literature and craning his neck for a Bechtel exec. \n     Stephen Thomas, whose achingly polite Oxbridge manner belies \n     his 15 years in Oman (``not bad''), said he hopes to sell \n     Bechtel his company's food-service and telecommunications \n     skills. Like Sedgbeer and everybody else in the lobby, he \n     lowered his voice when saying ``Bechtel,'' lest he risk \n     offending the keepers of the golden keys. ``We don't often \n     get the chance, in our lifetimes, to see a country with such \n     tremendous oil wealth and virtually no civilian commercial \n     infrastructure get a whole new blueprint,'' Thomas said \n     eagerly.\n       The revolving door that spins at the top of the military-\n     industrial ziggurat spins at the bottom too. On my way out of \n     Arifjan, I looked more closely at the heavily armed soldiers \n     guarding the gate and found they weren't soldiers at all, but \n     rather civilian employees of something called Combat Support \n     Associates, a joint venture of three obscure American \n     companies that provide the Army with security, logistics, \n     ``live-fire training'' and maintenance. In southern Iraq I \n     ran into four big men in full combat gear and Robocop \n     sunglasses whom I also took to be soldiers until I noticed \n     the tape over the left shirt breasts; instead of US ARMY, it \n     said EODT. That stands for ``Explosive Ordnance Disposal \n     Technology,'' not an Army unit but a company based in \n     Knoxville, Tenn. The Web site says EOD Technology ``applies \n     leading-edge geophysical technologies to provide documented \n     efficient solutions to environmental challenges,'' and what \n     that translates to is: these guys dig up minefields for a \n     living. Their challenge the day I saw them was an unexploded \n     American artillery round that had crashed through an oil \n     pipeline and was buried who-knew-where underneath. All four \n     used to be soldiers; now they do the same work at private-\n     sector wages.\n       It's an article of faith among KBR's people that they will \n     be in Iraq only a short while. KBR's top client, Brig. Gen. \n     Robert Crear of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, is the man \n     in charge of Team RIO (Restore Iraqi Oil) and on a walking \n     tour of the Basra oil refinery he insisted that the Army's \n     role--and by extension KBR's--is temporary. ``This is an \n     Iraqi operation,'' he said several times. ``The oil belongs \n     to the Iraqi people. We are only support, and only until the \n     infrastructure is up and running.''\n       But neither he nor anybody else was able to say what ``up \n     and running'' means. Depending on how that question is \n     answered, companies like KBR will be in Iraq for months and \n     will make millions, or years, and make billions. Decades of \n     war and sanctions have left the wellheads, drills, pumps, and \n     pipelines so inefficient and unsafe that, by some estimates, \n     it will take $50 billion and a decade to fix them.\n       There is no question that companies like KBR are up to the \n     job. What isn't clear is whether there will come a day, \n     anytime soon, when the United States says, ``O.K.; good \n     enough,'' and goes home--leaving the Iraqi oil fields patched \n     together and its equipment semi-safe. Or does the effort to \n     ``assist the Iraqi people'' require a\n\n[[Page S9177]]\n\n     decadelong, oil-financed bonanza for oil-service companies \n     like KBR/Halliburton? If anybody has the answer to that \n     question, he or she is not saying. ``That's way above my pay \n     grade,'' says General Crear.\n       What's certain is that as long as the Army is in Iraq, KBR \n     will be there with it. In Baghdad every morning, a crowd of \n     desperate job seekers gathers at dawn at the back gate of the \n     old Republican Palace compound, which is now U.S. Army \n     headquarters. At about 7, a Humvee full of KBR men roars up, \n     and like doorkeepers at the old Studio 54 they select a dozen \n     or so grateful men and women for menial tasks on the base. \n     Nobody objected to my watching this scene, but later, when a \n     photographer took out a camera, an Army public-affairs \n     officer walked up with his hand outstretched. ``The \n     authorities in charge have decided not to allow access at \n     this time,'' he said. When asked if those ``authorities'' \n     were the Army or KBR, the officer sighed and said, ``To be \n     honest, the lines get a little blurred sometimes.''\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the reason that article is so important is \nbecause it indicates Kellogg Brown & Root essentially wrote the specs \nfor the U.S. Government with respect to an oil field restoration \neffort. What that article shows is that the process basically allowed \nan incumbent contractor to identify the criteria for a multibillion \ndollar contract and virtually ensured that company would be awarded the \ncontract without competition. If the news reports are correct, the \npotential for sole-source, custom-crafted contracts is basically \nguaranteed now by the Kellogg-Brown agreement. Senator Clinton and I \nhave asked the Defense Department to provide within 30 days answers to \nsome of the serious questions that involve contracting processes that \nseem to be used as of today.\n  The Department of Defense recently announced, for example, that they \nhad some concerns about the original agreement. That is fine, but we \nwant to know whether there are other contracts that are being let in \nthis fashion. We want to know whether the Department of Defense intends \nto continue the practice where it has not been discovered by the news \nmedia.\n  The reason we are so concerned is if individual contractors are \ncustomarily setting the criteria for the work they plan to pursue, \nthere are conflict-of-interest issues that ought to be resolved by our \nGovernment today. When you consider the Kellogg Brown & Root contracts \nare so-called cost-plus contracts, this arrangement becomes even less \nacceptable. Cost-plus contracts let the companies spend what they think \nis necessary, and then on top of it they tack on a percentage fee to \nmake a profit. The more taxpayer dollars the company spends, the more \nprofit they are able to bring home. A number of Iraqi reconstruction \ncontracts, not just Kellogg-Brown's, have been designed in this way.\n  My view is, if the Federal Government is going to spend my \nconstituents' money in this way, my constituents deserve an \nexplanation.\n  I was at a town meeting in a small Oregon community on the Oregon \ncoast this last weekend, where they could not afford money to have \ntheir port dredged. It may take upwards of $100 billion under some of \nthese plans to rebuild Iraq. When our country can't afford the money to \nmake sure our small ports get help quickly, there is no place for waste \nin these reconstruction matters.\n  Finally, to just highlight the immediacy of this concern, questions \nhave been raised as to how MCI, a company that does no wireless service \nin the U.S. and never has, could end up winning the contract from the \nDefense Department to set up a wireless telecommunications network in \nIraq.\n  That is the kind of question we want to see answered. That is why we \nare sending these letters today, calling for immediate public \ndisclosure of these contracts so we can see whether the American people \nare getting their money's worth. We come to the Senate floor today \nbecause these are new concerns that have come to light. Chairman \nWarner, Senator Collins, and others have worked with us in a very \nconstructive way with bipartisan legislation that I hope will be passed \nquickly. But I don't think we ought to allow the outsourcing of \naccountability over billions of dollars of contracts for Iraq to \ncontinue one day longer. That is why I come to the floor today to \nannounce this effort, to try to bring some sunshine to Iraqi \ncontracting. I have always felt sunshine is the best disinfectant. It \nsure looks like we need some of that right now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I join Senator Wyden in expressing \nconcern over the process regarding the awarding of reconstruction \ncontracts in Iraq. As Senator Wyden has pointed out, this is an issue \nthat impacts the spending of hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars. \nAfter the magnificent performance of our U.S. military in Iraq, we are \nnow faced with the task of rebuilding Iraq's infrastructure. Huge \ncontracts are being awarded in support of these efforts. However, many \nof these contracts are being awarded without fair and open competition \nand with no public oversight.\n  This week, Senator Wyden and I sent a letter to the administrator of \nthe U.S. Agency for International Development, Andrew Natsios, \nrequesting that he make public all documents related to USAID's \ndecision to exempt contracts for reconstruction of Iraq from full and \nopen competition. As the letter points out, sole-source and limited-\nsource contracts seem to be the rule, not the exception, for rebuilding \nIraq.\n  However, as the U.S. General Accounting Office has reported, sole-\nsource or limited-source contracts usually are not the best value for \nthe taxpayers. With $100 million in taxpayer funds projected for \nrebuilding Iraq, it is critical that we ensure that this money is being \nspent wisely.\n  Certainly, there may be times that contracts need to be awarded \noutside the normal contract award process. But in those cases, it is \nparticularly important that we ensure that those contracts undergo full \ndisclosure to avoid unnecessary expenses for the taxpayers.\n  As our letter makes clear, both the GAO and the USAID Inspector \nGeneral have raised questions about the processes used to award \nreconstruction contracts in Iraq. It is the responsibility of Congress \nto ensure that the funds we appropriate for reconstruction in Iraq are \nspent in a fair and open manner.\n  Earlier this year, I joined Senator Wyden, Senator Collins, Senator \nByrd and others in introducing the Sunshine in Iraq Reconstruction \nContracting Act. The bill provides an element of accountability so that \nCongress and the American people can have a full understanding of how \nthese contracts are being awarded. It would require that when contracts \nare awarded without a full and open competition, the awarding agency \nwould have to publicly explain why.\n  We were able to get similar language inserted into the Department of \nDefense Authorization bill which would require that Iraq reconstruction \ncontracts be subject to these reporting requirements. However, until \nthat provision becomes law, we are calling upon USAID to voluntarily \nmake these documents public.\n  As I have said before, it would be unfortunate if, in our effort to \nset an example of open government and democratic principles abroad, we \nundermined those principles here at home. I hope that the rest of my \ncolleagues join me in asking USAID to make these documents public.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted \nto speak for 5 minutes following the last speaker in the unanimous \nconsent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Reserving the right to object, is the Senator speaking \nagainst the Murray amendment?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will offer an amendment on Syria and speak on it and \nthen I will be withdrawing the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I understood the Senator from Oklahoma was lined up to \ngo next. If he wishes to defer, I would be happy to go now, if that is \nacceptable to him.\n  Mr. NICKLES. For the information of colleagues, I don't believe the \nUC had an order. It lists Senators. I can't do it right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as I understand it, I am recognized for \n5 minutes under the unanimous consent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n[[Page S9178]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 1170\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of the \nMurray amendment. I commend the very able Senator from the State of \nWashington for coming forward with this initiative. It is a critical \nissue for millions of Americans across the country, and I know how \nconcerned she has been about this issue. I am very happy to join in \nsupporting it as a co-sponsor.\n  This, historically, has been a bipartisan issue. Unemployment \ninsurance benefits were extended four times during the Reagan \nadministration and three times during the Bush administration. The \nrecent unemployment figures offer very strong support for acting on the \nMurray amendment.\n  Last week it was reported that the unemployment rate rose to 6.4 \npercent in June. This is the highest unemployment rate in over 9 years. \nWe have to go back to April of 1994 for a higher rate. Mr. President, \n9.4 million workers are unemployed, the most since December of 1992. \nThis, of course, doesn't account for those who are so discouraged that \nthey are not looking for work. Were we to count them, the unemployment \nrate would be well above 7 percent.\n  The economy has lost 394,000 jobs since January. We have lost jobs \neach of the past 5 months. Since this administration took office, \nprivate sector employment has fallen by more than 3 million.\n  Two million workers have been unemployed for more than 26 weeks, \nwhich is the period covered by regular unemployment insurance benefits. \nThis morning, the Labor Department reported that an additional 439,000 \nworkers filed initial unemployment insurance claims. More than 400,000 \nworkers have been filing initial unemployment insurance claims for 21 \nconsecutive weeks. The last time there was a longer streak of initial \nunemployment insurance claims over 400,000 was in September of 1992, \nmore than 10 years ago.\n  Furthermore, the number of continuing claims is at its highest level \nin 20 years. You have to go back to February of 1983 to find continuing \nclaims at the level which we are now experiencing.\n  There are over 1 million Americans who have exhausted all of their \nunemployment insurance benefits and are still not able to find a job, \nnot because they don't want to work but because there are not jobs to \nbe had.\n  Under current law, extended unemployed insurance benefits last only \n13 weeks for most workers. Those in high unemployment States receive 26 \nweeks. This amendment would provide an additional 13 weeks to those who \nhave already exhausted their benefits in most states and a further 7 \nweeks for those in high unemployment States.\n  It is not as though this proposal is excessive historically. In \nprevious recessions, we have passed extensions comparable or, indeed, \nbeyond what is contained in this amendment. When we had a recession \nfrom July of 1990 to March of 1991, we extended unemployment benefits \nuntil April of 1994. At the program's peak, benefits were available for \n26 to 33 extra weeks. That was in the previous Bush administration.\n  It is bad enough to get this level of unemployment in these \nadministrations. That is a breakdown in policy. But it is even worse \nnot to provide these benefits to help people go through the period of \nunemployment that they are experiencing, as the Senator from Washington \nso aptly stated in detailing the problems.\n  Let me make one final point. We build up an unemployment insurance \ntrust fund in good times to fund the benefits when we encounter an \neconomic downturn. The cost of this amendment, as I understand it, is \n$2.5 billion.\n  I ask the Senator from Washington if that is correct.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. There is $19 billion in the trust fund specifically \ncollected for the purpose of paying unemployment insurance benefits in \nan economic downturn. This amendment would take less than 15 percent of \nthat trust fund balance in order to expend these benefits.\n  We are facing a very serious situation. We need to recognize it here. \nWe recognized it when we had a downturn under the Reagan \nadministration. We recognized it when we had a downturn in the first \nBush administration. We ought to recognize it once again and make \nbenefits possible for these families who are experiencing tremendous \ndifficulties and burdens. We ought to help carry them through this \neconomic downturn until we start getting substantial job restoration.\n  I commend the Senator from the State of Washington for offering this \namendment. She has followed this issue very closely. I think it is \nimperative that the Murray amendment be agreed to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand there are 5 minutes reserved \nfor Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am told by his staff that Senator Kennedy is unable to \nbe in the Chamber due to other commitments. He has yielded his time to \nme on this amendment. I thank Senator Kennedy for yielding me this \ntime. I ask to be recognized at this point for those 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Senator Kennedy has been a great leader on \nthis issue. I know he wanted to speak on Senator Murray's amendment, \nbut he could not be here at this time.\n  We have been debating for the last few days the medical malpractice \nbill. We moved off it. But I think there is another, more pressing \nissue we need to address. It is what I call ``President Bush's economic \nmalpractice.'' The victims are working Americans.\n  As has been stated, unemployment has continued to climb; at 6.4 \npercent, it is the highest level since 1994. That is 9.4 million people \nlooking for work who can't find any. Under President Bush's misguided \nleadership, we have lost 3.1 million private sector jobs. This is the \nfirst time since Herbert Hoover's administration we have had an \nadministration with a net loss of jobs. What a record.\n  Again, the numbers don't reflect the millions of workers who were \nlaid off and had to take jobs that paid far less. In fact, the \nunemployment rate, in addition to the unemployed, would include part-\ntime workers who want to work full time but can't find it and \ndiscouraged workers no longer seeking jobs. This rose to 10.3 percent \nin June. We are still losing jobs every month--33,000 last month alone.\n  The economy is limping along. Our national deficit continues to \nballoon and will reach about $400 billion by the end of this year. \nAgain, that is why I accuse this administration of ``economic \nmalpractice.''\n  I don't think any illustration is better than this cartoon in the \nPittsburgh Post Gazette. Here is a man holding a cup of coffee. He \nsays: ``I tried to get angry with Bush for attempting to take away my \novertime pay, but then I remembered I don't have a job.''\n  Later on, I am going to have an amendment also dealing with overtime \npay because not only do we have people who are unemployed who need an \nextension, as Senator Murray says in her amendment, but now they want \nto take away overtime pay for those who are working. It is sort of a \ndouble hit on the workers of America.\n  In May, after weeks of Democratic efforts, Congress extended the \nunemployment benefits for 2.5 million Americans who had been laid off. \nBut our Republican colleagues refused to include assistance for the 1.1 \nmillion Americans hit the hardest by the economic crisis--those long-\nterm unemployed who have already run out of their unemployment \nbenefits.\n  It is unconscionable to provide billions of dollars in tax breaks for \nthe wealthiest of Americans and refuse to provide an average of $260 a \nweek for the recession's first and hardest hit victims. That is what \nthe Murray amendment does. This amendment provides up to a 13-week \nadditional benefit for these 1.1 million long-suffering Americans.\n  I might add that I looked at the figures. There are 9,800 in my State \nof Iowa alone. This would give them 13 weeks of additional benefits, \nand it would provide 7 additional weeks of benefits for those who have \nreceived the 26 weeks of benefits but who are\n\n[[Page S9179]]\n\nout of it and who live in those States hardest hit by the recession.\n  It occurred to me when I looked at the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Washington that it really is unconscionable that this \nCongress proposed these tax breaks for the wealthiest but won't come \ndown and help those who are unemployed.\n  I ask a rhetorical question: The tax breaks we provided for the \nwealthiest in our country, did we limit them to 26 weeks? Did we limit \nthem to 13 weeks so they can get the tax breaks, but they are only for \n26 weeks and once the 26 weeks are over, they snap back again and they \nhave to pay the tax rate they paid before? No. It is unending. It goes \non and on. From now on, they continue to get those tax breaks. But for \nhard-hit Americans out of work, our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle are saying 26 weeks, that is enough; you are out. I don't believe \nthat is fairness in our society.\n  I commend and compliment my friend and colleague from Washington \nState for addressing this issue and for pointing out that these hardest \nhit Americans deserve and need to have this extension.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Murray \namendment. I urge our colleagues to vote no on the amendment.\n  Just for the information of our colleagues and the sponsor of the \namendment, I will make a budget point of order. Not only does it \nviolate the budget, but it also violates, I am going to say, the spirit \nof the Senate.\n\n  We are supposed to be working on a State Department authorization \nbill. Every Senator knows this amendment does not belong on this bill. \nYet some people say: Oh, we are going to put it on this bill. It is \nridiculous. It is not like we have not voted on this before. Just last \nMay we passed an extension of unemployment compensation that takes us \nthrough the end of the year. It costs about $7 billion. We passed it \noverwhelmingly. It is a clean extension.\n  We have passed clean extensions in the past, but it seems like, for \nthe last year and a half, a lot of colleagues say: Well, we don't want \nto pass a clean extension of unemployment benefits. And by that I mean \na Federal unemployment assistance, which is temporary. Most States \nprovide 26 weeks of benefits. I believe Massachusetts has 30 weeks, but \nmost States have 26 weeks of unemployment comp. And then there is a \nFederal program of 13 weeks that is temporary. The Murray amendment \nwould make that 26 weeks for certain people. It would double the \nFederal temporary assistance. That is very expensive. It costs billions \nof dollars. I have opposed that and the Senate has opposed it.\n  As a matter of fact, we voted on it four times this year. We voted on \nit on January 22, March 25, May 15, and then May 23. We have defeated \ndoubling this program. Yet here we are again trying to double it on a \nState Department reauthorization bill. It does not belong on this bill. \nIt violates the budget. Some States even get more than 52 weeks, \nincluding the State of Washington. Most States get 26 weeks of State \naid, 13 weeks Federal. And high unemployment States--and there are a \nfew--get another 13 weeks of federal aid. So a few States already get \n52 weeks. Some States that really have high unemployment, including the \nState of Washington, get another 13 weeks. That is a total of 65 weeks. \nThat is over a year.\n  It is almost like no matter what program we have, we have to have \nmore. This is a lot of money. I believe I heard my colleague say that \nbenefits average about $260 per week. That is correct. Some States are \nup to $500-plus per week. And, yes, in some cases it might be paid for \nover a year.\n  In this amendment, it will all be paid for by the Federal Government. \nI think there has to be a limit. That is why we have budgets. This \nwould break the budget. But more important than that, it does not \nbelong on this bill. This is the fifth time we are going to vote on \nthis. Maybe people think they are scoring political points on this \nissue. I don't know. It does not belong on this bill.\n  At the appropriate time, I will make a budget point of order and urge \nmy colleagues not to agree to this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a piece of \nlegislation that Senator Boxer and I introduced last year and \nreintroduced this year which has 63 cosponsors. I understand the \nSenator from California may be offering this amendment after these two \nvotes and speaking on that amendment; and then my understanding is she \nintends to withdraw that amendment. But I think it is important that \nboth of us have an opportunity to talk about the importance of this \nissue; and that is the Syrian Accountability Act.\n  Many in this Chamber--obviously, 63--have very serious concerns about \nthe role Syria is playing in the Middle East and in the world \ncommunity. Syria is, unfortunately, being treated differently than \nother countries that have been listed as sponsors of terrorism. There \nare a couple handfuls of states that sponsor terrorism. Syria is one of \nthem. Yet it is treated fundamentally differently than all of the other \nstate sponsors of terrorism.\n  Yet arguably--maybe with the exception of Iran--it may be one of the \nmost egregious violators of international law, one of the worst in \nterms of sponsoring terrorism, and one of the most disruptive to peace \nin the Middle East and the Palestinian-Israeli peace process.\n  In addition, even since we introduced this legislation last year, we \nhave seen Syria's horrendous actions with respect to the support for \nSaddam Hussein and his regime during the recent operation in Iraq. So \nthere are even additional reasons for Syria to be held accountable for \ntheir actions, which are against the security interests of the United \nStates of America.\n  We had Under Secretary Bolton just recently over at the Department of \nState talking about how Syria has a stockpile of nerve agent, sarin \ngas, and is trying to conduct research and development on nerve toxins \nlike VX. So not only are they a sponsor of terrorism, disruptive to the \nMiddle East process--and one thing I did not mention, which is as \negregious as any, is their occupation and manipulation of the country \nof Lebanon. So they are, in a sense, occupying with a puppet government \nwhere they have terrorist camps which provide great disruption in the \nregion. They are developers of weapons of mass destruction. They aided \na country that we were at war with, at the time we were at war with \nthem. They are an underminer of the peace process. The list can go on \nand on and on.\n  There are very few countries that you can say as many negative things \nabout as far as their impact on the world stage as the country of \nSyria. Yet this country treats Syria better than all of the other \nterrorist states that we have listed. I find that to be very troubling. \nSenator Boxer and I have introduced a piece of legislation which just \nwants the United States to treat Syria the way we treat all the other \nrogue nations in the world--no worse but certainly no better, given \ntheir record of disruption and instability in that region and their \nthreat to the national security of this country.\n  This legislation would require the President to prohibit the export \nto Syria of any items on the U.S. munitions list or any item on the \ncommerce control list. In addition, under the Boxer-Santorum amendment, \nthe President would be required to impose two or more of a menu of five \nother sanctions, including a ban on all exports to Syria, except food \nand medicine; a ban on U.S. businesses operating or investing in Syria; \na reduction of diplomatic contacts with Syria; restrictions on travel \nby Syrian diplomats in the United States; and the blocking of all \ntransactions in Syrian property. It does provide, as all these kinds of \nlegislation provide, the President's ability to waive sanctions if he \ndetermines that waiving is in the national security interests of the \nUnited States.\n\n  So I believe this is a vitally important measure for the U.S. \nCongress and our country, to go on record and say Syria--maybe one of \nthe worst offenders and most destabilizing countries not just in the \nregion but in the world--should be treated no better--not worse than \nbut no better--than other state sponsors of terrorism.\n\n[[Page S9180]]\n\n  Senator Boxer and I talked to the chairman and ranking member about \nthis legislation. We had a very good discussion yesterday about it. The \nchairman, who I see is in the Chamber, assured us this was of great \ninterest to him, and he understands the concern of Senator Boxer and \nmyself and the other cosponsors about this issue. If the chairman would \nlike to make a comment, I think we have come to some sort of agreement \nas to how we might handle this situation.\n  I yield to the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Let me respond to the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania by saying, we will have a hearing on Syria in the Foreign \nRelations Committee. We take the issue seriously, as the Senator does, \nand Senator Boxer, who is a member of our committee. We look forward to \nthat hearing.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the chairman for his assurance that the issue \nof Syria and the Syrian Accountability Act will be taken seriously by \nthe committee. We hope, as a result of that, we can move forward with \nsome productive legislation in the Senate to give our country a \nstronger hand in dealing with terrorism in the Middle East.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1170\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time remains under the agreement \nbefore the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time does the other side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Grassley has 5 minutes, Senator \nNickles has 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would ask the Senator from Oklahoma if \nhe intends to use all his time.\n  Mr. President, I know many Senators are waiting to vote. I will just \nmake a few more comments. I know Senator Nickles intends to raise a \nbudget point of order.\n  Let me say in response to the comments made in opposition to the \nMurray amendment that we will be voting on shortly, that we on this \nside, Democrats, have brought this issue up time and again.\n  That is because our economy is struggling. That is because we have \nfamilies at home who have been laid off, who have run out of \nunemployment insurance. We would love to have a debate on how to \nincrease jobs. Democrats believe investing in transportation that \nprovides infrastructure and new jobs is critical. Democrats believe \ninvesting in education, getting our economy going again is an important \nway to provide jobs for people. And there are other investments we \nbelieve would be helpful in providing jobs. We have not had the \ndebates. We have been thwarted at every turn.\n  As a result, we have people at home who have been laid off. In the \nlast 5 consecutive months we have lost jobs. We cannot continue to \nignore those people at home who are out of work, who have run out of \nunemployment insurance, who cannot pay their mortgage, put food on the \ntable, are becoming even more of a drag on our economy because they \ncan't contribute back. We believe by extending unemployment benefits we \nwill at least help them in the temporary.\n  We welcome a debate on getting jobs and the economy going again. We \nhave been waiting for that discussion. We have had time to have a tax \ncut debate. We have seen that has not produced the kinds of jobs we \nneed. In fact, 3.5 million Americans have lost their jobs since this \nPresident took office. We want to have a jobs program. But at this \npoint that has not occurred.\n  What we now have is more than 1 million Americans who have run out of \ntheir unemployment insurance. The time is right. We hear this violates \nthe Budget Act. I welcome my colleagues to go home and say to a young \nfamily whose father or mother has lost their job, who are struggling \nevery single day with tears in their eyes, that this violates the \nBudget Act or this is not the right time or the right bill. We can do \nthis, and we can do it now.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I tell our colleagues on the other side as long as this economy \nstruggles, as long as people are losing unemployment insurance \nbenefits, we are going to continue to bring this issue back to the \nfloor. We would like to have a jobs program. We would like to see jobs \nincreased. We want to have the debate. Right now we need to deal with \nthe immediate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Cantwell and Dayton be listed \nas cosponsors of the Murray amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am willing to yield back the remainder \nof my time, if all sides are, and proceed to the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I raise a budget point of order against the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray. It increases \nmandatory spending and, if adopted, would cause an increase in the \ndeficit in excess of the level permitted in the most recently adopted \nbudget resolution. Therefore, I raise a point of order against the \namendment pursuant to section 505 of House Concurrent Resolution 95, \nthe Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for fiscal year 2004.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for purposes of the pending amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the vote on the Reid amendment No. 1164, followed by a vote \nin relation to the Murray amendment No. 1170, with 2 minutes equally \ndivided in the usual form prior to each of the votes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1164\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, since 9/11 we have had to refocus on the \nissue of national security. The amendment before the Senate deals with \nour national security in a very direct way. This amendment deals \ndirectly with our neighbor with whom we share a 2,000-mile border, \nMexico. This amendment would help the poorest of the poor in rural \nMexico. The four components of the amendment are, No. 1, it would \nestablish a microcredit lending program; No. 2, it would establish \nprograms to assist rural Mexican small businesses; No. 3, it would \nassist small rural farmers; No. 4, it would establish a system of \nprivate property ownership. This is not a typical aid package, not a \nhandout, but a commitment to a free market society to spur economic \ndevelopment. This is $1 for every Mexican. It doesn't sound like too \nmuch to me. Mexico is our friend, our neighbor. They deserve our \nsupport. Anyone who votes against this amendment should never ever \nagain complain about illegal immigration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I oppose the Reid amendment. I ask Members \nto vote no. I do so mindful of the fact that Mexico is our friend and \nthat we are going to have $67.5 million of foreign assistance in the \nbudget as we now have it that may be of assistance to our friends. The \nideas presented by the distinguished Senator from Nevada are good ones, \nbut they are ones that I believe require further discussion either in \ncommittee or on the floor. Clearly, $100 million, which is the request \nfor authorization in his amendment, is well outside the budget we have \nadopted. That $100 million must be subtracted from some other part of \nState Department foreign assistance at some other point. The Senator \nhas made the point the appropriators might very well do that. Indeed, \nthey might. But I believe it is irresponsible to push that \nresponsibility onward knowing the $100 million is not there, is not a \npart of the parameters of our foreign assistance. Therefore, I ask \nSenators to oppose the Reid amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Irresponsibility is not helping our neighbor.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to Amendment No. 1164. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n\n[[Page S9181]]\n\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the \nSenator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman), and the Senator from Georgia \n(Mr. Miller) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Are there any \nother Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 54, nays 43, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 268 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--54\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--43\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Dole\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Graham (FL)\n     Lieberman\n     Miller\n  The amendment (No. 1164) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1170\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Is the order now to have a rollcall vote on the Murray \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, 2 minutes equally divided on \nthe Murray amendment, followed by a vote.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield to Senator Nickles.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the bill we are trying to amend is the \nState Department authorization bill. The amendment Senator Murray has \noffered is an unemployment compensation amendment. One that, I might \nadd, we have not marked up or had a hearing on in the Finance \nCommittee. I might also add, one that we have already voted on four \ntimes this year. We have defeated it every time.\n  In May, we passed an unemployment compensation extension that costs \nabout $7 billion. We continued the current program. It lasts through \nthe end of the year. Senator Murray's amendment wants to double the \nprogram from 13 weeks of Federal temporary assistance to 26 weeks. Her \nState already gets 65 weeks of combined State and Federal benefits, and \nhas maximum benefits of about $500 per week.\n  There is a budget point of order because it breaks the budget and \nspends billions of dollars. I made that budget point of order and I \nurge my colleagues not to waive the budget point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, 30,000 jobs were lost in the month of \nJune alone. We have lost jobs in the last 5 consecutive months. A \nmillion people have now lost additional compensation under UI. This \namendment is extremely important.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we passed an extended unemployment in May \nbut that was to only take care of the recently unemployed. The Murray \namendment will take care of 1.1 million Americans who were fully \nemployed 2 years ago. Every one of them was employed. Every one of them \nwas working. They want to work. Now they are completely cut off by the \nabbreviated amendment we passed last spring.\n  We ought to provide the $2 billion included in the unemployment \ncompensation fund. That fund has $20 billion. This will only use $2.5 \nbillion. These workers have paid into it; they are entitled to it; they \nneed it; and they ought to be provided for. That is what the amendment \ndoes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON FUNDING FOR COMBATTING AIDS \n                   GLOBALLY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) With the President's support, Congress overwhelmingly \n     and expeditiously approved the United States Leadership \n     Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 \n     (Public Law 108-25; 22 U.S.C. 7601 et seq.), indicating the \n     gravity with which Congress considers the pandemic of HIV and \n     AIDS infection.\n       (2) The Act, which was supported and signed into law by the \n     President, authorized the appropriation of a total \n     $15,000,000,000 for fiscal years 2004 through 2008. \n     Specifically, the Act authorized $3,000,000,000 to be \n     appropriated in fiscal year 2004 for HIV/AIDS and related \n     programs, of which up to $1,000,000,000 was authorized to be \n     made available for the United States contributions to the \n     Global Fund.\n       (3) In contrast to the amounts authorized to be \n     appropriated in the Act, the President's budget for fiscal \n     year 2004, includes only $1,900,000,000 for HIV/AIDS and \n     related programs, of which only $200,000,000 is for the \n     United States contribution to the Global Fund.\n       (4) Approximately 5,000 people contract HIV each day.\n       (5) In Africa, more than 17,000,000 people have died from \n     AIDS, another 28,000,000 are infected with HIV, including \n     1,500,000 infected children, and 11,000,000 children have \n     been orphaned by AIDS.\n       (6) The United Nations Development Programme Annual Report \n     for 2003 states, ``HIV/AIDS is a catastrophe for economic \n     stability [and] may be the world's most serious development \n     crisis.''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     Congress, when considering appropriations Acts for fiscal \n     year 2004, should fully appropriate all the amounts \n     authorized for appropriation in the Act, even to the extent \n     that appropriating such amounts will require Congress to \n     appropriate amounts over and above the funding levels \n     contained in the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for \n     Fiscal Year 2004 (H. Con. Res. 95, 108th Congress, 1st \n     session).\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Act.--The term ``Act'' means the United States \n     Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of \n     2003 (Public Law 108-25; 22 U.S.C. 7601 et seq.).\n       (2) Global fund.--The term ``Global Fund'' means the \n     public-private partnership known as the Global Fund to Fight \n     AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria established pursuant to \n     Article 80 of the Swiss Civil Code.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment I am offering on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Daschle, Senator Leahy, Senator Durbin, \nSenator Lautenberg, Senator Feinstein, Senator Harkin, Senator Clinton, \nand Senator Corzine.\n  This year in his State of the Union Address, President Bush announced \na new global AIDS initiative which would provide $15 billion in U.S. \nfunding over the next 5 years. Unfortunately, when the time came for \nthe President to submit his budget and to stand behind that commitment \nto $15 billion, the budget did not reflect that commitment.\n  In the fiscal year 2004 budget request, the President asked Congress \nto appropriate at least $1 billion less than what he had spoken of in \nthis new initiative. Rather than requesting that Congress appropriate \n$3 billion for these issues, the President effectively said in his \nbudget that less funding was good enough this year.\n  This chart points out, in the bottom line, the President's budget \nrequest. As you can see, it is a total of $1.9 billion for the next \nfiscal year. The other line on this chart is the level at which we have \nauthorized funding, which is consistent with what the President asked \nfor in his State of the Union speech.\n  Using the most liberal of calculations, the President's budget asks \nfor $1.9 billion for this AIDS effort. This includes $200 million \npledged to the global fund in fiscal year 2004.\n  What makes this reduction even more difficult to swallow is that at \nthe same time we were asking for less than we promised as a nation with \nregard to AIDS funding, we also saw in the budget of the administration \nrequests for reductions in funding for critical global health issues in \nother areas as well.\n  I am very proud to say that this May, the Congress chose to realize \nthe President's original vision when it authorized, over the next 5 \nyears, the $15 billion the President asked for in his State of the \nUnion speech. This was legislated as the United States Leadership \nAgainst HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003.\n  Within this $3 billion, we provided that $1 billion could be directed \nto the global fund. So Congress did authorize what the President talked \nabout in his State of the Union speech.\n  The President is now, of course, in the midst of a tour through \nAfrica. He is meeting with the leaders of those countries. Many of \nthose countries have suffered from the ravages of these diseases. Of \ncourse, he is discussing, as he should, the fight against HIV/AIDS, \nagainst tuberculosis, against malaria.\n  The morning news report that I saw in the New York Times I think sums \nit up well. It has quotations. The President said yesterday in \nBotswana:\n\n       The people of this nation have the courage and resolve to \n     defeat this disease and you will have a partner in the United \n     States of America.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       This is the deadliest enemy Africa has ever faced, and you \n     will not face this enemy alone.\n\n  There is another article I have from the New York Times that speaks \nof the President's trip to South Africa yesterday. It indicates the \nfollowing: He talked about his AIDS proposal. He did not mention that a \nHouse subcommittee is likely to cut funds for the first year of the $15 \nbillion 5-year program below the $3 billion sought by legislation that \nMr. Bush signed this spring. The program would provide help to 14 \ncountries. Twelve of those countries are in Africa.\n  The question for us in the Congress is whether we will vote now to \nfully realize the President's stated intentions or will we succumb to \npolitical expediency and essentially go along with taking credit for a \n$15 billion commitment while in fact doing substantially less than \nthat. I believe a promise made should be a promise that is kept.\n  The amendment I am offering today, along with Senator Leahy and \nSenator\n\n[[Page S9183]]\n\nDaschle, simply states that we will appropriate the amounts Congress \nand the President have pledged to commit to these programs, and that we \nwill do so without reducing our funding commitments to other important \nglobal health programs.\n  The urgency behind our promise is borne out in a report that was \nreleased this week in which the United Nations finds that the greatest \nimpediment to development in poor countries around the world today is \nHIV/AIDS.\n  In 1990, 10 million people were infected with HIV. Today, in 2003, \nthere are 42 million people who are infected with HIV. To date, this \ndisease has killed 25 million people. It has created over 14 million \norphans. In the next 10 years, it is estimated that a full 25 percent \nof sub-Saharan Africans could die from HIV/AIDS.\n  Most of the victims of HIV/AIDS are children and young adults. It is \na disease that cuts lives short before they ever reach their full \npotential. Because of this, it creates a generational vacuum in \ncountries where it is most prevalent. The President today is in \nBotswana. That is the country with the highest rate of HIV/AIDS of any \ncountry in the world. So this generational vacuum I referred to means \nthere will not be leaders for tomorrow. It means the ideas and energy \nthat youth carries with it will not have an opportunity to express \nthemselves as cultural, societal, and governmental forces. It means the \ndevelopment of nations is seriously jeopardized and the doors of \nopportunity for fanaticism and terrorism are thrown wide open.\n\n  In 1998, Zambia lost 1,300 teachers to HIV/AIDS. In a country that is \nable to train only 1,900 teachers in a full year, it is not hard to \nimagine the depth of the devastation that is being created.\n  To date, over 17 million Africans have died from AIDS and another 28 \nmillion are infected with HIV. This includes 1.5 million children who \nare infected with HIV. Experts estimate that in less than 25 years, \nthere will be 110 million cases of HIV/AIDS in India, 70 million in \nChina, 13 million in Russia. The magnitude of the health resources that \nwill be required in these countries is mind-boggling.\n  Looking beyond the health service demands of these diseases, it \nbecomes apparent that domestic productivity, the continued growth and \ndevelopment of these nations, will be significantly impaired.\n  I could go on at length about the extent of the problem we face. I \nthink all of us in the Senate have become aware that this is a serious \nissue. By providing the promised $3 billion each year, in an effort to \nfight HIV/AIDS and TB and malaria, we would prevent a minimum of 2.3 \nmillion additional people from contracting the HIV virus. I say that is \na minimum because by fully funding our promise, we can leverage more \nresources from the other countries as well.\n  The question we are faced with is whether Congress is going to step \nup and do what it has promised to do. It is not enough to say some year \nin the future we will get around to doing this. We have authorized $3 \nbillion per year. We should appropriate $3 billion per year.\n  Our amendment answers that question and makes it clear that the \nCongress is committed to keeping its promise and this Nation's promise \nin this regard. It also makes clear we are committed to doing that not \nat the expense of other global health programs. The funding cuts in the \nPresident's budget seem to rest on an underlying assumption that \nbecause we are going to up the ante for funding HIV/AIDS, TB, and \nmalaria, we do not need to do as much in the areas of poverty and \ndisease and malnutrition and development of democracy abroad in other \nrespects. The reality is, the confluence and the interaction of these \nfactors in Third World nations contradict that assumption.\n  By choosing to focus intensely on one of these issues, we are not \nthen free to ignore others. The effective model for helping nations \nthat are less wealthy than ours requires an appreciation of the \ninterdependence of the issues of poverty, disease, early mortality, \nfamine, and poor education.\n  I do not believe that in order to fund efforts directed against HIV/\nAIDS and TB and malaria, other efforts to help these countries should \nsuffer. Unfortunately, in the President's budget, other essential \ninternational programs are cut anywhere from 5 percent to 63 percent. \nPrograms that help vulnerable children, children who are blind, who \nsuffer mental disabilities, who have physical disabilities, those are \ncut 63 percent in that budget request. Immunizations, therapeutic and \nsurveillance programs for infectious diseases are proposed for cuts of \n32 percent. Child survival and maternity programs will be cut by 12 \npercent. So we need to address this issue.\n  The amendment I have sent to the desk is a sense of the Congress, but \nit is one that will make it clear to the rest of the world, as well as \nto all who are concerned about this issue, that we will make good on \nthis promise. The Congress needs to choose between this funding and \nother items. The Congress needs to make a decision. The amendment we \nare offering today simply states that we are committed to putting the \nmoney behind our promises when it comes to fighting HIV/AIDS. We will \nprovide the funds we promised. We will do so without cutting funding to \nother vitally important health needs.\n  Let me just read the very short ``resolved'' sentence out of this \namendment I am offering. It says:\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that Congress, when considering \n     appropriations Acts for fiscal year 2004, should fully \n     appropriate all the amounts authorized for appropriation in \n     the Act. . . .\n\n  That refers, of course, to the United States Leadership Against HIV/\nAIDS Act.\n\n       [We] should fully appropriate all the amounts authorized \n     for appropriation in the Act, even to the extent that \n     appropriating such amounts will require Congress to \n     appropriate amounts over and above the funding levels \n     contained in the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget. . . .\n\n  In my view, this is a statement that needs to be made, particularly \nthis week as the President is traveling on the continent of Africa. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in helping to ensure that our commitment \nto fight HIV/AIDS is made a reality.\n  I yield up to 10 minutes to my colleague and a person who has been a \nvery strong leader on this issue, Senator Leahy from Vermont.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield briefly for an inquiry?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from New Mexico yielded me up to 10 minutes. I \ndon't think I will take quite that long.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). There are a total of 26\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that upon the conclusion of the \nremarks by Mr. Leahy I be recognized out of order, without the time \nbeing charged against either side, on another matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For how much time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Not to exceed 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from New Mexico. I \ncommend him for his amendment. What the Senator from New Mexico has \npointed out is the reality behind the rhetoric; perhaps, to some \nextent, the honesty behind the headlines.\n  Like so many others, I have read with interest and a little \nfrustration the press articles, the letters to the editor, the other \nexpressions of view by various people about how Congress needs to \n``step up to the plate'' and fund the President's global HIV/AIDS \ninitiative. Of course, we should fund it. This is far more than a \nPresidential initiative. It is the culmination of years of work by \nMembers of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, and the White \nHouse and many private groups to significantly increase funding to \ncombat the spread of AIDS.\n  When I talk about the reality behind the rhetoric and the honesty \nbehind the headlines, I recall how right up until the end of last year \nthe White House was actively opposing efforts by Senators, particularly \nSenator Durbin, to provide emergency funding for this purpose. In fact, \nthe White House refused many times to declare AIDS an emergency.\n  This January in his State of the Union Address the President \nannounced a 5-year, $15 billion global AIDS initiative. The President \nreceived a lot of praise for that announcement. He should have. In \nfact, I\n\n[[Page S9184]]\n\nam one of those who did praise him for it. And he deserves credit for \nspeaking out more than any previous President about the need to combat \nAIDS. I commend him for going to Africa, and for calling for greater \nefforts to fight AIDS, which has ravaged those countries.\n  But whether he intended it or not, the President's State of the Union \nannouncement created the expectation that the administration would \nprovide $3 billion toward this initiative in 2004, a reasonable \nexpectation when you consider that there are 15,000 new HIV infections \nevery single day. In 40 days, that is an amount equal to the entire \npopulation of my own State of Vermont.\n  The United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and \nMalaria Act of 2003, which passed last month--and we all recall, with \nvery strong support from the President--reinforced this expectation \nbecause it authorized up to $3 billion for these programs in 2004.\n  I support that funding. In fact, while it represents a significant \nincrease over the current level of funding, it is way short of what a \ncountry as wealthy as ours, the wealthiest Nation in history, should be \nspending to fight the worst public health crisis that history has ever \nknown. But let's look at what has happened since then.\n  After the headlines were over, after the meetings at the White House \nwere over, after all the photo ops were over, the President did not \ninclude $3 billion to fight AIDS in his 2004 budget. He provided $2 \nbillion, not $3 billion.\n  In fact, depending upon who you ask in the administration, it is not \neven $2 billion. It is somewhere between $1.65 and $2 billion.\n  Let's assume it is the full $2 billion. That is $1 billion less than \nwhat he promised. And then when the Republicans in the House \nAppropriations Committee met, they provided in their allocation for \nforeign assistance, which includes funding to fight AIDS, an amount \nwhich cut the President's $18.8 billion foreign assistance budget by \n$1.8 billion. The Senate cut it by $800 million.\n  So what happened is, the President underfunded his own AIDS \ninitiative by one-third when he actually sent his proposal to the \nCongress, and then the Republican-controlled Congress cut his budget \neven more. So now we are faced with the impossible task of finding $3 \nbillion in a total budget that is considerably less than the \nPresident's budget which was already too little.\n  I am growing weary of hearing in the press: Now it is up to the \nDemocrats to find the $3 billion to back up the President's promise. \nFirst off, it was not his initiative. It was a joint initiative of \nmany. Secondly, he didn't include the money in his budget. And even \nwith the amount of money that he did include in his budget, the Members \nof his own party cut it even deeper. Actually, if the Members of the \nPresident's party agree with the promise he and they made, they ought \nto be offering this amendment themselves, at least vote for this \namendment.\n  The amendment says we want the President's promise to be fulfilled \nbecause if the Members of the President's party don't vote for this, \nwhat they will have done, as so often happens here, is pass a big \nauthorization bill, pat themselves on the back, have the photo ops, \naccept the praise about finally getting serious about fighting AIDS and \nthen, when the cameras have gone home and it comes time to appropriate \nthe money, they say no.\n  Let's find the $3 billion. One easy way would be for the President to \nsend up a budget amendment that actually asks for the amount of money \nthat he promised. And then the Congress needs to declare AIDS an \nemergency, which we all agree it is, and appropriate the additional $1 \nbillion.\n  I commend the Senator from New Mexico for his amendment.\n  And I take the President at his word, that he does feel strongly \nabout the AIDS crisis and that he intends to do something about it. But \nwords won't prevent AIDS. Words will not provide treatment to those \nsuffering from it. Words are not enough to fight the worst epidemic in \nrecorded history. It is going to require money, too.\n  The President has said the right things but now it is sort of like \n``the check is in the mail.'' He has to write the check and he has to \ntell members of his own party who have voted for the President's \nbudget, which actually cuts his promise substantially: Look guys, I \nmade this promise; we have to stand up and vote for it. I think he \nwould be doing a very good thing if he did. We are not going to cure \nAIDS overnight. We are not going to stop every new case. But we know \nhow to slow it considerably.\n  We are going to see civil strife and conflict especially in Africa, \nand calls for the United States to send troops. And when you look to \nthe root causes, it will be AIDS that is part of the problem.\n  We have been blessed in this Nation with the most wealth of any \npeople in history. We should ask ourselves: Don't we have a moral \nresponsibility to do everything we can to help those who are less \nblessed?\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of Senator Bingaman's time and \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is recognized for up to 25 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on August 22, 1920, an article written by \nformer LTC Thomas Edward Lawrence appeared in one of the great \nnewspapers of London, the Sunday Times. This legendary British military \nofficer--better known as Lawrence of Arabia--began his commentary with \na sharp warning about his country's occupation of ancient lands in the \nMiddle East:\n\n       The people of England have been led in Mesopotamia into a \n     trap from which it will be hard to escape with dignity and \n     honor. They have been tricked into it by a steady withholding \n     of information. The Baghdad communiques are belated, \n     insincere, incomplete. Things have been far worse than we \n     have been told, our administration more bloody and \n     inefficient than the public knows. It is a disgrace to our \n     imperial record, and may soon be too inflamed for any \n     ordinary cure. We are today not far from a disaster.\n\n  Colonel Lawrence concluded with an equally sharp question:\n\n       How long will we permit millions of pounds, thousands of \n     Imperial troops, and tens of thousands of Arabs to be \n     sacrificed on behalf of colonial administration which can \n     benefit nobody but its administrators?\n\n  Mr. President, it seems that history does have a way of repeating \nitself. These were the observations some 83 years ago of a British \nsoldier who had studied the history of the Middle East, fought \nalongside Arabs in the Great War, and understood the anger of those who \nlived under the administration of a distant power. How prescient were \nthose words--then and now.\n\n  His observations, which might have been considered academic in the \nmonths before U.S. and British troops began their recent advance into \nIraq, now appear, as I say, prescient. As violence in the streets of \nBaghdad increases, as our troops are being killed and wounded by \nguerrilla attacks, as progress toward creating a new Iraqi Government \nstagnates, the American public is only just now beginning to come to \ngrips with the enormity of the task that we have before us in Iraq.\n  A clear picture had never been painted for the American public by the \n``powers that be.'' Oh, we heard rosy scenarios about instant liberty \nand flowers to the troops. The Vice President talked about flowers that \nwould be bestowed upon our troops by those people in Iraq who would be \nliberated by us, the liberators. That was the talk of the day.\n  But now reality has emerged and it is harsh. And seeing the \nenormity--the enormity, I say--of the task before us and the increasing \ndangers to the loved ones who serve in uniform, the American people out \nthere who are watching this Senate forum are beginning to ask, How long \nmust our troops remain in those distant hot sands? How long? They are \nasking that in the mail I receive from the people back home. How long \nmust they patrol the dangerous streets of Najaf and Fallujah? When will \nour troops be coming home?\n  Weeks ago, the President gave vague assurances about the timely \nwithdrawal of our troops. He said:\n\n       We will stay as long as necessary to get the job done, and \n     then we will leave.\n\n  Those were his remarks at Santa Clara, CA, on May 2 of this year. But \nI say, Mr. President, such words are without substance; they are \n``doublespeak.'' They do nothing but feed the hopes of the American \npeople, as well as the people of Iraq, that our troops will soon return \nfrom Iraq,\n\n[[Page S9185]]\n\nwhile avoiding any real indication of when that might happen.\n  The fact is, the Bush administration has carefully avoided telling \nthe American people when it expects our occupation of Iraq to conclude. \nSo far, this administration has yet to even estimate how soon it will \nbe able to hand over Iraq to the Iraqi people. In short, it appears \nthat we have no exit strategy, and we have had none from the beginning.\n  The word ``quagmire'' is starting to be used by the media. Clearly, \nmany people are very worried about our situation in Iraq. The death \ntoll keeps mounting.\n  Last week, the President actually taunted those forces who are \nmurdering our troops in the streets of Iraq. He dared the violent \nmilitants by saying: ``Bring 'em on.'' One can hardly think of a more \ninappropriate comment for a President to make when Americans are under \nsiege in Iraq and being asked to deal with the treacheries of urban \nguerrilla warfare with no end in sight. Chest thumping should have no \nplace in such a situation.\n  This was the same President who went to the trouble to put on a \nflight suit, land on an aircraft carrier, and with great fanfare tell \nthe American people that major combat operations in Iraq have ended, \nwhile overhead there was a banner stream which said: ``Mission \naccomplished.'' But British and American soldiers are still dying in \nIraq. Now the President is saying: ``Bring 'em on.'' What are we to \nbelieve?\n  The President has backed away from earlier suggestions of a \nforeseeable end to U.S. peacekeeping efforts in Iraq. He warns of the \nreturn of tyranny if our troops begin returning home.\n  Judging by the President's statements, our armed forces have become \nthe thumb in the dike--the only obstacle that prevents the return of a \nrepressive dictatorship in Iraq.\n  How did it come to this? Members of Congress were told that our \nforces would be greeted as liberators. We will be going in not as \noccupiers but as liberators. Iraqi citizens were supposed to eagerly \nembrace democracy and serve up Saddam Hussein on a silver platter the \nmoment they sipped from the cup of freedom. We should have known that \nthe burden of democratizing Iraq would be no easy task. The \nAdministration should have been more forthcoming about the difficulty \nof that task, about the time it would take to execute it, and about the \ncost to the taxpayer.\n  To be sure, the Defense Department is now scrambling to scrape up as \nmany as 20,000 foreign troops to join our forces in occupying Iraq by \nthe end of September. I applaud these efforts. But it would be folly to \nbelieve that a deployment of 10,000, 20,000, or even 30,000 foreign \ntroops would significantly reduce the dangers to the scores of \nthousands of Americans who are now in Iraq.\n  The failure of this Administration to adequately plan for postwar \nIraq has become painfully evident. Before the war, I said: Where is the \nplan? What is the plan? At yesterday's Armed Services Committee \nhearing, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said he did not know if \nthe United States had made any formal request for assistance from NATO \nor the United Nations since the beginning of the war in Iraq. The \ndeployment of experienced peacekeepers from our friends and allies \nwould go a long way to relieving the strain on our troops. And, Mr. \nPresident, it is simply shocking that our Secretary of Defense would be \nunaware of efforts by the administration, if there are any, to make a \nformal request to NATO and the United Nations to provide these troops.\n  The tragic failure of the Administration's efforts to build \ninternational support before launching its impatient rush towards war \nagainst Iraq is now bearing its bitter, bitter fruit.\n  The Secretary of Defense tells the Senate Armed Services Committee to \nbe patient. Well, the administration was not all that patient before \nlaunching its rush toward war against Iraq.\n  The difficulty in finding just 20,000 peacekeepers to patrol Iraq is \nevidence that White House efforts to assemble 49 nations into a \n``coalition of the willing'' was merely an exercise in rhetoric, meant \nto cover the lack of significant military or financial contributions \nfrom dozens of nations, save for those of Britain, Australia, and \nPoland.\n  Has the lack of a plan for postwar Iraq needlessly cost American \nlives? If we had not been so convinced that Iraqis would greet our \narmies with flowers and smiles, could we have better anticipated the \nchaos and lawlessness that broke out in the days after the war?\n  If we had not been so cocksure about our ability to neatly decapitate \nthe leadership of the Iraqi regime, could we have fashioned a better \nplan to deal with the collapse of civil order as our tanks rolled into \nBaghdad?\n  Perhaps this White House should have listened to the advice of some \nsenior military leaders who foresaw the need for several hundred \nthousand troops to stabilize postwar Iraq. Perhaps it should have \ncontemplated the consequences of a Saddam Hussein driven into hiding \nbut still potent and dangerous. Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.\n  The Administration appears quite ready now to dedicate our military \nto a long-term occupation of Iraq. War-weary soldiers will continue to \npatrol the areas around Baghdad. The citizen-soldiers of the National \nGuard and the Reserves will be kept from returning to their homes, \ntheir jobs, and their families.\n  Senators, read your correspondence from back home. See what those \nfamilies of guardsmen are saying. Read your letters. You are receiving \nthem. My office is not unique in that respect.\n  The citizen-soldiers of the National Guard and the Reserves will be \nkept from returning to their homes, their jobs, and their families. \nThousands of American families will continue to worry about the fate of \ntheir loved ones.\n  Ah, the sleepless nights that are spent by mothers, by wives, by \nhusbands of guardsmen who have already been in Iraq for weeks and weeks \nand who are not told when they will be coming home but were told we \nwill be there for a long time. Think of the tears that are spilled by \nmothers and wives and children for the husbands, the sons, the fathers \nwho are away and who are not told when they will be coming home.\n  And in spite of the heavy commitment that this Administration has \nmade to the most ambitious policy of nation-building in more than half \na century, it appears to be on the verge of sending unknown numbers of \nU.S. troops to yet another peacekeeping mission in Liberia.\n  In my home state, there is a growing sense of disenchantment with \nthese foreign adventures. Every day, more letters come to my office \nfrom West Virginians asking when their family members will be coming \nhome. How long will it be? How long must we wait? When will they be \ncoming home? My letters contain details about National Guard and Army \nReserve units with unclear missions and open-ended deployments. I have \nreceived word that some units are without mail service--we are not told \nthat by this administration--others must wait weeks between phone calls \nhome to their families. One unit had to ration water to just 20 ounces \nper day because of supply shortages. I suspect that other Senators are \nexperiencing a similar phenomenon in the content of their mail from \nfamilies of the Guard and Reserve.\n\n  These part-time soldiers are proud to serve in our nation's military, \nbut they know that they are also full-time members of their \ncommunities. Our nation's reservists have important duties in their \ncivilian lives, serving their cities and towns as police officers, \nbusiness men and women, doctors, teachers, and laborers. Members of the \nGuard and Reserves proudly joined to serve their country in times of \ncrisis, and they have demonstrated that pride and done well, but not to \nbe a permanent constabulary force in the Middle East. Nobody told them \nthat.\n  Our brave and professional fighting men and women are awesome on the \nbattlefield, but they must not be expected to carry out the role of \npeacekeepers or nation-builders in an open-ended mission, whether it \ntake place in Lebanon, Somalia, Bosnia, Afghanistan, Liberia, or Iraq. \nOur American soldiers are not Iraqi bureaucrats. Our Armed Forces are \ntrained to win wars, not run countries. Putting our men and women in \nsuch an untenable situation is a misuse of our military and a \ndisservice to our military personnel.\n\n[[Page S9186]]\n\n  This Administration should think hard about whether we have the \nmanpower--do we?--to sustain a large commitment of troops in Iraq for \nthe long term. They better think about it. We currently have overseas \ncommitments in South Korea, Japan, the Balkans, and Afghanistan. I have \nheard we have our military forces spread so thinly around the world, in \n136 countries, I recently saw. Keeping tens or hundred of thousands of \ntroops in Iraq for as many as ten years may demand more troops than our \nvoluntary armed forces can muster. Think about it.\n  This Administration should think hard about whether we have the money \nto single-handedly pay for the occupation and reconstruction of Iraq. \nThe Department of Defense has reported that we are spending $3.9 \nbillion each month to occupy Iraq. That is a billion dollars a week. \nHow much is a billion dollars? A billion dollars is $1 for every minute \nthat has passed since Jesus Christ turned the water into wine in the \ncity of Caanan.\n  So the Department of Defense has reported that we are spending $3.9 \nbillion a week. They had not said that until yesterday. Pulling that \ninformation from the Secretary of Defense was like pulling teeth. It \nwas hard to do.\n  How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute and thirty-eight seconds.\n  That is in addition to the $950 million we are spending each month \nfor our mission in Afghanistan. At a time when the United States is \nrunning record-breaking deficits of $400 billion each year, the \nAdministration has not even included these $58 billion in occupation \ncosts in its budget. In sharp contrast to the 1991 Persian Gulf war, \nwhere our allies contributed $54 billion of the $61 billion cost of \nthat war, the American taxpayer is virtually alone in bearing the \nburden for the staggering cost of this most recent war with Iraq.\n  Americans have good cause to be proud of the men and women who \nunselfishly serve our country in uniform. They have carried out their \nduty in Iraq admirably. But what is the next step? The last thing we \nwant to do is repay the services our troops have given to our country \nby committing them indefinitely to a fuzzy reconstruction mission of \nuncertain duration.\n  Iraq is fast becoming an urban guerilla shooting gallery with U.S. \ntroops as the targets. It is time to go to the United Nations and work \nto deploy a trained multinational peacekeeping force to cope with the \nperils of the occupation of Iraq. Before there is a disaster to cope \nwith, before there is a major loss of life, before there is a crisis, \nwe must read the tea leaves.\n  This White House cannot further presume on the patience of the \npublic. The American people must be given an exit strategy for our \ntroops. We must ask the international community for help in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from West Virginia yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. My time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time to yield to the \nSenator from Illinois for whatever question he may want to ask of the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Democratic leader for the time.\n  I rise for a brief moment in tribute to my colleague from West \nVirginia. Over the last 6, 8, or 10 months, the United States has been \nmaking critical and historic foreign policy decisions which have \nreversed values and traditions that have guided this country for \ndecades. One Senator has come to this floor time and time again to turn \nthat bright, glaring light on America that is our responsibility to do, \nand the Senator from West Virginia has done it again today. I thank him \nfor being that voice time and again in the Senate, and I hope that many \nof us will join in this chorus to accept our congressional \nresponsibility to the people we represent, to stand up and ask the hard \nquestions that Congress must ask of every President, regardless of \nparty, particularly at a moment in time when over 100,000 of our best \nand brightest in service to this country are risking their lives. My \ntribute and thanks to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, my thanks to the senior Senator from \nIllinois who has added his voice and his vote in support of his \nconscience on this matter.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use the remainder of my leader \ntime to make a couple of remarks with regard to the Bingaman amendment, \nbut I, too, want to join the Senator from Illinois in expressing our \ngratitude to the Senator from West Virginia for his outspokenness, his \ncandor, the strength and conviction with which he has once again \narticulated the views of so many of the people of this country, as well \nas the members of our caucus. I thank him once again for his \ncontribution.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished leader.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1174\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I express my strong support for the \namendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico. It is very \nstraightforward. It says as clearly and as succinctly as it can that \nthe United States must keep its promise when we consider the \nappropriations bill later this month, that we will fully fund the $3 \nbillion promised in the fight against global AIDS. That is all it says.\n\n  The Senator from New Mexico has laid it out very clearly. I applaud \nhim and thank him for his leadership and the compelling arguments that \nonce again he has articulated with regard to the urgency as well as the \nneed to do this as we consider the appropriations bill later on.\n  The President early this year laid out a very ambitious proposal. \nUnfortunately, for whatever reason, the President did not fund that \nproposal when he submitted his budget to the Congress. We are now \nresponsible to fill that hole, to address that vacuum, to make that \ncommitment. That is, in essence, what the Senator from New Mexico is \nsaying with this amendment. Let's acknowledge the commitment, let's \nacknowledge our determination at the appropriate time, in the \nappropriations bill, to send a clear message.\n  Why is it important now? It is important now because the focus of the \nworld media is on Africa. The President today is in Botswana. I \nhappened to be in Botswana last August. It is a beautiful country with \nremarkable natural beauty. They have a dedicated democratic government, \none of the most successful in all of Africa. It has the fastest growing \neconomy in the world over the last three decades.\n  However, if there is any hope of economic survival, if there is any \nchance this economy will continue to flourish, they must grapple \neffectively with a very serious matter. Forty percent of all Botswanans \ntoday are infected. Consider that 4 in 10 people in Botswana today have \nHIV. We opened an AIDS testing and counseling center when we were in \nBotswana. The townspeople turned out for that ceremony with a joy and \nexcitement that I had not expected in a country where 40 percent may \nhave that disease. They were joyful for one reason: They knew we could \nnow begin to address this incredible problem.\n  If we fully fund our promise, if we fully ensure that centers such as \nthe one we opened in Botswana last August can test, can treat, can \ncare, can provide the outreach, then indeed we will have fulfilled our \ncommitment. We will have recognized the critical nature of this crisis.\n  The world has never known a pandemic as brutal as this AIDS pandemic. \nBut the world has never known a country as strong and giving and caring \nas America. So this is our moment to prove that the commitments made in \nthe past are no less and no more than the commitment we make now to \naddress this pandemic in a meaningful way, to send a clear message to \nthe Botswana people Botswana who are listening today and who want to \nbelieve what they heard in the commitment given earlier this year is \none that will not erode, that will be there, not only with words but \nwith deeds, not only with promises but with resources.\n  That is what the Bingaman amendment does. That is why I rise so \nstrongly in support of it today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 16 minutes and \n20 seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Daschle, the leader, for \nhis strong support for this effort.\n\n[[Page S9187]]\n\n  I had the good fortune to be with him in Botswana last August and \nunderscore and emphasize the very points he made about the enormous \nneed that exists in that country and throughout the African continent.\n  I yield all but 2 minutes of the remaining time to my colleague from \nIllinois. I reserve 2 minutes to summarize at the end.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 14 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Perhaps I will not use all of the time and will yield \nback to the sponsor of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator for focusing the attention of the \nSenate on an issue of such moral gravity. As the President of the \nUnited States said in Africa yesterday, that continent has never been \nchallenged as greatly as it is challenged today by the AIDS epidemic. I \nmight add parenthetically, the world has never been challenged in a way \nwe are being challenged today by this world AIDS epidemic.\n  I sit on the Democratic side of the aisle and am proud of my party \nloyalty, but when I went to the State of the Union Address with \nPresident Bush just a few months ago and he said the United States of \nAmerica was going to lead the world with a $15 billion commitment over \n5 years to fight the global AIDS epidemic, this Democrat stood up and \napplauded as loudly as he could. And ever since, every opportunity I \nhave had, I have given this President credit for leading our Nation in \nthe right direction on the global AIDS epidemic.\n  I add, as well, I am happy this President has joined two of his \npredecessors in visiting sub-Saharan Africa. We have overlooked this \ncontinent far too long. There is great potential in sub-Saharan Africa, \na great potential for economic growth and a great potential for \nbuilding democracy, building a market economy.\n  But as President Bush has learned and everyone who visits Africa \nlearns, this whole continent is consumed with this epidemic. You can go \nto Africa looking for any issue you are interested in; I guarantee what \nyou will find is the AIDS epidemic. Whether you are interested in food, \nAIDS, or economic development, whether microcredit or education, your \nfirst concern will be the AIDS epidemic.\n\n  How can you teach children in school when school teachers are dying \nat an alarming rate? How do you keep up with the health care needs with \nso many AIDS orphans and so many infected people? What is the economic \nfuture of a country where you cannot predict what next month's \nworkforce will look like? All of these issues, whatever they may be, \nall point to the one central concern: Fighting and conquering this \nepidemic.\n  We applauded President Bush on both sides of the aisle for the $15 \nbillion over 5 years. What Senator Bingaman is doing today is saying to \nthe Senate, don't let the applause die down. Let's give the President a \nchorus of support, not just a chorus of applause. Let's make certain \nthose who did stand up and laud the President for his leadership will \nbe here doing our part.\n  It is inexcusable to say we can only spend $2 billion this year to \nfight the global AIDS epidemic. The United States can do more and must \ndo more. If we do not, more people will become infected, more people \nwill die, more AIDS orphans will populate the poor countries around the \nworld which means the challenges in the later years will be even more \nsubstantial.\n  How much money is needed at this point? Here is an estimate that has \nbeen given from the United Nations agency about the need to fight the \nglobal AIDS epidemic. If you look at the next fiscal year, 2004, $8 \nbillion is needed on a global basis. The United States AIDS spending is \nsubstantial but, unfortunately, it makes up only a small part of this \nglobal need. Frankly, when you look at what the President has proposed, \nif we could increase our spending to a $3 billion level it could make a \nsignificant difference.\n  This year about $4.7 billion will be spent worldwide fighting the \nglobal AIDS problem; $1.6 billion of international bilateral assistance \ncountry to country of which the United States puts up about $640 \nmillion; $1 billion in multilateral AIDS groups like the Global Fund, \nwhich I support; $1 billion by the governments of infected countries, \nand $1.1 billion by the families of those infected countries--about \n$4.7 billion. And the need is $8 billion.\n  What Senator Bingaman brings to the Senate today is an amendment \nasking the Senate to put the money where the promise has been made. The \nPresident has toured South Africa, Botswana, countries like Senegal. In \nvisiting these countries he has said the United States is committed to \n$15 billion. With the Bingaman amendment, we will make certain that \ncommitment is more than just passing rhetoric.\n\n  I say to my colleagues in the Senate who have had a chance to travel \noverseas and not visited Africa, if you want to be a convert on the \nurgency of this issue, visit Africa. Meet the people who are infected \ntoday and are trying, every single day, just to survive.\n  Go to Soweto Township in South Africa, as I did just a few months ago \nwith Senator Feingold of Wisconsin, and meet women who are infected \nwith HIV who have small children and will never be able to have access \nto antiretroviral therapy which could keep their lives stronger and \nlonger than otherwise would be the case. The best they could hope for \nis one nutritional meal a day, to give them strength to ward off \ninfection.\n  Come to the streets of South Africa. Come see in Cape Town the AIDS \norphans roaming those streets, AIDS orphans--I saw this with my own \neyes--who are sniffing glue, stealing, living on the streets. Their \nfamilies are gone. It is repeated over and over, thousands of times, \nmillions of times, in sub-Saharan Africa.\n  Come to Uganda and find those battling with the AIDS epidemic with \nvery little money but great resolve, preaching abstinence and fidelity \nand condoms if necessary to protect themselves. These are people \nwinning this battle every single day, waging the battle every single \nday, surviving for another day. But they need our help.\n  The richest nation on Earth should put $3 billion on the line this \nyear, this next year, as the President has promised--in 2004. By \nkeeping that promise, we will say to the world, we are not only trying \nto meet our moral obligation, we are urging you to do the same.\n  This money has a multiplier effect. Mr. President, $3 billion from \nthe United States will multiply into more and more money being spent on \nthe global AIDS crisis. But, likewise, our failure to do so, our \nfailure to keep our word--what the President said in the State of the \nUnion Address--that is going to be noted as well.\n  We have a lot more we can do. It is not just a matter of humanity and \ncompassion; it is a matter of global security. These countries that are \ndevastated by AIDS are fragile societies which, if they fall, if they \ncannot maintain their civil structure, will become vacuums, and in \nthose vacuums we know we will find havens for terrorism, laboratories \nand experiments for the worst possible political outcomes. We don't \nwant that to happen.\n  We need to stand together with the President. I don't think we should \nbe making excuses or coming up with alternatives. Let's put our money \nwhere the President promised it would be. Let this President, traveling \nin Africa, receive word within an hour that the Senate is standing \nbehind him. The promises he is making to the continent of Africa are \npromises which both political parties in the Senate are going to stand \nbehind. That is the best possible message.\n  Senator Bingaman, Senator Leahy, Senator Daschle, I, and others want \nto make certain $3 billion will be available next year to combat this \npandemic across the world.\n  I stand in strong support of this amendment, and I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 7 \\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I will yield to the Senator from California who had a \nquestion or two she wanted to ask at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I wish to address a couple of questions to my \nfriend, Senator Bingaman.\n  First, I thank you so much for bringing this amendment to the floor. \nWe have a situation where President Bush\n\n[[Page S9188]]\n\nis in Africa. I want to make sure I am right on how I read your \namendment. He is there saying he has committed, over a 5-year period, \n$15 billion. Is that correct?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. That is exactly the commitment the President has made.\n  Mrs. BOXER. As I understand my friend, what has happened is that the \nPresident's own budget, instead of giving $3 billion for this effort, \nwhich would be $3 billion this year and $3 billion each year for 5 \nyears to meet his commitment, has underfunded his own request and has \nunderfunded where the authorizing bill said this ought to be at $3 \nbillion.\n  Am I correct in saying when the President says he is waiting for \nCongress to act, essentially his own budget has undercut his \ncommitment?\n  I just want to make sure I understand that what the Senator is doing \ntoday is sending a signal to the people of the United States of \nAmerica, and to the people who are suffering from AIDS worldwide, that \nthis amendment would bring the amount up to the amount that was \npromised in the President's own authorizing legislation but that he has \nunderfunded in his own budget and that this bill is underfunding.\n  What you are doing is keeping the promise made by the President \nhimself, in correcting what was a terrible mistake, it seems to me, in \nthe fact that this bill, as it currently stands, without my colleague's \namendment, underfunds that account for AIDS.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in response to the question, let me just \nsay that is the thrust of the amendment. The amendment is a sense of \nthe Congress. It is the sense of the Congress that when appropriations \nbills do come to the floor of the Senate, we will agree to fully \nappropriate the money needed to meet this $3 billion per year \ncommitment. That is not the amount the President has asked for. He has \nasked for substantially less. It is not what early indications are the \nHouse Subcommittee on Appropriations is likely to provide.\n  We are also concerned, of course, about the availability of those \nfunds in our own Appropriations Committee.\n  So this would make it clear to the whole world, we are committed to \nproviding these funds, even if it is outside the bounds of the budget \nresolution--which it may well have to be. But we will provide the funds \nnecessary to meet the commitment the President has made and continues \nto make on this trip to Africa.\n  I would like to reserve the remainder of my time. I know Senator \nLugar wishes to reserve the remainder of his time so we can have short \nstatements. We will not use the full amount of time reserved.\n  At this point, Senator Reed is here wishing to speak so I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Rhode Island is recognized for up to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, over the past few weeks the entire world has \nwitnessed the images emanating from Liberia of chaos and carnage and a \npeople who are bedeviled by a civil war that has lasted too long. This \nis a country that is in turmoil, a country with which we have a deep \nhistoric relationship. It is a country I do believe we must assist.\n  The trouble in Liberia is not of the last few days or few months. It \nhas extended at least for a decade. But at this time we have the \nopportunity, and I believe also the responsibility, to assist the \npeople of Liberia to find a better way, a way without violence, a way \nthat will guarantee a democracy that works and an economy that provides \nfor the people of Liberia.\n  Liberia has a special relationship to the United States. In 1822, a \ngroup of freed slaves from America began to settle the west coast of \nAfrica. They were provided assistance by private philanthropists but at \nthe insistence and encouragement of the U.S. Government. This was, at \nthat time, a response to the prevailing system of slavery in the United \nStates, a humanitarian approach.\n  By 1847, these settlers had established the Republic of Liberia, the \nfirst independent country in Africa. It was modeled after the United \nStates. In fact, even today, 5 percent of the population trace their \nheritage directly back to these American slaves who were freed and \nrepatriated to Liberia.\n  The Liberians modeled their Constitution on the United States \nConstitution. The Liberian flag closely resembles the United States \nflag. The capital of Liberia is named Monrovia, after President James \nMonroe.\n  Before 1990, before the beginning of this civil war, Liberia's \nleading trading partner was the United States, and the United States \nwas a major source of assistance to the country of Liberia.\n  Our histories have been inextricably linked since 1822. Without the \nattempt of the United States in a small way to work its way through the \nproblem of slavery and the creation in this country of private \nphilanthropy, Liberia would not exist.\n  I argue that these close historical ties are very important \ninfluences that should govern our decision today as we seek to help the \npeople of Liberia.\n  At the core of the problem today in Liberia is the behavior and the \nconduct of the President of Liberia, Charles Taylor. Taylor is 55 years \nold. He is the son of an American father and a Liberian mother who was \na direct descendent of American slaves.\n  During the 1970s, he worked in Boston, MA, while earning an economics \ndegree at a Massachusetts college. He returned to Liberia in 1979, \nhaving spent a significant part of his life here in the United States. \nIn 1979, the Government of Liberia was at that time taken over by \nSamuel Doe. President Taylor worked briefly for Samuel Doe. When he was \naccused of embezzling over $1 million from that Government, he left \nLiberia. He fled to some place with which he was very familar, \nMassachusetts. He was arrested there but he managed to escape from jail \nand made his way to Libya where he trained at a camp run by Qadhafi, a \nguerrilla training camp.\n  In 1989, he led a small band of irregular forces that overthrew the \nSamuel Doe government, and he effectively became leader. Then, through \nan election, he became the President.\n  But his Presidency has been marred not only by the decline of Liberia \nbut by the instability throughout west Africa, spawned by his policies \nand his practices. Between 150,000 and 200,000 people have been killed \nand over 1 million people have been dispossessed in Liberia during the \nTaylor reign.\n  Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, a city of more than 1 million \npeople, is the only African capital that has no electricity, no running \nwater, and no telephone service. Tens of thousands of people live in \nthe ruins of bombed-out buildings. There are only two functioning \nhospitals in the entire country. Only a handful of flights each week \nleave Monrovia in small planes and go to adjacent west African \ncountries. There is no direct connection between this country and the \ncapitals of the world.\n  In the past decade, in response to this violence, this chaos, and \nthis collapse, the United Nations has passed seven resolutions seeking \nto halt the destabilizing force of the Liberian Government--seeking to \nhalt it from its policies of encouraging rebel groups in adjacent \ncountries and trying to induce it to fully abide by numerous Security \nCouncil resolutions to end the internal conflict in Liberia.\n  The United Nations-backed Special Court in Sierra Leone is \ninvestigating war crimes that have taken place in Sierra Leone. These \ncrimes include mass rapes, kidnapping, murder, amputation of limbs of \ncivilians, and recruitment and use of child soldiers.\n  Last month, the Court unsealed an indictment against Charles Taylor \nfor ``bearing the greatest responsibility for war crimes, crimes \nagainst humanity and serious violations of international humanitarian \nlaw within the territory of Sierra Leone since November 30, 1996.''\n  Taylor has deliberately assisted rebel forces in Sierra Leone and has \nprovided resources for and is a willing party to the atrocities which I \nmentioned--the atrocities which have led to his indictment by the Court \nin Sierra Leone. He did it for diamonds. He did it for power. But the \nresults have been devastating to that country.\n\n  It is quite clear that Taylor has not only destroyed his own country \nbut he has also helped to undermine and destabilize adjacent countries, \nsuch as the Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone.\n  One of the problems with countries such as Liberia and adjacent \ncountries is when there is a government that\n\n[[Page S9189]]\n\ndoes not work or simply works for the benefit of the party in power or \nthe person in power, those countries are likely breeding grounds for \nterrorist activity and terrorism that will spread beyond their borders. \nIn fact, in today's world, it could spread worldwide.\n  As a CRS report noted, ``For more than a decade, cycles of conflict \nin Liberia have generated a range of effects that have undermined the \nnational security, political stability, and economic prosperity of its \nneighbors, and had secondary negative repercussions in the wider sub-\nregion. Among the most serious of such effects are the spread of small \narms; the diffusion of violence-based social norms, often with \ncommercial underpinnings; and increasing amounts of mercenary activity \nin the region; the deployment of diverse, often state-assisted rebel \ngroups along regional borders; rampant human rights abuses; and the \ncreation of aggrieved refugees and internally displaced populations.''\n  That has been the record of Charles Taylor.\n  I believe the United States has an obligation to Liberia based on \nhistory, based upon the chaos that is obvious in the country, based \nupon the policies and practices of President Taylor that has ruined his \nown country and harmed his neighbors. We must act for the security of \nwest Africa and possibly even for the security of the United States.\n  I should also point out that our British allies intervened in Sierra \nLeone to ensure stability because of their historic ties with Sierra \nLeone. The French have intervened in the Ivory Coast. In fact, a month \nago it was the French forces that evacuated Americans who were in \ndanger in Liberia itself.\n  I believe we have to take several steps. First, the United States \nshould organize a robust multinational force endorsed by the United \nNations Security Council to support the cease-fire and to restore order \nin Liberia.\n  We all recognize that this is a decision for the President of the \nUnited States. But the Department of Defense must give the President of \nthe United States all the options he needs and which he requires for \nthe movement of troops--troops that could, with the President's order, \nintervene in Liberia. Without timely orders and giving troops notice of \nmovement and beginning the movement process, we could find ourselves \nwith other ugly episodes of violence in Liberia in the next few days, \nor weeks, or months. Finding the President being moved to act, it could \ntake days to put our forces in place to operate.\n  With respect to not only organizing our response, we also should \nseriously begin marshaling the forces necessary to intervene if and \nwhen the President of the United States gives such an order.\n  Our involvement should not be contingent on Charles Taylor's decision \nto leave.\n  I have already described the record of Mr. Taylor. It is a record \nthat lacks credibility. And his decision should not represent a veto of \nour policy. The President has said that he would consider the use of \nforce or international forces if Taylor left. I think we should make it \nquite clear that if the situation deteriorates sufficiently and there \nis a prospect of using force for positive change for the Liberian \npeople, then Charles Taylor should not decide by his presence or his \nabsence whether we commit forces or assist with these international \nforces.\n  The United States should also seek Security Council approval of \nchapter VII authority to further support the Sierra Leone Special Court \nand its indictment of Taylor for crimes against humanity.\n  Presently, although the Special Court is backed by the United \nNations, only Sierra Leone is bound by its decision. We should use our \ndiplomatic influence to ensure that Taylor answers the indictment, in \nthe event he does leave Liberia, or in the event that he comes into \ninternational custody in Liberia.\n  Finally, we should support a U.N. mission for Liberia, in \nconsultation with the Economic Community of West African States, or \nECOWAS, and the International Contact Group for Liberia, to provide for \nan interim government and ultimately a democratic transition.\n  The world, and particularly the people of Liberia, are waiting for \nour leadership. We should provide it.\n  There is another aspect of the issue of Liberia that is important to \nconsider. It is not with respect to those Liberians who are in that \ncountry but actually with respect to Liberians who are here in the \nUnited States and who have been here in the United States for more than \na decade.\n  When the Liberian civil war broke out, many Liberians began to flee \nto the United States. The chaos began to be obvious to our political \nleaders and in March of 1991, the then-Attorney General recognized \ntheir plight, and granted to these people temporary protective status, \nor TPS. This was back under the administration of President George \nHerbert Walker Bush.\n  Under TPS, nationals of a country may stay in the United States \nwithout fear of deportation because armed conflict or extraordinary \nconditions make it unsafe for these people to return home.\n  To obtain TPS, persons must register with the Bureau of Citizenship \nand Immigration Services--formerly known as INS, before its \nreorganization--pay a processing fee, and apply for an authorization to \nwork. They must have a passport from the country from which they have \nfled. And they cannot be granted TPS if they have any criminal \nconvictions.\n  Persons with TPS in the United States must pay taxes, but they do not \nqualify for benefits such as welfare or food stamps, and not a single \nday spent in this country under TPS counts toward the residency \nrequirement for permanent residency.\n  As required by statute, the Attorney General reviews the situation in \nthe country each year and then decides whether to extend TPS.\n  In the case of Liberia, the civil war has raged on and on for more \nthan a decade, prompting Attorneys General of the first Bush \nadministration, the Clinton administration, and the present Bush \nadministration to annually review the status of Liberians in the United \nStates.\n  In 1996, 1998, and again in 2002--this time under the present Bush \nadministration--the Attorney General found that the situation in \nLiberia had deteriorated to such an extent that TPS was not only \ngranted but there was a ``redesignation.''\n  What does that mean? It means that people who had fled the country \nafter 1991, or who had returned to Liberia and then returned to the \nUnited States, were also included in the protected category of TPS. So \nwe have had a situation going over a decade in which annually Attorneys \nGeneral have looked at the issue and have granted protective status to \nthese people.\n  There was one brief period, from 1999 to 2001, where the conflict \nseemed to be ebbing. In that period, TPS was not granted. However, the \nAttorney General and the administration determined that it was still \ninappropriate to return these people to Liberia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 15 minutes allocated to the Senator from \nRhode Island have expired.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 3 \nminutes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  During this period of time, the Attorney General, therefore, granted \na different form of relief known as deferred enforced departure, which \nwas used to shelter the population of Liberians in the United States \nfrom immediate deportation.\n  But I think the point is, it is quite clear we have recognized the \nlegal right of these people to stay in the United States because of the \nturmoil in Liberia for more than a decade.\n  That turmoil today is even worse. It is reaching a crisis proportion, \nso much so that the President of the United States is actually \ncontemplating the use of American forces or certainly American support \nfor an international peacekeeping mission.\n  Now, I have given this long and complicated history to suggest that \nwe have a population that each year waits anxiously for a decision by \nthe Attorney General whether to be sent back to a very difficult \nenvironment.\n  We are talking about 15,000 people in the United States. There is a \nhuman\n\n[[Page S9190]]\n\nface to this. They cannot tell an employer they can take a job for 2 \nyears. They do not know if their children can go off to college for 2 \nor 3 years because you cannot give those assurances. They pay taxes, \nbut they do not qualify for benefits. And many of these Liberians have \nlived in the country longer than the 5 years of residency required for \ncitizenship.\n  What I have done for several years is introduce legislation to allow \nthese individuals to become permanent residents as a step towards \ncitizenship. I have been supported by my colleagues, Senators Chafee, \nKennedy, Corzine, Durbin, and Hagel because we believe--and \nparticularly at this moment we believe--it is appropriate to give these \nLiberians in America a sense of permanency.\n  Let me say, this would not be a unique occasion. We have, in many \nother instances, extended coverage like this to other nationals. We \nhave had situations in which we have allowed people staying in our \ncountry to adjust to permanent residency status.\n  For example, in 1998 Congress passed a law allowing four national \ngroups, who were in similar situations, staying in the United States at \nthe discretion of the Attorney General to adjust to permanent residency \nstatus: 4,996 Poles, 387 Ugandans, 565 Afghanis, and 1,180 Ethiopians.\n  In the 102nd Congress, we passed a law that allowed 52,968 Chinese \nnationals with deferred enforced departure to apply for permanent \nresidency and then citizenship because they were victims of Tiananmen \nSquare.\n  In the 105th Congress, we passed the NACARA legislation. Under this \nlaw, 150,000 Nicaraguans, 5,000 Cubans, 200,000 El Salvadorans, and \n50,000 Guatemalans were given the chance to reach permanent residency \nstatus.\n  In 1999, we passed a bill allowing 2,000 Syrian Jews to accede to \npermanent residency en route to citizenship.\n  My legislation would not set a precedent, but it would provide \nsupport and comfort, and I think long overdue justice, to 15,000 \nLiberians in this country.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can work together in the near future to make \nthis legislation law.\n  I thank my colleagues for listening to this speech about Liberia. We \nhave two functions: One, to provide assistance internationally to help \nthe people struggling there; and then to provide a sense of permanency \nto those Liberians who are here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I will give a short speech as part of the \n20 minutes allocated to me at this time.\n  My understanding is, my colleague Senator Bingaman will speak on the \nAIDS legislation that he has proposed with many cosponsors, and then we \nwill proceed to a rollcall vote on the Bingaman amendment.\n  Let me say at the outset that during our debate today on these \nauthorization bills, we have heard from Senators on very important \nforeign policy issues. The distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, who \njust spoke on Liberia, is an excellent example of one who has spent \ntime and effort in analyzing that issue.\n  We heard from the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, \nearlier on with regard to his apprehensions on Iraq. Other Senators \nlikewise have taken this forum.\n  Although that means perhaps our debate has been more extended on the \nauthorization bills, this is a good time for Senators who are focusing \non foreign affairs to speak and to enlighten their colleagues and the \npublic in this important body.\n  On the AIDS question, let me simply say that I indicated early on to \nSenator Bingaman and the sponsors that we would be prepared to accept \nthat amendment. I did so simply because I think it is important, with \nthe President in Africa, that there be clarification, in a bipartisan \nway, that we support the initiative he has given to the world. It is an \nextraordinary initiative. It has large impact. Hopefully, it will have \ngood results on the ground with medical services, pharmaceutical \nproducts, other practices that are initiated by the various states that \nmay be recipients as well as individual persons.\n  I come to the floor simply to say I hope Senators will support the \namendment, that we understand the President has made a very large \noffer. Now, authorizers and appropriators are going to have to work \ntheir way through that situation, along with the White House, in \nresponsible ways for the next 5 years or so. That will take some doing, \nas most speakers today have pointed out.\n  There has been, at least with some of those who have spoken on the \nissue, some skepticism about whether the President either understood \nthe enormity of the task, whether he or his staff have in fact asked \nfor the amounts of money that are required to get the job done, to \nfollow the plan. And, in fact, some have suggested even a photo op \nfollowed by a lack of activity and followthrough that would be \ndisastrous both to the credibility of the proposal as well as to the \nrecipients.\n  My own view is that our President, George Bush, is very sincere about \nthis project. I say that from personal conversations with the President \nand the opportunity to work with him. The occupant of the Chair, as a \ndistinguished member of the Foreign Relations Committee, is well aware \nthat our committee took up the AIDS legislation issue. Senator Biden \nand I, in a bipartisan way, formulated, with the aid of many Senators \non both sides of the aisle on our committee, an initiative that we \nbelieved was most appropriate in following through on that.\n  In due course, colleagues in the House of Representatives, led by \nHenry Hyde of Illinois and others, formulated a piece of legislation \nthat was a strong piece of legislation, in our judgment. It was the \nhope of the President and the leadership of the Senate that we could \nall turn to, in unity with our colleagues in the House, and pass an \nAIDS bill prior to the President going to the G-8 to lay before the \nEuropean states and Japan and others the full benefits that would come \nto the world if they were willing to sign up likewise and work with us \nand follow our leadership.\n  And in a very late night session, the Chair will recall, we did pass \nthat legislation. The President promptly signed it in the early days of \nthe following week, as soon as it reached his desk, and proceeded to \nEurope with that initiative. He proceeds to Africa with that initiative \nnow.\n  It is very meaningful, as he visits in countries, even as we speak, \nthat have a very high incidence of AIDS. It is important with the \nPresident in Africa on the ground speaking to this issue that we speak \nin one voice likewise. This is why I will propose to Senators that we \nin fact support the amendment.\n  I am advised my colleague from Pennsylvania would like to have a few \nminutes. I am prepared to yield to him. I have 20 minutes. How much \ntime would the Senator desire?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Two minutes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield 3 minutes to my distinguished colleague from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to echo the chairman's comments \nthat this body in a very late session, under his leadership and that of \nSenator Biden, was able to pass this historic measure providing the \nPresident the fodder he needed to go to Europe and the G-8 and make a \npitch that the United States is behind trying to take on this scourge \nthat has enveloped a continent, the subcontinent of Africa, and he was \nable to do that. As a result, he has been able to get the European \nUnion to make a substantial commitment to participating in this \nproject.\n  I don't know if it has been said yet, but not only did we believe it \nwas necessary to provide the appropriate leverage for our comrades in \nEurope to participate, but it worked. It was successful. They have come \nto the table and we are grateful for that. I think Senator Bingaman's \namendment, as the chairman suggested, is just further evidence of our \ncommitment to funding.\n  My belief is we should come forward with the necessary funds. I don't \nnecessarily agree with Senator Bingaman that we need to put $3 billion \nin the appropriations process in the pipeline right now. The commitment \nwas $2 billion plus $1 billion in matching funds. The President said he \nwould put up $200 million in good faith. So that puts us at $2.2 \nbillion which is what I believe is the number that is necessary to meet \nthe commitment the authorization requires. I don't think it is \nnecessary for us to appropriate $1 billion without having the match in \nplace for that $1 billion. I think we can always come back, as we are \nmaybe even this week,\n\n[[Page S9191]]\n\nwith supplementals throughout the course of the year to fulfill the \ncommitment.\n  Our commitment in the Congress was $2 billion plus $1 billion if \nother countries match it. So we need to put in $2 billion. We have $1.9 \nbillion, as the Senator from New Mexico said. So we are not that far \noff. But the President did say he would put $200 million forward, \nwhether or not it is matched, as a good faith effort. And so I think to \ncomport with that, we should do our best, within the appropriations \nprocess, to come up with $2.2 billion. But I think anything beyond \nthat, candidly, is unnecessary, under the authorization is unnecessary. \nAnd I hope we do what is required and candidly sit back and wait and \nsee what kind of commitments we will get from the rest of the world \nbefore we start ponying up real dollars in the appropriations process \nwhen those dollars are contingent upon other countries coming through \nwith their contributions.\n  While I agree in principle with what the Senator from New Mexico said \nand will certainly support his amendment--I encourage Senators to \nsupport this amendment--I do so with the caveat that really full \nfunding, under the understanding on this floor the night we passed it \nas well as the President's initiative, is, in my mind, $2.2 billion. \nAnd then we can go from there subsequently, depending upon the kind of \nsupport we get from other countries around the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 3 minutes and \n46 seconds remaining, and the Senator from Indiana has 10 minutes and \n20 seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nStabenow be added as a cosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me begin by thanking the Senator from Indiana for \nhis willingness to support the amendment and urge others to. That is \nvery important. It is important we pass this amendment by a large \nbipartisan vote. He indicated he believes the President is sincere in \nhis commitment to provide this $15 billion over 5 years. I certainly \nagree. I believe the President is sincere as well. I believed that when \nhe said it in his State of the Union speech. I still believe it.\n  Unfortunately, the fact we are faced with is we have authorized the \n$15 billion to be spent consistent with what the President asked for. \nBut as we all know, there is a difference between what is authorized \nand what is appropriated. And the early indications are the \nappropriation may not be that generous or that robust.\n  That is the reason for my amendment.\n  The early indications I am referring to are the President's own \nbudget request. In his request to the Congress, the President did not \nask for $3 billion this first year. He asked for, perhaps in a most \ngenerous reading of his budget request, $1.9 billion; $200 million of \nwhich would be committed to this global AIDS fund. We had authorized $3 \nbillion, $1 billion for the global AIDS fund, $2 billion on other \nbilateral programs and AIDS initiatives. All I am saying is, we need to \nstep in and, as is appropriate under the Constitution, appropriate the \nfunds the President is talking about in Africa, that we have authorized \nto be spent.\n  I believe that is the least we can do. This amendment is a sense of \nthe Congress that we are committed to that when the appropriations \nbills come to the floor later this year. We will all have a chance at \nthat point to look at those bills and see whether or not the funding is \npresent.\n  If it is, fine; if it is not, we can add funding at that time before \nwe complete action on those bills. I do not subscribe to the view that \nthe President's commitment of $15 billion is contingent upon all sorts \nof other things. I think it is a commitment this country has made. I \ncommend the President for it. I commend him for taking this trip to \nAfrica. I know those countries have desperate needs for which that \nfunding could be used. And this pandemic that we are seeing worldwide, \nbut most particularly on the African Continent, is something that \ndeserves our top priority. I urge my colleagues to join me in passing \nthis sense-of-the-Congress amendment and then, of course, I will urge \nthem to support following through when the appropriations bills \nactually come to the floor. That is when the real decision point comes. \nThis is a great indication that the Senate is standing behind the \nPresident, behind its commitments, and that is exactly what we should \ndo.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield back the remaining time that I \nhave, and I commend the amendment to Senators. I hope there will be \nstrong support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the \nSenator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Lieberman), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo).

Mr. President, just as soon as the list has been \nreviewed more carefully by our distinguished ranking member, I am sure \nwe will be in a position to work with the chair to accommodate his \nunanimous consent request.\n  We have a number of Senators who have been working with the managers. \nI think they may be in a position to offer their amendments with the \nunderstanding they would not require rollcall votes.\n  I know Senator Dodd and Senator Clinton and Schumer, at least, are in \nthat position, maybe others.\n  I have just shared with the majority leader a list of amendments that \nmay not be finite but is almost officially finite. We are hopeful we \ncan continue to work with our managers in accommodating those Senators \nwho wish to offer amendments but with a recognition that in most cases \nthey will not require a good deal of time. In some cases they will not \nbe offered at all.\n  We have only been on the bill for about a day--full--and we were \nreminded it has been since 1985, which was the last time we actually \nbrought up successfully the State Department authorization bill.\n  We are very desirous of completing the work on all three pieces of \nit. We will continue to work with the distinguished majority leader and \nchair to figure out a way to accommodate the successful conclusion and \nconsideration of the legislation. As I say, this list is not \nnecessarily finite, but I do not expect it to grow. In fact, I think \nthere are amendments on the list that will probably not be offered. So \nwe will go from here.\n  In the meantime, perhaps, if we could dispose of the amendments that \nwill not require rollcalls, we will expedite this process even more.\n  Mr. REID. Will the distinguished Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes, I will be happy to.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator indicated we have spent basically a day, a half \nday yesterday and so far today, on the State Department authorization. \nAll Democrats want to finish this bill. I think the leader would \nacknowledge that. We had our policy meeting today and our caucus \nluncheon Tuesday. I remind the leader--the majority leader is in the \nChamber also--we spent 2 days this week on a bill that everyone knew, \nwhen it came up, was going nowhere. We all believe this bill is going \nsomewhere--has the opportunity to go somewhere. I hope the two leaders \nwould work to move it forward.\n  I know the Democratic leader feels that way. I think it would be a \nshame, for lack of a better description, after all the work we have \ndone on this--as the Democratic leader has announced, we have a list \nthat is a good list, nearly complete. We could complete this \nlegislation. We can't complete it in a matter of hours, but I think we \ncould complete it in a matter of a day or so.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will comment and then yield the floor. It was reported \nto me the last time we took up the bill in 1985 we took a couple of \nweeks to pass it. We certainly do not expect to spend a couple of weeks \non the bill in this session of Congress. But I think it does, again, \nremind us that there are very important issues involving foreign \npolicy, the State Department, and other issues--whether or not they are \ndirectly relevant to the State Department--that are meritorious and \ndeserve consideration. I know of no one, on this side at least, who \nwould require a good deal of time, an inordinate amount of time, for \ntheir amendment to be considered.\n  We will work with our Republican colleagues in the hope we can \naccommodate this list, expedite the consideration of the bill, and move \nto a successful conclusion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Democratic \nleader agrees we can complete this very important piece of legislation. \nThe fact it has been such a long time since we have carried out our \nreal responsibility in this authorizing legislation, trying to do what \nwe are doing in a very systematic, orderly way, rather than throwing it \non appropriations which, in the past, historically, has been done, I \nhope reflects my intent and the intent of all of us working together to \ngo about this in an orderly way, the way that is most appropriate.\n  We have a lot of work to do. We have made a lot of progress this \nweek. We knew at the outset of the week we were setting out an \nambitious agenda, in the sense that it is really what I believe our \nresponsibility is to do. We tried not to rush things too much and \nconsider amendments, some of which are not germane to the underlying \nbill. It is the right of every U.S. Senator to offer those. Those \namendments have come from the other side of the aisle. I know every \neffort is being made to focus on the bill itself.\n  We will be in session today. We will be in session late tonight. We \nwill be in session tomorrow. We will be in session, voting, tomorrow. \nMy goal remains to be to finish this bill. We will do legislative \nappropriations. We can discuss when to do that that is most appropriate \non both sides of the aisle. We are going to bring that to the floor. We \ncan do it tonight. We can do it tomorrow. We can do it tomorrow \nafternoon.\n  My goal would be to be able to complete that bill and go to military \nconstruction as well. We can talk among ourselves.\n  The Democratic leader stressed the importance of getting amendments \nforward. We just talked through a list from the other side of the \naisle. I just talked to Chairman Lugar. We have really just two or \nthree amendments. So for the first time we have sort of a finite list \nof amendments with which we can work. I ask that the chairman and \nranking member do their very best to cull through the amendments. As \nthe Democratic leader said, if they do not need a rollcall vote, let's \ntry to work through this in an orderly way.\n  I do want our colleagues to know, for scheduling, just as I said last \nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday--today, I am saying it again, we \nare going to go through these next three bills. If we can complete this \nbill in a few hours, which the Democratic leadership said we cannot \ndo--and I respect that if we really can't. I hope we could. Talking to \nChairman Lugar, he says he thinks we can. But if you believe it is \nabsolutely impossible, then it may be that later tonight we will set \nthis aside and we will begin the other two bills, which we will be \naddressing. We will be voting on them with rollcall votes. I will talk \nto Chairman Stevens in a few minutes and see what he thinks is best, in \nterms of that overall schedule.\n  If there were any chance we could systematically go through this bill \nand complete the work--and again the chairman and ranking member have \ndone a great job in terms of considering the whole range of amendments \nthus far, but if we can complete that bill and get started on \nlegislative appropriations, and military construction, if we can do \nthat tonight we wouldn't even have to vote tomorrow at all.\n  I know we just heard that is not going to be possible in terms of the \nrange of amendments as we go forward. We are voting today, tonight, we \nwill stay on this bill a while longer, and we can talk. If you believe \nwe need to set it aside so we can go to the appropriations, we can come \nback to this as soon as we finish this appropriation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Chair's understanding the chairman \nhas sent to the desk a series of amendments which he wishes to be \nconsidered en bloc. Is that correct?\n  Mr. LUGAR. That is correct. I would like to amend my proposal to \neliminate an amendment by Senator Warner to strike section 206, and an \namendment by Senator Ensign regarding the level of U.S. funding. I had \nlisted eight of these. These two should be omitted from that list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Reserving the right to object.\n\n[[Page S9193]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. No, I do not object.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we on this side have worked with the ranking \nmember of the committee, and we have a list of Democratic amendments we \nwant to go in order.\n  I would like to announce those for the benefit of the Senate.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield for just a \nmoment, if I could complete the action with regard to the six \namendments.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize. I thought that had been done.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that those six \namendments be agreed to en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1136\n\n (Purpose: To authorize Economic Support Fund assistance for Pakistan)\n\n       At the end of section 2123, add the following:\n       (d) Assistance for Pakistan.--\n       (1) In general.--Of the funds authorized to be appropriated \n     to carry out chapter 4 of part II of the Foreign Assistance \n     Act of 1961 for fiscal year 2004, $200,000,000 may be made \n     available for assistance for Pakistan, of which up to \n     $200,000,000 may be made available for the costs, as defined \n     in section 502 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, of \n     modifying direct loans and guarantees for Pakistan.\n       (2) Treatment of certain assistance.--The amount made \n     available under paragraph (1) for the cost of modifying \n     direct loans and guarantees shall not be considered \n     assistance for purposes of any provision of law limiting \n     assistance to a country.\n       (3) Limitation.--The authority provided by paragraph (1) \n     shall be subject to the requirements of section 634A of the \n     Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1183\n\n(Purpose: To grant the consent of Congress to the receipt by employees \n  of a designated entity or designated country of salary and benefits \n from such entity or country while they serve in offices of profit or \n                 trust within the Department of State)\n\n       On page 31, between lines 23 and 24, insert the following:\n       ``(c) For the purposes of the program authorized by \n     subsection (a), Congress consents to employees of a \n     designated country or designated entity continuing to receive \n     payment of salary and benefits from such designated country \n     or designated entity while they serve in offices of profit or \n     trust within the Department of State.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1184\n\n(Purpose: To authorize a United States-Russia Interparliamentary Group)\n\n       On page 94, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC. 815.

AUTHORIZATION FOR THE CENTER FOR CULTURAL AND \n                   TECHNICAL INTERCHANGE BETWEEN EAST AND WEST.\n\n       Of the amounts authorized in this Act under Section 102 for \n     United States Educational, Cultural, and Public Diplomacy \n     Programs up to $4 million is authorized to be appropriated, \n     in addition to such funds authorized under Section 102(a)(3), \n     in support of the Center for Cultural and Technical \n     Interchange Between East and West.\n\n\n                      amendment nos. 1184 and 1185\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have two amendments to establish \nlegislative exchange programs on behalf of the United States Senate.\n  These two amendments will authorize funds necessary to create \nformalized, cooperative relationships between the U.S. Senate and the \nFederation Council, the upper house of the Russian Parliament, as well \nas between the United States and the National People's Congress of the \nPeople's Republican of China.\n  The genesis of these initiatives is the hard work and deep interest \nthat two of our colleagues have shown in pursing a deeper relationship \nwith our counterparts in those two bodies.\n  Senator Lott, during a visit to Russian 2 years ago, began a very \nfruitful dialogue with members of the Federation Council that has \ncontinued at many levels since. I myself had the opportunity earlier \nthis year to meet with the Mr. Mikhail Margelov, Chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee of the Federation Council, Senator Lugar's \ncounterpart, and I look forward to playing host this fall to my \ncounterpart, Mr. Sergei Mironov, the Chairman of the Federation \nCouncil. At that time it is our joint intention to sign a memorandum of \nagreement that will formalize a regularized relationship between our \ntwo legislative bodies.\n  U.S.-Russian relations are at a point today that would have been \nunimaginable even a decade ago. We are joined in a growing exchange of \ntrade and investment, the open travel of tourists and the business \ncommunity, and cooperation on the central threat facing our two \nnations--the scourge of global terrorism. We have our disagreements, \nbut for the most part these are the normal disagreements that exist \nbetween any friendly nations. It is my firm belief that as part of our \nrelationship with Russia, we should establish an institutional \nrelationship with our counterparts in the Federation Council to examine \nour mutual interests and craft solutions that reflect our shared \ninterests.\n  In the case of the National People's Congress of the People's \nRepublic of China, I would like to credit Senator Ted Stevens for his \ninitiative in pursuing a more regularized relationship. It is my \nintention to invite my counterpart, Mr. Wu Bangguo, the Chairman of the \nNational People's Congress, to visit the United States later this year \nor early next year.\n  As an aside, I have the privilege to lead a delegation of eight \nSenators to China earlier this year. This delegation was hosted by \nChairman Wu during our 3-day stay. He was a gracious host and provided \nus with an outstanding schedule of appointments during our stay. But \nbeyond this, we also had very candid and complete conversations about \nthe challenge and opportunities in the U.S.-China relationship. I will \nnot suggest that there are not problems, but it was remarkable how \nopenly Chairman Wu was willing to discuss these issues in an attempt to \nunderstand our perspective, if not find common ground.\n\n[[Page S9194]]\n\n  I detect on both sides an optimism about U.S.-Chinese relations that \nhas not existed in well over a decade. By deepening our relationship \nwith the National People's Congress, I am confident we can fortify that \noptimism and create real potential to solve some of the problems that \nhave plagued our relationship in the past.\n  I urge immediate adoption of these two amendments.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1186\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I rise today to introduce an amendment that would \nrequire the State Department to include in its annual report on \ninternational religious freedom a section highlighting the issue of \nanti-Semitism abroad.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, we have seen a disturbing trend \nin the increase of anti-Semitic violence abroad, with growing reports \nof incidents in countries that have traditionally been among Europe's \nstrongest democracies, including France and Germany. I remain deeply \nconcerned with these reports, and I believe it is absolutely essential \nthat we do all that we can to take action to combat this problem, both \nat home and overseas.\n  Last month, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani led the U.S. \nDelegation to the first conference of the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe, OSCE, dedicated solely to the issue of anti-\nSemitism. The conference took place in Vienna, Austria, during the \nperiod of June 19-20, 2003, bringing together parliamentarians, \nofficials, and private citizens from all 55 OSCE participating states.\n  As a member of the Helsinki Commission, I strongly encouraged the \nState Department to make this conference a priority of the U.S. \ngovernment. Last October, a number of my colleagues joined me in a \nletter to Secretary of State Colin Powell urging him to call on the \nOSCE to schedule this meeting. With the support of Secretary Powell, \nUndersecretary of State Marc Grossman, and our Ambassador to the OSCE, \nStephan Minikes, I was very pleased that the chair-in-office of the \nOSCE did in fact agree to put this meeting on the calendar. It is an \nimportant step in the right direction.\n  Work to highlight this alarming trend began in earnest last year. In \nMay 2002, the Helsinki Commission conducted a hearing to examine \nreports of increased anti-Semitism. During that hearing, I called on \nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, OSCE, to \nconduct a separate session on anti-Semitism during the annual meeting \nof the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly in Berlin last July. I was pleased \nthat this did, in fact, take place. Delegates to the meeting \nunanimously passed a resolution calling attention to the danger of \nanti-Semitism, which I cosponsored. The conference held last month was \na product of much of the work done during the past year.\n  As we discuss the need to address this issue, I could not agree more \nwith a statement made by Mayor Giuliani just before he left for the \nVienna conference, in which he remarked, ``The conference represents a \ncritical first step for Europeans, who have too frequently dismissed \nanti-Semitic violence as routine assaults and vandalism. Anti-Semitism \nis anything but routine. When people attack Jews, vandalize their \ngraves, characterize them in inhumane ways, and make salacious \nstatements in parliaments or to the press, they are attacking the \ndefining values of our societies and our international institutions.''\n  While we are headed down the right path, it is critical that we take \naction to follow up on the successful beginning found at the conference \nin Vienna. This amendment aims to ensure that the U.S. Government pays \nclose attention to the issue of anti-Semitism internationally, with the \nhope that it will encourage our friends, allies, and partners abroad to \ndo the same. The amendment requires the inclusion of the following \ninformation on the subject of anti-Semitism for each foreign country: \nacts of anti-Semitic violence that occurred in that country; the \nresponse of the government of that country to such acts of violence; \nactions by the government of that country to enact and enforce laws \nrelating to the protection of the right to religious freedom with \nrespect to people of the Jewish faith; societal attitudes in that \ncountry toward people of the Jewish faith; and trends relating to such \nattitudes in that country.\n  The promotion of human rights worldwide is a central aspect of U.S. \nforeign policy, and consistent with this goal, the Senate has acted to \ncondemn anti-Semitism abroad. I believe this amendment is a necessary \nstep as we look to combat anti-Semitism at home and abroad.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the amendments offered on this side are \namendments by Senator Biden, Senator Schumer, Senator Kennedy, Senator \nStabenow, Senator Dorgan, Senator Harkin, and Senator Dodd, in that \norder. So everyone understands--we have a lot of people shuffling \naround--that will be the order of amendments by Democratic Senators.\n  It is Clinton and Schumer. I apologize for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware sought recognition.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield. Apparently the Senator from New York has a \nquestion.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the amendment Senator Reid mentioned \nafter Senator Biden's amendment is a different amendment. Senator \nClinton and I have an amendment. Those two amendments we will do en \nbloc. We would not have a vote. The majority and minority have agreed. \nIt affects matters in New York City. We would like to do those very \nquickly before we begin this order, if I may ask that we do that.\n  Mr. REID. Following the Biden amendment?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. One minute.\n  Mr. REID. Right now?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Two minutes of debate right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes. I am happy to yield, not that I have the floor.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside and that I call up amendment No. 1142 and \nanother amendment at the desk by Senator Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          Amendments Nos. 1142 and 1188 to Amendment No. 1136\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mrs. Clinton], for herself and \n     Mr. Schumer, proposes an amendment numbered 1142 and an \n     amendment numbered 1188 to amendment No. 1136.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1142\n\n     (Purpose: To increase the authorization of appropriations for \nprotection of foreign missions and officials for fiscal year 2004, and \nto make an authorization of appropriations for expenses related to such \n        protection that were incurred prior to October 1, 2003)\n\n       On page 10, strike lines 17 through 19 and insert the \n     following:\n       (5) Protection of foreign missions and officials.--For \n     ``Protection of Foreign Missions and Officials'', $21,000,000 \n     for the fiscal year 2004, and $55,900,000 to be available for \n     expenses related to protection of foreign missions and \n     officials incurred prior to October 1, 2003.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1188\n\n(Purpose: To impose an economic sanction on foreign countries that owe \n          property taxes to Washington, D.C. or New York City)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. ____. PENALTY FOR UNPAID PROPERTY TAXES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), an amount equal \n     to 110 percent of the total amount of unpaid property taxes \n     owed by a foreign country to the District of Columbia and New \n     York, New York as reported by the District of Columbia and \n     New York, New York, respectively, shall be withheld from \n     obligation for such country from funds that are--\n       (1) appropriated pursuant to an authorization of \n     appropriations in this Act; and\n       (2) made available for such foreign country under part I of \n     the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.).\n       (b) Payment.--Funds withheld from obligation for a country \n     under subsection (a)(2)\n\n[[Page S9195]]\n\n     shall be paid to the District of Columbia or New York, New \n     York, as appropriate, to satisfy any judgment for unpaid \n     property taxes against such foreign country.\n       (c) Certification.--The withholding of funds under \n     subsection (a) shall apply with respect to a foreign country \n     until the Secretary of State certifies to the designated \n     congressional committees that the total unpaid property taxes \n     owed by such country have been paid in full.\n       (d) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Designated congressional committees.--The term \n     ``designated congressional committees'' means the Committees \n     of Foreign Relations and Appropriations of the Senate and the \n     Committees on International Relations and Appropriations of \n     the House of Representatives.\n       (2) Judgment.--The term ``judgment'' means a judgment, \n     order, or decree, including a judgment rendered by default or \n     nonappearance of a party, entered in favor of the District of \n     Columbia or New York, New York in a court of the United \n     States or any State or subdivision thereof, arising from a \n     proceeding regarding unpaid property taxes.\n       (3) Unpaid property taxes.--The term ``unpaid property \n     taxes'' means the amount of the unpaid taxes, and interest on \n     such taxes, that have accrued on real property under \n     applicable laws.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, the U.S. State Department is legally \nobligated to provide security protection for the United Nations and its \nmissions. Under a longstanding arrangement, the City of New York has \nprovided this police security for the United Nations and its missions, \nand then it has been reimbursed by the State Department.\n  Long ago, the State Department decided the best way to do this was to \nhave the city provide the service and then provide a reimbursement.\n  Since September 11, the security needs of the United Nations have \nincreased to about $18.5 million annually in New York alone. Then there \nhave been additional events, such as the U.N. General Assembly and the \nMillennium Summit alone cost almost $20 million. Thus, the \nauthorization for the program entitled ``Protection of Foreign Missions \nand Officials'' must be increased so that the City of New York can \nreceive adequate reimbursement.\n  I thank the chairman for his understanding and his cooperation in \nmaking this possible. I thank the ranking member as well.\n  This program has been authorized at $10 million over the last several \nyears. It will provide reimbursement not only for New York but also Los \nAngeles and Chicago. The annual figure will be increased $21 million to \ncover all three cities' expenses; plus an authorization of $55.9 \nmillion is included to reimburse the cities for back claims accumulated \nover the last several years.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member for accepting this \namendment.\n  I would like to yield to my colleague, Senator Schumer, on a second \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the chairman and \nranking member for their courtesy.\n  We have two amendments. Senator Clinton has explained the first one. \nThat deals with reimbursement for police expenses. We always had that \nin New York City. This simply raises the amount, given the 9/11 \nsituation.\n  The second amendment is a little different. It very simply says that \ndiplomatic scofflaws have to pay their property taxes. We have a whole \nlot of missions in New York. A handful of them don't pay their property \ntaxes.\n  This amendment is very simple. When they don't pay their property \ntaxes, this gives authorization for them to be taken from their foreign \naid. It is only fair. It is only right.\n  We did this for parking tickets a few years ago. It was very \nsuccessful. We want to do it for property taxes.\n  It is mind-boggling to know, but there is $214 million in outstanding \nproperty taxes from these missions. This amendment will go a long way \nto collecting it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that both amendments be agreed to by voice \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's request is not in order. Does \nthe Senator request unanimous consent that the amendments be agreed to?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that both amendments be agreed \nto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1142 and 1188) were agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I suggest that we move out of order to \nSenator Dodd. The chairman and I have accepted a modified Dodd \namendment. Rather than have him wait all this time, I would like to \nsuggest he be recognized to speak and that we move on his amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1189 to Amendment No. 1136\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1189.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit MCA monies from being used to fund projects that \n could displace US jobs or production, or pose an environmental hazard)\n\n       On page 247, strike the period at the end of Section \n     3102(a) and add the following:\n       ``, except that the Corporation is prohibited from \n     providing assistance to any entity for any project which is \n     likely to--\n       (i) cause the substantial loss of US jobs, or the \n     displacement of US production, or\n       (ii) pose an unreasonable or major environmental, health or \n     safety hazard.''\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this amendment reflects the language and my \ndiscussion with the chairman of the committee which adds the word \n``substantial'' to the first paragraph of the first (i) clause--the \nsubstantial loss of U.S. jobs. And the rest of the amendment will read \nas it is presently printed.\n  Let me, first of all, thank the distinguished chairman and ranking \nmember for allowing me to offer this amendment and for accepting it. \nThis language conforms to existing law with the Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation, the Export-Import Bank, and other foreign aid \nprograms and takes into consideration job loss on environmental issues.\n  I think it fits into the Millennium Account category. I am a strong \nsupporter of the Millennium Account. I thank the chairman and others \nwho have been involved. I think it will be a wonderful opportunity for \nus to provide education and needed assistance to others around the \nworld.\n  This amendment would add a proviso to Division C of the bill--\nMillennium Challenge Assistance--to ensure that Millennium Challenge \nmonies authorized in this legislation do no inadvertently fund projects \nthat result in the loss of American jobs, or the transfer of U.S. \nproduction facilities abroad, or pose a threat to public health or the \nenvironment.\n  Why is this amendment necessary? Aren't U.S. foreign assistance laws \nalready on the books that prevent U.S. foreign aid monies from being \nused in ways that can hurt American families or damage the environment? \nThe answer is yes such laws exist but the bill before us today would \nexempt the Millennium Challenge Corporation set up in Division C of \nthis bill from this and other restrictions currently in law.\n  The Millennium Challenge Account has been provided with substantial \nresources in this bill--more than $8 billion over three years with \nvirtually no legislative strings attached.\n  Clearly there was a rationale for giving the corporation flexibility \nto try a new approach to helping countries help themselves climb the \ndevelopment ladder. I am certainly willing to give this ``experiment'' \na chance to see if it produces better results than our normal foreign \nassistance programs.\n  Having said that, none of us in this body would support the use of \nAmerican taxpayer dollars being used to displace American jobs or U.S. \nproduction or to pose an environmental or health hazard.\n  There is also ample legislative history to suggest that restrictions \nof this kind are not unduly burdensome.\n  USAID programs are already subject to somewhat similar restrictions \nas are U.S. Export/Import Bank and OPIC programs. None of these \norganizations have alleged that these restrictions impair their ability \nto carry out their activities.\n\n[[Page S9196]]\n\n  Opponents of this amendment suggest that this provision is \nunnecessarily restrictive and difficult to implement. I find that \nrather hard to accept. We clearly know that there are a number of \nsectors in this country that are particularly sensitive to foreign \ncompetition--steel, textiles to name a few. Over the last three years \nmore than 2.3 million American manufacturing jobs have been lost. We \nmust not unknowingly make matters worse by providing ill conceived \nsubsidies to foreign competitors.\n  My colleagues I am sure know that there is a U.S. government entity--\nthe International Trade Commission--which is charged with monitoring \nthe impact that foreign production is having on U.S. industries and \njobs in this country.\n  Clearly there are enormous U.S. resources and information that will \nbe readily available to the corporation to ensure that U.S. taxpayer \ndollars aren't being used to, in effective, subsidize the export of \nAmerican jobs and production. So I don't accept the argument that this \namendment is too difficult or draconian for the corporation to \nimplement.\n  Is this amendment more difficult to implement than a provision \nalready in this bill which requires the corporation to make the \njudgement that a particular government is ``committed to just and \ndemocratic governance'' in order for it to be eligible for assistance \nfrom the Millennium Challenge Account? I don't believe it is.\n  There is no reason to believe that the corporation should find this \nrestriction any more burdensome.\n  Frankly, I would think that the Administration would welcome this \namendment because it will sensitize officials of the corporation that \nthey must always be mindful that nothing that the corporation \nundertakes or supports should be injurious to American workers--the \nfolks footing the bill for this experimental approach to helping poor \ncountries lift themselves out of poverty.\n  Some may argue that this provision is unnecessary, that the members \nof the corporation will be too smart to ever do anything to hurt U.S. \nworkers or production.\n  I would say to my colleagues that the conditions that currently exist \nin law with respect to this matter came about because U.S. agencies \nfrankly weren't paying attention to the domestic effects because that \nwasn't in their ``job descriptions''.\n  Moreover, the surest way for support to be eroded for the MCA is for \nit to become known that in its zeal to help MCA eligible countries, it \nhas ignored the negative implications that ill conceived projects could \nhave on American workers and production facilities. With this statutory \nred flag, it is less likely that such mistakes will be made.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Let me lastly say, aside from this particular amendment, how deeply \nproud I am of the chairman and the ranking member. When I was a member \nof committee, I think I had a full head of black hair the last time we \nhad a State Department authorization bill on the floor of the Senate.\n  This is not an accident. The last time we were on the floor and it \nwas brought up, the Senator from Indiana was chairing the committee. I \nam proud to be a member of this committee and proud to be affiliated \nand associated with the two distinguished Senators, the chairman and \nthe ranking member. They do a fabulous job on this committee.\n  I hope we get this bill finished. This is important, not only for \nwhat it includes but also the statement it makes about how important we \nconsider the role of the State Department, the aid programs which we \nadminister, and the assistance provided to people all over the globe.\n  My compliments to the chairman and the ranking member for a job \ntremendously well done.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his generous \ncomments. I thank him for his amendment and for his cooperation in \nworking to strengthen the MCA, and likewise at the same time indicate \nour concern about loss of jobs in this country and the environmental \ndamage by the modifiers of ``substantial loss of U.S. jobs,'' and the \nlanguage already, ``unreasonable or major environmental health, or \nsafety hazard.''\n  The Senator has made a very good contribution.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I, too, thank the Senator from Connecticut \nfor his kind comments. As they say, he uses overly formal language. He \nis a valued member of their committee. He is more than that. He is more \nthan that. He is one of the engines of the committee. I thank him for \nhis comments. I respect and reflect his comments relative to the \nchairman.\n\n  This is an important bill. As my grandfather used to say: With the \ngrace of God, the good will of the neighbors, and the creek not rising, \nwe may get this finished.\n  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I think we have to ask unanimous consent \nthat the Dodd amendment be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1189) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the chairman.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1190 To Amendment No. 1136\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden], for himself, Mr. \n     Levin, and Mr. Daschle, proposes an amendment numbered 1190.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert:\n       Sec.   . In appreciation of our armed forces and regarding \n     restoring stability and security in Iraq.\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States Armed Forces, with the support of \n     forces from Great Britain and other countries, historically \n     and courageously liberated Iraq in three weeks;\n       (2) Conditions on the ground in parts of Iraq continue to \n     pose a grave threat to American troops, thereby complicating \n     efforts to restore law and order and essential public \n     services for Iraqis and these efforts are further complicated \n     by the absence of effective communication with the Iraqi \n     people;\n       (3) Ultimately, maintaining law and order in Iraq and \n     preserving its territorial integrity will require the \n     creation of a professionally trained Iraqi police force and a \n     reformed Iraqi military but that will take a significant \n     amount of time and in the meantime international armed forces \n     and police must assume these responsibilities;\n       (4) Approximately 145,000 U.S. troops are currently \n     deployed in Iraq, meaning that American troops comprise \n     roughly 90% of Coalition forces, and even if, as the \n     Department of Defense has stated, an additional 10,000 \n     international troops join the Coalition effort in Iraq by \n     September, Americans will still comprise roughly 85% of \n     Coalition forces;\n       (5) Maintaining the existing force level in Iraq currently \n     requires $3.9 billion each month;\n       (6) The Department of Defense has stated that it will \n     require one year to train a new Iraqi Army of 12,000 soldiers \n     and three years to train 40,000 soldiers;\n       (7) The Coalition Provisional Authority has stated that it \n     will require at least one year to recruit and train a police \n     force of 40,000 officers capable of assuming minimal police \n     functions in Iraq, that it will require five years to recruit \n     and train a full force of 75,000 officers, and that at least \n     5500 additional international police are needed to train, \n     assist and jointly patrol with the existing Iraqi police \n     force;\n       (8) President Bush has noted that ``The rise of Iraq, as an \n     example of moderation and democracy and prosperity, is a \n     massive and long-term undertaking,'' and it is clear that \n     increasing the number of troops and police from countries \n     other than the United States will reduce risks to American \n     soldiers and the financial cost to the United States;\n       (9) Secretary Rumsfeld testified that ``We certainly want \n     assistance from NATO and from NATO countries'' and it is \n     clear that involving the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, \n     as is being done in Afghanistan and has been done in Kosovo \n     and Bosnia, allows the Coalition to maintain a robust \n     military presence while decreasing the exposure and risk to \n     American troops; and\n       (10) Rebuilding Iraq's neglected infrastructure and economy \n     and administering Iraq--including providing basic services \n     and paying public sector salaries--is likely to require tens \n     of billions of dollars over several years and projected Iraqi \n     oil revenues will be insufficient to meet these costs.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that:\n       (1) It is in the national security interests of the United \n     States to remain engaged in Iraq in order to ensure a \n     peaceful, stable, unified Iraq with a representative \n     government.\n\n[[Page S9197]]\n\n       (2) The President should request formally and expeditiously \n     that NATO raise a force for deployment in post-war Iraq \n     similar to what it has done in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Kosovo \n     and the Congress urges NATO allies and other nations to \n     provide troops and police to Coalition efforts in Iraq.\n       (3) The President should call on the United Nations to urge \n     its member states to provide military forces and civilian \n     police to promote stability and security in Iraq and \n     resources to help rebuild and administer Iraq.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Indiana for his \ntolerance. I don't usually send to the desk, in the 30-plus years I \nhave been here, sense-of-the-Senate resolutions. But this is a sense-\nof-the-Congress resolution. I don't send those, either. But I want to \nexplain, before I explain what this resolution does, why I am doing \nthis.\n  I am of the view--and I am not suggesting the chairman shares my \nview, or anyone else does--that the President's attitude as to how to \nproceed on Iraq from this moment on is in play and being influenced by \ntwo very important elements of his administration. I am of the view, \nspeaking for myself, that Mr. Cheney and Mr. Rumsfeld, and others in \nthe administration--who are referred to, not in a negative sense but \nstraightforwardly, as the so-called neoconservatives of the \nadministration in foreign policy--are importuning the President on one \ncourse of action.\n  I am of the view that the Secretary of State--and I do not speak for \nthe Secretary of State; I do not suggest he has represented to me what \nI am about to say--but I believe the Secretary of State and a lot of \nthe uniformed military are suggesting the President take another course \nof action, not drastically different but different relative to the \nissue of post-Saddam Iraq: How do we win the peace?\n  So it is my hope and my view that this is an appropriate place for \nthe Senate to weigh in on what I believe to be an ongoing debate. I \nknow it is an ongoing debate within the administration on a matter on \nwhich I do not believe the President has fully made up his mind. That \nis not a criticism. That is not meant to be a criticism. It is an \nobservation because a lot of these issues are in play.\n  Let me illustrate what I mean by that.\n  The President bought on to a position proffered by the Secretary of \nDefense, prior to us going into Iraq, that in a post-Saddam Iraq we \nwould have a general, named Garner, who would move in, and along with \nGeneral Franks, he, General Garner, would put together the political, \neconomic, and reconstructive pieces of this; that he would set up an \nIraqi Government very quickly; that there would be in place an \ninfrastructure of a bureaucracy; a significant element of an army that \nhad been beheaded of the Baathist Party elements; and that a police \nforce would be up and standing, once you took out the Baathist \nelements; and there would be something to work with.\n  Well, we held hearings, as did my friend, Senator Kennedy, in the \nArmed Services Committee, and that was not what the experts told us \nprior to us going into Iraq. But that is what Mr. Rumsfeld, and others, \nconvinced the President would be the case. So right afterwards, Mr. \nChalabi landed in southern Iraq. General Garner was in there shortly \nafter that. We started down a course that was based upon that \nrecommendation. It became obvious, almost instantly, that it was not a \nvery well-thought-out or likely-to-succeed initiative. So what \nhappened?\n  The President, importuned again by others in his administration, \nimmediately corrected course, I think correctly so, and to his credit. \nHe very shortly pulled out General Garner. He came along and put in an \nambassador named Bremer, who is a first-class guy, put in a different \nteam, brought in public information officers from the military, and did \nother things which literally changed the course that was planned.\n  Now look, again, not a criticism. I am complimenting the President \nbecause he realized the first course set out was not likely to succeed \nand he changed course. That is what good leaders do when faced with an \nobject in their way that is not able to be surmounted by the game plan \nthey have in place.\n\n  If anybody thinks I am exaggerating this, remember what Ambassador \nBremer had to say: We are not going to hold elections right away. We \nare not going to move forward and set up an Iraqi Government. We are \nnot going to have Mr. Chalabi running the show, et cetera. I happen to \nthink these were correct decisions.\n  My point is, the President saw the unlikely prospects of the first \ncourse of action succeeding and he changed course. That is good.\n  Now, there are other things that are now in play--in my view, if he \ndoes not change course, we are going to reap the whirlwind in Iraq. We \nare starting from an incredibly difficult situation. I said in Iraq, \nwhen we were last there with the chairman, Senator Lugar--and have said \nsince--that if the Lord Almighty came down and stood in the well of the \nSenate and said: ``I have told the President the right answers to the \nnext 15 decisions he has to make on Iraq''--we would still only have a \n65- or 70-percent chance of getting it right in Iraq because there are \nanother 30 decisions to follow.\n  This is a complicated problem. This is a country that really isn't a \ncountry. This is not a country in a way most Americans think of it. \nThis is the idea of the Brits. After 1919, they put together three \ndesperate elements--two Arab, one Indo-European--into the borders that \nnow constitute Iraq, in a circumstance that is difficult, at best, to \nmake work. The only way it has worked, quote, unquote and been held \ntogether since then, is with either an outside power or an \nauthoritarian ruler.\n  So what are we doing now? The President is saying he wants to \nestablish a democracy there. I, quite frankly, think that is a bridge \ntoo far. If we establish a participatory government that is a republic, \nthat takes into consideration in its constitution each of the major \nelements of that country, in a way that gives them representation but \nfalls short of a liberal democracy, I will be happy. I will be happy. I \nwill consider that a success.\n  So the point I am making is, this is very difficult.\n  What are the immediate obstacles we are facing now? I do not have to \ntell anybody in this Chamber. All my colleagues are well-informed women \nand men. The first obstacle is, it has proven to be incredibly \ndifficult to stand up the infrastructure of Iraq.\n  We were there. We did a press conference. I think it was literally \nabout 120 degrees. At another press conference there, it was 114 \ndegrees. That I know for certain. My point is, it is hot there. Guess \nwhat. Failure to have refrigeration, failure to have lighting, failure \nto have air-conditioning ``ain't'' like failing to have it even on a \nsteamy day in Washington.\n  What happens when it gets to be 95 degrees in Washington, DC, or \nWilmington, DE? We send out social service agencies to go out to every \narea we know of, or people with meals on wheels, to make sure their \nwindows are up and their air-conditioning working, because people die.\n  I want to put this issue in perspective. Not having air-conditioning, \nnot having lighting, not having electricity in a country where it is \nnot unusual to have 125 degree temperature for a long stretch of time \nis more than an inconvenience.\n  Now, we are doing everything possible. The Corps of Engineers is in \nthere. We have private contractors in there. We have let contracts, \neven contracts I have criticized. Bechtel gets a contract without even \na bid. But the point is, we are moving as fast as we can.\n  But we have a second problem. The second problem is: the expectations \nof the Iraqi people. They think we are the Second Coming. They cannot \nbelieve that we, the United States of America, within roughly 4 weeks \nwere able to topple this guy they thought was invincible.\n  We were able to take this several-hundred-thousand-person army and \ndecimate it and have it evaporate, to take the thought-to-be-12-foot-\ntall Republican Guard, and vanquish it. What do they think? They think \nwe can do anything. So they don't believe now, many of them, that their \nfailure to have these amenities is because we can't get it done quickly \nenough. They believe we don't want to do it because if we did, we could \nsnap our fingers. We are the United States.\n  There is a third piece here. They don't understand because we are not \nbroadcasting it, in my view, sufficiently well, that when we do stand \nup\n\n[[Page S9198]]\n\na power grid, the Iraqis, whether it is the fedayeen, whether it is the \nleft over remnants of the Baathist Party, whether it is the Sunni in \nthe so-called Sunni triangle, whether it is the Shia who are angry--\nwhoever it is--they don't understand that Iraqis are blowing up the \ngrids. We get it done; they go blow it up guerrilla warfare style--\nblowing up the oil fields, the pipelines. So what do we do about that? \nThat is our first big problem, a perception and a reality of not \nsufficiently quick movement.\n  There is a second big problem we have, among many others, although I \nam sure the chairman would rather I not be bringing up this sense of \nthe Senate. I will not state where I know he and I agree, and you \nshould not imply we agree; you should not infer from what I say that we \nagree on this. Many people believe, on both sides of the aisle, that we \nhave to internationalize this effort from the standpoint of the \nmilitary.\n  There are two reasons for that. People like me believe we don't have \nenough firepower there because this is a big country. Let me overstate \nthe point. Let's assume we had 250,000 people there instead of 140,000. \nWe don't have the ability to do that, practically speaking. We would be \nable to guard more pipelines. We would be able to guard more electric \ngrids. We would be able to have a better chance.\n  I am not proposing we add American forces. I am proposing we call \nupon our NATO allies and the coalition of the willing in earnest to \nprovide significant increases in the number of forces we have, allowing \nus in the near term to draw down some of our forces. We have 10 \ndivisions. Seven of them are tied down in Afghanistan, Iraq, Bosnia and \nKosovo. We only have three divisions left.\n  It seems to me--speaking for myself, but I am confident I speak for a \nsignificant number of Republicans and Democrats--this is the time to, \nas they used to say when my sons were younger, ``get over it.'' Ask \nNATO. Ask them: Please, come help. Make this a NATO operation with a \nU.S. commander with a U.S. helmet, with us in charge, but get more \nfirepower in there.\n  There is a debate about that. Mr. Rumsfeld is saying: We don't need \nany more. We were over in Iraq. Without identifying their ranks, a \nnumber of officers with whom I met--and I suspect the chairman and \nSenator Hagel and the delegation from the Armed Services Committee that \nwent over had similar experiences--all thought, we have to change the \nboard here. And the rumors were rife, including on an Air National \nGuard plane that took us into Iraq that happened to be the Delaware Air \nNational Guard.\n  Those guys were saying: The rumors are, we are going to get down to \n30,000 forces over here by January.\n  That is foolish. That is absolutely beyond comprehension unless we \nare saying we are just pulling out; we are just giving up on what we \nsay our objectives were.\n\n  I found fascinating--it is almost on point--Secretary Rumsfeld's \ntestimony yesterday about the number of troops needed and whether or \nnot NATO has been asked to participate. Again, I defer to my friend \nfrom Massachusetts who was at that hearing. I wasn't at the hearing. \nBut this is actually a news report of it:\n  When first asked whether the administration had asked France and \nGermany, whose leaders vigorously opposed the invasion of Iraq, to \ncontribute to postwar peacekeeping, Rumsfeld said, ``I'll have to \nask.'' After checking during the break in the hearing, he said that \nthey been asked at least once, last December, which was before the \nFrench and German opposition to the war became a major disruption in \ntransatlantic relations. And when asked if a request had been made \nsince then, he said, ``I have no idea.''\n  This is the Secretary of Defense.\n  ``I'd be happy to run around and try to find out the answer to \nthat.''\n  As they say in my neighborhood: Give me a break. The Secretary of \nDefense doesn't know whether or not on his watch, NATO, the French, the \nGermans have been asked to contribute.\n  On the same trip only 10 days ago or thereabouts, we started off at a \nconference, appropriately, at the Dead Sea in Jordan. It was sponsored \nby the World Economic Forum. I met with a guy we all know well, a guy \nwho has been my friend and acquaintance for almost 20 years, the head \nof NATO, the Secretary General, Lord Robertson. I pulled him aside. I \nsaid: Let me ask you a question: Has NATO been asked to make a \nsignificant contribution, other than providing logistical support for \nthe Polish forces going in? Would they go in?\n  He said: Joe, you have to ask.\n  Here is the Secretary of Defense who says he doesn't know whether we \nhave asked NATO. And the Secretary General of NATO is saying: You have \nto ask.\n  What happens if I ask, George?\n  He said: They will go.\n  So the reason I give you that background is, the President, I am \nconfident, is being told by some in his administration: Don't ask the \nFrench and don't ask the Germans. They weren't with us in the first \nplace. Don't ask.\n  I am confident some are further saying: Don't make this a NATO \noperation. With us, remember, we run the show in NATO, in practical \nterms and, on the ground, in specific terms.\n  I am also positive there are other high-ranking administration \nofficials saying: Ask. Ask. Get NATO involved.\n  So why am I doing this sense of the Congress? I want Congress to go \non record weighing in on the side of the administration and saying: \nAsk.\n  Is the President still in play? To the best of my knowledge--and I am \nnot a confidant of the President, although he is kind enough to speak \nto me whenever I ask to speak to him, and occasionally he asks to speak \nto me when I don't ask--it is my impression that the President is in \nplay on this. He has not made up his mind, in my view--maybe he has--\nwhich course to take. I think it is a profoundly important decision he \nhas to make, not only in terms of relieving pressure on American \nmilitary fighting women and men and providing additional military \ncapacity, but for a second reason. I know my friend agrees with this \nbecause he and I started talking about it separately and collectively \nback in September of last year: It makes a difference whether we are \nviewed as occupiers or liberators, whether we are the only guys in \ntown. It is kind of hard for extremists to make the case in the Arab \nworld that we are occupiers if there is truly a genuine multinational \nforce headed by Americans as opposed to an American force with a few \nmultinational people helping out.\n\n  Remember, we were told that 40 nations were a part of this war \neffort. Well, maybe a couple sent observers, but there were really only \nfour nations involved--England, Australia, the U.S., and Poland. There \nwere another 36 or so nations that said they supported us, and if they \nallowed an overflight of American forces, then they were part of the \nwar effort.\n  That is not what I am looking for. I want, when Iraqis go down the \nstreet, to see not just an American soldier at the checkpoint. This is \ngoing to sound tough and maybe even unfair, but I don't want every kid \nthat is blown up at a checkpoint being an American soldier. This is the \nworld's problem, not just ours. I want to give the French--as mad as \nthe administration might be at them--the honor and the opportunity to \ndo the same thing as our young men do. I said before this war began--\nand I supported this war and I voted for it and I helped shape the \nresolution that allowed it--if we did not internationalize this \nrapidly, somewhere between 2 and 10 body bags a week would come home \nfor the indefinite future. Unfortunately, it is one of the prophesies I \nmade on this floor and in other places that I wish had never turned out \nto be correct.\n  The fact is, we will get a lot more support from the Iraqis who will \nbe a lot less suspect of us if we are not the only game in town. That \nis the second reason to internationalize.\n  There is a third piece of this resolution that says it is in the \nnational interest of the United States to remain engaged in Iraq in \norder to assure a peaceful, stable, and unified Iraq with a \nrepresentative government.\n  Look folks, I believe the President has been missing in action in \nexplaining to the American people why it is important that we stay in \nIraq. He needs to go on national television just as definitively as he \ndid in making the case to go into Iraq, and explain why it is \ncritically important that we stay in Iraq until it is stable, unified, \nand has\n\n[[Page S9199]]\n\na representative government. The President must explain that to the \nAmerican people.\n  The reason he must is the fear that a number of our military had in \nQatar when I visited them with Senator Hagel in November or December \nbefore the war. We had over 100 generals in one room. When I was asked \nby General Franks if I would speak to them, I asked why. He said just \nanswer their questions. They wanted to know whether or not the American \npublic would be supporting them--not during the war or immediately in \nthe aftermath, but whether they would stick with them in the long haul. \nThese are smart men and women. They knew they were going to be locked \ndown there for a long time.\n  My answer to them then was very straightforward. I said the one thing \nI hope we have all learned from the Vietnam experience--whether you \nwere for or against the war and you went to Canada--there is only one \nthing I know everybody agrees on: a foreign policy, no matter how well \nthought out, will not and cannot be sustained without the informed \nconsent of the American people before it is initiated. There has \nbeen no informed consent. By ``informed,'' I mean the people are not \neven, to this moment, being told what the administration knows to be \ntrue: One, we are going to be there for a long time. We are going to be \nthere with tens of thousands of troops for a long time. Johnny and Jane \nare not going to come marching home from Iraq any time soon. That is \nnot a criticism on my part, that is the reality. We knew that before we \nwent in. But we did not tell the American people.\n\n  The second thing the American people have not been told since the war \nended is why it is important to stay in Iraq. I am assuming the reason \nthe President won't go on television and say that is because, if he \ndoes, he has to say, prior to that, that we are going to stay in Iraq \nand have a lot of people stay in Iraq. The chairman called a hearing \njust after the war. We had expert testimony from the White House that \nsaid it costs $2 billion a month to maintain troops there. We had a \nsecond hearing and they said it is going to cost $3 billion a month. \nThis is a matter of a week.\n  At the third hearing, yesterday, they said $3.9 billion. I have been \nagreeing with the chairman that we should hold more hearings, but I am \nnot sure we should because it may go up to $5 billion. I am not sure I \nwant to hear the answer.\n  But the truth is that the American people still think Iraqi oil \nrevenues are going to pay for this. Not a shot. Not a shot. When we \nwere in Iraq, we met with a first-rate oil man who was picked by the \nadministration to come over and handle the oil interests of Iraq for \nthe Iraqi people and to get it up and running. He sat with us in the \nonly air-conditioned room I am aware of in probably all of Baghdad. By \nthe way, our people don't work in air-conditioning either. He said: \nLook, if everything goes well and things don't get sabotaged, Iraq may \ngenerate $5 billion worth of profit--in effect, revenues--in 2003. Next \nyear, if everything goes swimmingly well, that number will be $14 \nbillion. Hear that? From now through the whole next calendar year, the \nnext year and a half, there may be, if all goes well, about $19 billion \nin revenue to reconstruct Iraq. It is going to cost us almost $4 \nbillion a month just to keep American forces in Iraq at the present \nlevels.\n  I have heard administration witnesses before us. The last \nadministration witness before the Foreign Relations Committee got his \nskin ripped off by our good friend Senator Hagel when asked how many \nfolks are going to be needed. He said, ``I have no idea.'' No idea? \nEverybody has an idea. The idea is that General Shinseki was a heck of \na lot smarter than Secretary Rumsfeld and a heck of a lot closer to \nwhat the number is likely to be. So at $4 billion a month, we are going \nto be spending about $70 or $80 billion in the next year and a half \njust to keep American troops there. Just putting this into perspective, \nthere will be--maybe--$19 billion worth of Iraqi oil reserves in that \nperiod.\n  By the way, we are not going to spend a penny of that to maintain \nAmerican forces. That is the Iraqi people's money the President said, \nand rightly so. The World Bank is coming in, and others, to give an \nestimate of the cost of reconstructing Iraq. But I would bet my life it \nis going to be more than $19 billion.\n  Again, why do I mention this? The President has to come forward \nbecause I do not want to be on this floor and be one of only several \npeople, along with the chairman and others, who continue to vote \nwhatever is needed to get the job done with my constituents back home \nsaying: What are you doing that for? Why aren't you putting more money \nin education? Why aren't you putting more money in tax cuts? Why aren't \nyou putting more money in taking care of my roads? Why aren't you \nputting more money in--whatever. Because the President does not have \nthe political vision and the willingness to go before the American \npeople and say straightforwardly: This is going to cost us tens of \nbillions of dollars beyond what we are spending now. It is going to \ntake tens of thousands of forces, which I support. This is not a cry to \npull forces out. It is a cry to say: Please, Mr. President, level with \nthe American people.\n  The third part of this resolution--I won't go on much longer and I \nnote this is the only time I have spoken on this bill--is also a sense \nof the Congress:\n  The President should call on the United Nations to urge its member \nstates to provide military forces and civilian police to promote \nstability and security in Iraq and resources to help rebuild and \nadminister Iraq.\n  There are two pieces I have not spoken to yet. I think there is \ncontinuing debate within the administration and I would like the \nCongress to weigh in to try to persuade the President the right way and \nto reject the suggestions being made by those who have been operating \nthe policy in post-conflict Iraq so far. I do not mean the people in \nIraq, I mean here in Washington.\n  We sat out at a police training academy. I think I have made a dozen \nvisits over 10 years to Bosnia and Kosovo. I believe I have spent more \ntime in those two countries before, during, and after those wars than \nany Member of Congress. I could be wrong, but I think I have. My son, \nwho is at the Justice Department, got sent over to Bosnia to be the \nJustice Department coordinator in a Republican administration, not by \nme, and over to Kosovo to help them set up a criminal justice system \nand a police force.\n  We have learned a lot from our experience in setting up and \nmaintaining public order in Bosnia, and we improved it in Kosovo and in \nAfghanistan. The people who are over there now, appointed by President \nBush, are top notch--such as former New York City Police Commissioner \nKerik who is respected by everyone. His top people have extensive \nexperience in both Bosnia and Kosovo and we should be proud of the team \nwe have. I just wish the folks in Washington would listen to them.\n  We spent more than an hour, I believe, at the police academy. And we \nwere told by these first-rate pros that it is going to take at least 1 \nyear to recruit and train a police force of 40,000 people, which they \nargue would provide only minimal police functions, and 5 years to build \na force back up to 75,000 people.\n  I asked a guy who has extensive experience, in front of my colleagues \nand in front of all the military there: Who is in charge of the prison \nsystem? He said: There is no prison now. There is not a prison in all \nof Iraq that we would call a prison--maybe the equivalent of a dungeon, \nbut not a prison.\n  I turned to him and said: If you had all the resources you needed, \nall the help you wanted, and all the personnel you needed, how long \nwould it take you to set up a prison system in Iraq from this day on? \nHe said 3 years.\n\n  It is going to take 3 years minimum to set up, with all the \nresources, a prison system. It is going to take, according to our own \nadministration experts on the ground, a year to minimally train 40,000 \npolice, and 5 years to build a force up to 75,000.\n  Then came the kicker. What do you need? They said: We need right \naway, in addition to the MPs we have, which are stretched beyond \nlimit--because most of the MPs are reserve officers and can you ask \nReserves who have been there 6 months to stay another year, year and a \nhalf?--we need 5,500 trained, hardnosed European police officers, \ncarabinieri, now to take over\n\n[[Page S9200]]\n\nthese functions and help us train the Iraqi police force.\n  I might add parenthetically, our intelligence was abysmal on this \npoint. The 78,000 police officers and the 10,000 or 20,000 member \nquasi-military--they weren't trained by what we call a trained police \nofficer. An example was given: If there was murder in an apartment \nbuilding, the police did not go to the apartment building to \ninvestigate the murder. They sent a notice to the apartment, and \neverybody emptied out of the apartment building and went down to the \npolice station.\n  There is no police force as we think of it. There were none as we \nthink of them in Iraq. So the fact that somebody in the intelligence \ncommunity did not tell the President that their police force is not our \nidea of a police force that could help maintain order is an abysmal \nfailure. We have to deal with it.\n  The third part of this resolution, to promote stability and security, \nis to have a civilian police force and to ask for the use of diplomacy \nwith our French friends, our German friends, our Spanish friends, our \nItalian friends who are already sending some police there: Help us now.\n  There is more to say. If we continue to comprise 80 to 90 percent of \nour forces on the ground, be sure we will get at least 80 or 90 percent \nof the blame for everything that happens in Iraq. If it is an American \npolice officer, an American MP, an American soldier who is the one \nattempting to settle whatever the dispute is, just remember, we are \ngoing to take the blame. I would like to share the responsibility a \nlittle bit beyond what we have now.\n  All I have suggested is not prescriptive in the literal sense. It \ndoes not require the President to actually find 5,500 police. It does \nnot require him to do anything. But this is for us to weigh in on the \nside of the voices within the administration that say: We have to get \nsmarter about how we are doing this.\n  The last point I will make is, we now, in a physical sense, control \nIraqi television. We are told by those with whom we visited--and two \nsenior staff members, one Republican and one Democrat, who stayed \nbehind for another week or so in Iraq confirmed this--that what we \nbasically have 4 hours of television a day with Americans talking on \nit. They're trying to explain our position on television and, though \nthey do not mean it to be, it sounds as if it is propaganda.\n  With Al-Jazeera in Iraq, with Iranian television flooding in, with \nall the slant that these guys have, why we do not have the Board of \nInternational Broadcasting, why we do not have USI, why we do not have \nsomebody in there setting up that television quickly, finding Iraqi \nnewspeople, Iraqi personalities, explaining what happened, why the \nlights are not on, why the group of Iraqis under Saddam's former sway \nhave blown up a pipeline or the reason why the grid went out in \nsouthern Baghdad is beyond me.\n  Granted, it is hard to get all of this going, and I end by saying the \nvery prescriptions I have offered, the very proposals or the direction \nI think we should be going may very well change. It is a fluid \nsituation. One thing I am confident of right now, we do not have enough \npolice to stand up a real force to restore order within the time we \nneed.\n  We are going to lose the support of the Iraqi people to the extent we \nhave it but, more importantly, and what worries me more, we are going \nto lose the support of the American people. The American people are \ngoing to start to say to us, and maybe even some people who are \nwatching this right now in person or on television are going to say, \nwhy is Biden saying we should stay there? We had two more kids killed \ntoday, nine kids killed yesterday and four kids the day before--not \nkids but soldiers, warriors. I do not want to stay there. Bring them \nhome.\n  The President has to go on the air and say if we bring them home, we \nwill inherent the wind, because if the American people understand why \nit is critical to stay there, they will be prepared to come up with the \nmoney, the time, and the risk to stay there.\n  The President has to ask them. He has to ask the American people. He \nhas to ask the French, the Germans, NATO. I hope those who are \ncounseling him not to are not doing it out of false pride.\n  My dad, who passed away a little while ago, used to say, only a big \nman can bend a considerable distance. We are the big man. We should act \nlike it. Not in terms of taunts, bring them on, but in terms of saying, \ncome on, help us, it is in your interest as much as it is ours.\n  The President is very popular. He has done some very good things. In \nmy humble opinion, he should use some of that stored-up popularity to \nmake what I acknowledge is an unpopular case: My fellow Americans, we \nmust stay in Iraq because if we do not the following will happen, and \nif we stay in Iraq, it means this is what I am going to be asking of \nyou, this is the sacrifice I am going to be asking of you, and, by the \nway, I am asking the rest of the world in a real sense to help us.\n  I am waiting for that speech. I am waiting for that to happen. If it \ndoes not happen, I fear we will lose support in Iraq very quickly, we \nwill lose it at home very shortly, and we will lose it in fact in the \nnear term. That is not why I voted to go into Iraq. That is not why I \nvoted to go into Iraq.\n  By the way, I sent this amendment up on behalf of myself, Senator \nLevin, and Senator Daschle. I now ask unanimous consent that Senator \nKennedy be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, as I said, this is a sense-of-the-Congress \nresolution. It is meant, quite frankly, as the only way I know how to \nweigh in on the debate that is going on at the White House; to add \nanother collective voice from another branch of the Government as to \nhow we should proceed. It is not meant as a criticism of the President. \nIt is not meant as a criticism of his policy. It is an observation. \nJust as he stated his initial game plan was not workable and he changed \nit, I respectfully suggest that unless we change the game plan here, we \nare going to be in for some real trouble.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1190, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, could I inquire of the Senator if he would \nbe prepared to modify his amendment in two ways? In the-sense-of-\nCongress section, the second sentence, ``the President should request \nformally and expeditiously,'' would the Senator use the word \n``consider,'' ``the President should consider formally and \nexpeditiously,'' and in the second one, ``the President should consider \ncalling on the United Nations''? I modify it in that way in that the \nSenator has suggested the President is weighing these options. We have \noffered at least some ideas as to what he ought to weigh, clearly for \nthe reasons stated earlier.\n  My own view is if the Senator would be prepared to modify his \nsentences in that way, to use the word ``consider'' rather than \n``request,'' I would be prepared to accept the amendment and proceed \nwith the Senator at least in a bipartisan statement with which I \ngenerally agree.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Quite frankly, I am much less wedded to the particular \nverbiage of this resolution than I am to staying bipartisan, because \nthat is what the chairman and I have been trying to do throughout. So I \nask unanimous consent that my amendment be modified on page 2, \nparagraph 2, to say that ``the President should consider requesting,'' \nadding the word ``consider,'' and I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment to say ``the President should consider calling on the United \nNations.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nso modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1190), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert:\n       Sec.   . In appreciation of our armed forces and regarding \n     restoring stability and security in Iraq.\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States, with the support of forces from \n     Great Britain and other countries, historically and \n     courageously liberated Iraq in three weeks;\n       (2) Conditions on the ground in parts of Iraq continue to \n     pose a grave threat to American troops, thereby complicating \n     efforts to restore law and order and essentially public \n     services for Iraqis and these efforts are further complicated \n     by the absence of effective communications with the Iraqi \n     people;\n\n[[Page S9201]]\n\n       (3) Ultimately, maintaining law and order in Iraq and \n     preserving its territorial integrity will require the \n     creation of a professionally trained Iraqi police force and a \n     reformed Iraqi military but that will take a significant \n     amount of time and in the meantime international armed forces \n     and police must assume these responsibilities;\n       (4) Approximately 145,000 U.S. troops are currently \n     deployed in Iraq, meaning that American troops comprise \n     roughly 90% of Coalition forces, and even if, as the \n     Department of Defense has stated, an additional 10,000 \n     international troops join the Coalition effort in Iraq by \n     September, Americans will still comprise roughly 85% of \n     Coalition forces;\n       (5) Maintaining the existing force level in Iraq currently \n     requires $3.9 billion each month;\n       (6) The Department of Defense has stated that it will \n     require one year to train a new Iraqi Army of 12,000 soldiers \n     and three years to train 40,000 soldiers;\n       (7) The Coalition Provisional Authority has stated that it \n     will require at least one year to recruit and train a police \n     force of 40,000 officers capable of assuming minimal policy \n     functions in Iraq, that it will require five years to recruit \n     and train a full force of 75,000 officers, and that at least \n     5500 additional international police are needed to train, \n     assist and jointly patrol with the existing Iraqi police \n     force;\n       (8) President Bush has noted that ``The rise of Iraq, as an \n     example of moderation and democracy and prosperity, is a \n     massive and long-term undertaking,'' and it is clear that \n     increasing the number of troops and police from countries \n     other than the United States will reduce risks to American \n     soldiers and the financial cost to the United States;\n       (9) Secretary Rumsfeld testified that ``We certainly want \n     assistance from NATO and from NATO countries'' and it is \n     clear that involving the North Atlantic Organization, as is \n     being done in Afghanistan and has been done in Kosovo and \n     Bosnia, allows the Coalition to maintain a robust military \n     presence while decreasing the exposure and risk to American \n     troops; and\n       (10) Rebuilding Iraq's neglected infrastructure and economy \n     and administering Iraq--including providing basic services \n     and paying public sector salaries--is likely to require tens \n     of billions of dollars over several years and projected Iraqi \n     oil revenues will be insufficient to meet these costs.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that\n       (1) It is in the national security interests of the United \n     States to remain engaged in Iraq in order to ensure a \n     peaceful, stable, unified Iraq with a representative \n     government;\n       (2) The President should consider requesting formally and \n     expeditiously that NATO raise a force for deployment in post-\n     war Iraq similar to what it has done in Afghanistan, Bosnia \n     and Kosovo and the Congress urges NATO allies and other \n     nations to provide troops and police to Coalition efforts in \n     Iraq.\n       (3) The President should consider calling on the United \n     Nations to urge its member states to provide military forces \n     and civilian police to promote stability and security in Iraq \n     and resources to help rebuild and administer Iraq.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask my friend whether or not he would \nobject, because a number of people on my side, including the major \nsponsor who helped on this, Senator Levin, wanted to have a rollcall \nvote. Does he have an objection to a rollcall vote on this?\n  Mr. LUGAR. In response to the Senator, my preference would be that we \nwould not have a rollcall vote; that it could proceed by voice vote. I \nsay this advisedly, but I presume many Members on both sides will \ngenerally agree with this. This is very complex language and analysis. \nI think there is general feeling that the chairman and ranking member \nhave been through this experience, have gone through this together, and \nour opinions are fairly well understood. I do not want to see a result \nin which there are a fair number of people who feel constrained because \nit is requesting the President to consider these things that it might \nbe considered criticism of him or undermining in any way his \nconsideration of this amendment.\n  Mr. LEVINE. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon in support of the \nBiden, Levin, Daschle amendment.\n  The initial military phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom appears to have \nbeen thoroughly planned and brilliantly executed. Unfortunately, the \ntransition to post-conflict stability operations and the conduct of \nthose operations appear to be far less so. We must succeed in this \nendeavor and we need to understand the strategy for ensuring that \nsuccess. Part of that strategy hopefully would be the attempt to \ninternationalize the security and nation-building efforts. To achieve \nthat end, it is critically important to seek NATO and United Nations \nsupport and endorsement. This would facilitate the recruitment of their \nmember nations to our effort--in terms of providing troops, resources, \nexpertise and international legitimacy.\n  The whole world has a stake in the stability of Iraq. It is a mystery \nto me why the Administration has not reached out to NATO and to the \nU.N. as institutions. Their support could bring significant additional \nforces, such as German and French forces through NATO, and Indian and \nEgyptian forces through a U.N. endorsement.\n  At a hearing before the Armed Services Committee yesterday and in \nresponse to my question as to whether the administration has formally \nrequested NATO assistance in Iraq, Secretary of Defense Donald \nRumsfeld, stated:\n\n     whether the Department of State has instructed the U.S. \n     Ambassador to NATO . . . to issue some sort of a formal \n     request, I don't know.\n       This is too important an issue for that answer to be \n     acceptable.\n\n  We should also end the feud with Germany and France. Those countries \nare major participants with us in Afghanistan and Bosnia and Kosovo. \nThey should be asked to join with us in Iraq. We are going to be in \nIraq a long time and a large number of troops are going to be needed as \nthe President finally acknowledged last week.\n  When I asked Secretary Rumsfeld if Germany and France were on the \nlist of 70 to 90 countries that he said the Department of State had \nissued requests to provide forces for Iraq, he said ``I'll have to ask. \nI would suspect they are.'' That is also an unacceptable answer.\n\n  There are a number of advantages to having a significant number of \nadditional forces from other countries join in the stability operations \nin Iraq. First, some U.S. forces, including Reserves, have seen \nextended combat and other exhausting duty in Iraq and, with U.S. forces \nstretched thin around the world, increasing the number of non-U.S. \nforces who can substitute for us in Iraq, would reduce the numbers of \nand the burden on U.S. forces. As of now, the number of troops of other \ncountries that will be present on the ground will increase from the \npresent number of 12,000 to a total of only about 20,000 to 22,000 by \nthe end of the summer; an increase of a mere 8,000 to 10,000 troops out \nof about 165,000.\n  At the hearing before the Armed Services Committee yesterday and in \nresponse to my question, General Tommy Franks, who was the commander \nwho led U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq until earlier this week, said \nthat the current force level or ``footprint'' of 145,000 U.S. troops in \nIraq would likely remain at that level ``for the foreseeable future.'' \nThat troop level will be difficult to sustain.\n  Second, I would hope that internationalization would serve to reduce \nthe threat to U.S. forces in more ways than reducing the quantity of \nour forces on the ground. Up until now, we have been the main target of \nthose Baathists who stand to lose most when democracy is established in \nIraq, because the United States is principally the country, along with \nBritain, which brought down Saddam's regime which provided privileged \nstatus to the Baathist minority. It would be harder for those Saddam \nloyalists to sustain attacks on forces wearing NATO or U.N. patches on \ntheir shoulders, because it would be dramatized to the people of Iraq \nthat this is not a U.S.-British occupation, but an international effort \nto bring stability to the nation and the region.\n  That is why we are offering this amendment, which expresses the sense \nof Congress that the United States should remain in Iraq in order to \nensure a peaceful, stable, unified Iraq with a representative \ngovernment; that the President should request formally and \nexpeditiously that NATO raise a force for deployment in Iraq and the \nCongress urges NATO allies and other nations to provide troops and \npolice to coalition efforts in Iraq; and that the President should call \non the United Nations to urge its member states to provide military \nforces and civilian police to promote stability and security in Iraq.\n  The United States has taken upon itself the daunting task of nation \nbuilding in both Iraq and Afghanistan. The administration and Congress \nmust work together to ensure success in those endeavors. I hope that \nall of my colleagues will vote for this amendment and that the \nPresident will follow\n\n[[Page S9202]]\n\nthrough with NATO and the United Nations. It appears that both of those \ninstitutions would be responsive to a formal request for assistance and \nthat a number of their member states would provide military forces and \ncivilian police to help the U.S.-led Coalition bring stability and \nsecurity to Iraq so that reconstruction can take place.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield, if he would \npermit me to go into a quorum call for 3 minutes to confer with the \nmajor sponsor of this amendment, I would like to do that and see if we \ncan resolve this quickly. Is that appropriate?\n  Mr. LUGAR. That would be appropriate. I respond further, part of my \nthought, likewise, is the hope we might finish the bill.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am with you there. I promise this quorum call will not \nbe as long as the vote.\n  Mr. LUGAR. But, at the same time, the additional debate and the vote \nwill be time consuming.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I agree.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I am hopeful we will be able to proceed.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I tell my colleagues I will be back asking for the quorum \ncall to be lifted within 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Surely.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1192 to Amendment No. 1136\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, before a quorum call is placed, let me ask \nthat the amendment be temporarily laid aside in order that I propose an \namendment on behalf of Senator Ensign on which there has been agreement \non both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], for Mr. Ensign, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1192.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To fulfill the Administration's request to move towards the \ngoal of achieving a 25 percent UN peacekeeping assessment rate without \n                           incurring arrears)\n\n       Strike Section 401 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 401. LIMITATION ON THE UNITED STATES SHARE OF \n                   ASSESSMENTS FOR UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 404 of the Foreign Relations \n     Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 (Public Law \n     103-236) is amended by amending subparagraph (B), added by \n     Section 402 of P.L. 107-228 (FY 2003 Foreign Relations \n     Authorization Act), to amend subparagraph (iv) as follows and \n     add subparagraph (v) at the end:\n       ``(iv) For assessments made during calendar year 2004, 27.1 \n     percent.\n       ``(v) For assessments made during calendar year 2005, 27.1 \n     percent.''\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of an amendment \nconcerning our U.N. peacekeeping assessment rate. This amendment is \nvery simple. It supports the President's plan to move toward having the \nU.S. share of U.N. peacekeeping costs fall to 25 percent without \nincurring arrears.\n  This history of our financial commitment to U.N. peacekeeping should \nbe a cautionary tale. For instance, from 1988 to 1994, U.N. \npeacekeeping spiraled out of control as the number of operations more \nthan tripled and costs soared from $268 million to $3.5 billion.\n  Finally, in 1994 the Democrat-controlled Congress and President \nClinton enacted legislation unilaterally reducing the U.S. share of the \nU.N. peacekeeping budget from 31 percent to 25 percent. This produced \narrears, but it also produced badly-needed reforms.\n  Indeed, combined with the disastrous U.N. peacekeeping operations in \nSomalia and Bosnia, this drastic action finally helped get the \nattention of other member states. For instance, the U.N. finally set up \na 24-hour-a-day command and control center where military officers \nparticipating in peacekeeping operations could call in to discuss the \nsituations in the field. Results were positive.\n  The annual U.S. peacekeeping bill fell from almost $1 billion to \naround $300 million in 1997.\n  With the historic Helms-Biden U.N. agreement we managed to clear up \nour fair share of arrears in exchange for much needed reforms. Congress \nlater agreed to a glide-path in our peacekeeping assessment rate, still \nmaintaining the 25 percent cap in law but permitting higher authorized \nlevels as we work to achieve that goal.\n  This amendment continues the glide-path. It authorizes an assessment \nlevel of 27.1 percent for the next 2 years, which is the exact level \nthe Bush administration says we need in order to fully fund our \nobligations.\n  To permanently raise the cap to 27.4 percent, as the underlying bill \nseeks to do removes all pressure to reduce the U.S. assessment level \nand reform U.N. peacekeeping. That is unhealthy for the U.S., which \npaid $794 million in U.N. peacekeeping costs last year, and unhealthy \nfor the U.N. which is overly reliant on one nation--the U.S.--for \nfinancial support.\n  Let's fully fund the President's request for U.N. peacekeeping and \nlet him keep the necessary tools he needs to ensure that U.N. \npeacekeeping is as effective as it can be.\n  One of those tools is the 25 percent assessment rate in current law.\n  The White House Statement of Administration Policy calls section 401 \nof this bill, which permanently raises the peacekeeping cap to 27.4 \npercent, a significant provision that restricts the President's ability \nto conduct and manage foreign policy. So I hope that my colleagues will \njoin the White House and State Department in supporting my amendment to \nthis bill.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask that the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment?\n  The amendment (No. 1192) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table is agreed to.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1190\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment. I \ncommend my friend and colleagues, the Senator from Delaware and Senator \nLugar, and Senators Daschle and Levin, for their support on this \namendment.\n  To minimize the strain on American troops and ensure the \nstabilization of Iraq, we need to internationalize the presence in \nIraq. Today, our policy toward Iraq is adrift and American troops and \ntheir families are paying the price. President Bush declared an end to \nmajor hostilities on May 1. Since then, more than 70 American service \nmen and women have been killed. For them and their families the war is \nnot over. We have options and we need not go it alone. We have NATO; we \nhave the United Nations. It is time to mend the fences with our allies \nand work together in order to stabilize Iraq, in order to bring the \npromise of democracy and to minimize the strain on our own troops. We \nshould ask NATO as an institution to join this extremely important \neffort.\n  I welcome the opportunity for the Senate to go on record in support \nof that request.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I say to my friend from Indiana, I don't have anyone else \non this side who wishes to speak to the amendment. I have checked with \nmy leadership, giving people an opportunity to know we will have a \nvote. I ask unanimous consent we move to a vote on this at 20 minutes \nof so people have a little bit of notice there will be a vote, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S9203]]\n\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous consent the vote on the Biden-Levin \namendment begin at 20 minutes to 5 p.m. with no second-degree \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, is there an order for a rollcall vote at \nthis time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an order for a rollcall vote.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1190, as modified. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, earlier today I spoke about the serious \nthreat to U.S. forces that remain engaged in a volatile situation in \nIraq. The same troops that fought and won the war against Iraq are now \nperforming a peacemaking mission with no end in sight.\n  The United States entered this war virtually alone. But the United \nStates, alone, cannot be expected to carry the burden of providing the \nvast majority of troops and the nearly endless amounts of funds that \nwill be required to get Iraq back on its feet. We need the help of the \ninternational community, and we need it now.\n  The administration has the obligation to look out for the welfare of \nour troops by engaging NATO and the United Nations in order to raise a \nlarge peacekeeping force that will share the burdens of occupation with \nthe other nations of the world. There are many countries that have the \ncapability to assist in a peacekeeping mission in Iraq, but first the \nPresident must make the unambiguous call to NATO and the U.N. to appeal \nfor foreign troops and financial contributions.\n  I compliment Senator Biden for his efforts in introducing the \namendment, but the amendment only calls for the President to \n``consider'' the issue of whether to appeal to NATO and the U.N. to \nraise an international peacekeeping force.\n  I have very strong reservations about another provision in this \namendment. The amendment states the sense of Congress that ``it is the \nnational security interests of the United States to remain engaged in \nIraq in order to ensure a peaceful, stable, unified Iraq with a \nrepresentative government.'' Engaged for how long? Surely it is not in \nthe national security interests of the United States to retain a \npermanent presence as a peacekeeping force in Iraq. This particular \nstatement could well lead us down the path to mission creep.\n  Moreover, contrary to the assertions by the President of the United \nStates and others in his administration, I have never believed that it \nwas in the ``national security interests'' to go to war with Iraq to \nbegin with. Subsequent events thus far have not shown that Iraq \nconstituted an imminent threat to the security of our country. \nTragically, the American people were deceived into believing otherwise.\n  I voted for this sense of Congress amendment because it draws \nattention to a critical issue, but the Senate must not wash its hands \nof internationalizing the occupation of Iraq by passing a nonbinding \nresolution which does not actually call on the President to do \nanything.\n\n\n   Amendments Nos. 1193 through 1196, En Bloc, to Amendment No. 1136\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I send to the desk a packet of agreed-on \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar] proposes amendments \n     numbered 1193 through 1196, en bloc.\n       Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \n     reading of the amendments be dispensed with.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. These include an amendment by Senator Warner to strike \nsection 206 of the pending State Department authorization bill relating \nto security capital cost sharing; an amendment by Senator Frist to \ncommend the people of Colombia on the third anniversary of Plan \nColombia; an amendment by Senator Schumer to express the sense of the \nSenate regarding reports to Congress on the National Commission on \nTerrorist Attacks upon the United States; and an amendment by Senators \nDurbin, Mikulski, and Landrieu regarding the Millennium Challenge Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these amendments be agreed to en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to en bloc, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1193\n\n  (Purpose: To strike section 206, relating to security capital cost \n                                sharing)\n\n       Strike section 206.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1194\n\n(Purpose: To commend the leadership and people of Colombia on the third \n                     anniversary of Plan Colombia)\n\n       On page 242, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2522. COMMENDATION OF THE LEADERSHIP AND PEOPLE OF \n                   COLOMBIA ON THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF \n                   PLAN COLOMBIA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) July 13, 2003, marks the third anniversary of the \n     enactment of legislation providing initial United States \n     assistance for the Plan Colombia initiative. Since then, the \n     United States has provided over $3 billion in support of Plan \n     Columbia.\n       (2) During this period, the Government of Colombia, with \n     United States support, has made progress in the eradication \n     and seizure of illegal drugs.\n       (3) According to reports--\n       (A) the total area of coca cultivation in Colombia has \n     declined 59.9 percent from 163,289 hectares in 2000 to \n     102,071 at the end of 2002, with a further additional 65,000 \n     hectares to be sprayed with herbicides in 2003;\n       (B) 3,300 hectares of poppy crop have been sprayed with \n     herbicides in 2002, and an additional 1,658 hectares to be \n     sprayed in 2003; and\n       (C) between January 2002 and May 2003, 100 tons of pure \n     cocaine and 850 kilos of heroin have been seized, with a \n     street value of approximately $3,000,000,000.\n       (4) The armed forces of Colombia have 60 percent more \n     combat-ready troops than in 1999, including three United \n     States-trained counterdrug brigades and five riverine \n     brigades.\n       (5) The armed forces of Colombia are taking steps against \n     the drug traffickers and terrorists in Colombia, as \n     demonstrated by the capture, as of July 2003, of some 3,553\n\n[[Page S9204]]\n\n     guerrillas and 1,336 members of paramilitaries and the \n     surrender of an additional 1,138 members of illegal groups, \n     the destruction of more than 1,000 coca laboratories, the \n     confiscation of solid and liquid chemicals used for \n     manufacturing cocaine, and the seizure of weapons from \n     guerrillas and drug traffickers.\n       (6) In the past several years, the Government of Colombia \n     has extradited 78 persons to the United States to face trial \n     on narcotics and terrorism charges.\n       (7) The Government of Colombia is working to establish law \n     and order in Colombia--\n       (A) homicides have reportedly declined in Colombia during \n     the first months of 2003, as compared to the same period in \n     2002; and\n       (B) kidnappings have reportedly declined during the first \n     months of 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002.\n       (8) The Government of Colombia is training and equipping \n     during 2003, thousands of new police officers who will be \n     stationed in hundreds of rural towns where there is little or \n     no police presence.\n       (9) The Government of Colombia plans to increase defense \n     spending from 3.5 percent of its gross domestic product in \n     2002 to 5.8 percent of its gross domestic product by 2006, \n     and to enlarge its armed forces by 126,000 troops.\n       (10) It is in the national interests of the United States \n     to continue to support the efforts of President Alvaro Uribe \n     Velez of Colombia, and the Government and people of Colombia, \n     to stop narcotics trafficking, end terrorism, strengthen \n     democracy, and protect human rights.\n       (b) Commendation.--The Senate--\n       (1) commends President Alvaro Uribe Velez of Colombia and \n     the Government and the people of Colombia on the third \n     anniversary of Plan Colombia and for their efforts in \n     fighting illegal drugs and terrorism; and\n       (2) supports and encourages the efforts of President Uribe \n     and the Government and people of Colombia to preserve and \n     strengthen democracy, protect human rights, and provide \n     economic opportunity in Colombia.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1195\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that President Bush should \n require all executive agencies to provide full and timely cooperation \n   with the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United \nStates so that the Commission can provide the best possible analysis of \n          how the Nation can prevent future acts of terrorism)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 815. SENSE OF SENATE ON EXECUTIVE BRANCH COOPERATION \n                   WITH THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON TERRORIST \n                   ATTACKS UPON THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) On November 15, 2002, Congress passed legislation by a \n     wide bipartisan margin to establish the National Commission \n     on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States to determine the \n     facts surrounding the attacks of September 11, 2001, and to \n     help the Nation prevent any future terrorist attacks. On \n     November 27, 2002, President Bush signed the legislation into \n     law as title VI of the Intelligence Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-306; 116 Stat. 2408; 6 \n     U.S.C. 101 note).\n       (2) There was broad bipartisan consensus that the work of \n     the Commission was of national importance and of particular \n     significance to the families of the victims of the attacks of \n     September 11, 2001.\n       (3) The work of the Commission is essential to discovering \n     what weaknesses and vulnerabilities were exploited to \n     successfully perpetrate the deadly attacks of September 11, \n     2001.\n       (4) The Commission is required to ``ascertain, evaluate, \n     and report on the evidence developed by all relevant \n     governmental agencies regarding the facts and circumstances \n     surrounding the attacks'' and to complete its work by May, \n     2004.\n       (5) Both the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Commission \n     have recently announced that many of the relevant agencies--\n     most notably the Department of Defense, the Department of \n     Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Central \n     Intelligence Agency--have failed to provide the bulk of the \n     documents the Commission has requested and some of those \n     agencies have prevented the Commission from conducting \n     independent interviews with officials who may have important \n     information about the tragic events of September 11, 2001.\n       (6) Members of the Commission have also acknowledged that \n     if this cooperation is not forthcoming in the next several \n     weeks, the Commission will not be able to meet the May 2004 \n     statutory deadline to conclude its investigation and report \n     its findings to Congress and the President.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) President Bush should immediately and publicly require \n     all executive branch agencies, especially the Department of \n     Defense, the Department of Justice, the Department of \n     Homeland Security, and the Central Intelligence Agency, to \n     provide their fullest and most timely cooperation to the \n     Commission, and permit the Commission unfettered access to \n     agency officials for interviews, so that the Commission can \n     complete its mission in the time allotted by law;\n       (2) the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, \n     the Department of Homeland Security, and the Central \n     Intelligence Agency should submit to Congress, by August 15, \n     2003, and quarterly thereafter for the life of the \n     commission, a report on the actions taken by each such \n     department or agency to comply with the requests of the \n     Commission; and\n       (3) the Commission should submit to Congress and the \n     President, by August 15, 2003, and quarterly thereafter, a \n     report assessing the compliance of each department and agency \n     referred to in paragraph (2) with the requests of the \n     Commission.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1196\n\n (Purpose: To ensure that the benefits under the Millennium Challenge \n   Assistance program are available for the intended beneficiaries, \n                       including women and girls)\n\n       On page 250, line 19, strike ``Such'' and insert ``In \n     recognition of the essential role of women in developing \n     countries, the CEO shall ensure that such indicators, where \n     appropriate, take into account and assess the role of women \n     and girls.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nStevens be added as a cosponsor to amendment No. 1185 which establishes \na parliamentary exchange program with the People's Republic of China.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1194\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to introduce an amendment to the \nforeign assistance authorization bill regarding Colombia.\n  Colombia is one of the oldest democracies in our hemisphere. It is \nunder threat by narcotics traffickers, leftwing guerrillas and \nrightwing paramilitaries. We have been working with the government for \nseveral years to combat the twin threats of narcotics and terrorism and \nto strengthen democracy.\n  President Uribe and the Republic of Colombia have made great strides \nin implementing Plan Colombia, eradicating the production of illegal \ndrugs, providing alternatives to coca and poppy cultivation for \nimpoverished Colombians, establishing law and order, and taking steps \nto protect human rights and to administer justice.\n  The total area of coca cultivation in Colombia has declined markedly \nin the past 3 years, while drug seizures are up. The armed forces of \nColombia are better trained than four years ago. Colombia is also \ntraining and equipping 78,000 new police officers who will be stationed \nin hundreds of rural towns where there is currently little or no police \npresence.\n  The Armed Forces are defeating the narcotics traffickers and \nterrorists in Colombia by capturing to date a total of 3,553 guerillas \nand 1,336 members of paramilitaries; destroying more than 1,000 coca \nlaboratories; confiscating billions of gallons of solid and liquid \nchemicals used for manufacturing cocaine; and seizing more than 4,000 \nweapons from guerillas and traffickers.\n  Colombia has extradited 78 individuals to the United States to face \ntrial for narcotics and terrorist charges.\n  The government of Colombia has made progress in combating crime; \nduring the first months of 2003, homicides have declined 20 percent and \nkidnappings by 40 percent when compared to the same period in 2002.\n  The government of Colombia is committed to increased defense spending \nfrom 3.5 percent of GDP in 2002 to 5.8 percent by 2006, thereby \nenlarging the armed forces by 126,000 troops.\n  The government of Colombia is taking steps to protect the human \nrights of the people of Colombia by establishing the national early \nwarning system to prevent forced displacement and human rights \nviolations; and by providing protection for 2,731 human rights workers, \nlabor leaders, journalists, and local government officials.\n  The government is establishing a judge advocate general center and \nMilitary Penal Justice Corps with U.S. assistance. It is also creating \nhuman rights units under the Colombian Attorney General's Office, the \narmed forces, and the national police.\n  The government of Colombia is taking steps to ensure the fair \nadministration of justice in Colombia by establishing 31 Casas de \nJusticia that have handled 1.6 million cases to date; by creating 19 \noral trial courtrooms and training 3,400 judges to administer justice; \nand by training Colombian law enforcement personnel judges, and \nprosecutors in anticorruption, money-laundering, and antikidnapping \nmeasures.\n  The United States should continue its strong support of the efforts \nof President Uribe, the government, and people of Colombia to stop \nnarcotics trafficking, end terrorism, strengthen democracy, and protect \nhuman rights.\n\n[[Page S9205]]\n\n                           amendment no. 1196\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member \nfor accepting my amendment, cosponsored by Senators Mikulski, Landrieu, \nSnowe, and Hutchison, regarding the Millennium Challenge Account and \nconsidering the role of women and girls in the development process.\n  The Millennium Challenge Account has great potential to make a \nsignificant difference in some of the poorest countries of the world by \nincorporating the best practices that are known to accelerate economic \ndevelopment. The account will create incentives for countries to engage \nin these practices, and builds them into the design of development \nprojects.\n  According to the bill before us, the Millennium Challenge Corporation \nwill use indicators to see which poor countries meet criteria on good \ngovernance, economic freedom, and investing in health care and \neducation. My amendment adds consideration of the role of women and \ngirls in those indicators.\n  Why is this important? Why should women be singled out?\n  One of the strongest lessons we have learned over the last 30 years \nis that when development efforts address the different needs of women \nand the specific barriers they face, countries are more likely to \nsucceed. When the needs of women are not addressed, development \nassistance projects are more likely to fail. It is one of the core \nlessons of development effectiveness.\n  Women are the vast majority of the world's poor. We cannot succeed in \nreducing poverty unless we ensure that women are fully integrated into \nour efforts. Around the world, social, economic, and political barriers \ninhibit women's access to opportunities. If we address these barriers, \nwe can unleash women's potential to contribute to their families, their \ncommunities, and their economies.\n  Empowering women is a smart investment because it will help us \nachieve many of our other goals. Research has shown that: HIV infection \nrates are higher when the gap between men and women in literacy is \nlarger. In agriculture, women have less access to education and to \nlabor, fertilizer, and other inputs than men do in developing \ncountries. When women receive equal access to these inputs, their \nyields for food such as maize, beans, and cowpeas increases by 22 \npercent. According to the World Bank, increased progress in closing the \ngap between men and women in schooling would accelerate economic \ngrowth. Increases in women's education accounted for 43 percent of the \ntotal reduction in child malnutrition in developing countries. In \nEgypt, increasing the education level of mothers from none or less than \nprimary, to completion of primary school reduces the proportion of the \npopulation below the poverty line by 33.7 percent. The probability that \na child will survive in urban Brazil is almost 20 times greater when \nwomen accumulate income rather then men.\n  Lack of understanding of women's roles lowers returns on development \ninvestments. Women participate directly or indirectly in virtually \nevery sector of life in developing countries, from agricultural \nproduction to high-tech manufacturing, but their roles can be \n``invisible''. For example, women in rural Africa are responsible for \n80 percent of agricultural production. However, research shows that, \neven where we can show that women perform the majority of agricultural \nlabor and are responsible for the most food production, agriculture \nextension services seldom reach women. According to a study in Kenya, \nyields among women farmers could increase 7 percent if they were given \nthe same tools, training, and education as male farmers.\n  One of the greatest successes in recent years is microcredit \nprograms, which have targeted women. People in the microcredit movement \nrealized that many poor women have creative ideas and the willingness \nto work hard to improve their economic well-being. What they do not \nhave is access to credit to make those ideas happen. When women cannot \nown property, or travel outside of their villages, they cannot access \ncredit from banks. Microcredit programs bring credit to women, and they \nhave worked. Most microcredit programs have over 95 percent repayment \nrates and have helped many women change their own lives and those of \ntheir families. Unless we ensure that this type of thinking is part of \nthe MCA, we will not succeed.\n  Secretary of State Colin Powell has said that countries that treat \nwomen with dignity and afford them a choice in how they live their \nlives, give them equal access to essential services and an equal \nopportunity to contribute to public life are the countries that are the \nmost stable and viable.\n  The amendment that I have proposed is modest, but it addresses an \nimportant gap to ensure that the MCA achieves its overall purpose. We \nmust address the different needs, roles, barriers, and potential of \nwomen in our development interventions.\n  My amendment would create incentives to developing countries to do so \nby taking into account and assessing the role of women in eligibility \ncriteria.\n  We must ensure that we are doing what we know works to create a \nbetter, more stable world. Unless we ensure that women's roles, as well \nas men's, are fully integrated into the design of the Millennium \nChallenge Account from the outset, we will not succeed.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1197 to Amendment No. 1136\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I send an amendment authored by Senator \nDurbin to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], for Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n     Roberts, Mr. Rockefeller, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Warner, Mr. Lott, \n     Ms. Snowe, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Hagel, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Lugar, \n     Mr. Levin, and Mr. Bond, proposes an amendment No. 1197.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress on an investigation into \n     assertions that Iraq attempted to obtain uranium from Africa)\n\n       On page 94, between lines 17 and 18 insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC. 815. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON AN INVESTIGATION INTO \n                   ASSERTIONS THAT IRAQ ATTEMPTED TO OBTAIN \n                   URANIUM FROM AFRICA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the State of the Union address in January 2003, the \n     President asserted that ``[t]he British government has \n     learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant \n     quantities of uranium from Africa''.\n       (2) It has been determined that the claim regarding the \n     efforts of Iraq to obtain uranium from Africa cannot be \n     substantiated.\n       (3) In May 2003, the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate requested that \n     the Inspector General of the Department of State and the \n     Inspector General of the Central Intelligence Agency work \n     jointly to investigate the handling and characterization of \n     the underlying documents behind the assertions regarding the \n     efforts of Iraq to obtain uranium from Africa.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Congress supports the thorough and expeditious joint \n     investigation by the Inspector General of the Department of \n     State and the Inspector General of Central Intelligence \n     Agency into the documents or other materials that the \n     President relied on to conclude that Iraq had attempted to \n     obtain uranium from Africa;\n       (2) the findings and conclusions of the joint investigation \n     should be completed not later than September 12, 2003; and\n       (3) such findings and conclusions should be unclassified to \n     the maximum extent possible, while fully protecting any \n     intelligence sources or methods.\n       (4) the findings and conclusions of the joint investigation \n     should be sent to the House and Senate Select Committees on \n     Intelligence and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and \n     the House International Relations Committee.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared on both \nsides. I ask unanimous consent that it be passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1197) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in his State of the Union message in \nJanuary of this year, the President discussed the threat posed by \nIraq's nuclear weapons development program. The President went on to \nmake the following statement: ``The British government has learned that \nSaddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from \nAfrica.''\n  After numerous concerns being raised about the veracity of this last \nstatement, the administration has recently\n\n[[Page S9206]]\n\nacknowledged that the President should not have made this claim. In a \nstatement authorized by the White House, a senior Bush administration \nofficial said on Monday, July 7: ``Knowing all that we know now, the \nreference to Iraq's attempt to acquire uranium from Africa should not \nhave been included in the State of the Union speech.''\n  In May of this year, Chairman Pat Roberts and Vice Chairman Jay \nRockefeller of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence requested \nthat the Inspectors General of the Department of State and the Central \nIntelligence Agency work jointly to investigate the handling and \ncharacterization of the underlying documents behind the President's \nstatement.\n  I would note that earlier this year, the International Atomic Energy \nAgency, IAEA, determined that some of the intelligence documents \nprovided to it by the United States are forgeries. These documents were \nprovided to the IAEA as evidence of Iraqi efforts to procure uranium \nfrom the Republic of Niger. In March of this year, Senator Rockefeller \nrequested that the FBI investigate this issue as well.\n  I want to thank the bill managers for accepting the amendment I \nplanned to offer today a ``Sense of the Congress'' amendment to the \nState Authorization Bill which, 1, expresses support for the thorough \nand expeditious joint investigation into this matter by the Inspectors \nGeneral of the Department of State and the CIA; 2, that the findings \nand conclusions of this joint investigation should be completed by \nSeptember 12, 2003; and, 3, that the findings and conclusions of this \njoint investigation should be unclassified to the fullest extent \npossible, consistent with the protection of intelligence sources and \nmethods.\n  I am a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence which is \nconducting a review of pre-war intelligence on the existence of, and \nthe threat posed by, Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, WMD, as well \nas other matters related to pre-war intelligence reporting related to \nIraq.\n  The reported existence of Iraq's WMD and support for international \nterrorism, al-Qaida in particular, were the primary justifications put \nforward for military action against Iraq by the Bush Administration to \nthe Congress, the American public and the international community.\n  There is no more serious undertaking for our government than to take \nour Nation to war. Such a momentous decision must be made on the basis \nof the best intelligence available--and intelligence analysis must be \nobjective and not influenced by policymakers or other outside \npressures.\n  As this issue demonstrates, the administration's intelligence-derived \nassertions about Iraq's level of WMD-related activity raises increased \nconcerns about the integrity of the U.S. intelligence community and the \ncredibility of the U.S. Government--both here and around the world. \nThese concerns are all the more troubling because of the \nadministration's new national strategy of military pre-emption--which \nplaces a premium on timely, accurate and non-political intelligence \nassessments of the threats to our country.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1198 To Amendment No. 1136\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I send an amendment on behalf of Senator \nDorgan to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], for Mr. Dorgan, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1198.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The program will bring 138 Muslim \nstudents to the United States this fall for an academic year of study, \nand 365 more students are expected next fall.\n  The program is modeled on the highly successful program for students \nin the former Soviet Union, and Senator Lugar and I worked together to \ncreate the new program for students from Islamic countries. I \nunderstand that my distinguished colleague has current information on \nits progress.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, it is clear, especially in the aftermath of \nthe war in Iraq, that we have to redouble our efforts to improve \nperceptions about America in the Islamic world. Addressing this urgent \npriority should be high on the State Department's public diplomacy \nagenda.\n  We have heard reports that the program is off to an excellent start. \nDespite the many cultural and political obstacles, recruiting for the \nfirst year has proceeded successfully. Substantial applicant pools \nappeared even in countries where difficulty in attracting applicants \nwas expected. Students are currently being recruited in 12 countries: \nIndonesia, Egypt, Turkey, Nigeria, Tunisia, Lebanon, Morocco, Jordan, \nKuwait, Yemen, United Arab Emirates, Syria, and in West Bank/Gaza as \nwell. Six additional countries--Algeria, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, \nMalaysia, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia--will be added to the program next \nyear. From an applicant pool of 3,000 in Indonesia, 20 have been \nselected. In Turkey, 200 students applied and 20 were chosen. Over 300 \napplications have been received in Jordan. Gender distribution varies \nby country, but we expected that as many as 40 percent of the program \nparticipants will be female.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Unfortunately, although the State Department requested \n$10 million in its fiscal year 2004 budget to continue the program, I \nunderstand that the Office of Management and Budget did not include \nthat request in the administration's final budget. Would the chairman \nagree that this program should be a high priority for the State \nDepartment?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Absolutely. It is vital that once this program gets \nunderway, it proceed with adequate funding to continue its outreach and \neducation efforts. This funding will allow for program growth by \nexpanding participation to other priority countries and by increasing \naccess from the large applicant pools we expect from countries who are \nalready participating. Most importantly, sustainable funding will allow \nthe program to set realistic growth benchmarks, conduct meaningful \nevaluation of outcomes, and add program improvements.\n  There are no better representatives of American values than Americans \nthemselves, and student exchange programs are no effective means of \nreaching out of the next generation of leaders. I look forward to \nworking with the Administration to ensure that this program will \nreceive strong continued support.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to note that the Foreign \nRelations Committee has included a very important provision on global \nclimate change in S. 925, as reported. This provision, section 813, \nexpresses the sense of Congress that the United States should take \nresponsible action to ensure significant and meaningful reductions in \nemissions of greenhouse gases from all sectors. I strongly support this \nprovision. Its inclusion in this legislation should be a signal to all \nthe conferees on this bill and to the world that the Senate strongly \nsupports such reductions.\n  The findings preceding the articulation of the sense of Congress in \nsection 813 are also very important. They clarify that it is Congress' \nposition that evidence continues to demonstrate that increases in \natmospheric concentrations of man-made greenhouse gases are \ncontributing to global climate change.\n  This assertion is supported by reports from the National Academy of \nSciences, the International Panel on Climate Change, and testimony \nbefore various Senate committees, including the Senate Environment and \nPublic Works Committee of which I am the ranking member. We have heard \nrepeatedly that increasing greenhouse gas emissions increase the risks \nassociated with global climate change and warming.\n  I believe it is prudent and practicable to manage these risks now by \nreducing our emissions as swiftly as possible. Based on the work of \nmany highly respected scientists, I believe we must endeavor to prevent \na doubling of atmospheric concentrations of carbon. That means dramatic \nchanges in the way we use, produce and consume fossil fuels in the next \n10 to 15 years.\n  Nearly every single climate expert and scientist believes that the \nfacts require us to take prudent actions now to reduce emissions and \nthereby reduce the risks of climate change. In a December 2002 \nresolution, the American Geophysical Union said the following: ``AGU \nrecommends the development and evaluation of strategies such as \nemissions reduction, carbon sequestration, and adaptation to the \nimpacts of climate change. AGU believes that the present level of \nscientific uncertainty does not justify inaction in the mitigation of \nhuman-induced climate change and/or the adaptation to it.''\n  As much as some people would like to continue debating whether or not \nglobal warming is occurring and whether or not man-made emissions are \ncontributing to that warming, there is not a real debate on this matter \nin the scientific community. They have moved on, as Congress and the \nAdministration should, to trying to define the magnitude of the \nprobable disruption to earth and human systems, and to designing \nemissions reductions and adaptation programs to avert the negative \neffects of that disruption to our quality of life, the environment, and \nthe economy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that four short documents be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nLeading Climate Scientists Reaffirm View That Late 20th Century Warming \n              Was Unusual and Resulted From Human Activity\n\n       Washington.--A group of leading climate scientists has \n     reaffirmed the ``robust consensus view'' emerging from the \n     peer reviewed literature that the warmth experienced on at \n     least a hemispheric scale in the late 20th century was an \n     anomaly in the previous millennium and that human activity \n     likely played an important role in causing it. In so doing, \n     they refuted recent claims that the warmth of recent decades \n     was not unprecedented in the context of the past thousand \n     years.\n       Writing in the 8 July issue of the American Geophysical \n     Union publication Eos, Michael Mann of the University of \n     Virginia and 12\n\n[[Page S9209]]\n\n     colleagues in the United States and United Kingdom endorse \n     the position on climate change and greenhouse gases taken by \n     AGU in 1998. Specifically, they say that ``there is a \n     compelling basis for concern over future climate changes, \n     including increases in global-mean surface temperatures, due \n     to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, primarily \n     from fossil-fuel burning.''\n       The Eos article is a response to two recent and nearly \n     identical papers by Drs. Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas of \n     the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, published in \n     Climate Research and Energy & Environment (the latter paper \n     with additional co-authors). These authors challenge the \n     generally accepted view that natural factors cannot fully \n     explain recent warming and must have been supplemented by \n     significant human activity, and their papers have received \n     attention in the media and in the U.S. Senate. Requests from \n     reporters to top scientists in the field, seeking comment on \n     the Soon and Baliunas position, lead to memoranda that were \n     later expanded into the current Eos article, which was itself \n     peer reviewed.\n       Paleoclimatologists (scientists who study ancient climates) \n     generally rely on instrumental data for the past 150 years \n     and ``proxy'' indicators, such as tree rings, ice cores, \n     corals, and lake sediments to reconstruct the climate of \n     earlier times. Most of the available data pertain to the \n     northern hemisphere and show, according to the authors, that \n     the warmth of the northern hemisphere over the past few \n     decades is likely unprecedented in the last 1,000 years and \n     quite possibly in the preceding 1,000 years as well.\n       Climate model simulations cannot explain the anomalous late \n     20th century warmth without taking into account the \n     contributions of human activities, the authors say. They make \n     three major points regarding Soon and Baliunas's recent \n     assertions challenging these findings.\n       First, in using proxy records to draw inferences about past \n     climate, it is essential to assess their actual sensitivity \n     to temperature variability. In particular, the authors say, \n     Soon and Baliunas misuse proxy data reflective of changes in \n     moisture or drought, rather than temperature, in their \n     analysis.\n       Second, it is essential to distinguish between regional \n     temperature anomalies and hemispheric mean temperature, which \n     must represent an average of estimates over a sufficiently \n     large number of distinct regions. For example, Mann and his \n     co-authors say, the concepts of a ``Little Ice Age'' and \n     ``Medieval Warm Period'' arose from the Eurocentric origins \n     of historic climatology. The specific periods of coldness and \n     warmth differed from region to region and as compared with \n     data for the northern hemisphere as a whole.\n       Third, according to Mann and his colleagues, it is \n     essential to define carefully the modern base period with \n     which past climate is to be compared and to identify and \n     quantify uncertainties. For example, they say, the most \n     recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \n     Change (IPCC) carefully compares data for recent decades with \n     reconstructions of past temperatures, taking into account the \n     uncertainties in those reconstructions. IPCC concluded that \n     late 20th century warmth in the northern hemisphere likely \n     exceeded that of any time in the past millennium. The method \n     used by Soon and Baliunas, they say, considers mean \n     conditions for the entire 20th century as the base period and \n     determines past temperatures from proxy evidence not capable \n     of resolving trends on a decadal basis. It is therefore, they \n     say, of limited value in determining whether recent warming \n     in anomalous in a long term and large scale context.\n       The Eos article started as a memorandum that Michael \n     Oppenheimer and Mann drafted to help inform colleagues who \n     were being contacted by members of the media regarding the \n     Soon and Baliunas papers and wanted an opinion from climate \n     scientists and paleoclimatologists who were directly familiar \n     with the underlying issues.\n       Mann and Oppenheimer learned that a number of other \n     colleagues, including Tom Wigley of the University \n     Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) in Boulder, \n     Colorado; Philip Jones of the University of East Anglia's \n     Climatic Research Unit in Norwich, United Kingdom; and \n     Raymond Bradley of the University of Massachusetts in Amherst \n     were receiving similar media requests for their opinions on \n     the matter. Their original memorandum evolved into a more \n     general position paper jointly authored by a larger group of \n     leading scientists in the field.\n       Mann says he sees the resulting Eos article as representing \n     an even broader consensus of the viewpoint of the mainstream \n     climate research community on the question of late 20th \n     century warming and its causes. The goal of the authors, he \n     says, is to reaffirm support for the AGU position statement \n     on climate change and greenhouse gases and clarify what is \n     currently known from the paleoclimate record of the past one-\n     to-two thousand years and, in particular, what the bearing of \n     this evidence is on the issue of the detection of human \n     influence on recent climate change.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Climate Change and Greenhouse Gases--Adopted by American Geophysical \n                      Union Council December, 2002\n\n       Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other \n     greenhouse gases have substantially increased as a \n     consequence of fossil fuel combustion and other human \n     activities. These elevated concentrations of greenhouse gases \n     are predicted to persist in the atmosphere for times ranging \n     to thousands of years. Increasing concentrations of carbon \n     dioxide and other greenhouse gases affect the Earth-\n     atmosphere energy balance, enhancing the natural greenhouse \n     effect and thereby exerting a warming influence at the \n     Earth's surface.\n       Although greenhouse gas concentrations and their climatic \n     influences are projected to increase, the detailed response \n     of the system is uncertain. Principal sources of this \n     uncertainty are the climate system's inherent complexity and \n     natural variability. The increase in global mean surface \n     temperatures over the past 150 years appears to be unusual in \n     the context of the last few centuries, but it is not clearly \n     outside the range of climate variability of the last few \n     thousand years. The geologic record of the more distant past \n     provides evidence of larger climate variations associated \n     with changes in atmospheric carbondioxide. These changes \n     appear to be consistent with present understanding of the \n     radiative properties of carbon dioxide and of the influence \n     of climate on the carbon cycle. There is no known geologic \n     precedent for the transfer of carbon from the Earth's crust \n     to atmospheric carbon dioxide, in quantities comparable to \n     the burning of fossil fuels, without simultaneous changes in \n     other parts of the carboncycle and climate system. This close \n     coupling between atmospheric carbon dioxide and climate \n     suggests that a change in one would in all likelihood be \n     accompanied by a change in the other.\n       Present understanding of the Earth climate system provides \n     a compelling basis for legitimate public concern over future \n     global-and regional-scale changes resulting from increased \n     concentrations of greenhouse gases. These changes are \n     predicted to include increases in global mean surface \n     temperatures, increases in global mean rates of precipitation \n     and evaporation, rising sea levels, and changes in the \n     biosphere. Understanding of the fundamental processes \n     responsible for global climate change has greatly improved \n     over the past decade, and predictive capabilities are \n     advancing. However, there are significant scientific \n     uncertainties, for example, in predictions of local effects \n     of climate change, occurrence of extreme weather events, \n     effects of aerosols, changes in clouds, shifts in the \n     intensity and distribution of precipitation, and changes in \n     oceanic circulation. In view of the complexity of the Earth \n     climate system, uncertainty in its description and in the \n     prediction of changes will never be completely eliminated.\n       Because of these uncertainties, there is much public debate \n     over the extent to which increased concentrations of \n     greenhouse gases have caused or will cause climate change, \n     and over potential actions to limit and/or respond to climate \n     change. It is important that public debate take into account \n     the extent of scientific knowledge and the uncertainties. \n     Science cannot be the sole source of guidance on how society \n     should respond to climate issues. Nonetheless, scientific \n     understanding based on peer-reviewed research must be central \n     to informed decision-making. AGU calls for an enhancement of \n     research to improve the quantification of anthropogenic \n     influences on climate. To this end, international programs of \n     research are essential. AGU encourages scientists worldwide \n     to participate in such programs and in scientific assessments \n     and policy discussions.\n       The world may already be committed to some degree of human-\n     caused climate change, and further buildup of greenhouse gas \n     concentrations may be expected to cause further change. Some \n     of these changes may be beneficial and others damaging for \n     different parts of the world. However, the rapidity and \n     uneven geographic distribution of these changes could be very \n     disruptive. AGU recommends the development and evaluation of \n     strategies such as emissions reduction, carbon sequestration, \n     and adaptation to the impacts of climate change. AGU believes \n     that the present level of scientific uncertainty does not \n     justify inaction in the mitigation of human-induced climate \n     change and/or the adaptation to it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Hot Words--A Claim of Nonhuman-Induced Global Warming Sparks Debate\n\n                           (By David Appell)\n\n       In a contretemps indicative of the political struggle over \n     global climate change, a recent study suggested that humans \n     may not be warming the earth. Greenhouse skeptics, pro-\n     industry groups and political conservatives have seized on \n     the results, proclaiming that the science of climate change \n     is inconclusive and that agreements such as the Kyoto \n     Protocol, which set limits on the output of industrial heat-\n     trapping gases, are unnecessary. But mainstream \n     climatologists, as represented by the Intergovernmental Panel \n     on Climate Change (IPCC), are perturbed that the report has \n     received so much attention; they say the study's conclusions \n     are scientifically dubious and colored by politics.\n       Sallie Baliunas and Willie Soon of the Harvard-Smithsonian \n     Center for Astrophysics reviewed more than 200 studies that \n     examined climate ``proxy'' records--data from such phenomena \n     as the growth of tree rings or coral, which are sensitive to \n     climatic conditions. They concluded in the January Climate \n     Research that ``across the world, many records reveal that \n     the 20th century is probably not the warmest nor a uniquely \n     extreme\n\n[[Page S9210]]\n\n     climate period of the last millennium.'' They said that two \n     extreme climate periods--the Medieval Warming Period between \n     800 and 1300 and the Little Ice Age of 1300 to 1900--occurred \n     worldwide, at a time before industrial emissions of \n     greenhouse gases became abundant. (A longer version \n     subsequently appeared in the May Energy and Environment.)\n       Scientists skeptical of human-induced warming applaud the \n     work. ``Soon et al. have done a service to the science \n     community,'' remarks Gary Sharp of the Center for Climate/\n     Ocean Resources Study in Monterey Bay, Calif., ``which is in \n     serious threat of losing all credibility via the IPCC's media \n     management and oversell of the dangers of global warming.''\n       In contrast, the consensus view among paleclimatologists is \n     that the Medieval Warming Period was a regional phenomenon, \n     that the worldwide nature of the Little Ice Age is open to \n     question and that the late 20th century saw the most extreme \n     global average temperatures. Many of these scientists argue \n     that Soon and Baliunas produced deeply flawed work--and they \n     have criticized it in unusually strident language. ``The fact \n     that it has received any attention at all is a result, again \n     in my view, of its utility to those groups who want the \n     global warming issue to just go away,'' comments Tim Barnett, \n     a marine physicist at the Scripps Institution of \n     Oceanography, whose work Soon and Baliunas refer to. Similar \n     sentiments came for Malcolm Hughes of the Laboratory of Tree-\n     Ring Research at the University of Arizona, whose work is \n     also discussed: ``The Soon et al. paper is so fundamentally \n     misconceived and contains so many egregious errors that it \n     would take weeks to list and explain them all.''\n       Rather than seeing global anomalies, many \n     paleoclimatologists subscribe to the conclusions of Phil \n     Jones of the University of East Anglia, Michael Mann of the \n     University of Virginia and their colleagues, who began in \n     1998 to quantitatively splice together the proxy records. \n     They have concluded that the global average temperature over \n     the past 1,000 years has been relatively stable until the \n     20th century. ``Nothing in the paper undermines in any way \n     the conclusion of earlier studies that the average \n     temperature of the late twentieth century in the Northern \n     Hemisphere was anomalous against the background of the past \n     millennium,'' wrote Mann and Princeton University's Michael \n     Oppenheimer in a privately circulated statement.\n       The most significant criticism is that Soon and Baliunas do \n     not present their data quantitatively--instead they merely \n     categorize the work of other primarily into one of two sets: \n     either supporting or not supporting their particular \n     definitions of a Medieval Warming Period or Little Ice Age. \n     ``I was stating outright that I'm not able to give too many \n     quantitative details, especially in terms of aggregating all \n     the results,'' Soon says.\n       Specifically, they define a ``climate anomaly'' as a period \n     of 50 or more years of wetness or dryness or sustained warmth \n     (or, for the Little Ice Age, coolness). The problem is that \n     under this broad definition a wet or dry spell would indicate \n     a climatic anomaly even if the temperature remained perfectly \n     constant. Soon and Baliunas are ``mindful'' that the Medieval \n     Warming Period and the Little Ice Age should be defined by \n     temperature, but ``we emphasize that great bias would result \n     if those thermal anomalies were to be dissociated'' from \n     other climatic conditions. (Asked to define ``wetness'' and \n     ``dryness,'' Soon and Baliunas say only that they ``referred \n     to the standard usage in English.'')\n       Moreover, their results were nonsynchronous: ``Their \n     analysis doesn't consider whether the warm/cold periods \n     occurred at the same time,'' says Peter Stott, a climate \n     scientist at the U.K. is Hadley Center for climate Prediction \n     and Research in Bracknell. For example, if a proxy record \n     indicated that a drier condition existed in one part of the \n     world from 800 to 850, it would be counted as equal evidence \n     for a Medieval Warming period as a different proxy record \n     that showed wetter conditions in another part of the world \n     from 1250 to 1300. Regional conditions do not necessarily \n     mirror the global average, Stott notes: ``Iceland and \n     Greenland had their warmest periods in the 1930s, whereas the \n     warmest for the globe was in the 1990s.''\n       Soon and Baliunas also take issue with the IPCC by \n     contending that the 20th century saw no unique patterns: they \n     found few climatic anomalies in the proxy records. But they \n     looked for 50-year-long anomalies; the last century's \n     warming, the IPCC concludes, occurred in two periods of about \n     30 years each (with cooling in between). The warmest period \n     occurred in the late 20th century--too short to meet Soon and \n     Baliunasis selected requirement. The two researchers also \n     discount thermometer readings and ``give great weight to the \n     paleo data for which the uncertainties are much greater,'' \n     Stott says.\n       The conclusion of Soon and Baliunas that the warming during \n     the 20th century is not unusual has engendered sharp debate \n     and intense reactions on both sides--Soon and Baliunas \n     responded primarily via e-mail and refused follow-up \n     questions. The charges illustrate the polarized nature of the \n     climate change debate in the U.S. ``You'd be challenged, I'd \n     bet, to find someone who supports the Kyoto Protocol and also \n     thinks that this paper is good science, or someone who thinks \n     that the paper is bad science and is opposed to Kyoto,'' \n     predicts Roger Pielke, Jr., of the University of Colorado. \n     Expect more of such flares as the stakes--and the world's \n     temperatures--continue to rise.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         [From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, June 1, 2003]\n\n              Nonprofits Push Controversial Climate Study\n\n                           (By Jeff Nesmith)\n\n       Washington.--Nonprofit organizations with ties to energy \n     interests are promoting a controversial climate study as \n     proof that prevailing views of global warming are wrong.\n       The scientists who authored the new study contend that the \n     global warming of recent decades is not without precedent \n     during the past 1,000 years, as other scientists have \n     claimed. In fact, they say the Earth was even warmer during \n     what is known as the ``medieval warm period'' between 900 and \n     1300 A.D.\n       The paper has touched off a worldwide storm of e-mail among \n     climate scientists, some of whom have proposed organizing a \n     research boycott of two journals that published the study.\n       The links among authors of the new study, the nonprofit \n     groups and the energy interests illustrate a three-way \n     intersection of money, science and policy. Energy interests \n     underwrote the study and help finance the groups that are \n     promoting it.\n       The study also illustrates a strategy adopted by some \n     energy companies in the late 1980s to attack the credibility \n     of climate science, said John Topping, president of the \n     Climate Institute.\n       ``They saw early on that what they had to do was keep the \n     science at issue,'' said Topping, a former Republican \n     congressional staffer who founded the institute in 1986.\n       By relying on the news media's inclination to include both \n     sides of a story, the industries were able to create the \n     impression that scientists were deeply divided over climate \n     change, Topping said.\n       ``It was all very shrewdly done,'' he added.\n       The Climate Institute takes the position that climate \n     change threatens the global environment and promotes \n     international cooperation on the issue. Less then 1 percent \n     of its funding has come from oil industry sources, Topping \n     said, with the rest coming from foundations.\n       To measure long-term climate patterns, scientists rely on \n     ``proxy'' indicators, such as the content of air bubbles \n     trapped centuries ago under the ice packs in Greenland and \n     Antarctica, the chemical makeup of ancient ocean sediments, \n     and the relative widths of old tree rings.\n       These natural records have been used to portray a global \n     climate that has been largely stable until the late 1980s, \n     when temperatures started rising sharply.\n       A millennium of these temperature records presents what has \n     been called a ``hockey stick'' graph, depicting centuries \n     with little relative change, then a sharp and sudden rise \n     during the past two decades.\n       Most climate scientists think the rise results from the \n     atmosphere buildup of heat-trapping ``greenhouse gases,'' \n     especially carbon dioxide released by the combustion of \n     fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum.\n       Industry-backed groups claim the new study challenges the \n     validity of this view by presenting evidence of global \n     warming at a time when fossil fuels were not being burned in \n     appreciable quantities.\n       The new study, ``Reconstructing Climatic and Environmental \n     Changes of the Past 1,000 Years: A Reappraisal,'' was \n     published several weeks ago in a British scientific journal, \n     Energy and Environment.\n       The authors contend in the 65-page paper that their \n     reanalysis of data from more than 200 previous climate \n     studies provides evidence of global temperature shifts that \n     are more dramatic than the current one, including during the \n     ``medievel warm period.''\n       The research was underwritten by the American Petroleum \n     Institute, the trade association of the world's biggest oil \n     companies.\n       Two of the five authors are scientists who have been linked \n     to the coal industry and have received support from the \n     ExxonMobil Foundation.\n       Two others, who are affiliated with the Harvard-Smithsonian \n     Center for Astrophysics, also have the title of ``senior \n     scientists'' with a Washington-based organization supported \n     by conservative foundations and ExxonMobil Corp.\n       The organization, the George T. Marshall Institute, is \n     headed by William O'Keefe, a former executive of the American \n     Petroleum Institute.\n       O'Keefe also was at one time the president of the Global \n     Climate Coalition, a now-defunct organization created by oil \n     and coal interests to lobby against U.S. participation in \n     climate treaties, such as the Kyoto Protocol.\n       ``Statements made about the warming trend of the 20th \n     century and the 1990s do not withstand close scrutiny,'' \n     O'Keefe declared at a recent luncheon held in the Dirksen \n     Senate Office Building here.\n       The purpose of the luncheon was for Willie Soon, a \n     physicist and astronomer with the Harvard-Smithsonian Center, \n     to present a summary of the new research.\n       Promotion of the scientists' arguments began with a news \n     release issued by the public affairs office of the Harvard-\n     Smithsonian Center shortly after the paper was published. \n     Headlined ``20th Century Climate Not So Hot,'' the release \n     declared that the scientists had ``determined'' that the \n     current warming trend is neither the hottest nor the most \n     dramatic change in the past 1,000 years.\n\n\n                       didn't publish the release\n\n       Major news organizations failed to publish the news \n     release. However, it was picked up\n\n[[Page S9211]]\n\n     by the Discovery Channel Online, which declared that the 20th \n     century may have been ``just another bump in the climate \n     road.''\n       The Discovery Channel Online article was immediately copied \n     and distributed by the staff of the Senate Environment and \n     Public Works Committee, headed by Sen. James Inhofe (R-\n     Okla.), an outspoken skeptic about climate change.\n       The committee also circulated a statement by the Committee \n     Enterprise Institute declaring that ``the hockey stick theory \n     has effectively been dismanted'' and ``the margin of error is \n     so large that nearly any temperature trend could be drawn to \n     fit within it.''\n       The principal target of the paper by Soon and his co-\n     authors was Michael Mann of the University of Virginia, whose \n     landmark compilation of thousands of ``proxy'' indicators led \n     to the conclusion that the last two decades have been \n     unusually warm and to the first depiction of the ``hockey \n     stick'' graph.\n       Mann said last week that the Soon study does not even \n     attempt to reconstruct global average temperatures but simply \n     highlights anecdotal evidence of isolated warming trends.\n       In a statement issued jointly with environmental scientists \n     Michael Oppenheimer of Princeton University, Mann said that \n     when all of these indicators are compiled and averaged, the \n     ``medical warming period'' fits within the long-range global \n     trend. He said this was done not only in his study but also \n     in nearly a dozen that have followed it.\n       Soon acknowledged during a question period at the Senate \n     luncheon that his research does not provide such a \n     comprehensive picture of the Earth's temperature record. He \n     questioned whether that is even possible, and said he did not \n     see how Mann and the others could ``calibrate'' the various \n     proxy records for comparison.\n       ``Then he needs to educate himself on several decades of \n     very careful, painstaking research,'' Mann snapped.\n       The energy industry provides significant funding for groups \n     that employ some of the authors or promote their new study.\n       Soon's four co-authors were Sallie Baliunas, also from the \n     Harvard-Smithsonian center; Sherwood Idso and his son, Craig \n     Idso, both of Tempe, Ariz.; who are the past president and \n     the current president of an organization called the Center \n     for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change; and David \n     R. Legates, a climate researcher of the University of \n     Delaware.\n       The Idsos, who have previously been linked to Western coal \n     interests, do not reveal the sources of financial support for \n     their center, which on its Web site presents summaries of \n     scientific studies purporting to raise questions about \n     prevailing climate change theories.\n       The center had a budget of nearly $400,000 in 2001, the \n     most recent year for which nonprofit statements to the \n     Internal Revenue Service are available.\n       It operates from a post office box and offices in the homes \n     of Craig and Sherwood Idso and a second son of Sherwood Idso, \n     Keith Idso.\n       Identities of the four donors who provided the \n     organization's $397,000 contributions in 2001 are blanked out \n     of the Internal Revenue Service filing, and Sherwood Idso \n     declined to name them.\n       ``We generally do not stay anything about our funding,'' he \n     said. ``The feeling is that what we produce there should be \n     evaluated on its own merit, not where any funding comes \n     from.''\n       Records filed with the IRS by ExxonMobil Foundation show \n     that it provided a grant of $15,000 to the Arizona center \n     2000. These records and others show that ExxonMobil \n     Foundation and ExxonMobil Corp. also have contributed \n     $160,000 to the George T. Marshall Institute in the past \n     three years and more than $900,000 to the Competitive \n     Enterprise Institute.\n       In a telephone interview, Soon declined to say how much he \n     is paid to serve as a ``senior scientist'' with the George T. \n     Marshall Institute. Both he and Baliunas have that title.\n       The institute was organized in the 1980s and is chaired by \n     Robert Jastrow, a retired scientist from the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration who was an early and \n     vocal supporter of former President Reagan's ``Star Wars'' \n     missile defense initiative.\n\n\n                          Other board members\n\n       Other members of the organization's board include O'Keefe; \n     Baliunas; techno-suspense novelist Thomas Clancy Jr.; \n     newspaper columnist Charles Krauthammer; Dr. Bernadine Healy, \n     former director of the National Institutes of Health; and \n     Frederick Seitz of Rockefeller University in New York, a \n     former chairman of the National Academy of Sciences.\n       O'Keefe declined to identify the Marshall Institute's \n     funding sources, but acknowledged it received money from \n     ExxonMobil and the Sarah Scaife Foundation, headed by \n     conservative Pittsburgh billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife.\n       He volunteered that it also receives funds from the Bradley \n     Foundation, a large Milwaukee foundation known for its \n     support of conservative causes.\n       Ross Gelbspan, once a Boston Globe reporter and editor \n     whose 1997 book, ``The Heat Is On,'' details industry efforts \n     to discredit climate change science, said conclusions that \n     greenhouse gases are causing the planet to heat up are the \n     result of ``the largest and most rigorously peer-reviewed \n     scientific collaboration in history.''\n       ``The contradictory statements of a tiny handful of \n     discredited scientists, funded by big coal and big oil, \n     represent a deliberate--and extremely reckless--campaign of \n     deception and disinformation,'' Gelbspan declared.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I highlight an important provision in the \nState Department Authorization bill that is now before the Senate. It \nis a provision that resulted from an amendment I offered in the Senate \nForeign Relations committee to insure the inclusion of women in the \nreconstruction of Iraq.\n  The Boxer amendment states that it is the policy of the United States \nto ensure the full and active participation of women in the \nreconstruction of Iraq. It specifically states that the U.S. should \nwork to promote the involvement of women in all levels of the \nGovernment of Iraq and decision-making bodies; the planning and \ndistribution of assistance, including food aid; and job promotion and \ntraining programs.\n  Three years ago, the U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 1325 \nwhich reaffirmed the important role of women in peace-building and \ncalled attention to the special needs of women during post-conflict \nresolution. Iraqi women are among the most highly educated in the \nregion and should play a significant role in rebuilding Iraq.\n  The head of the U.N. Development Fund for Women recently wrote that, \n``As groups of Iraqi people meet to prepare for the creation of an \ninterim Iraqi authority, it is essential to know that a way to achieve \nconsensus and compromise, amid the divisive complexities of Iraqi \nsociety, is to ensure the extensive participation of women. Indeed, the \nperspectives of women offer the best promise of meaningful \nreconstruction and the development of a working democracy.''\n  My amendment is designed to ensure that the perspectives of women are \ntaken seriously as we work to help Iraq rebuild. I appreciate the \nsupport of my colleagues on this issue and hope that this provision is \nincluded in the final version of the bill.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the managers' amendment includes a provision \nthat will help solidify the strong friendship that exists between the \nUnited States and the United Kingdom. The provision is a result of a \ngreat deal of work between the chairman, the ranking member of the \nForeign Relations Committee, and the Department of State. They are to \nbe commended for helping to strengthen the partnership between our two \ncountries, a partnership we have relied on for many years.\n  The provision will allow the U.S. to finalize a bilateral agreement \nwith the United Kingdom and provide a licensing exception to the UK for \ncertain defense-related items. Such an agreement will pave the way for \nenhancing both our defense capabilities as it promotes cooperation with \nour coalition partners, especially on matters of defense.\n  Enhancing our defense capabilities and the industrial and economic \ncooperation that exists between our two nations is critical if we are \nto continue to have the ability to promote peace, freedom and democracy \nthroughout the world. As we have seen for many years, and through many \ninternational conflicts, the United States and the United Kingdom are \nsteadfast allies who have come to the aid of each other whenever it was \nnecessary to preserve the peace. Our troops fought together in the \ndeserts of Iraq and the United Kingdom has demonstrated time and time \nagain that we can always count on them in a time of crisis.\n  Another important objective of this agreement is the improvement of \nthe industrial cooperation between our countries. Industries of all \ntypes are consolidating in the face of economic downsizing and \nglobalization so that research and development of new products and new \ntechnologies can be pursued. This consolidation has only further \nhighlighted the need for effective export control measures.\n  The United States must now work with our Allies, especially our \nfriends in the United Kingdom, to improve the flow of information and \nincrease the level of cooperation in the areas of export control \nreform, multilateral control regime participation, and improvements in \nlicensing procedures.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member for working \nwith me on this issue during both the committee markup and in recent \ndays. This provision means a great deal to both our long-term interests \nand to our continued friendship with the United Kingdom.\n\n[[Page S9212]]\n\n  The United Kingdom has consistently proved their support for our \ncommon cause of peace. Most recently, by their efforts in Iraq. Prime \nMinister Tony Blair took a great deal of heat for his position, but he \nheld fast to it because our cause was just. We will recognize him for \nhis efforts when he speaks at a Joint session of Congress on July 17. I \nbelieve our action here today is also a strong and very welcome show of \nsupport for his and his country's efforts.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I rise to speak in support of the managers' amendment \nand its inclusion of the President's proposal for Millennium Challenge \nAccounts, or MCA.\n  MCA is a new approach for foreign aid. Instead of providing aid based \nsolely on need, as is largely the approach under our current system, \nMillennium Challenge Account assistance will go only to those countries \nwhich meet certain criteria for good governance, free markets, and \neducational and health support. MCA will not replace foreign aid to \ncountries in need; need-based assistance will continue. Nor will MCA be \na subsidy for wealthy democracies--it will only go to poorer nations \nthat qualify.\n  MCA, once implemented will be the first time foreign aid is provided \nbased on a country's efforts to improve itself. This is important for \ntwo reasons. First, by investing in countries that are already showing \na commitment to sound development principles, MCA assistance is far \nmore likely to make a positive difference in improving conditions in \nthat county. Second, by clearly delineating the criteria used for \nselecting countries to receive MCA funding, the proposal will provide \nstrong incentive for other countries to make changes so they will also \nqualify.\n  I am particularly excited about another aspect of the MCA proposal: \nhow the funds will be used. Because a limited number of countries will \nqualify for MCA assistance, the aid will go a long way. The Millennium \nChallenge Corporation, or MCC, which will manage the accounts, will \nwork with government and citizens in the recipient country to ensure \nfunded projects will make a significant contribution toward helping a \ncountry move to a new level in its economic growth.\n  I hope recipient governments, in working with the MCC, will select \nprojects that emphasize their strengths. By focusing on their \nstrengths, recipient countries will not only improve their comparative \nadvantage economically, but also strengthen and build new institutions, \nand cultivate national pride.\n  When I was Governor of my State, that was the approach we took to \nhelping cities grow economically. In Chattanooga, for example, the \npeople and local government chose to focus on one of their strengths: \nthe riverfront. State government joined in this effort which resulted \nin major renovations including a new aquarium that is the envy of the \nregion. In Memphis, State government joined with citizens and local \ngovernment to focus on improving Beale Street--the home of the Blues. \nAgain, the area became a major attraction and highlight of the city. In \nboth cases, the projects resulted not only in economic growth but a \nrenewed sense of pride in their homes for both Memphians and \nChattanoogans.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to commend Chairman Lugar, \nSenator Biden, and Senator Hagel for the compromise language reached in \nthe managers' amendment for authorizing the Millennium Challenge \nCorporation. My distinguished colleagues have worked out an approach \nfor authorizing a separate agency, as the President proposed, but \nhaving it report to the Secretary of State--much as USAID does--in \norder to maintain continuity in our Nation's foreign policy. This is an \nexcellent compromise, and I am fully supportive of it.\n  Millennium Challenge Accounts represent the most significant change \nin our approach to foreign aid in years, perhaps ever. I urge all my \ncolleagues to support it and look forward to watching its \nimplementation, particularly with African countries in my role as \nchairman of the Subcommittee on African Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to address the Millennium \nChallenge Account and the importance of providing full funding for \nforeign assistance initiatives.\n  I had intended to offer an amendment to the State Department \nauthorization bill to authorize an additional $300 million to the \nMillennium Challenge Account, MCA, to match the President's request of \n$1.3 billion for fiscal year 2004.\n  I believe it is critical for the United States to provide full \nfunding for the MCA at its inception to demonstrate our commitment to \nthose in the developing world who seek a better life and our fellow \ncitizens at home who deserve a safe and secure future free from terror.\n  Nevertheless, I understand Senator Lugar has worked closely with \nSenator Biden on a bipartisan bill and that an amendment to increase \nfunding for the MCA is not appropriate at this time. I will not offer \nan amendment, but I want to take this time to emphasize the need for \nthe United States to take a leadership role in combating global poverty \nand provide the necessary resources to do so.\n  Let us not forget that 1.2 billion people live on less than $1 a day \nand nearly 3 billion live on less than $2 a day; 1.2 billion people \nlack access to safe drinking water, 2.9 billion have inadequate access \nto sanitation, and 1 billion people in developing nations are \nunemployed or underemployed.\n  In March, 2002, the President announced an initiative to increase \nforeign aid by $5 billion over the next 3 years through the creation of \nthe Millennium Challenge Account.\n  These funds would be available on a competitive basis to a few \ncountries based on their records in three areas; ruling justly, \ninvesting in people, and pursuing sound economic policies.\n  Over the past few years, I and several of my colleagues have worked \nhard to raise awareness about the importance of a robust international \naffairs budget as a central component of advancing the U.S. foreign \npolicy agenda and protecting our national security interests.\n  We simply can not afford to rely on our military might alone to fight \nterror and provide safety and security for our citizens.\n  The fiscal year 2004 Defense authorization bill passed by the Senate \nauthorized $400.5 billion for national defense.\n  Over the past 10 years, the Defense appropriations bill has risen \nfrom $261 billion in fiscal year 1994, to $355 billion in fiscal year \n2003, to $400 billion this year.\n  Given the multitude of threats our country faces and the commitments \nof our troops all around the world, I fully support giving the men and \nwomen of our Armed Forces the tools they need to do their job at the \nhighest level.\n  On the other hand, in fiscal year 1994, the foreign operations \nappropriations bill totaled $17.9 billion falling to $16.3 billion in \nfiscal year 2003. This authorization provides for $15.3 billion for \nforeign operations for fiscal year 2004 and $1 billion for the MCA. The \nUnited States spends less than 1 percent of our budget on foreign aid \nwhich is barely 0.1 percent of GDP.\n  Thus, I applauded President Bush's initiative to begin to restore the \nforeign aid budget to the high water mark of the cold war years and \nincrease foreign assistance spending by $5 billion over the next 3 \nyears.\n  The fiscal year 2004 budget resolution passed out of the Budget \nCommittee, however, cut $1.1 billion--including $1 billion to the MCA--\nfrom the President's request for the International Function 150 \nAccount. So, Senator Lugar and I introduced, and the Senate passed, an \namendment to restore those funds.\n  National security is not just about ensuring we have the most \nadvanced weapons and the best trained personnel. We must make the same \ncommitment to our international affairs budget and use all the tools at \nour disposal to prevent terror and avoid more costly military \ninterventions in the future.\n  I, for one, believe that we should provide additional resources \nbeyond the President's request; $5 billion over 3 years is a good start \nbut, in my view, not near enough.\n  But I felt we should at least match what the President himself has \nrequested for his own initiative in its first year of existence. Now is \nnot the time to take steps backwards or shy away from larger \ncommitment.\n  In addition, we should provide full funding for our existing foreign \naid programs which have been proven to reduce poverty and increase \neconomic\n\n[[Page S9213]]\n\ndevelopment. Many countries will fall outside the bounds of the MCA, \nand we can not afford to leave them behind.\n  I believe the MCA and our overall international affairs budget will \nhelp us attack the conditions that foster terrorism in the developing \nworld: poverty, hunger, illiteracy, and illness.\n  Terrorists prey on the hopelessness, anger, fear, and alienation of \nthe poor and provide an easy way out of the misery of the developing \nworld. The MCA and the international affairs budget, by providing \neducation, health care, shelter, and food, will help promote tolerance, \nunderstanding, and political stability.\n  We send the wrong message when we devote billions of dollars for \nnational defense but fail to provide the resources for a new, \nsignificant foreign assistance initiative.\n  We must demonstrate to the world that the United States is serious \nabout reducing global poverty through a robust and substantive foreign \naid budget. I urge my colleagues to join with me in making full funding \nfor all of our foreign assistance initiatives a priority.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee included in S. 925 an authorization for $2 million for the \nDante B. Fascell North South Center.\n  The Dante B. Fascell North South Center at the University of Miami is \na public policy studies center that is dedicated to the analysis of \ncomplex global problems, with special emphasis on the Western \nHemisphere. The center's research encompasses key areas such as trade \nand economic policy, migration, democratic governance, security, \ncorruption, the environment, and information technology. Since its \ninception in 1984, the Center has become a valuable national and \nhemispheric resource, a focal point for cooperative study and an adept \ncoordinator of international projects. It will remain so, and I hope it \nwill continue to be a prominent focal point of Western Hemisphere \nstudies.\n  Congressman Fascell dedicated his career to improving relations with \ncountries in the western hemisphere, lifting the people of these \nnations up. He understood how the culture of South America, Central \nAmerica and the Caribbean is embedded in Florida culture, and embraced \nit. It is in this spirit that we honor his memory by providing \nresources to this Center.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the leadership on both sides of the aisle \nhave been in conversation. For the benefit of our colleagues, so they \ncan plan for tonight and I guess begin to plan for tomorrow, I will \nstate where we are.\n  It is important that we move to the appropriations bills. The intent \nwas to do everything possible to finish the bill we have been on for \nthe last 2 days, but we have not been successful, although very close. \nWe plan on moving to the legislative branch appropriations bill \nshortly. We have been working over the last hour to put together--which \nwe have done successfully--a finite group of amendments from both sides \nof the aisle. We have them written on a piece of paper and have made a \ndecision to work off that list once we return to the bill we have been \ndiscussing today.\n  The intent very shortly is to set the current bill aside, go to the \nlegislative branch appropriations bill--Chairman Stevens will be doing \nthat shortly--followed by the military construction appropriations \nbill. Following that, we will return to the State Department \nauthorization.\n  In terms of voting tonight, we likely will be voting later tonight, \nalthough until we get on the legislative branch appropriations bill, I \ncannot say for certain that we will. The intent is to be voting tonight \nto complete that bill and to go on to military construction tonight as \nwell. That is the intent.\n  For planning purposes, over the next 2\\1/2\\ hours we expect to have \nno rollcall votes and ask people to stay in touch with their respective \nsides in terms of plans after about 8:30 tonight for rollcall votes.\n  I do hope we will be able to return to the State Department \nauthorization bill as soon as we complete the other two. Until we \naddress the issues and see how many amendments we have on legislative \nbranch and military construction, I cannot say with certainty whether \nor not we will be returning to that tomorrow, but that is the intent. \nThe intent will be to finish that bill tomorrow.\n  That is the general understanding as to what the plan will be \ntonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. First, with regard to the State Department authorization \nbill, I think we have made a lot of progress this afternoon. In \ndefining more explicitly the list of amendments that are likely to be \noffered, it is not a lengthy list and I think we can work through them. \nI appreciate the cooperation of so many of our Senators.\n  I will repeat what I have indicated to the majority leader, that many \nof our colleagues who have submitted their amendments for this list do \nso with an expectation that they will have an opportunity to have a \nvote on or in relation to their amendment. Obviously, we are going to \nhave to attempt to accommodate that expectation as we work through the \nlist.\n  I think this is a wise decision and a wise course of action with \nregard to setting the bill aside temporarily because I know the time \nconstraints under which the Appropriations Committee is working.\n\n  I will say we have very significant reservations on the part of some \nof our colleagues--I know Senator Byrd has expressed more than once on \nthe Senate floor his frustration with late night sessions and votes, \nand I am sure, were he here, he would express that frustration again. I \ndo believe we have to continue our work, and perhaps we can arrange \nways in which to address that concern.\n  As I understand it, we have a handful of amendments to be offered to \nthe legislative appropriations and supplemental bill. I think \ndefinitively there are four amendments at this point. So we ought to be \nable to work through those reasonably quickly. I know of no amendments \nto the military construction bill at this point.\n  So we ought to be able to work through these, perhaps even stacking \nthe votes for tomorrow morning.\n  In any case, I hope that Senators who have amendments will come to \nthe floor to accommodate the consideration of these bills in a timely \nway. We want to finish our work so that we can move on.\n  I appreciate the work that has been done and the effort that has been \nmade to get us to this point. I hope we can have a productive evening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, to review, the plan will be to shortly go \nto legislative branch appropriations. We will not have any rollcall \nvotes over the next 2\\1/2\\ hours.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the majority leader yield for a question? Could we \nget an agreement now that the amendments that are to be presented to \nthe legislative branch bill be presented tonight, the debate finish \ntonight, and we will vote tomorrow on them--not have any rollcall votes \ntonight but have all the amendments be brought before us tonight and \nthe arguments start and we will schedule the votes for tomorrow \nmorning?\n  I know there are several Members who have talked to me and they have \nother events. This is sort of surprise. We are trying to get the bill \nfinished by tomorrow. If the leader would agree, we would get consent \nthat all amendments must be filed and we will debate them tonight--\nhowever late it takes--and vote on them tomorrow.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am quite sure we would be able to enter \ninto such an agreement, but I want to check with those Senators who \nhave amendments to offer. That is a very wise course of action and with \na little checking, I think we can enter into such an agreement, but we \nwould have to check.\n  I also note I have been asked the question, Will there be votes \ntomorrow morning? I assume there will be votes tomorrow morning, so \nSenators should be prepared to come tomorrow. I defer\n\n[[Page S9214]]\n\nto the majority leader for a definitive answer to that question.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as I have said since Monday, our intention \nis to vote tomorrow morning. As you can tell from the comments in the \nlast few minutes, there are a lot of people who do not want to vote \ntonight. They do not want to vote tomorrow. We have a lot of work to \ndo. The appropriations bills are critical to address. The plan will be \nto vote tomorrow for sure. I don't know how late in the day it will be. \nThe intention would be to finish as soon as reasonable tomorrow.\n  With that, in terms of the request, we will consider as to whether or \nnot we would be able to lay over the votes tomorrow morning and have \nall the debate tonight. We will consider that. I don't want to commit \nto that although I will commit to having no votes in the next 2\\1/2\\ \nhours. We will work together, and if at all possible be able to stack \nthose votes in the morning.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. I am happy to yield.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. There was a very important discussion that took place \nearlier today on the emergency appropriations bill. The chairman has \nbeen very cooperative in working through some of the amendments we \nmight have. I know we are on short time and we want to move the bills.\n  Is it the leader's understanding we will get an opportunity to debate \nand offer amendments on the emergency appropriations bill, perhaps not \nvoting tonight, but in the morning?\n  Mr. FRIST. That would be the intention for tonight. We will be able \nto continue tonight, and as to whether or not we will be voting in the \nmorning we will discuss among ourselves.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. And perhaps even in the morning because there is an \nissue very important to Louisiana that needs to get resolved.\n  Mr. FRIST. We will work with both sides of the aisle. My objective is \nto get to the supplemental as soon as possible so we can address these \nissues. Once we get to it, no commitments have been made at this \njuncture in terms of the number of amendments and as to whether or not \nwe will finish all debate tonight, which would be nice, so we can vote \nin the morning, or continue debating tomorrow.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the majority leader yield for a question? I don't \nknow where we are on what is being propounded before I got here, but I \nam concerned about the supplemental; some of the items that have been \nmade part of that I do not think qualify--in my judgment, at least--as \nemergency. Will we have opportunities with any proposal being floated \nhere that would eliminate the opportunity to have votes on that matter?\n  Mr. FRIST. No, we will not and there is no unanimous consent being \npropounded. We have had discussions and we will have.\n  Right now my only intent is to move off the State Department \nauthorization and get to the bill the Senator is concerned about. We \ncan have discussions about that.\n  Now, so we can move off of the State Department authorization, we \nhave a statement?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I know Senator Dorgan has been waiting patiently to make \nsome comments with regard to an amendment he had offered. I think that \nis the only remaining piece of business we have on the State Department \nauthorization bill today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1198\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, earlier we cleared an amendment on the \nState Department authorization bill that I want to talk about briefly. \nThe reason I want to do it is I especially want to read some passages \nfrom the Wall Street Journal today, an article by a man named Roger \nThurow. We are deeply indebted to the article he has written about \nfamine in Africa.\n  The amendment passed today provides the requirement for the Commodity \nCredit Corporation to authorize another $250 million, which the Senate \nhad previously done, incidentally, on the supplemental bill previously. \nWe authorized $500 million in food aid to Africa to respond to the \ndesperate famine that is occurring there. That was cut in conference to \nthe $250 million. This additional $250 million will reach, then, the \nsame level that we previously agreed to in the Senate.\n  It will mean additional food, grain will move from America's family \nfarms to Africa, to those in desperate need of food. I think it is very \nimportant to do this. It does respond to famine, to starvation, to the \nneeds of people who are in desperate straits, and does so by using what \nis an asset in this country, something of significant value, food that \nis produced on our family farms.\n  We are told these days as farmers drive their trucks to the elevator \nwith a load of wheat, barley, or other grain, that food has no value; \nprices are collapsing. In a hungry world, it has substantial value. We \nought to be using the Commodity Credit Corporation to help respond to \nthe famine and starvation that is occurring in Africa.\n  I will read just a part of this article. There are some 11 million \npeople at risk at this point who do not have enough to eat, who go to \nbed with an ache in their belly, some of whom are dying every day. Let \nme read part of this article because it is such a gripping firsthand \ndescription of what it is we are trying to do. Myself, Senator Daschle, \nand Senator Leahy offered the amendment that was accepted just a bit \nago. I say thanks to the chairman and the ranking member for doing so \nbecause I think it addresses this in a very real way.\n  The article begins:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 10, 2003]\n\n                           (By Roger Thurow)\n\n       Their father died in 1999, their mother in 2000, both of \n     them from what social workers and village officials believe \n     were complications from AIDS. Since then, Makhosazane \n     Nkhambule, now 16 years old, has been caring for her four \n     younger brothers and sisters in their one-room mud-brick \n     shack.\n       They sweep the floor of the house and the dirt yard with \n     homemade straw brooms. They try to patch holes in the \n     thatched roof and plug cracks in the mud walls. They fetch \n     water from a well nearly a mile away. They scavenge wood for \n     the fire. They go to an informal school in a neighbor's \n     house.\n       Makhosazane says they can do everything they need to do, \n     except feed themselves. ``I would like to plant corn and \n     vegetable, but we have no money to buy seeds or tools,'' she \n     says. Her parents' cattle could have helped with plowing, but \n     they have also died. The garden beside the hut and the two-\n     acre field behind it haven't been planted since their mother \n     died.\n       For two years, the orphans scrounged what they could, \n     asking neighbors for scraps of food and waiting for relatives \n     in distant villages to bring something to eat. Last year, the \n     United Nations' World Food Program came to Swaziland to \n     distribute food to those suffering from the drought that has \n     gripped southern Africa. Although the Nkhambule children had \n     no crops to be killed by drought, they began receiving the \n     food aid. So, too, did thousands of other households where \n     the adults who had been tending the fields have died. Most of \n     the victims likely died of HIV/AIDS, which, according to \n     government estimates, infects more than one-third of adults \n     in this tiny, hilly kingdom.\n       The Nkhambule siblings, barefoot and wearing dirty, shabby \n     clothes, embody what is being called an entirely new variety \n     of famine. It breaks the historical mold of food crises, \n     according to people who are studying it. It isn't caused by \n     weather, war, failed government policy or crop disease, all \n     of which prevent or discourage farmers from bringing in a \n     harvest. Rather, this is a food shortage caused by a disease \n     that kills the farmers themselves. Recovery won't come with \n     weather improvement, new government policies, a peace treaty \n     or improved hybrid crops. Once the farmers die, there is no \n     rain that will make their empty fields grow. * * *\n\n  Now, I have heard testimony of people who have been to this part of \nthe region who say they find old ladies, old women, climbing trees to \nforage for leaves to eat because it hurts to be hungry. People are \ndying every single day. The question is, What can we do about it?\n  Every day, as more and more die, with 11 million people at risk, 11 \nmillion orphans currently living in Africa at risk of severe \nmalnutrition, even as people die, our farmers are told the food they \nproduce in such abundance has no value. That is why the Commodity \nCredit Corporation has the authority for $30 billion worth of food to \nbe moved to places in the world where it is needed.\n  This amendment would simply provide for less than 1 percent of it to \nbe added to that which is already on the way, to provide some \nassistance and relief to those who are suffering.\n  It is easy, I suppose, for some to ignore this. But when millions of \npeople face famine and illness, the world--and\n\n[[Page S9215]]\n\nespecially our country--cannot turn its head. We know what we produce \nin great abundance has value. It has value to help people around the \nworld who are starving.\n  Again, thanks to Roger Thurow, a reporter who is in Swaziland, for \ntelling us specifically about the ravages of this famine, what it is \ndoing.\n  We just talked about AIDS in legislation we passed recently. \nPresident Bush is in Africa talking about AIDS. The fact is, this \nfamine relates directly to AIDS. These children are hungry. These \nchildren are starving--not because it didn't rain but because they have \nnothing to eat. Their parents are dead. The cattle are dead.\n  So if we can do this small amount through this amendment I have \noffered for myself, Senator Daschle, and Senator Leahy, if we can add \nto this $500 million, half of which was taken out in conference--if we \ncan add the money to make that whole once again, there will be bags of \nfood going to these villages to feed hungry people and our country will \ndo something, again, that not only makes us proud but represents the \nbest of this great country of ours.\n  I thank Senator Lugar and Senator Biden and my colleagues, Senators \nDaschle and Leahy. We deeply appreciate this amendment being accepted \nby the Senate today.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/10/senate-section/article/S9215-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9215-S9225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2004\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent we turn to \nconsideration of H.R. 2657, the legislative branch appropriations bill; \nthat the text of the bill relating solely to the House remain; that all \nother parts of the text be stricken; and the text of the Senate bill, \nS. 1383, be inserted; and that no points of order be waived by this \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2657) making appropriations for the \n     Legislative Branch for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2004, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring to the full Senate \nthe legislative branch spending bill for fiscal year 2004. I appreciate \nthe support of the Full Committee Chairman Senator Stevens and Ranking \nMember Senator Byrd, and assistance of my ranking member, Senator \nDurbin, in this process.\n\n  This is my first year as chairman of this subcommittee, and I believe \nSenator Durbin and I have done our best to craft this bill to meet the \nhighest priorities of the legislative branch with an allocation that is \n$190 million below the request level. Chairman Stevens knows I am not \ncomplaining about the allocation--he has been very generous in this \nallocation given the very tight constraints the committee faces.\n  The bill totals the allocation level of $3.6 billion in budget \nauthority.\n  Most agencies and programs have been kept to current staffing levels, \nwith full funding recommended for normal pay and price level increases.\n  Increases above the current level have been provided in a few key \nareas, particularly security.\n  I would like to review the highlights of the bill for my colleagues. \nFor the Capitol Police, funding totals $240 million. The amount \nrecommended would enable them to have on board by the end of the year \n1,771 police officers, in keeping with security recommendations made by \nlaw enforcement experts. I believe this is prudent and necessary to \nensure adequate security for the Capitol complex.\n  Having been in law enforcement myself, I am keenly interested in \nmaking the U.S. Capitol Police the premiere law enforcement agency in \nthis country, and the funds we have recommended help move them in this \ndirection with resources directed at not only increasing the force \nsize, but improving the administrative infrastructure of the agency to \nensure it is managed properly, and adding important new programs such \nas a mounted horse unit.\n  For the Architect of the Capitol, funds total $358 million, which is \n$89 million below the request, owing to the deletion of several major \nprojects which should be deferred until completion of the Capitol \nVisitor Center--the highest Architect of the Capitol priority at this \ntime.\n  Our recommendation includes $47.8 million for the Capitol Visitor \nCenter, which represents the General Accounting Office's estimate--in \nconjunction with an independent consultant with expertise in \nconstruction cost estimating--of the cost to complete the project.\n  Some have called for cutting corners on the project rather than \nappropriating the funds needed to get the job done right. I don't \nagree. I am new to this project but I am a big supporter. It promises \nto enhance security for the Capitol complex, while also ensuring a much \nbetter educational experience for visitors who come to the Capitol.\n  This Visitor Center was planned and preliminary work was done before \n9/11. No one could have predicted that changes would have to be made \nafter 9/11 because of an increase in the security requirements.\n  While there have been some problems with this project to date, and \nsome cost overruns due to unforeseen site conditions and unexpected \ncosts related to utility work, we plan to monitor the project closely \nto ensure that costs are kept under control, the schedule is adhered \nto, and quality is not jeopardized.\n  Moving on to the Library to Congress, there is a total of $523 \nmillion included in the bill, $19.6 million above the FY03 level but \n$17 million below the request. Funds are reduced from several program \nareas slated for increases, owing to budget constraints, but the \nVeterans History Project is fully funded at the increased level of $1.3 \nmillion and no program is cut below current levels.\n  For the Senate, a total of $718 million is recommended, $27.9 million \nbelow the request. Reductions are primarily from the Sergeant at Arm's \nprojects which can be deferred until FY05.\n  To my knowledge, there have been no amendments filed on either side \nof the aisle for titles I and II.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are awaiting the Senator from Nevada.\n  Let me state for the Senate that it would be my intention to move to \nclose debate and consideration of any further amendments to title I and \ntitle II following the statements of the two managers of the bill. We \nhave no notice of any amendments by any Member wishing to offer to \ntitle I or title II. Title III is the portion of the bill that contains \nthe supplemental provisions and that will be open to debate.\n  We will later ask consent that all amendments and all motions to \ntitle III be offered tonight and debated tonight with the votes to \noccur on any matters which will be brought to a vote tomorrow morning. \nThat is not the agreement yet but that is the agreement we will seek.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would be happy to agree to that at this \ntime. I agree that titles I and II be closed and I be allowed to give a \nstatement in support of the bill itself with no amendments in order to \ntitles I and II.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from Nevada \nwould allow us, we just put out the hotline on both sides. I want to \nmake sure no one has objections until we get final consent.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, one of the most pleasurable times of my \nSenate career was the 4 years that I served as chairman of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Legislative Branch. Working with Senator \nNickles and Senator Slade Gorton of Washington, we were able to \naccomplish that which really had a meaningful impact on this body.\n  When Senator Durbin, who is tied up, as he should be, in the most \nimportant asbestos legislation now before the Judiciary Committee, \nasked me if I would cover this bill for him today, I am doing it with \npleasure because it brings back memories of working on this bill.\n  We did good things for the Library of Congress. I still have a very \nclose personal relationship with Jim Billington\n\n[[Page S9216]]\n\nas a result of what we were able to accomplish in some very difficult \ntimes for the Library of Congress.\n  The Library of Congress is the greatest library in the history of the \nworld. Today, the Library of Congress is the greatest library in the \nhistory of the world. It is as a result of what we as a Congress did. \nWe provide money for that.\n  The General Accounting Office, which is funded through this bill, is \nthe watchdog of Congress for the American people. It has done \nremarkable things. It is a nonpartisan organization that does so much \ngood. Yet we have cut back the money I think they need. I wish we had \nmore money to give them.\n\n  Much of the work is done directly through the committee chairman and \nthe subcommittee chairman. Previously, it was effectively by all \nMembers of Congress.\n  I think the work I was able to do with my counterparts for the \nCapitol Police was very important. I don't know, there may be another \nMember of Congress who was a Capitol policeman. I don't know of one. \nBut I was a Capitol policeman. I worked a swing shift. I came at work \nat 3 or 4 in the afternoon. I worked 6 days a week. I went home after \nmidnight every night. That is how I put myself through law school. I \nacknowledge that I wasn't as well trained and the times were not as \ndifficult as they are now. But I was still a Capitol policeman. I am \nproud to have in my office up on the third floor in the Capitol my \nbadge, No. 236. But I am very proud to be an alumni of U.S. Capitol \nPolice Force.\n  I am pleased to do this for my friend, the distinguished Senator from \nthe State of Illinois, who is such a good Senator and who has done a \nremarkably good job in his tenure on this committee, this his second \ngo-around as chairman of this committee.\n  I echo the thoughts of the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nLegislative Branch, my friend from the State of Colorado, Senator \nCampbell.\n  The bill before us today is comprehensive, thorough, and fair, \nespecially in light of the tight funding constraints we are under this \nyear. This is one of the 13 subcommittees. I wish we had more money. It \ncould be used. There are many things that we need to do that we are not \nable to do.\n  As has been pointed out, there are a number of things that this \nsubcommittee is doing and has done.\n  I want the Record to reflect and I want the chairman of the \nsubcommittee to know how much I support the work on the Visitor Center. \nThe record is quite clear that I started supporting this when I was \nchairman of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee. I am sorry to say, I, \nalone, was unable to get this done. The real impetus for accomplishing \nthis was the tragic death of two Capitol Police officers. But for their \ndeaths, we would not have been able to be in the position we are now in \nwith this Capitol Visitor Center. But we are here.\n  We have had complaints from some of my friends, as a matter of fact, \nwho serve in the Congress of the United States, who complain about the \nfunding for this not being adequate, the original number. Well, any one \nof us who drives through here sees the tremendous engineering feat that \nis taking place in the front of this historic building. It is a huge \njob. I go out at least once a week and watch them. I suggest every \nMember of Congress go out and watch what they are doing out there.\n  Why are they doing it? To make this Capitol safer than it was before \nthis facility began to be built. To make it more convenient for people \nwho want to visit the Capitol. In the summer and winter, when people \nwant to come to this building, they stand outside. There is no place \nfor them to go to the bathroom. There is no place for them to get a \ndrink of water or have a snack.\n  The Visitor Center is going to provide that. It will also allow \nsecurity checks to be made so people don't come into the Capitol \ncarrying things they shouldn't carry and doing bad things to people \nthey shouldn't do.\n  So I want the chairman of this subcommittee to know that I am on \nboard. I will defend, in any way I can, the work that is being done in \nfront of this building. It is important for our country.\n  When I first got this subcommittee, I could not believe the east \nfront of the Capitol of the United States was a parking lot, a blacktop \nparking lot. We were able to do a few things and get the cars moved off \nslowly but surely. That was a struggle. But I will do whatever I can to \nmake sure this Capitol Visitor Center is completed and is as nice as \nthe Capitol itself. We want the Visitor Center to be as nice as the \nCapitol itself.\n  If the people in charge--namely, the Architect of the Capitol--are \nallowed to go forward, it will be as nice as the rest of the Capitol. \nIt will be something of which we can all be proud. And people coming \nhere, who will be able to walk into this beautiful Capitol, will be \nable to see films of the Capitol itself. They will be able to pick up \ntour guides there. There will be a place for them to go to the bathroom \nor have a sandwich, if they want one, buy souvenirs. And they will not \nbe asking: The Capitol of the United States, this ugly blacktop with \ncars parked all over it? That is going to change. So I am happy to lend \nmy voice as a cheerleader for the Capitol improvement we will have out \nfront.\n  I am glad to see this bill includes $33 million over last year's \nlevel for the Capitol Police. Again, that probably isn't enough, but by \nthe end of fiscal year 2004, the Capitol Police will have 500 more \nofficers than they did on September 11, 2001--not enough but certainly \na step forward.\n  So, Mr. President, I am talking far longer than I should have. But I \nreally do have some sentimental attachment to this bill. It is not \noften I think of it, but the subway we ride from the Hart Building over \nto here is something I was able to work on when I was chairman of this \nLegislative Subcommittee. And we did not do it all at once. In fact, we \nput a little bit here and a little bit there, and pretty soon we had \nenough money to take care of the subway. It was $16 million.\n\n  The reason I worked so hard on that: I can remember the old cars you \ncan still see going to the Russell Building. A man in a wheelchair \ntried to get in that old subway car. He couldn't do it. They brought \nhim up there and put his legs--he was having spasms in his legs. They \ncouldn't do it. They couldn't put him up there, no matter how hard they \ntried. Now someone in a wheelchair just moves into the subway car, no \nproblem at all.\n  So, again, Mr. President, I have talked too long on this most \nimportant legislation we have before us. But I am proud of the years I \nspent working on the Legislative Branch Subcommittee. And I say to my \nfriend from Colorado, he has been a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee for some time, and I know he has been involved in other \nsubcommittees, and there have been some changes made, and this is the \nfirst year he has been chairman of this subcommittee.\n  I say to the Senator, I hope you will look back on your service on \nthis subcommittee with feelings as I have for what I really believe is \nthe good that comes from this subcommittee. It was--I repeat for \nprobably the third time--a joy to work on this subcommittee. I look \nback with such fond memories at the time I was able to spend on it. \nAnd, frankly, I am kind of glad Senator Durbin was tied up so I could \nreflect on my service as a Senator working on this subcommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Let me say, in closing, I certainly appreciate my \nfriend's support. We have a great deal in common. We both have sports \nbackgrounds. We are both westerners. We both have law enforcement \nbackgrounds. So we have worked on a good number of things together. And \nhis voice in support of this bill is really appreciated.\n  I guess he recognizes, as I do, that although many people in America \ndo not know very much about this bill, everyone who comes to the United \nStates Capitol, sooner or later, is affected by the money that is in \nthis bill.\n  I know, as my friend knows, there were many times we came to the \nCapitol--before that hole was in the ground out there--in the \nwintertime, with drizzling rain, drizzling freezing rain, and there \nwould be people lined up out on the tarmac, the blacktop, shivering, \nfreezing, just waiting for a chance to get in to watch these \nproceedings. That is not right.\n  When we get done with this Capitol Visitor Center, as my friend and \ncolleague from Nevada said, they are\n\n[[Page S9217]]\n\ngoing to have a place to learn a lot more about their Capitol and the \ninstitution in which we now serve. I think we will all be better served \nby finishing this Visitor Center.\n  I just want to tell the Senator from Nevada how much we appreciate \nhis support.\n  I have no further comments, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have not had any response to the \nrequest concerning title I and title II. So at this time, I ask \nunanimous consent that title I and title II be considered closed and \nnot be available for amendments or motions or points of order or any \naction at all as we consider the rest of this bill. That leaves title \nIII which is the supplemental portion available completely for \nconsideration of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I call to the attention of the Members of \nthe Senate that in this bill we have before us now--the House bill, as \namended by the Senate bill--we have title III which deals with \nsupplemental emergency appropriations for 2003.\n  In this bill is $1.550 billion for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity for disaster response. It is estimated that the disaster \nrelief fund will exhaust its current funding by the end of this month, \nJuly 2003, in part due to the higher than expected costs for disaster \nrelief, including funding for tornadoes and winter storms. These \nadditional resources are needed to continue to provide necessary \nemergency assistance.\n  There is also a NASA provision that provides an additional $50 \nmillion for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. These \nfunds will cover additional and unanticipated costs associated with the \nrecovery and investigation of the Space Shuttle Columbia accident, such \nas collection and reconstruction of the orbiter Columbia, and computer \nanalyses of potential failure scenarios and impact testing of space \nshuttle wing components.\n  We also have an amount in this bill for firefighting. We ask the \nSenate to provide an additional $253 million to the Forest Service for \nwildland fire suppression and emergency rehabilitation of burned areas \nto ensure sufficient funding for the 2003 fire season.\n  We also ask for an additional $36 million for the Bureau of Land \nManagement for wildland fire suppression and emergency rehabilitation \nof burned areas to assure that sufficient funding is available for the \n2003 fire season.\n  These funds will bring the total fiscal year 2003 funding available \nfor wildlife suppression to a level equal to the 10-year average, which \nincludes the severe 2002 fire season.\n  I am on notice there are several amendments we will be considering. I \nask my friend and colleague from West Virginia if he has any opening \nstatement to make concerning the supplemental request in this bill?\n  Mr. BYRD. I have none.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.\n  I know the Senator from Nevada has an amendment I join in offering. I \nremarked today at the hearing that we had in the Appropriations \nCommittee on the Interior appropriations bill, 2.2 million acres of my \nState burned last year. We have a series of very devastating fires \ngoing already. One of the worst problems we have is the infestation of \ninsects in trees that now have been dead for a couple of years. If a \nfire starts in those areas now, we will have a catastrophe of unknown \nsize. I join the Senator from Nevada in offering an amendment to \nprovide additional funds to deal with fire prevention as well as the \nfirefighting amendments we have in the bill already.\n  I yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1201\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the distinguished President pro tempore of \nthe Senate is very kind. I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nSenators Stevens and Reid for Senator Feinstein and Senator Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself, Mrs. \n     Feinstein, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Stevens, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1201.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To appropriate an additional $25,000,000 for emergency \nactions to reduce the threat to human safety arising from the threat of \n               catastrophic fire in dead and dying trees)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. ____. (a) Additional Amount for Cooperative Forestry \n     Assistance.--The amount appropriated by title __ of this Act \n     under the heading ``______________'' is hereby increased by \n     $25,000,000.\n       (b) Availability of Amount.--Of the amount appropriated by \n     title __ of this Act under the heading ``______________'', as \n     increased by subsection (a), $10,500,000 shall be available \n     for emergency actions to reduce the threat to human safety in \n     areas declared under a State of Emergency by the Governor of \n     any State due to the danger of catastrophic fire from dead \n     and dying trees including--\n       (1) clearing of evacuation routes;\n       (2) clearing around emergency shelter locations;\n       (3) clearing around emergency communication sites; and\n       (4) clearing buffer zones around highly populous \n     communities in order to prevent fire sweeping though such \n     communities.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am confident and hopeful that the \ncommittee can work something out on this matter before final passage. \nSenator Feinstein is heavily engaged. She is an important member of the \nJudiciary Committee. She has been involved in that every step of the \nway. This is legislation that involves so many very important issues. \nIt really would have been very hurtful to the committee and the \nmovement of that legislation not to have Senator Feinstein come over \nhere and offer this amendment. As a result of that, during the last \nvote, she spoke to Senator Daschle and me and asked if we would cover \nher. This is something I am very happy to do, knowing how strongly she \nfeels about this and the difficult problems that exist in California \nwith the beetle problem. Senator Stevens has indicated that exists all \nover the country. This amendment will maybe not take care of everything \nbut will take care of a lot of it. I hope the committee would strongly \nconsider the amendment prior to final passage of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for \nsending the amendment of Senator Feinstein at my suggestion. The \namendment will make money available for a fund that is depleted. That \nfund is available under this amendment to fulfill the request or \nattempt to fulfill the request of the Governor of any State to deal \nwith the trees that are dead or dying because of infestation of these \nbeetles. They are not all the same types of beetles but the result is \nthe same. Dead timber is nothing but fuel for an enormous fire, if one \ngets started in the area of that. That happened in what we call the \nMillers' Reach fire north of Anchorage. I personally watched it from a \nhelicopter. The sinuosity of that fire just followed right through the \ndead areas. Then it came back to burn the whole area. Once it started, \nthe fire just kept burning out.\n  I think the answer is to try to deal with the dead trees as quickly \nas possible and protect particularly the developed areas as much as \npossible from these areas. This amendment will allow Governors of any \nState to request funds to deal with that. Again, this is 2003 money. We \nare not talking about an enormous sum. This is money for the balance of \nthis year. We hope the bills for 2004 that will come before the Senate \nlater will adequately cover all those items. I join the Senator from \nNevada and hope the Senate will approve this amendment. I ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I want to \nbe very helpful here on Senator Feinstein's amendment because I am sure \nit is going to a very worthy cause. But I want to ask the chairman, \nsince it is attempting to put money into an account that is depleted, \nthe amendment I am going to be offering will also put money into an \naccount that is depleted, that is empty, for a different purpose but \nfor the same effort, because there is a real problem of levee\n\n[[Page S9218]]\n\nrates in Louisiana. I hesitate to object to the amendment or to even \noppose it, because I don't oppose what we are trying to do. But I do \noppose adding money to a depleted account when we don't seem to be able \nto add money for an account that is depleted.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator would check with her staff, I have \nalready cleared her amendment with regard to moneys to go into that \naccount in a similar way we have done for this beetle problem.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for adoption of the amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, there are now as many as 415,000 acres \nof dead and dying trees on the San Bernardino and Cleveland National \nForests and surrounding private lands as the result of drought, decades \nof fire suppression, and a bark beetle infestation.\n  Jack Blackwell, the Regional Forester for California, has described \nthis situation as an unprecedented threat to public safety.\n  There are large mountaintop communities with over 90,000 people \ntotal, communities that are completely surrounded by thousands and \nthousands of deed trees. In addition, the only escape routes are narrow \nwinding mountain roads which are themselves surrounded by dead and \ndying trees.\n  The result is that thousands of lives are at risk.\n  There is some good news, in that San Bernardino National Forest and \nCalifornia Department of Forestry staff agree on the four highest \npriority tasks to reduce the threat to public safety.\n  First, they want to clear evacuation routes from the mountain \ncommunities. This involves clearing a corridor on either side of major \nescape roads so people can escape from their communities without being \nblocked by fallen trees, or the radiant heat of the fire.\n  Second, they want to clear trees around safety zones like elementary \nschools and camps. This gives people a place to go if they can't get \nout of the community.\n  Next they want to clear brush around communication sites in the \nforest to communicate with the public and emergency responders.\n  Finally, they want to clear buffer zones around populous communities, \nprotecting thousands of lives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1201) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1200, As Modified\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1200 and send a \nmodification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself and Ms. \n     Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered 1200, as modified.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To transfer education funds that would otherwise lapse to the \n                    Title I Grants to LEAs program)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, during the \n     period from September 1 through September 30, 2003, the \n     Secretary of Education shall transfer to the Education for \n     the Disadvantaged account an amount not to exceed $4,353,368 \n     from amounts that would otherwise lapse at the end of fiscal \n     year 2003 and that were originally made available under the \n     Department of Education Appropriations Act, 2003 or any \n     Department of Education Appropriations Act for a previous \n     fiscal year: Provided, That the funds transferred to the \n     Education for the Disadvantaged account shall be obligated by \n     September 30, 2003: Provided further, That the Secretary \n     shall notify the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses \n     of Congress of any such transfer.\n       Provided further, Any amounts transferred to the Education \n     for the Disadvantaged account pursuant to the previous \n     paragraph shall be for carrying out subpart 2 of part A of \n     title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965, and shall be allocated, notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, only to those States that received funds \n     under that subpart for fiscal year 2003 that were less than \n     those States received under that subpart for fiscal year \n     2002: Provided further, That the Secretary of Education shall \n     use these additional funds to increase those States' \n     allocations under that subpart up to the amount they received \n     under that subpart for fiscal year 2002: Provided further, \n     That each such State shall use the funds appropriated under \n     this paragraph to ratably increase the amount of funds for \n     each eligible local educational agency in the State that \n     received less under that subpart in fiscal year 2003 than it \n     received under that subpart in fiscal year 2002: Provided \n     further, That the Secretary shall not take into account the \n     funds made available under this paragraph in determining \n     State allocations under any other program administered by the \n     Secretary in any fiscal year.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is a very simple, fully offset \namendment that will restore a cut in title I funding to three States \nwithout harming or hurting any other State.\n  The fiscal year 2003 Labor-HHS appropriations bill that Congress \npassed in February included a 13 percent increase for title I, the most \nimportant Federal program in the No Child Left Behind Act. At the time \nthe Congressional Research Service projected every State would receive \na sizable increase over the previous year. But 4 months after the bill \nwas passed, new data from the 2000 census showed that three States \nwould actually get less title I money in fiscal year 2003 than they did \nin fiscal year 2002. Those three States are Iowa, Maryland, and \nMichigan. Their total cut in title I funding is $4.4 million.\n  The Congress did not intend for any State to get a cut in title I. I \nrecently had a meeting with Secretary Paige about this matter. We had a \nfull and frank discussion. He agreed to find an offset from Education \nDepartment funds that would otherwise lapse at the end of the fiscal \nyear. Again, let me make it clear, none of the title I money in this \namendment will come from any other State. It is fully offset by \nEducation Department funds that will not otherwise be spent. Secretary \nPaige has signed off on the amendment. So has Senator Specter, chairman \nof the Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am informed this amendment has been \ndiscussed with the Department of Education and at this time, the best I \ncan say is I am willing to accept the amendment and take it to \nconference. This is the first time we have seen the amendment, and it \nis somewhat complicated. But it goes to a point I understand Secretary \nPaige has discussed with the Senator from Iowa and it does affect three \nStates. I cannot commit that it will absolutely come out of conference, \nbut I will do my best to hold it. Right now, not having any further \ninformation than I have just received, I believe it is worthy of the \nSenate adopting the amendment so we can take it to conference. And we \nwill work with the Senator from Iowa if there are any comments that \ncome from the administration in the meantime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I urge that the amendment be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1200), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous to speak as in morning \nbusiness to pay tribute to some Californians who were killed in Iraq. \nIt will probably take no more than about 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Boxer are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask the managers if I may speak for a \nmoment about pending amendment. I don't want to call it up at this \npoint. I would like to talk about it for a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to discuss any matter \nshe wants to.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as we are still working on the \namendment, I hesitate to call it up at this point. I\n\n[[Page S9219]]\n\nwant to talk for a moment about why this amendment is so important. I \nthink what the Senator from Alaska is doing is extremely important, and \nI commend the administration for putting forth a bill that really helps \nto address some very serious problems in our Nation because the \nemergency accounts are depleted.\n  There are many emergencies occurring in our Nation, from fires to \ntornadoes. People's lives and homes are at risk. If the Federal \nGovernment doesn't act and do it quickly and appropriately, tremendous \nhardships and difficulties can result. So I am 100 percent supportive, \nand so are the people in my State, just as is every State that suffers \nfrom natural disasters.\n  I am having a difficult time understanding why there is some \nhesitation--and the chairman has been very cooperative--to fund or to \nask for money to fund the emergency fund--not a nonemergency fund, but \nan emergency fund that is completely empty. There is no money left in \nthis account. It is a very important account not just for Louisiana, \nbut for Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, California, and for all \nthe States in the Union. It is the only account in the Federal \nGovernment that allows the Corps of Engineers to fix the levees when \nthey are damaged in anticipation of a great storm that might come, and \nto prevent the loss of property damage. So we can save money in the \nbill by providing a little bit of maintenance on these levees. This \naccount is empty.\n  I am asking for whatever the chairman and the Members of the Senate \nthink we can afford--whether it is $20 million, $30 million, $40 \nmillion--to get us through the end of the year so we are prepared when \nthe storms come. And they will come, hurricanes will come.\n  We just had a pretty tough storm last weekend. There is one out in \nthe gulf as we speak. If I had time, I could put up a chart that shows \nwhere it is. There will be storms, and it is predicted to be a very \ndifficult season. We hope and pray and prepare. But the account that \nhelps us to prepare is empty. There is not a dime in this account. Let \nme repeat. The account that helps the Corps of Engineers prepare levee \nsystems for the whole country--not just Louisiana--is empty.\n  We are getting ready to pass a bill to protect us from emergencies. \nYet this account is empty. I am asking the Senate to not pass this bill \nwithout putting some money into this account so that we can build up \nthe levees in anticipation of storms--not after a storm has come \nthrough and wreaked hundreds of millions of dollars of damage, but \nbefore the storm hits, to be able to repair the levees that have been \nweakened by rain or by storms that are not hurricanes, tropical storms, \nor storms that don't rate to be a hurricane, and to prepare the levees \nto prevent the taxpayers from having to pick up a bigger tab.\n  That is why I want to spend a few minutes talking about this issue \nand asking the Senate for its attention. If we can find $25 million to \nhelp fund disasters that occur because of dead trees, I think we can \nfind at least half of that money somewhere to preserve the levy system \nin the country that protects billions and billions of dollars of \ninfrastructure everywhere, not just in Louisiana.\n  As the chairman and staff are considering what to do, I hope we can \nfind a certain amount of money to make sure we get through the end of \nthe fiscal year or get through a period where on another bill, perhaps \nenergy and water appropriations, we can add some money.\n  Whether $10 million or $20 million is enough, I do not know. Perhaps \nthe Corps of Engineers which is engaged in this debate can give us some \nidea, based on weather predictions and patterns, determine what amount \nwill be enough to help us.\n  This is a huge issue for Louisiana, and it is a big issue for all the \nStates. My people are afraid. They are frightened. The phone has been \nringing off the hook because of the storm from last week. When I called \nthe Corps of Engineers, which I typically do after a storm, and said, \nCould you please send some crews to help us with the levees, the people \nare very frightened, they said to me: Senator, there is no more money. \nWe would love to send the crews, but there is no money in the account.\n  I said: Do not worry about it; there is a bill coming through the \nSenate for this exact purpose--only to find out maybe the bill is not \nfor this purpose. That is why I am going to offer this amendment in a \nfew minutes, sometime tonight, and hopefully we can get it resolved.\n  The Senator from Nevada, because he is the ranking member on the \nEnergy and Water Development Subcommittee which funds the Corps of \nEngineers, knows how important this particular fund is for the regular \nmaintenance of a levee system, not after the Governor calls it a \ndisaster. This is for maintaining the levees before the storms hit to \nprevent damage, to minimize damage, and save people's lives and \nproperty.\n  There are other accounts that kick in once something is declared an \nemergency. That is not what I am talking about. There is no money in \nthe account right now as we speak to prevent and repair the levee.\n  The Senator from Alabama on the floor. I know he is going to speak on \nanother subject. But there is no money to repair levees in Alabama, \nwhich is a coastal State, or any State. The account is zeroed out.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the right to offer my amendment later \ntonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there is still $330,000 left in this \naccount. It is a strange account. There has been extraordinary activity \nin this account because of the tornadoes that hit the Midwest this \nyear. That is why it is now depleted. There is $60 million in the 2004 \nbill which will be coming before the Senate next week.\n  We are dealing with a question of how much money might be needed for \nprevention in the period between the time this bill is enacted and \nsigned, which we hope will be sometime before the end of this month. At \nmost, we are dealing with 8 weeks of money that might be called upon on \nthe basis of a Governor's request and a Presidential declaration of \ndisaster in taking preparatory steps to prevent further damage.\n  Again, I am on notice that at least two other Senators intend to ask \nfor similar money. I am told by the people who handle this money that \nthe most that could be used is $10 million. I am prepared to offer an \namendment--I will do it or ask the Senator from Louisiana to offer it--\nthat will put $10 million in this fund to remain available for \nexpenditure. That means, if it is not used in 2003, it will carry over \nto 2004.\n  Right now there are no demands, obviously, because there is still \nsome money in the account. In order to be safe, we are willing to ask \nfor an additional amount of $10 million for this fiscal year, 2003.\n  I inquire, does the Senator want to offer an amendment for $10 \nmillion or shall I offer it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am happy to let the Senator offer that \namendment. I will support the amendment, but the last telephone call I \nmade to the Corps emptied their fund of $600,000, and if there was \n$300,000 in that account this morning, it should be empty now because \nthe money is heading to Louisiana to fix some levies.\n  I thank the Senator for his help.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1206\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1206.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: Making emergency appropriations to the Corps of Engineers for \n                         emergency assistance)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       ``: Provided further, That for an additional amount for \n     ``Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies,'' for emergency \n     expenses due to flood control, hurricane, and shore \n     protection activities, as authorized by section 5 of the \n     Flood Control Act of August 16, 1941, as amended (33 USC \n     701n), $10,000,000, to remain available until expended:''\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is for the Corps of Engineers flood \ncontrol\n\n[[Page S9220]]\n\nand coastal emergencies fund. It will be available immediately upon the \nsignature of the President.\n  This bill does have a clause that makes funds in this bill, title \nIII, immediately available to the President for disbursing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  If there is no further debate on the amendment, without objection, \nthe amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1206) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the Senator from Louisiana is here, I \nsay to her, I think she did the right thing. I am the ranking member on \nthe Energy and Water Development Subcommittee. The President requested \n$75 million for this account this year. Senator Domenici and I are \ngoing to mark that bill up and pass it out shortly.\n  As the Senator from Alaska said, if, in fact, there is an emergency, \nwe have this money in there, of course. Also, if anything goes wrong \nwithin the next 60 days before the 2004 bill passes, money can always \nbe used from FEMA if there is an emergency. For the people of \nLouisiana, I hope there is no natural disaster but if there is, it is \nnot as if there is no way of helping them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1202\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I appreciate the \nopportunity to make some remarks. I thank Senator Stevens for his \ncourtesy in allowing me to have this time.\n  I ask that the pending business be set aside, and that the amendment \nI previously filed, No. 1202, be called up for debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no amendment that needs to be set \naside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1202.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To eliminate the additional amount for programs under the \n              National and Community Service Act of 1990)\n\n       In title III, strike the following: ``Provided further, \n     That for an additional amount for `Corporation for National \n     and Community Service, National and Community Service \n     Programs Operating Expenses', for grants under the National \n     Service Trust program authorized under subtitle C of title I \n     of the National and Community Service Act of 1990 (the `Act') \n     (42 U.S.C. 12571 et seq.) (relating to activities including \n     the AmeriCorps program) and for educational awards authorized \n     under subtitle D of title I of the Act (42 U.S.C. 12601), \n     $100,000,000, with funds for grants to remain available until \n     September 30, 2004, and funds for educational awards to \n     remain available until expended:''.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered will remove \nthe $100 million that is contained in the emergency supplemental \nsection. I think it is wrong to include it in the emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill. It apparently is not an emergency, \nand I wish to talk about that a little bit. It is certainly not good \npublic policy for us to do this.\n  There are people in this Congress who support AmeriCorps and there \nare those who oppose it. My concern at this point deals with how this \nmoney has been added and whether or not it should be properly added.\n  The emergency supplemental that has been made part of the legislation \nmoving forward tonight involves the expenditure of Federal money \noutside the budget we approved. I serve on the Budget Committee. We \nworked hard to develop a budget of which we felt proud and on which we \ncould agree. Frankly, with the deficits we are facing, I thought the \nbudget was a little higher than I would have liked to see but it had a \nmodest growth across the board in all areas.\n  We agreed on it, and it passed in this Senate. We understand that \nlegitimate emergencies occur during the year. We understand that when \nthose emergencies occur, it is appropriate for Congress to appropriate \nemergency funding for them. This emergency funding agreement has some \nvaluable items in it. We have a number of emergencies today but there \nhas been a tendency--and I would say it is not a good tendency--to add \nto the emergency supplemental general items of appropriation that \npeople would like to see be passed and be paid for.\n  I remember talking with a senior member of the House of \nRepresentatives. We wanted to get a bill passed that would help \nAlabama. I talked to him about how we might do this. He said: Jeff, we \nneed to look for a supplemental.\n  I said: Well, good.\n  He said: Do you know why?\n  I said: No.\n  He said: The reason you want a supplemental is it does not count \nagainst the deficit.\n  Well, I thought that was kind of amusing. I said: What do you mean it \ndoes not count against the deficit? It is money we spend.\n  He said: I do not know. It is just money that does not get counted \nagainst the deficit.\n  What he really meant was it does not count against the budget. If you \nspend something extra, under a normal appropriations bill and you \nexceed the budget, or you should stay within your budget, the \nappropriators try to do so and if they spend money on one item they \nhave to save money on something else. They have more requests than they \ncan fund so they take the money and they reduce it to fund what they \nwant. Some things do not get funded. One great way to get something \ndone that one wants done in their district, that they believe in, that \nis easy to do, that requires no offsets, no competing against any other \nappropriations, is to tack it on to an emergency supplemental. Of \ncourse, it does add to the deficit. It adds to our debt. It increases \nour debt. It is real money and it is a real expenditure. It just \ncircumvents the budget process and the integrity of the budget process.\n  Frankly, a lot of these supplementals ought to be offset anyway. We \ncould find $1.9 billion to offset these emergencies we are funding. I \nknow we did not. We do not have to. This is the kind of emergency bill \nthat we normally face and we normally pass without offsetting. So that \nis the circumstance we are in.\n  I would like to go into that a little bit further. I want to say this \nbefore we get into the details of this amendment: Tomorrow is cost of \ngovernment day. Cost of government day is a day in the calendar year \nwhen Americans have paid their share of Federal, State, local tax, and \nregulatory burdens. This year cost of government day is 4\\1/2\\ days \nlater than last year. This means that from the beginning of this year, \nAmericans have been working for the Government and will not stop \nworking for the Government to pay their taxes until tomorrow. That is a \nbig deal.\n  One of the best ways we have to maintain some control over spending \nis the budget process. This supplemental is outside the budget process. \nSo I am concerned about it. So $100 million, that makes us work just a \nlittle bit longer this year than we would have otherwise. By passing \nthis amendment, we work a little less for the Government this year than \nwould otherwise be the case.\n\n  I will go a little further. The AmeriCorps appropriation does not \nbelong in title III to an emergency bill. Let me say why. Look at the \nbill itself. Here are the legitimate emergency fundings that are in \nthis bill: $1.55 billion for disaster relief and emergency assistance \nfor fires and those kinds of events. That is important. That is a \nlegitimate emergency, I think. At least historically we have considered \nit so. There is $50 million to cover expenses for responding to the \nSpace Shuttle Columbia accident. NASA has incurred some substantial \ncosts as a result of that. This will not fully reimburse them for that \nbut it will be a help. There is $289 million for wildlife fire \nsuppression and emergency rehabilitation activities. So I can \nunderstand those. Those are legitimate designations. While I would like \nto see us have offsets for that within the budget, that is not going to \nhappen.\n\n[[Page S9221]]\n\n  However, during the markup of this supplemental, without any real \ndebate the committee agreed to an amendment to provide $100 million in \nemergency supplemental funds for AmeriCorps not requested by the \nPresident. The President requested emergency funding for these other \nitems. His budget people reviewed them carefully. The funds and numbers \nthey asked for were subject to some scrutiny there. So in this \nemergency category, we have disaster relief, space shuttle accident, \nwildfires, and AmeriCorps. I do not think it belongs on this list.\n  I see the value in AmeriCorps but I have been concerned about it for \nsome time as not being a well run agency. I have not led a fight \nagainst it on the Senate floor but I have had some serious concerns. \nThey have been shared by a very knowledgeable person who cares about \nAmeriCorps and who cares about helping people in need.\n  I want to read from a press release from Congressman Jim Walsh, who \nis chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on VA/HUD and \nIndependent Agencies with oversight over AmeriCorps, the national \nservice program.\n  This is a committee where this ought to be dealt with. It ought to be \ndealt with in our appropriations bill from our committee that deals \nwith these very agencies. I want my colleagues to listen to the \nextraordinary comments that Congressman Walsh makes. Frankly, when I \nraised my objection to this addition to the emergency bill, it was \nbased primarily on the process concerns and my generalized concern \nabout the efficiency of AmeriCorps. I did not realize AmeriCorps had \nmisbehaved as badly as it has. This is what Congressman Walsh said:\n\n       I have been a strong and consistent supporter of the \n     AmeriCorps program throughout my tenure in the United States \n     Congress. Hundreds of volunteers have accomplished some \n     amazing things in communities across my home State of New \n     York. As a returned Peace Corps volunteer--\n\n  He is talking about himself--\n\n       I recognize and appreciate the value of this service \n     program for local communities, program participants and our \n     Nation at large. In fact, I was a supporter of its mission \n     and opportunity the day the program was signed into law by \n     President Clinton, and remain a steadfast supporter today.\n\n  Now I would like to share the concerns of this strong supporter. He \nsays this:\n\n       However, AmeriCorps has been sadly plagued by poor \n     management and weak financial oversight by program managers \n     in Washington since its inception. Repeatedly, AmeriCorps \n     administrators have overestimated capacity and underestimated \n     available resources. This Congress has repeatedly instructed \n     AmeriCorps to reform its management and to improve its \n     accounting procedures, all the while working to live up to \n     the commitments to its current participants.\n       Most recently, just two months ago this Congress \n     appropriated an additional $64 million in supplemental \n     funding to close another budget gap, this time to cover \n     agency overspending of funds clearly designated to cover \n     existing volunteers' educational stipends.\n\n  So he says just 2 months ago we appropriated another $64 million to \ncover overspending by this program. Why do we need extra money? Because \nthey overspent. They mismanaged and they came back 2 months ago and got \n$64 million. That is not enough. They want another $100 million.\n  Quoting Congressman Walsh, this supporter of AmeriCorps:\n\n       In the fiscal year 2003 bill--\n\n  That is the bill we are operating under this year--\n\n       Congress provided necessary funding to cover the enrollment \n     of 50,000 volunteers nationwide. Federal law set that as the \n     enrollment limit, and AmeriCorps administrators agreed to it. \n     In response, those same administrators went out and \n     contracted with grantees and local agencies for 70,000 \n     volunteers without the money or the authorization to do so.\n\n  I am just quoting Congressman Walsh.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       My opposition to the Senate's supplemental AmeriCorps \n     appropriation proposal comes down to an issue of \n     accountability. We shouldn't reward an agency that violates \n     federal law and mismanages taxpayer dollars by providing \n     additional funding until clear and consistent reforms have \n     been enacted. Should these requested funds be appropriated, I \n     have little faith that the existing operation could get the \n     funding out of Washington to local community grantees \n     effectively or equitably by the end of this fiscal year on \n     September 30th.\n       The positive impact AmeriCorps volunteer programs have \n     across the country makes this a difficult decisions to make, \n     but I truly believe that this action is necessary if true \n     reform is to occur and the agency's long-term stability \n     secured.\n       At the same time, I look forward to constructing an FY '04 \n     appropriations bill that adequately meets the growing role \n     AmeriCorps volunteers have been asked to play by increasing \n     ranks and expanding opportunities should agency leaders be \n     able to demonstrate their commitment to improving management \n     practices, reforming financial operations, and strengthening \n     grant procedures.\n\n  So we are being asked to tack on to an emergency bill an AmeriCorps \nsupplemental of $100 million in addition to the $64 million in \nsupplemental funding added to close another budget gap earlier this \nyear, and we still do not have reform and an understanding that we are \ngoing to fix the out-of-control agency. This is an important matter.\n  I note that Mr. Thomas Schatz, the president of Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste, has written. He strongly supports this amendment. He \nnotes that:\n\n       . . . striking anomaly about AmeriCorps is that it is not a \n     volunteer program at all. Rather, it recruits college-age \n     students for paid positions and then uses taxpayer dollars to \n     subsidize the organizations that hire these recruits. Those \n     hired by AmeriCorps participants cost taxpayers a bundle. An \n     August 1995 GAO audit of 93 AmeriCorps grantees found that \n     programs operated by nonprofit, state, and local agencies \n     received about $25,800 in cash and in-kind contributions per \n     participant.\n\n  I don't know whether the program is worth it in the long run or \nwhether it can be affirmed in the long run, but what I would say is \nthat it is unlikely the money can be gotten out before the next fiscal \nyear. Why not have the money go through the normal legislative process \nand be in next year's budget? It is really for scholarships for these \npeople who work; they promise to give them scholarships in the future. \nThey won't be drawing the scholarships down for 2 years more. I don't \nthink we have to do it this year.\n  The situation with their management is worse than I thought. It \nshould not be on this emergency bill.\n  If we are going to get serious about spending, this is the kind of \nthing on which we all ought to be agreed. This is the kind of thing to \nwhich we have to say no. If we have to give more to AmeriCorps, let's \ndo it in the appropriations account where we have a budget cap and it \nwill compete against other items in that cap. If it merits additional \nfunding, so be it. If it does not merit it, so be it. Let us not tack \nit on to the debt. This will be paid for in no other way but by \nincreased debt. I don't think we ought to do it. I feel strongly about \nit.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I shall in a moment make a motion to \ntable the Senator's motion to strike. I want to make sure, before the \nSenator leaves, that we have an understanding that after having made \nthat motion to table, I shall move to set that motion aside until \ntomorrow morning, at which time I will ask for 10 minutes equally \ndivided on my motion to table, to be divided in the usual form, which \nwould mean that the Senator from Alabama would have half that time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the distinguished chairman for his courtesies, \nas always.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do not make that motion yet because the Senator from \nMaryland wishes to speak.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. First to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nwill I have time tomorrow morning?\n  Mr. STEVENS. There would be 5 minutes. I am opposed, so I would be in \ncontrol of 5 minutes, and I would be sure to allow the Senator from \nMaryland to have a portion. I would think Senator Bond might have a \nportion. I would have a minute, and you each would have 2 minutes. You \ncan speak at length tonight.\n  Does the Senator wish more than that time tomorrow morning?\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Of course, I first of all thank our colleague from \nAlabama for offering this amendment earlier this evening. I would like \nabout 3 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We will assure the Senator has 3 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. But I want to make sure my reform-minded colleague, \nSenator Bond, can speak.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We will do that.\n\n[[Page S9222]]\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I understand my colleague from Alabama, who offered \nthis amendment, is in an armed services conference. I say to the \nSenator I appreciate the demands on his time. I will say some things \nand have a more elaborate statement, but I thank the Senator for \nleaving the conference and I thank the Senator for offering this \namendment earlier in the evening.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator for her comments. I will have to \ndepart.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I state to the Senator from Alabama some facts. First \nof all, the reason this is being declared an emergency is that if this \n$100 million is not in this appropriation, 20,000 volunteers will lose \ntheir slots. I want to speak about the debacle and the bureaucratic \nboondoggle at the national corporation.\n  I say to my colleague from Alabama, he is absolutely right, but what \nhe should know is that the VA-HUD subcommittee chaired by Senator Bond \nhas been in the forefront of reform. I say to our colleague that our \nApril 15 hearing was when we found out that AmeriCorps, National \nCorporation, had enrolled 70,000 volunteers when we had given them \nmoney for 50,000 volunteers. I want the Senator to know that we went \nballistic. Also, the Senator should know we called the board the Enron \ncorporation of nonprofits. I later wrote to the President asking for \nmore money, a better board and the resignation of Mr. Lenkowsky.\n  The criticisms are there, but when you talk about the need for \naccounting reform and transparency and all of the excellent things, the \nSenator should know that our colleague, Senator Bond from Missouri, \nchairman of the committee, has been a leader in shaking up the agency \nand I have been his very able partner. We have insisted on a new CFO. \nWe have insisted on better procedures. We have been doing this, and I \nmight add, we were doing it, sir, when the House wasn't paying one bit \nof attention.\n  It was our oversight hearing that found under this rock were a lot of \nother rocks, and under those rocks were worms.\n  We know that. We agree with that. What we do not want to do, though, \nis punish these volunteers and the communities they serve because of \nthe overenrollment. In all honesty, what you should know is that if \nthis supplemental does not occur, 20,000 volunteers will lose their \nslots, like in Teach America. There will be 395 in my State. I am sure \nmy colleague will see them in his State.\n  So while we want to really throttle the bureaucracy--throttle the \nbureaucracy--we do not want to punish the volunteers and the \ncommunities we serve.\n  We are at a pivotal point--actually a crisis point. So that is why \nthis is in the supplemental. The Senator is well within his rights to \nraise some of the questions he does. But from the standpoint of the \ncommunities and these 20,000 volunteers, this is a pivotal point.\n  I could go on and tell you about the merits of AmeriCorps. I will not \nkeep you. I will have more things printed in the Record. I am very \nmindful of your time.\n  But I wanted to say to my colleague from Alabama, his call for \nreform? We issued it even years ago. We have really been pressing. \nActually, I think with this new CFO, you would like him very much.\n  But I really have to defend Senator Bond's efforts in moving for \nadministrative reform. I want to say these administrative problems also \npredate President Bush's time. I do not know if the Senator would like \nto comment on that. My next set of remarks will be about AmeriCorps and \nthe consequences of this. But I wanted to share those facts with the \nSenator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank my colleague. The Senator from Maryland is one \nof our exemplary Members. She manages details and watches things better \nthan most. I am glad she made some strong efforts to reform this \nprogram.\n  I have two concerns about it. My original comments, when I saw the \nsupplemental on this bill, went to the fact I did not think it should \nbe on this bill. I did not realize the program had really gotten as far \noff course as it has, and been mismanaged as badly as the Senator just \nhas stated. So it seems to me what we are doing is, by having this on \nthe emergency supplemental, as the subcommittee in charge of oversight \nover the program that admits it has been out of control, that \nsubcommittee will be able to get extra money to finance that \nmismanagement without it coming out of its appropriated, allocated \namount by shifting it purely to debt, which is what the supplemental is \ngoing to be funded by, additional debt. I think it would be better \nfrugal management if we could put it on next year's bill that you \nprobably are already beginning to work on. That would be accountable \nunder the budget.\n  I am delighted the Senator is working on accountability. I know there \nis no Senator here who has a deeper commitment to integrity in the \nprocess than the Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would say on a bipartisan basis we \nwere working for very strong administrative management and fiscal \nreform. We have worked. It was our committee that uncovered this fiasco \nin April. We have been, since, working with OMB on management \nimprovement as well as accounting flexibility to get them over the \nhump. Remember, it is volunteers who will be penalized. It will be \nvolunteers and communities that will be penalized, not the bureaucracy. \nThe bureaucracy gets to keep their jobs. They get to move papers \naround. It is the volunteers who are going to be punished.\n\n  So we have a difference of opinion about how you can get reform. But \nwe did move in accounting flexibility, when this Senate passed it 100 \nto nothing. We did it in 1 day, the House the next day. The President \nwas able to sign it. But flexibility without funds was a hollow \nvictory. So we need the $100 million to cover the rest of the quarter \nso these 20,000 volunteers do not lose their slots.\n  That is why this is in this supplemental. It was our original intent, \nSenator Kennedy and I were going to offer this amendment on the floor. \nBut we understood there was sympathy for our position at the White \nHouse no commitments, no guarantees, but sympathy. I must say, the \nPresident, in his State of the Union, called for a spirit of \nvoluntarism. The outpouring has been tremendous. What happened was they \nended up overenrolling. But we are now going to snuff out the spirit of \nAmerica, snuff out the call to service the President himself requested. \nWe are going to trample on the very ideals these young people want to \nbring to their communities.\n  We cannot trample on their idealism. We should not snuff out this \nopportunity because there is a bureaucratic boondoggle. The ``boon'' \nought to go to the ``dogglers,'' not to the volunteers.\n  So we believe this modest amount of money, in the overall trillion \ndollar budget, would be a bridge to get AmeriCorps over troubled waters \nand would ensure these volunteers would have their jobs.\n  In Maryland, 395 volunteers would be cut from civic work which \nremodels and rehabilitates homes, tutors kids, works in a variety of \nways in these very poor neighborhoods. I personally know what they have \ndone to rehabilitate boarded-up houses.\n  The Baltimore Reads program, the Teach America program--I could list \nthem. But it is not about programs; it is about people helping.\n  I am going to tell you the story of a young man named Mark who was an \nAmeriCorps volunteer who came to Baltimore and went into one of our \npoor schools where kids were performing at the 25th percentile. When he \nleft after his 3-year stint, they were performing at the 70th \npercentile. And, because of the voucher he had earned, he was able to \npay down his student debt and therefore be free to get a master's in \nteaching, and he is now a full-time teacher in Baltimore schools \nbecause he so loved what he had come to, the sense of accomplishment \nthat had come from being a volunteer in Teach America.\n  We believe this is $100 million in an emergency supplemental that \nwill help these volunteers do what they want. They will answer the call \nfor service of our own President. The communities and the volunteers \nwill not be punished for bureaucratic mismanagement. We have worked on \nreform. The reform efforts have been a bipartisan effort. The \nleadership for greater accountability has been led by our colleague \nfrom Missouri and we think we have real momentum now. The White House \nis\n\n[[Page S9223]]\n\nwatching over this program. The board is now engaged. I believe a new \nCEO is on the way. We have the right CFO to help us with the financing \naccountability. There needs to be this bridge to get these 20,000 \nvolunteers over the troubled waters. This is why I believe it should \nstay in the supplemental and I hope the majority of the Senate would \nconcur with that.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator from Maryland yield for a question?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. To the Senator? Of course.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friend from Maryland. I am looking at the \nlanguage. It says the funds for AmeriCorps, on page 54:\n\n       . . . with the funds for grants to remain available until \n     September 30, 2004, and funds for educational awards to \n     remain available until expended. . . .\n\n  Correct me if I am wrong. Almost none of this money will be spent in \n2003, and this basically is an appropriation for 2004. Why don't we do \nthis in the 2004 bill instead of now? It doesn't seem to me to fit into \nthe definition of assistance. We only have 2\\1/2\\ months left in fiscal \nyear 2003. I don't know why we are doing this amendment on this urgent \nsupplemental. I don't think it fits that definition.\n  Could you tell me, is any of this money going to be spent in 2003, \nand why isn't this really an appropriation for 2004?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I see what the Senator is saying: ``To remain available \nuntil.'' That means if for some reason they don't use this, it would \nexpire. That doesn't mean it begins in 2004. It means that it will be \navailable through 2004.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I want to make a statement, if my \ncolleague from Maryland is finished. I want to speak on the amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Let me doublecheck this. We have a little disagreement. \nI will be right here.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I inform my colleague from Maryland \nthat CBO estimates that there will be zero money spent in 2003.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I wish to compliment my colleague, \nSenator Sessions from Alabama, for raising this amendment. I urge our \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I tell my friend and colleague, the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, that I understand the publicity that AmeriCorps has received \nbecause it has not been managed properly. But this does not belong in \nthis bill. The urgent supplemental for 2003 is to help pressing needs \nwhich has to be done now and that can't wait until the 2004 \nappropriations process.\n  I have great confidence that the Senator from Alaska and our \ncolleagues in the House are going to finish appropriations bills on \ntime. They will be done by the end of September.\n  But this particular provision says there is $100 million and it will \nbe available to be spent through the end of 2004.\n  Incidentally, the educational awards granted after people provide \nvoluntary paid services--kind of a contradiction in terms--but after \nthey provide their public service, they are entitled to reap \neducational awards equaling about $5,000 per year; that is, for \nfuture--that should be dealt with in the 2004 bill. It shouldn't be \ndealt with now. It doesn't belong on this bill.\n  In April, we gave AmeriCorps $64 million. There has been some \nmismanagement, obviously. But we knew about that in April. We gave them \n$64 million in April. How much is enough?\n  If this is not going to be spent in 2003 and the Congressional Budget \nOffice, which is our budget arm, says this money isn't going to be \nspent in 2003--they say most of it won't be spent in 2004.\n  I think what has happened is some people have read some articles and \ngot excited, saying we will be able to slip this in and we will have an \nextra $100 million to spend for next year and we will do it under the \nguise of an emergency. That requires 60 votes. We just gave them $64 \nmillion additional money in April. If we find out that this money is \navailable to be spent anytime up through the end of next year, it is \nreally a 2004 appropriation. It doesn't belong in a 2003 urgent \nsupplemental bill that we use for fire, for FEMA, and for real \nemergencies. It doesn't fit that definition. It wasn't requested by the \nadministration.\n  I will make a couple of other comments on the program.\n  When we talk about wanting to encourage and help volunteers, this \nprogram costs about $18,000 per year per participant. That is a lot of \nmoney. When we talk about volunteers, we are talking about a cost that \nis very high. It has payments to the individual, it has payments for \ndaycare, it has payments for health care, and it has educational \nassistance of about $1,000 per year. It ranges from $20,000 to $18,000 \nper person. That is a lot of money to be paying for ``volunteers'' to \ndo a lot of services that, frankly, most people do for free or most \npeople donate for charity. Most people volunteer and are not paid.\n  I just make these comments. This is a program that has run amuck and \nthat has not been well managed. Now we are rewarding that poor \nmanagement and doing it under the guise of emergency in 2003 when we \nonly have 2\\1/2\\ months left in this fiscal year and we are going to \nadd $100 million. CBO estimates that every single dollar of this will \nbe spent not in 2003 but in 2004 or 2005 or later.\n  To try to stick it in under the guise of emergency for 2003 is very \ninappropriate. I think it violates the whole spirit of what we call an \n``emergency.''\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the amendment of Senator Sessions.\n  I might also mention this jeopardizes some things. I want us to be \nvery frugal when we use emergency designations because we shouldn't be \ndoing that.\n  When we say it is an emergency, we are saying that basically the \nbudget doesn't fly, we don't need a budget, and we are going to have \nemergencies. But we have a higher threshold of 60 votes for emergency \nspending. This is thrown in the same category of emergencies, FEMA and \nfirefighting. I don't think that is correct. I don't think that is \nright.\n  The best way to solve it would be to adopt Senator Sessions' \namendment. I urge our colleagues to do so when we vote on his \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I now move to table the motion to \nstrike filed by the Senator from Alabama. I ask unanimous consent that \nmy motion be temporarily set aside and that the Senate resume \nconsideration of my motion on Friday at a time to be determined by the \nmajority leader after consultation with the Democratic leader.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that there then be 15 minutes for \ndebate equally divided in the usual form with not less than 3 minutes \nof that time being available to the Senator from Maryland and that \nthere be no other amendments in order.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I know of no future amendments, unless \nthere is one that has come from the other side. I inquire if there are \nany other amendments to be filed this evening.\n  The inquiry is, Why can't we finish tonight? We can't finish tonight \nbecause we have a large number of Senators involved in the Judiciary \nCommittee consideration of the asbestos problem. We have been asked not \nto have the votes. But we have agreed to have them tomorrow morning as \nearly as possible. That would be determined by the leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have been dealing with military \nconstruction. Are we about finished with this bill?\n  Mr. STEVENS. We are at the place where I am inquiring whether there \nare any further amendments to be offered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1201, As Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. \n1201 offered by Senator Feinstein be modified. When the chairman and I \ncorrected it, we put the number only in one place and we need to put it \nin two places.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I saw that myself. I was about ready to do that.\n\n[[Page S9224]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that it be modified with the \nlanguage that is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1201), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. ____. (a) Additional Amount for Cooperative Forestry \n     Assistance.--The amount appropriated by title III of this Act \n     under the heading ``Department of the Interior, Bureau of \n     Land Management, Wildland Fire Management'' is hereby \n     increased by $25,000,000.\n       (b) Availability of Amount.--Of the amount appropriated by \n     title III of this Act under the heading ``Department of the \n     Interior, Bureau of Land Management, Wildland Fire \n     Management'', as increased by subsection (a), $25,000,000 \n     shall be available for emergency actions to reduce the threat \n     to human safety in areas declared under a State of Emergency \n     by the Governor of any State due to the danger of \n     catastrophic fire from dead and dying trees including--\n       (1) clearing of evacuation routes;\n       (2) clearing around emergency shelter locations;\n       (3) clearing around emergency communication sites; and\n       (4) clearing buffer zones around highly populous \n     communities in order to prevent fire sweeping though such \n     communities.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have an amendment also for the Senators \nfrom Utah, Idaho, and Nevada dealing with the problem that I talked to \nthe Senator from Alaska about. Crickets have eaten up parts of their \nStates.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, it is my understanding that the \namendment is offset completely and it would be appropriate to consider \nit at the present time.\n  Mr. REID. That is true.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1210\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1210.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for the use of funds of the Commodity Credit \n   Corporation for the suppression and control of the Mormon cricket \n   infestation on public and private land in Nevada, Utah, and Idaho)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. MORMON CRICKET CONTROL.\n\n       The Secretary of Agriculture shall use $20,000,000 of the \n     funds of the Commodity Credit Corporation, to remain \n     available until expended, for the suppression and control of \n     the Mormon cricket infestation on public and private land in \n     Nevada, Utah, and Idaho, that amount to be expended in equal \n     amounts among the 3 States.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, it is my understanding that this \namendment is offset by transferring money from the Commodity Credit \nCorporation.\n  Mr. REID. That is true.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have no objection.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Mormon crickets eat nearly anything in \ntheir path. They can grow to 3 inches long and travel a mile a day as \nthey eat sagebrush, lawns and crops.\n  Over the course of the last several years, Mormon cricket \ninfestations have doubled each year in Nevada, and have seen similar \nrapid growth in Utah and Idaho.\n  More than 2 million acres of northern Nevada were crawling with these \npests last year, the worst infestation in the State for 40 years.\n  It was an even larger infestation than the 1990-91 infestation that \nbriefly shut down I-80 as the crickets made the road greasy and caused \ncar accidents.\n  This year, the crickets are hatching three weeks earlier than normal \nand could more than double from last year's record-setting infestation \nin Nevada.\n  While some Federal funding to try to control Mormon crickets has been \nmade available, it falls far short of what is needed.\n  While State officials understandably spend funds to try to control \nexisting outbreaks, little funding is available to take preventive \nmeasures necessary to end this plague of the Great Basin.\n  My amendment would provide $20 million to be equally divided among \nNevada, Utah and Idaho to get this plague under control and eradicated.\n  The funds would be provided from the Commodity Credit Corporation and \nwould remain available until spent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I take this opportunity to inform the \nmembers of this distinguished body about S. 1383, the Legislative \nBranch Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2004, as reported by the \nSenate Committee on Appropriations.\n  The pending bill provides $3.7 billion in new budget authority and \n$3.1 billion in new outlays for fiscal year 2004 to fund the operations \nof the Senate and House of Representatives; the Architect of the \nCapitol; the U.S. Capitol Police; and the Library of Congress. With \noutlays from prior years and other completed actions, the Senate bill \ntotals $3.7 billion in budget authority and $3.7 billion in outlays.\n  For discretionary spending, which represents the bulk of the funding \nin this bill, the Senate bill is $37 million below the subcommittee's \n302(b) allocation for budget authority, and it is $43 million in \noutlays below the 302(b) allocation. The Senate bill is $227 million in \nBA and $0.9 billion in outlays below the President's budget request.\n  In addition to providing appropriations for fiscal year 2004 for the \nlegislative branch, the committee-reported bill contains various \nsupplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2003. The fiscal year 2004 \nconcurrent resolution on the budget, H. Con. Res. 95, established \nlevels for fiscal year 2003 and provided an allocation (pursuant to \nsection 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974) to the \nCommittee on Appropriations for fiscal year 2003 in the joint \nexplanatory statement accompanying the resolution, see page 103 of H. \nRpt. 108-71.\n  The committee has designated all the appropriations for fiscal year \n2003 as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 502 of H. Con. \nRes. 95. As a result, these emergency appropriations do not count \nagainst the committee's allocation.\n  As a point of information, I would like to call my colleagues' \nattention to section 302(c) of the Congressional Budget Act. Section \n302(c) provides that it is not in order to consider a bill making \nappropriations for a fiscal year until the Committee on Appropriations \nhas made the sub allocations required by section 302. It appears that \nthe Committee on Appropriations has yet to file 302(b) allocations for \n2003. This point of order may be waived, or a ruling of the Chair \nappealed, with 60 votes.\n  The fiscal year 2003 supplemental funding in this bill includes \n$1.889 billion requested by the President as an emergency requirement, \nand an additional $100 million added by the Senate appropriations \ncommittee. I am concerned that very little of the President's request \nor the additional $100 million is worthy of the emergency designation \nprovided for in section 502 of the H. Con. Res. 95, the fiscal year \n2004 budget resolution. The criteria for designation as an emergency \nare that the funding is 1. necessary, essential, or vital (not merely \nuseful or beneficial); 2. sudden, quickly coming into being, and not \nbuilding up over time; 3. an urgent, pressing, and compelling need \nrequiring immediate action; 4. unforeseen, unpredictable, and \nunanticipated; and 5. not permanent, temporary in nature.\n  While some of this funding may be necessary, it is not ``sudden'' or \n``urgent.'' The President requested and Congress approved a $78.5 \nbillion fiscal year 2003 supplemental just 3 months ago, and there is \nno reason why these requests could not have been considered at that \ntime. Further, the Congressional Budget Office reports that only $37 \nmillion of the $2.0 billion in emergency budget authority in this bill \nwill actually be spent in the 3 months remaining in this fiscal year. \nAll of this $37 million is attributable to the budget authority \nprovided for wildfire suppression and the space shuttle. Thus, the \nbalance of this funding could instead be addressed in the regular \nfiscal year 2004 spending bills.\n  Therefore, I strongly urge the President and the conferees on this \nlegislation to consider carefully if all of this emergency supplemental \nfunding should be retained in the final version of this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two tables displaying the Budget \nCommittee\n\n[[Page S9225]]\n\nscoring of the bill be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                CURRENT STATUS OF FY 2003 APPROPRIATIONS\n               [Fiscal year 2003, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                           General\n                                           purpose  Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEnacted to date:\n    Budget authority....................   844,986    391,344  1,236,330\n    Outlays.............................   846,706    378,717  1,225,423\nEmergencies in the Senate-reported\n Legislative Branch Bill: \\1\\\n    Budget authority....................     1,989  .........      1,989\n    Outlays.............................        37  .........         37\nTotal that counts against 302(a)\n allocation to Appropriations Committee:\n    Budget authority....................   844,986    391,344  1,236,330\n    Outlays.............................   846,706    378,717  1,225,423\n302(a) allocation to Appropriations\n Committee: \\2\\\n    Budget authority....................   844,986    391,344  1,236,330\n    Outlays.............................   846,706    378,717  1,225,423\nDifference between total and 302(a)\n allocation:\n    Budget authority....................  ........  .........  .........\n    Outlays.............................  ........  .........  .........\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Section 502(c)(2) of H.

Madam President, Senators Byrd, Stabenow, and I would like \nto engage in a colloquy with Senator Reid, the ranking member of the \nEnergy and Water Development Subcommittee and Ted Stevens, Chairman of \nthe Full Committee.\n  Mr. BYRD. In West Virginia, torrential flooding is becoming an annual \nevent--since 1993, the State has had 11 federally declared disasters. \nIn this year alone, the State has had two federally declared disasters. \nIn the latest round of devastating flooding in the State last month, 12 \ncounties were declared Federal disaster areas. Homes were damaged or \ndestroyed, and the severe impact on the infrastructure in the southern \npart of the State--from roads, bridges, water and sewer, to power \nsources--has brought a normal way of life to a screeching halt once \nagain.\n  Ms. STABENOW. In May of this year, unusually heavy rainfall occurred \nin four countries of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan causing rivers and \nstreams throughout the area to swell out of their banks, inflicting \nsevere and widespread damages. The greatest damages occurred in \nMarquette County where an earthen dike at Silver Lake Basin failed, \nsending and estimated 8 billion gallons of water cascading downstream \nthrough the city of Marquette toward Lake Superior.\n  The floodwaters destroyed or damaged numerous public and private \nstructures and caused unprecedented environmental and ecological damage \nwithin the Dead River Basin and into Lake Superior in Marquette County. \nTwo power generation facilities were damaged. One of the power \ngeneration facilities, the Presque Isle plant in the city of Marquette, \nresulted in shutdown for more than 30 days.\n  Without power, two iron ore mines, which produce about 20 percent of \nour Nation's annual iron ore output, were shut down, idling 1,200 \nworkers. Dozens of other area businesses, institutions and private \nhomeowners were also seriously impacted. Three of the four counties \naffected are impoverished, with a majority of the population over 65 \nyears of age. Local governments simply do not have the capital to pay \nfor the public damages. Without an infusion of Federal aid, Marquette \nand the other three counties will have a difficult, if not impossible, \ntask of recovering from this disaster.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Normally, our States would be able to rely on the \noperations and maintenance account for the corps to help repair damages \nto public facilities, such as obstructive deposits in flood control \nstreams, bank erosion threatening public facilities, damages to other \npublic infrastructure such as water and sewer facilities. Additionally, \nfunds provided will allow the Army Corps to repair weather-related \ndamages that have occurred to Federal infrastructure. However, it is \nour understanding that the fund has been depleted for this year.\n  Mr. REID. Unfortunately, your understanding is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. It is our hope that you and Senator Domenici, when drafting \nthe Fiscal Year 04 Energy Water Development Act will be able to address \nthese emergencies in these two States, as well as others that have \nexperienced massive flooding in this exceptionally wet spring.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Domenici and I will be marking up the Energy and \nWater Development Act for Fiscal Year 04 next week in both subcommittee \nand full committee. We recognize the needs of both States for flood \nmitigation, including stream and river restoration, bank stabilization, \ninfrastructure repair and restoration, water and sewer repairs, and \nfresh drinking water in some areas. We will do everything we can to \naddress these needs in the Fiscal Year 04 bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I, too, will do everything I can to support this \ncritical work as we draft the Fiscal Year 04 Energy and Water \nDevelopment Act.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I am very pleased to join with my \nranking member of the Military Construction Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senator Feinstein of California, in bringing forward for \nthe Senate's consideration the fiscal year 2004 military construction \nappropriations bill. This is a bipartisan bill which received the \nunanimous approval of the Committee on Appropriations.\n  I want to take a moment to say Senator Feinstein is in the Judiciary \nmarkup. She is the best ranking member a chairman could ever have. We \nhave a great relationship. We work together well. We see things the \nsame way. And our priorities are the same. So this is very much our \nbill together, and it would not have been nearly as easy without her \nwonderful cooperation.\n  This is a bill that does focus on quality of life for our troops \nbecause both Senator Feinstein and I believe it is very important at a \ntime like this, when we are asking so much from our troops, that we do \nright by them. This bill provides $9.196 billion for military \nconstruction, military family housing, and base realignment and closure \ncosts.\n  This bill is $79 million above the President's budget request, but \n$1.5 billion below the amount appropriated last year. The budget \nconstraints under which we all are laboring this year did force us to \nmake difficult choices about our spending priorities, but I believe we \nhave crafted a bill that attends both to the President's most pressing \nrequirements and the concerns of Senators.\n  The bill provides $4.6 billion for military construction, $3.95 \nbillion for military family housing, and $370 million for base \nrealignment and closure.\n  Our military forces have been severely strained by the extraordinary \nburdens they have been asked to shoulder in the last several years. \nThey have undertaken nearly 2 years of continuous combat operations in \nharsh conditions, endured long deployments and reserve activations. \nThey have had to deal with severe disruptions to family life resulting \nfrom lengthy separations.\n  We have asked much of our service personnel and their families; and, \nfor that reason, we have paid special attention in this bill to \nmilitary construction projects that promote our troops' quality of \nlife.\n  For example, the bill provides $1.1 billion for 40 new, modern \nbarracks projects; $166 million for the design and construction of new \nhospital and medical facilities; and $16 million for child development \ncenters to serve our military families.\n\n  The intense demands of the past few years have extended well beyond \nour Active-Duty forces, and no component has borne a heavier burden in \nthat time than our Guard and Reserve Forces who have met the call to \nduty with a high degree of professionalism.\n  Unfortunately, military construction for the Guard and Reserve \ncontinues to be severely underfunded. The administration's fiscal year \nbudget request for Reserve components was $370 million, a little more \nthan half of what was appropriated last year. This is just inadequate \nfor the task we are asking these components to perform. As a result, \nthis bill increases funding for the Guard and Reserve by 87 percent to \n$691 million.\n  This bill differs from the administration's request in only one \nsignificant way, and that is in the area of military construction \noverseas. The budget request included over $1 billion for military \nconstruction at U.S. installations outside the United States, much of \nit destined for facilities constructed for the cold war. For several \nyears, Congress has expressed its concern that our overseas basing \nstructure has not been updated to reflect the realities of the post-\ncold-war world. Our Nation is dealing with new threats, new strategies, \nnew force structure, new deployment concepts, and new geopolitical \nrealities. Yet a basing structure designed for the cold war endures.\n  We have questioned the wisdom of continuing to expend taxpayer \ndollars on overseas facilities that may not be appropriate to the \nNation's future military needs. The Defense Department continues to \nstudy this issue and has under way an overseas basing and presence \nstudy that will lead to, among\n\n[[Page S9228]]\n\nother things, recommendations for a major overhaul of the U.S. overseas \nbasing structure. That study is not yet complete. But in testimony \nbefore the Military Construction Subcommittee in April, two of the \ncombatant commanders, General James Jones, Supreme Allied Commander \nEurope, commander of U.S. European Command, and General Leon LaPorte, \ncommander of U.S. Forces Korea, presented their visions for military \nbasing in their respective areas of responsibility. General Jones \ndescribed a concept for Europe that features fewer large bases, several \nsmaller, more austere bases in forward locations, and greater use of \nrotational forces in and out of these facilities rather than permanent \nstationing of large forces with the attendant support infrastructure.\n  General LaPorte described a vision for Korea in which U.S. forces are \nconsolidated at a greatly reduced number of facilities located further \nsouth on the Korean peninsula than at present.\n  We have been impressed by the combatant commanders' boldness and \ncreativity in reassessing basing needs, and we believe their respective \nvisions hold great promise for a more efficient and effective basing \nstructure that will enhance the ability of the United States to meet \nnew threats.\n  When fully developed, this vision will provide a sound basis on which \nCongress and the administration will be able to determine the future of \nour overseas basing structure. However, at this point the vision has \nnot yet been developed into a comprehensive plan on which decisions to \npursue new construction initiatives can prudently be based.\n  The overseas basing and presence study involves far more \nthan military facilities. According to public statements of Defense \nDepartment officials, it will result in a dramatic change in the \ndisposition of U.S. forces abroad, including where they are based, how \nthey operate, how they move to and from their theaters of operation, \nand even the number of forces deployed in specific theaters.\n\n  In various press accounts, administration officials have acknowledged \nconsidering new bases in Australia; Navy ships ported in Vietnam; \nincreased U.S. presence in Malaysia and Singapore; bases in Algeria, \nMorocco, and Tunisia, as well as Senegal, Ghana, Mali, and Kenya; bases \non territory of the former Soviet Union; a rotational model for \ndeploying forces overseas; significant reductions to force levels in \nGermany; a major relocation and possible reformation of forces in the \nRepublic of Korea. Summarizing the extent of the changes under \nconsideration, the Under Secretary of Defense for policy, Douglas \nFeith, stated:\n\n       Everything is going to move everywhere.\n\n  If the sweeping changes under consideration are to be implemented, \nthey will require extensive diplomatic efforts both in the nations in \nwhich the United States seeks a new presence and in those where it will \nreduce or reshape its presence. Because a comprehensive plan is not yet \ndeveloped, we are unwilling to recommend undertaking extensive new \nmilitary construction projects that would begin the implementation of a \nplan without a thorough and deliberate review by Congress. We have been \nparticularly concerned about proposed projects in Europe and Korea.\n  For example, the budget request includes a number of projects in \nareas in Germany that, according to public statements of the Army and \nother Department of Defense officials, are likely to see significant \nforce level reductions.\n  In a June 23 letter updating the status of planning Europe, General \nJones said:\n\n       We have made considerable progress in determining the \n     installations required to support theater goals and the force \n     structure needed to implement our strategy. It is an arduous \n     process but a necessary one. While I realize fully the \n     importance of our progress on these matters, the timeliness, \n     and the effect these decisions will ultimately have on our \n     fiscal year 2004 military construction projects, I must tell \n     you candidly that we have not reached the end point of this \n     process. The changes we are proposing represent the most \n     significant undertaking to realign forces and basis in \n     theater in the past 50 years. The decisions made in the \n     coming weeks will have broad and far-reaching implications; \n     therefore, it is imperative that we get it right.\n\n  General Jones is absolutely right. I appreciate his candor. His \nstatements underscore our concern that we are not yet ready to begin \nimplementing the restructuring of our overseas bases in Europe. We have \nsimilar concerns about proceeding too fast in Korea.\n  In the budget amendment received May 1, the administration proposed \nmoving some $213 million in military construction projects to a single \nbase, Camp Humphreys. However, nearly half of that construction is to \noccur on land that the United States does not yet control. Although the \nKorean National Defense Minister has pledged to try to buy the land for \nour use, he is far from clear that this can occur for these projects to \nbe fully executed in fiscal year 2004. According to a July 7 article in \nthe Korea Times, there is fierce local opposition to the expansion of \nU.S. presence at Camp Humphreys.\n\n  The budget amendment also asked to move a $40 million barracks \nproject from an airfield to Camp Humphreys, but then that was reversed.\n  There are other examples, but I think this is making it clear that we \ndon't really have a fully thought out and reviewed plan from which we \ncan base the needs in Korea. Evaluated against a backdrop of \nuncertainty about fundamental aspects of a revised overseas basing \nstructure which the department has not yet proposed, the Defense \nDepartment's overseas basing and presence plan is not yet sufficiently \nmature to enable the Senate to commit to extensive new construction. \nThe failure to fund these projects at this time does not indicate \ndissatisfaction with the general direction in which the Department is \nheaded. We support the direction. But we do believe that Congress \nshould know the extent of the restructuring and the price tag before we \ndetermine our Nation's priorities. It would be premature to begin new \nconstruction at this time in these areas. We look forward to receiving \nand evaluating the Department's full recommendations once they become \navailable and taking the time to consider these changes.\n  Reflecting our continuing concern about this issue, our bill includes \na provision establishing an independent commission to thoroughly study \nthe structure of our overseas military facilities and advise Congress \non its conclusions. This commission, proposed by Senator Feinstein and \nmyself, would provide Congress with an independent view of the Nation's \noverseas basing requirements to help inform our decisions about the \nrestructuring of our facilities.\n  The report accompanying this bill also directs the Defense Department \nto submit several reports that will aid Congress in its oversight role, \nincluding a report on the feasibility of privatization and the use of \ncommercial building practices in barracks construction, a study of the \nimpact of privatized housing on local school districts, and a report on \nthe Department's activities related to perchlorate, a chemical used in \nsolid rocket propellant that has been found in drinking water supplies \nin 29 States. Senator Feinstein has more to say on perchlorate, but I \nwant to say, this is a concern of mine as well.\n  While a national standard for perchlorate levels has not yet been \nestablished, it is important that the Department of Defense be prepared \nto deal with this containment at defense installations once a standard \nis agreed upon.\n  All of the projects added to the bill have been carefully vetted by \nthe military services. All are top priority for installation \ncommanders, and all are included in the services' future years defense \nplan.\n  Madam President, the bill before the Senate is a bipartisan product \nthat was approved by the Appropriations Committee on a vote of 29 to 0. \nI am pleased to offer it for the Senate's consideration.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I am pleased to join my chairman, \nSenator Hutchison, in recommending the 2004 military construction bill \nto the Senate.\n  This has been a very challenging year. The President's budget request \nfor military construction was $1.5 billion below last year's enacted \nlevel, a nearly 15 percent reduction in a program that is chronically \nunderfunded. And this year, because of across-the-board constraints on \nappropriation allocations, we had little room to maneuver beyond the \nceiling imposed by the President's budget submission.\n\n[[Page S9229]]\n\n  The bill that we bring to the Senate provides $9.2 billion for \nmilitary construction and family housing programs for fiscal year 2004. \nWithin that allocation, we had to shoehorn funding for a large number \nof critical programs and projects that were not adequately funded in \nthe President's budget request.\n  In addition to tight budget constraints, we were faced with another \nchallenge this year in determining how to deal with overseas military \nconstruction programs at a time when the Defense Department is \nproposing what has been described as the most sweeping change in \nAmerica's military presence overseas since World War II.\n  The President's budget request included more than $1 billion for \noverseas military construction. Less than 3 months after the budget was \nsubmitted, the Defense Department unveiled preliminary plans for a \nmajor restructuring of forces in Europe and Korea, and sent Congress a \nbudget amendment to rescind or delete more than half a billion dollars \nin overseas military construction programs from fiscal year 2003 and \nthe Fiscal Year 2004 request.\n  It became clear to Senator Hutchison and me that the Department was \nfar from finalizing its global realignment plans, and indeed, we \ncontinue to read almost daily about different proposals for moving U.S. \nforces here and there overseas. For this reason, we are recommending a \npause in funding a number of proposed construction projects in Europe \nand Korea until the Defense Department completes its overseas basing \nreview and presents a comprehensive plan to Congress. The overseas \nbasing commission that Senator Hutchison and I are proposing in this \nbill will provide another important layer of oversight to this process.\n  In Europe, central questions include how many troops will remain \npermanently stationed there, what basing structure will be needed to \nsupport them, and where and what type of forward operating bases and \nforward operating locations will be needed to support rotational and \ntransitory forces.\n  In Korea, the issue of where the forces will be realigned has \napparently been settled--the U.S. is planning to withdraw troops from \nSeoul and the Demilitarized Zone and move them to south central South \nKorea. However, the details of that realignment have yet to be \npresented to Congress, nor has the Korean government provided the land \nneeded for the realignment.\n  I am aware that the administration would prefer to bank all of the \nproposed funding for the realignment of forces in Korea to keep \npressure on the South Korean government to transfer the required land \nto the U.S. military. However, I believe that withholding this funding \nuntil the U.S. has actually secured the land is an equally effective \nincentive for the Korean government if, in fact, it is serious about \nwanting United States military forces to move out of Seoul.\n  Moreover, in a year when the administration has slashed the military \nconstruction budget by nearly 15 percent, it is unrealistic for the \nDefense Department to turn around and ask Congress to wager hundreds of \nmillions of dollars that are urgently needed elsewhere on the Korean \nGovernment's uncertain timetable.\n  We have given this matter a great deal of consideration, and I \ncommend Senator Hutchison for laying out the position of the \nsubcommittee so clearly and completely in the report accompanying our \nbill. This explanation should leave no doubt in anyone's mind that the \nMilitary Construction Subcommittee understands the importance of \nmaintaining strong military ties to our allies overseas and supports \nthe Defense Department's efforts to ensure that our overseas basing \nstructure reflects the international realities of the post-cold-war \nenvironment. We look forward to helping implement the construction \nelements of the new overseas basing structure once the Defense \nDepartment completes its review.\n  There is another item in the Military Construction bill that is \nextremely important to me, and that is the environmental clean up of \nmilitary installations. The fiscal year 2004 bill includes just $370 \nmillion for Base Realignment and Closure, BRAC, environmental cleanup. \nThis is a significant drop from last year's funding, and it is a level \nof funding that I accept only reluctantly, and only because the Defense \nDepartment is embarking on a new and ambitious program to raise revenue \nfor environmental cleanup at BRAC sites through land sales. The Navy's \nBRAC budget, for example, includes $68 million above the appropriated \namount in anticipated revenue from land sales, and the Navy anticipates \nthat additional land sales revenue could significantly increase the \namount of money available in fiscal year 2004 for environmental \ncleanup.\n  I believe that the Defense Department has the responsibility to \ncomplete, to the maximum extent possible, the cleanup of military \ninstallations closed or realigned through previous BRAC rounds before \nembarking on a new BRAC round in 2005. I am hopeful that self-financing \nthrough land sales will be sufficient to supplement appropriated \namounts, but I intend to keep a close watch on this program to ensure \nthat we do not sacrifice momentum by relying too heavily on land sale \nrevenue.\n\n  Madam President, I also want to comment on an issue that I have been \nfighting since this last winter. It is the problem of perchlorate \ncontamination in our country's drinking water. This topic is relevant \nto the Department of Defense and Military Construction Appropriations \nas Defense, along with the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration, uses 90 percent of the perchlorate produced in the \nUnited States.\n  Perchlorate, a chemical used in solid rocket propellant, explosives \nand munitions has been identified by the Environmental Protection \nAgency (EPA) as an unregulated toxin. No national standard exists for \nperchlorate. Perchlorate contamination has been found in drinking water \nsupplies in 29 States, including Arizona, California, Texas, Colorado, \nMaryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, and New Mexico. More than 300 \ngroundwater wells in California alone are contaminated with \nperchlorate, as is the Colorado River, which supplies drinking water to \nmore than 15 million people in the Southwest.\n  I am alarmed about the potential impact of perchlorate contamination \nat installations that have been closed through the BRAC process as well \nas at active and inactive Defense sites or where perchlorate has \nmigrated off of current and former Defense or contractor properties to \nthreaten public water supplies.\n  I am also very disappointed that the Department of Defense has been \nunresponsive to requests to take a positive leadership role in \naddressing the concerns of the public and the immediate needs of water \nagencies large and small as perchlorate is detected in more and more \nlocations. It is also distressing that the Department is resisting the \nobvious need to test for the presence of perchlorate at BRAC properties \nor other Defense sites.\n  The Department of Defense has a moral obligation to the public to \naddress the problem now as the water agencies that have to close wells, \nor treat their water supplies, are faced with a real problem today. \nThis problem is a result of the activities of the Department or its \ncontractors.\n  The language I worked to include in the Military Construction \nSubcommittee report moves the Department of Defense toward addressing \nthe perchlorate problem. This language directs the Department to submit \nto the Congressional Defense Appropriation Committees the following:\n\n  A report on the activities of the Interagency Perchlorate Steering \nCommittee and the activities of the Department on perchlorate as \ndescribed in the Memo of January 24, 2001 from the Under Secretary of \nDefense for Environmental Security to the Secretaries of the military \ndepartments and the Defense Logistics Agency.\n  Identification of sources of perchlorate contamination at BRAC \nproperties and to develop a plan to remediate perchlorate contamination \non BRAC sites that can be implemented rapidly once state or Federal \nperchlorate standards are set.\n  Finally, I want to address an issue covered in the report where I \nbelieve the report language was not wholly accurate, and which I intend \nto attempt to clarify in conference.\n  The existing language says, ``The Committee recognizes that, absent a \nstate or Federal standard for perchlorate, the Department of Defense is\n\n[[Page S9230]]\n\nunder no obligation to remediate perchlorate contamination at defense \nsites.''\n  It is more accurate to say that absent a State or Federal standard \nfor perchlorate, there is uncertainty as to the level of perchlorate \ncleanup that would be required at each site, but there still is a legal \nobligation to remediate perchlorate contamination under Federal and \nState statutes including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and California's Carpenter-\nPresley-Tanner Hazardous Substance Account Act. Remediation would then \nproceed on the basis of a site-specific risk assessment or other \ncriteria such as an Applicable, Relevant and Appropriate Requirement.\n  Madam President, as I stated earlier, this has been a challenging \nyear. Senator Hutchison and I were faced with a difficult set of \ncircumstances and a series of hard choices. We were able to develop a \nmilitary construction program that comes within the constraints of the \nbudget resolution, but I hope that the administration understands the \nimportance of infrastructure as a key element of readiness and quality \nof life, and will present Congress with a more realistic budget request \nnext year.\n  I thank the members of my Appropriations Committee staff, Christina \nEvans, and B.G. Wright, and to Chris Thompson of my personal staff for \ntheir hard work on this bill. Also, I wish to express my appreciation \nto Dennis Ward, of Senator Hutchison's staff for his cooperative and \nbipartisan effort throughout this process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. As I said earlier today, the work Senator Durbin has done \non the legislative appropriations bill is, of course, exemplary, as was \nSenator Feinstein's, the ranking member of the subcommittee.\n  As the Senator from Texas knows, last year I made a statement on the \nfloor about the great work these two fine Senators had done on the \nmilitary construction appropriations bill. My feelings have not \nchanged. I think they have done an excellent job.\n  I had the honor of also chairing the subcommittee in years past. It \nis an extremely interesting subcommittee. It does so many important \nthings for the men and women representing this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise briefly to make a few remarks \nabout the military construction appropriations bill, and, \nuncharacteristically, I commend the Appropriations Committee--\nespecially Chairman Stevens and Chairperson Hutchison, as well as the \nother members of the committee--for reporting out a bill with the \nlowest number of earmarks I have seen in a long time.\n  The military construction appropriations bill for fiscal year 2004 \nhas $80 million of unrequested and unauthorized military construction \nprojects. Obviously, that is a lot of money. But I point out, to the \ngreat credit of the sponsors of this legislation on both sides of the \naisle, it is far less than what was added last year, which was $900 \nbillion.\n  What is egregious and objectionable in this year's military \nconstruction appropriations bill that I have not seen to this degree in \nprevious years is the extent to which the appropriators earmarked \nprojects in the unspecified minor construction accounts--totaling $80 \nmillion. The authorization committee, once again, was circumvented and \nthe President's budget was not requested. But the fact is that this is \na much smaller number than before.\n  In an effort to contain the wasteful spending inherent in member-\nrequested construction projects, I sponsored, and the Senate adopted, \nmerit-based criteria for evaluating member adds as a part of the fiscal \nyear 1995 Defense Authorization Act. The criteria are:\n  One, the project is in service's future years defense plan.\n  Two, the project is mission essential.\n  Three, the project can be put under contract in the current fiscal \nyear.\n  Four, the project doesn't conflict with base realignment proposals.\n  Five, the service can offset the proposed expenditure within that \nyear's budget request.\n  These criteria have been useful in our efforts to determine programs \nof merit or nonmerit.\n  Regarding the reduction in the amount of member adds in this \nlegislation, there are, of course, a couple we have found that I found \nat least somewhat entertaining. While some of our soldiers and sailors \nhave been on food stamps, we have found a way to provide $1.4 million \nto replace a working dog kennel. It is good to see that Fido has not \nbeen left out of this year's military construction appropriations.\n  Having said that, I am grateful to my friends on both sides of the \naisle, including the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the \nchairperson of the Military Construction Subcommittee, for their \narduous work on the bill and their continued unequaled support for our \nmen and women in the military. Their attention and commitment to \nsupporting only necessary projects that are high priorities of the \nservices is exemplary this year, in my view.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of the \nprojects that were add-ons--not leaving out the replacement of the \nworking dog kennel.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as

The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I thank the kinder and gentler \nSenator from Arizona. I am very pleased that he looked at our bill and \nfound that we did meet the criteria because that is exactly what we \nintended to do.\n  The kennel is for dogs at an Air Force base. The dogs are security \ndogs, and they do need a place to stay.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Might I ask where that is located?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. At Elmendorf Air Force Base. I think the Senator \nknows that is in Alaska. Dogs in Alaska need a place to stay, too. \nMaybe it is cold up there and they need shelter. I think it is \ncertainly legitimate.\n  With that, we did work hard to make the priorities that we thought \nwere right for our military personnel. No one deserves better treatment \nright now than the military personnel of our country. I thank the \nSenator from Arizona for his continuing interest in assuring that our \nmilitary personnel have a quality of life. That has been his hallmark \nhere.\n  I thank, once again, the chairman of the committee, Senator Stevens, \nand Senator Inouye, the ranking member, Senator Byrd, Senator \nFeinstein, my ranking member, and our respective staffs. I am very \nproud of the work we did on the bill, and I do hope our military \npersonnel do see better health care facilities, better barracks, better \nliving quarters, and from this legislation I think they will.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I wonder if the Senator from Arizona has \nlooked over the managers' package on this bill including 15 different \nitems.\n  I am only kidding.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, to clarify the record, and before \nthe Senator from Arizona turns into the ``Incredible Hulk,'' there was \nno managers' amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, when the Senators brought this bill to \nthe full committee--Senators Hutchison and Feinstein--I was totally \nastounded at the consensus on this bill. This is a fairly difficult \nbill and there are difficult decisions in which the House may not \nconcur. But the two Senators managing the bill proposed decisions for \nthe Senate to which not one Senator has objected. I think that is \nreally a milestone in dealing with this bill.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Texas and the Senator from California \nnot only for their work product but for their work ethic, working \ntogether as a bipartisan team on a very difficult subject. I hope we \ncan bring the bill back from the conference as it stands. I am not sure \nwe can, but it certainly is an extremely good work product dealing with \na whole myriad of subjects that affect our bases at home and abroad, \nand I congratulate the Senators for a marvelous job.\n  Madam President, we are close to wrap-up. I ask unanimous consent we \ntemporarily set aside the pending business, and Senator Dayton be \nallowed to make a statement about Iraq for 15 minutes while we prepare \nthe wrap-up for this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, before we move off this bill, I so \nappreciate the chairman's remarks. We could not have done it without \nour excellent staff work. On the majority staff, Dennis Ward has done \nan incredible job of research. He is the most thorough person we could \nhave on the committee. I appreciate him very much.\n  Also, Christina Evans and B.G. Wright on Senator Feinstein's staff, \nwithout their working relationship being so good, we could not have \ndone so well. I wanted to add that to the record before we moved away \nfrom the bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, for the information of the Senate, I am \ninformed we will open the Senate tomorrow at 9:15 a.m. We will have 15 \nminutes of debate and then proceed to the three votes that will be \nstacked at that time.\n  I renew my request to permit the Senator to speak as in morning \nbusiness for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/10/senate-section/article/S9231-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9231-S9234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, I thank the senior Senator from Alaska \nfor making possible my opportunity to speak tonight on a trip to Iraq I \ntook last week with several of our colleagues as members of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee and Senate Intelligence Committee, led by the \nchairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, John Warner, who is an \nextraordinary leader of the committee. I do not know if his age is \nclassified or not, but at his age, the kind of\n\n[[Page S9232]]\n\nenergy, the kind of determination, the kind of enthusiasm and \nleadership he showed was just extraordinary. It was a privilege to be \non this adventure with him and Carl Levin, our ranking member, who \ncelebrated a birthday as we were traveling over there. The two of them \nset a sterling example for the rest of us to follow.\n  Then we met with the real superstars who are in Iraq: the men and \nwomen of our Armed Forces. I cannot say enough about the respect and \nadmiration I have for those mostly young men and women from all over \nthis country. They have performed superbly well. They have redefined \nthe words ``patriotism'' and ``courage'' for this Senator. I am truly \nin awe of their skill and their performance under the greatest of \ndanger, and their resolve, which continues to this day.\n  They are proud of what they have accomplished, as they should be. \nThey achieved a tremendous military victory in 3 weeks' time, and now \nthey are doing their utmost to preserve that victory while these other \nfactors get resolved, and that is what I wish to address my remarks to \nthis evening.\n  Stalwart as they are, those men and women pretty much asked all of us \none question: ``When are we coming home?'' I did not have the answer. \nThe military command with whom we met in Iraq did not have the answer. \nThe Secretary of Defense yesterday did not have that answer. And that \nuncertainty, as well as the demands that are placed upon them--the \nrisks, the dangers, and the pressures in this god-awful environment \nwith temperatures 115 degrees in the afternoon, sweltering heat, and \nsoldiers dressed in flack jackets, heavy helmets, patrolling, doing \nwhat they must do, knowing they are now increasingly targets of Iraqi \nresistance. It is a gruesome situation they are enduring on behalf of \nour country and on behalf of the commitments they have undertaken. As I \nsay, they are performing them incredibly well.\n\n  When we met in Baghdad with U.S. Ambassador Bremer and with the \ncommanding general of the U.S. forces, General Sanchez, we asked what \nthey thought was the course that had to be followed, and they both said \nindependently the same thing: The United States had to stay the course \nin Iraq and keep its presence there until success was achieved.\n  We asked, What constitutes success? They each said three things. \nFirst, that Saddam Hussein and his sons must be found and removed \npermanently from Iraq.\n  Second, that law and order must be restored to that country.\n  And third, that a successor government, an Iraqi government, \nhopefully a democratically reelected Iraqi government, will be able to \nreplace the U.S. civilian command and begin to run that country \nsuccessfully.\n  The first objective, the elimination of Saddam Hussein and his two \nsons, should have been accomplished already. It must be accomplished \nvery soon, and I believe it will be accomplished very soon. It is \nimpossible to overstate the terror he strikes in the souls of the \npeople of Iraq. People literally quiver when his name is even \nmentioned. They refuse to say anything about him. They do not even want \nto mention his name or respond to questions about him.\n  The new local leaders we met with in Kirkuk talked softly, and when \nhis name came up, they talked so softly they were barely audible. It is \nas if they wanted to recede into the woodwork and become invisible, \nrather than be subjected to this man's cruelty and tyranny.\n  We heard stories about unspeakable cruelty orchestrated by him or his \ntwo sons, such as the soccer games played in their Olympic stadium \nwhere the members of the losing team would be taken below and tortured \nand then executed for losing a soccer game. Or even if someone scored \nthe winning goal and it cost one of the son's his bet, that player \ncould be taken down below and tortured and executed. To think of living \none's life under those kinds of horrific circumstances at the whim of \nthis insane, cruel, and demonic man and his sons.\n  We visited a mass grave site where a couple thousand bodies have been \nexhumed, the ones not identified and taken away by their Iraqi brothers \nand sisters. There are thousands of those grave sites, we are told, all \nover the country.\n  There is reason to believe that when those three men are permanently \ngone, unmistakably gone, identified clearly by the Iraqi people as \nbodies that are never again to rule Iraq, that more and more of the \ncitizenry will come forward and will be willing to take that crucial \nfirst step toward allegiance with the United States but, more \nimportantly, allegiance with their own future, with their own \nautonomous Iraq that they can create and run themselves.\n  After that first goal has been achieved, the other two, bringing law \nand order to this country and installing a successor government that is \ngoing to be viable over the months that will follow, is going to be \neven more challenging. Right now, U.S. forces are seeking out and \ntraining, putting into place some 60,000 to 70,000 police officers all \nover Iraq.\n  This is a monumental undertaking of its own, to screen out the wrong \nelements, those who were involved before in the Baath Party or secret \npolice, and put them now in charge of law and order all over that \ncountry, law and order that is desperately needed because right now it \nis the U.S. troops who are required to patrol to reconstruct the peace, \nguarding public property which, we are told, if something has any value \nat all and is not being guarded, it will be quickly stolen, looted. \nWhile our troops are standing guard or patrolling, they are exposed \ntargets. Increasingly, they are the targets of murderers who are \nseeking vengeance and trying to drive out our forces.\n  In fact, the day after we left Baghdad, a Minnesota soldier was \nkilled, PFC Edward Herrgott from Shakopee, MN. He was 20 years old. He \nwas killed, murdered really, by a sniper as he stood guarding the \nBaghdad Museum. Some of that hostility is being orchestrated by forces, \nsome rumored to be by Saddam Hussein himself trying to retaliate \nagainst the United States military for the victories that were \nachieved, but some of it is also said to be caused by the lack of \nimprovements that have failed to be made in the basic services upon \nwhich Iraqi citizens depend.\n\n  There is an article in yesterday's New York Times and I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record at the completion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DAYTON. Let me read a couple of excerpts because this is really \nthe crux of where I think we have fallen behind in our effort and \nwhere, until we do make up that effort and start showing some visible \nsuccess, our troops are going to have an increasingly difficult time \nand increasingly become targets of hostility and reaction and where \nthey are going to be bound to that country longer than they would need \nto be.\n  It describes the city of Abu Ghraib which is just west of Baghdad. It \nsays:\n\n       The constituents' woes came down to the essentials. They \n     had no power, and thus no clean water. Their local elected \n     leader was besieged with all of these requests for basic \n     necessities of life.\n       Mr. Dari could do nothing for the man who, lacking \n     electricity, stayed up all night fanning a sick child, \n     nothing for the 5-year-old child who was left legless by \n     unexploded ordnance that detonated, a sight that caused him \n     to weep. He could do nothing for the multitudes complaining \n     of cars, weapons or relatives taken by American forces, other \n     than give their names to the Americans. He could do nothing \n     for those lacking drinking water or waiting for food rations.\n       ``What do you tell the people--have more patience?'' he \n     asked rhetorically. ``Till when?''\n\n  This local Iraqi leader went on to say:\n\n       ``Conditions have never been worse,'' he said bluntly. \n     ``We've never been through such a long bad period.''\n\n  The city has had only 1 to 3 hours of power a day in recent weeks. \nDrinking water cannot be pumped without electricity so people have to \ntake their water from dirty canals. As I said before, when we were \nthere, the temperatures in the afternoon were 115 degrees. I was told a \ncouple of days before we arrived it had reached 130 degrees. If there \nis no electricity for air conditioning and other cooling, there are \nserious problems.\n  Crime, rare under the old government, is rampant. The leader said \nthat\n\n[[Page S9233]]\n\nwhen he first met with the Americans he told them that they did not \nhave much time to meet the expectations of the citizenry, and that he \nbelieves time is almost up. Yet, as of the other day, neither he nor \nthe American colonel in charge of the troops there had ever had contact \nwith the American-led civilian administration ostensibly governing \nIraq, even though this man, Mr. Dari, oversees an area that is home to \n900,000 people.\n  It is an impossible situation for our service men and women to be \ntrying to uphold civil order in a foreign country with virtually no \ninterpreters available to communicate with citizens, when they are in \nthat state of frustration and agitation.\n  We met yesterday with the Secretary of Defense in the Armed Services \nCommittee, who pointed to progress that has been made in this respect. \nI am sure that there has been progress in certain areas, but there is \nnot enough progress being made in these nonmilitary efforts. They are \nnot occurring in enough places in the country to take hold among the \ncitizenry. And where they are occurring, at least from what we saw on \nour trip, it is the U.S. and British troops who are performing these \nnonmilitary services.\n  For example, in Kirkuk, which is north of Baghdad, U.S. forces \nconduct raids at night against what are believed to be enemy cells of \nresistance, and then by day they are hauling away thousands of tons of \naccumulated garbage, old garbage, and repairing rundown schools. The \nBritish troops with whom we met in Basra, in southern Iraq, are \nrebuilding a hospital. They are doing wonderful work, but that is not \nwhat they are there to do.\n  To ask them to be engaged in military activities, policing the \nstreets of these cities, doing repair work or hauling away old \naccumulated garbage in their spare time, which they have done, is just \nreally senseless. It is overburdening them. It is unfair to them, and \nit means that not enough of these nonmilitary projects, economic \nrehabilitation, social rehabilitation programs, are underway or visible \nanywhere in Iraq for the citizens of that country to see that they have \nhope for a better future.\n  They expect the United States of America, which they view as \nomnipotent because we came in and swept their military aside and \noccupied those cities and the country, to deliver services as basic as \nelectricity or running water, and when we cannot do so and when the \nconditions are markedly worse than they were under Saddam Hussein, we \nhave a very serious problem with the reception there. Our troops, our \nyoung men and women, are literally going to pay for these failures with \ntheir lives.\n  I was recently told about a story of a company in Ohio that makes \nhospital surgical beds. They were willing to send as many of these \nsurgical tables over to Iraq as could be used--such as for the 5-year-\nold legless boy who needed surgery--to save lives and be recognized as \nhaving come over from the United States of America to help dress the \nwounds, literally and figuratively, that exist there. The company is \nstill waiting to hear back from the Deputy Secretary of Defense's \noffice regarding that offer to donate and transport, at their expense, \nthese hospital facilities.\n  If the United States can bring in, as we have because we must, tent \ncities with electric generators, with sewage disposal systems, with \nportable toilets, why can't electric generators be brought in that will \nproduce some of the electricity that these cities need so that they can \nagain appreciate the benefits of what we have brought to them, not only \nthe liberation of spirit and soul and body, but also the ability to \nfunction as they must and move forward as they must?\n  I urge the administration that the same efforts be made, with the \nsame intensity of effort, the same--not quite the same funding but \nconsiderable effort be made--to bring about this renovation.\n  Ultimately, that reconstruction is going to take decades. It is the \nresponsibility of the Iraqi people to undertake it and to pay for it, \nbut in the short run, in the immediate sense, those projects are not \ngoing to occur unless the United States is the initiator, provides the \nleadership, and provides the initial financial resources. If we do not \nsee a plethora of those kinds of improvements overall, if we do not see \nchildren who are outside playing with soccer balls donated by American \nchildren who sent them over there, we do not establish that basic \nconnection, then we are going to be there far longer than we should be \nand longer than anybody over there now wants us to be. We are going to \nsuffer casualties far greater than we should.\n  So I implore the President and the administration to undertake this \neffort with the same magnitude of skill and American know-how that \nsucceeded so wonderfully militarily so we can bring our folks home.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 9, 2003]\n\n         For a Town Council in Iraq, Many Queries, Few Answers\n\n                            (By Amy Waldman)\n\n       Abu Ghraib, Iraq, July 5.--On a recent morning, the Abu \n     Ghraib town council was hearing the usual litany of \n     complaints, offering its usual mix of help and, mostly, \n     impotence in return. Overhead, a fan turned, but the air did \n     not.\n       The constituents' woes came down to the essentials. They \n     had no power, and thus no clean water--could they get \n     generators? They had no security--could they get weapons \n     permits?\n       If anyone could help them, it should have been the man at \n     the center of the scene, Dari Hamas al-Dari. In April, he was \n     selected by the local tribes to lead Iraq's first freely \n     formed town council after the fall of Saddam Hussein. Since \n     then, he has sat at a desk in a white robe and headdress, in \n     a room lined with men in tribal robes and Western dress all \n     looking to him for answers. He has not had many.\n       Mr. Dari could do nothing for the man who, lacking \n     electricity, stayed up all night fanning a sick child, \n     nothing for the 5-year-old child who was left legless by \n     unexploded ordnance that detonated, a sight that caused him \n     to weep. He could do nothing for the multitudes complaining \n     of cars, weapons or relatives taken by American forces, other \n     than give their names to the Americans. He could do nothing \n     for those lacking drinking water or waiting for food rations.\n       ``What do you tell the people--have more patience?'' he \n     asked rhetorically. ``Till when?''\n       If America has natural allies in Iraq, they are men like \n     Mr. Dari. He attended the American Jesuit school in Baghdad, \n     then university in Frankfurt. He has lived in Europe and \n     speaks excellent English. He maintained his independence \n     throughout Mr. Hussein's rule, shunning the material \n     blandishments with which Mr. Hussein bought the loyalty of \n     many tribal sheiks.\n       A part-time farmer and businessman, he is a member of the \n     sizable Zobaa tribe, which his brother leads. He welcomed the \n     Americans and has worked closely with their military \n     commanders in his area.\n       So the impatience creeping into his voice and the \n     frustration lining his handsome face bode poorly for the fate \n     of the American-led occupation here--even if American \n     officials succeed in drawing Iraqis into a new national \n     leadership. There is no indication that Mr. Dari, who is 64, \n     would turn on the Americans. He is simply losing faith in \n     them.\n       ``Conditions have never been worse,'' he said bluntly. \n     ``We've never been through such a long bad period.''\n       Abu Ghraib--a largely agricultural area just west of \n     Baghdad that is also home to Iraq's most notorious prison--\n     has had only one to three hours of power a day in recent \n     weeks. Drinking water cannot be pumped without electricity, \n     so people take water from dirty canals.\n       The food ration system that functioned smoothly under \n     Saddam Hussein is breaking down, out here at least. Trucks \n     leave Baghdad laden with food, but it mysteriously gets \n     offloaded at markets along the way.\n       Crime, rare under the old government, is rampant. Mr. \n     Dari's car was taken from him at gunpoint in Baghdad \n     recently. Four of his council members have been the victims \n     of carjacking attempts. And while the criminals are well-\n     armed, the Americans are disarming the victims, taking \n     weapons while the weapons licenses they insist on are in \n     short supply.\n       ``People here feel naked without their pistols,'' Mr. Dari \n     said, putting his own in a holster.\n       In a time of rising discontent, Mr. Dari is the buffer \n     between occupier and occupied. It is a role that, \n     historically, has earned little appreciation. Recent attacks \n     on Iraqis cooperating with the Americans suggest that this \n     chapter will be no different.\n       ``We are stuck between the Americans and our people,'' Mr. \n     Dari said of the council, which sits, for no salary, from 8 \n     a.m. to 2 p.m. daily. ``And there were so many promises from \n     one side.''\n       Some people are calling the council members ``America \n     lovers'' and traitors, he said, because they are working with \n     the Americans.\n       ``He's caught in the middle,'' one of his American \n     partners, Lt. Col. Jeff Ingram of the First Armored Division, \n     acknowledged. ``He defends us a lot.''\n       These days, Mr. Dari is warning the American more than he \n     is defending them. When he first met with them, he said, he \n     told them\n\n[[Page S9234]]\n\n     that they did not have much time to meet people's \n     expectations. That time is almost up, he believes.\n       ``I'm not threatening your with another Vietnam--God \n     forbid,'' he said. ``I'm just trying to get help for the \n     people before something happens.''\n       Something is already happening, of course. Out here, as \n     across much of Iraq, the attacks on Americans are stepping \n     up. Colonel Ingram said his company is being attacked at \n     least once a day, fortunately by men who are not very good \n     shots.\n       Colonel Ingram blames the Iraqis for most of the area's \n     problems, saying it is they who have torn down the power \n     lines he fixed, they who are robbing one another. ``The U.S. \n     is not the problem, it's the solution,'' he said.\n       But he too wonders about the slow pace of rebuilding. ``I \n     would have expected the U.S., the biggest country in the \n     world, to say here's the water purification system, here's \n     the big generator,'' he said.\n       As of the other day, neither Mr. Dari nor Colonel Ingram \n     had ever had any contact with the American-led civilian \n     administration ostensibly governing Iraq, although Mr. Dari \n     oversees an area that is home to 900,000 people.\n       So they soldier on alone, often seeking progress in vain. \n     The council tried to distribute generators found at a \n     Republican Guard camp to villages, but found that many of the \n     village ``representatives'' were driving out of the camp and \n     selling the generators. Others were being set upon by angry \n     mobs wanting the generators for themselves.\n       American soldiers were deployed to keep order, but in the \n     heat and chaos their tempers frayed. They broke windshields \n     and cursed at Iraqis, further shrinking the reservoir of good \n     will.\n       Mr. Dari said he received 10 to 12 complaints a day about \n     weapons, cars or relatives taken by the Americas. One man \n     came to report that American soldiers had taken away his deaf \n     relative a month ago for having a picture of Saddam Hussein \n     in his house, and that he had not been seen since. Officials \n     from an Islamic charity said the Americans had confiscated \n     their car and raided their office--the left both unsecured, \n     giving looters free rein.\n       Then there are the small problems. The woman who is \n     illegally squatting in a government building (American \n     soldier told Mr. Dari they could not evict her unless she \n     threatened someone; property rights were not their \n     ``purview.'') The two council members whom the council \n     dismissed for corruption. The effort to find the American \n     commander with the authority to sign a contract for garbage \n     collection.\n       Mr. Dari is just old enough to remember when the British \n     had an air base just west of here. They told Iraqis they had \n     come to liberate them from the Ottomans, he recalled, and \n     they stayed 40 years.\n       ``I hope history isn't repeating itself,'' he said, and \n     pressed his temples as if hoping to make the impatient men at \n     both elbows disappear.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

OF MARYLAND\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I would like to notice the passing this \nweek of Eugene Augustine Jenkins, Jr. of Maryland, a loyal Senate staff \nmember and legal counsel to several senators over the course of almost \nfour decades. Gene Jenkins came to the Senate in 1953 after serving in \nthe Air Force as an Assistant Judge Advocate General from 1951 to 1953, \nand after receiving bachelor and law degrees from Georgetown \nUniversity. He worked for Senators J. Glenn Beall and Charles McC. \nMathiais of Maryland, Senator Winston Prouty of Vermont and Senator \nRoman Hruska of Nebraska.\n  During his long years of service, Gene Jenkins garnered a reputation \nnot only as a fine lawyer but also as the most meticulous historian and \narchivist that a Senator could hire to prepare their historical records \nand papers. A Senator who hired Gene Jenkins would have to hid the fact \nby hiding Jenkins' office because Jenkins' reputation was so well known \nthat if a Senator had hired him, it clearly signaled that the Senator \nwas about to retire.\n  A member of the family that once owned Jenkins Hill, which we now \ncall Capitol Hill, Gene Jenkins not only served the Senate modestly but \nhe was a public servant and good citizen in the truest sense, \ndedicating himself to numerous voluntary organizations, including his \nbeloved Society of the Cincinnati and the Stewards of Georgetown. He \nwas devoted to his church and volunteered for many years with Mother \nTheresa's Sisters of Charity. He will be buried this coming Monday at \nSt. Joseph' Parish in southern Maryland, one of the oldest Roman \nCatholic churches in North America, near his family home in Pomfret \nwhere the Jenkins family has been buried for generations--a final \nresting place befitting a historian. May he rest in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/10/senate-section/article/S9235-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, earlier this week, I voted in favor of \ninvoking cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 11, the Patients First \nAct of 2003. My vote was not an endorsement of S. 11 as it was \nintroduced in the Senate. In fact, I have concerns about various \naspects of the bill--including the $250,000 cap on noneconomic \ndamages--and I anticipate supporting amendments to S. 11 if the Senate \nhas an opportunity to fully debate this legislation.\n  However, I do believe that reform of the medical liability system \nshould be part of a comprehensive response to surging medical \nmalpractice premiums that endanger Americans' access to quality medical \ncare by causing doctors to leave certain communities or cease \npracticing medicine altogether. For this reason, I voted for cloture on \nS. 11 in an effort to move the debate forward.\n  I commend Senator Feinstein of California for working with the \nmajority leader to craft a bipartisan proposal for reform, and I am \nhopeful that they will revive their discussions in the near future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/10/senate-section/article/S9235-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SYRIA ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I wish to discuss S. 982, the Syria \nAccountability Act. Senator Santorum and I introduced this legislation \non May 1. In just over 2 months, this bill has received 63 cosponsors.\n  After discussing this issue with Senator Lugar, the chairman of the \nSenator Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Santorum and I have \ndecided against offering this legislation as an amendment to the State \nDepartment authorization bill.\n  Senator Lugar has agreed to hold a hearing in his committee on the \nissue of Syria in the near future. I am very grateful for his \ncooperation. The Syria Accountability Act would expand U.S. diplomatic \nand economic sanctions against Syria unless a certification can be made \nthat Syria no longer supports terrorism, has withdrawn from Lebanon, \nand has ended its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction.\n  The legislation does not in any way advocate the use of force against \nSyria. The goal is to give the President and the Secretary of State the \nability to exert economic and political leverage on Syria because of \nthe serious policy concerns we have with the Syrian government.\n  It is well known that terrorist organizations like Hizballah, Hamas, \nand the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine maintain offices, \ntraining camps, and other facilities on Syrian territory and in areas \nof Lebanon occupied by the Syrian armed forces. This bill addresses \nthis issue by confronting the Government of Syria in a diplomatic way \nthat shows the seriousness of our concerns.\n  The Syria Accountability Act of 2003 would impose various sanctions \non Syria, including a prohibition on the export of defense and dual-use \nitems. In addition, the act requires the President to impose two or \nmore of the following sanctions: 1, prohibiting the export of products \nof the U.S. other than food and medicine to Syria, 2, prohibiting U.S. \nbusinesses from investing or operating in Syria, 3, restricting Syrian \ndiplomats in Washington, DC and at the United Nations to travel only \nwithin a 25-mile radius of Washington, DC or the United Nations, \nrespectively, 4, reducing U.S. diplomatic contacts with Syria, and 5, \nblocking transactions in any property in which the Government of Syria \nhas any interest.\n  The President is authorized to waive any or all of these five \nsanctions if it is in the national security interest of the United \nStates. It is imperative that we hold all nations that are responsible \nfor the proliferation of international terrorism and regional \ninstability in the Middle East fully accountable for their actions. If \nwe do not, the credibility of our antiterrorism efforts diminishes, \nalong with our chances for victory over terrorism and for truly \npositive change in the Middle East. I thank the Chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee for his assistance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/10/senate-section/article/S9235-4", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9235-S9236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING OUR VIETNAM VETERANS ON JULY FOURTH\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise today to recognize and applaud \nVFW Post 2164 of Wheaton, IL for sponsoring the Moving Wall in Wheaton \nduring its Independence Day celebrations from June 30 to July 6 this \nyear. I had the honor of marching in the Wheaton July 4th parade last \nFriday and viewing the Moving Wall. I was especially impressed by the \ncommunity's tribute to fallen Vietnam veterans that was delivered at \nthe parade reviewing stand.\n  The Moving Wall is a half-sized replica of the Vietnam Veterans \nMemorial here in Washington. The Memorial was dedicated in 1982 in \nhonor of the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States who \nserved in the Vietnam War. The black granite wall, engraved with the \nnames of those who gave their lives and those who remain missing, \nserves as a somber reminder of the costs of war in American lives and \ntreasure.\n  The idea of a moving wall was conceived by Vietnam veteran John \nDevitt while attending the Vietnam Veterans Memorial dedication in \n1982. Devitt's idea was deeply personal. He had been out of work when \nthe wall was dedicated and had made the trip with financial help from \nfamily and friends. ``There were millions of people who would never be \nable to come to Washington,'' he later explained: ``I wanted\n\n[[Page S9236]]\n\nthem to be able see and feel what I had.'' Mr. Devitt accomplished his \nmission as millions of people in hundreds of American communities have \nvisited the Moving Wall during its 20 years of existence.\n  The Moving Wall was built by Devitt, Norris Shears, Gerry Haver and \nother Vietnam veterans, and was displayed for the first time in Tyler, \nTX in October of 1984. Currently, there are two Moving Walls, which \ncrisscross the country from April to November each year.\n  The 462-strong VFW Post 2164, commanded by Korean War veteran Sonny \nCarson, and the citizens of Wheaton, IL are to be commended for raising \nthe $26,000 required to bring the Wall to Wheaton. The Wall's presence \nin Wheaton was a particularly poignant event as the names of 14 of its \nsons are engraved upon the Wall's granite face, including a Medal of \nHonor recipient, James Howard Monroe.\n  The goal of bringing the Moving Wall to Wheaton was to help close old \nwounds, and to educate the community about the war in Vietnam and its \nprofound effect on our Nation and our veterans. It is my pleasure to \ncongratulate the members of VWF Post 2164 and the citizens of Wheaton \nfor achieving that goal, and for helping the rest of us honor and \nremember those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/10/senate-section/article/S9236-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MONEY FOLLOWS THE PERSON\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, my job as a Senator is to help protect \nand defend the freedoms of all Americans. Among the most basic freedoms \nare those we most often overlook: the freedom to choose where we live--\nfor example, among family and friends and not among strangers--the \nfreedom to walk down your neighborhood street, and not in a restricted \ncourtyard; and the freedom to be an active member in your community.\n  All too often, these basic freedoms are denied to older Americans and \nAmericans with disabilities. I have noticed an alarming trend in this \ncountry: we are unnecessarily isolating people with disabilities from \ntheir communities, friends, families, and loved ones by placing them in \ninstitutional care facilities.\n  Many of these Americans should not be in a nursing home or other \ninstitutional setting. Many Americans with disabilities could be better \nserved--and better integrated into their communities--by allowing them \nto live in community-based homes.\n  However, recent data indicates that 70 percent of Medicaid dollars \nare spent on institutional care and only 30 percent are spent on \ncommunity services for the disabled. Because Medicaid requires that \nStates provide nursing home care for Americans with disabilities but \ndoes not require the same for community-based services, many \nindividuals with disabilities and older Americans are forced to live in \nisolated settings.\n  In order to preserve the freedoms of our friends in the disabled \ncommunity and their loved ones, we must do something to reverse this \ntrend. I would therefore like to join my distinguished colleague from \nIowa as a cosponsor of the Money Follows the Person Act of 2003. The \nSenator from Iowa and I first introduced the provisions of this act as \nan amendment to S. 1, the Medicare and Prescription Drug Improvement \nAct of 2003.\n  This bill would enact the President's 2004 Money Follows the Person \nProgram to give people with disabilities the freedom to choose where \nthey want to live. Under this legislation, Oregon's effort to help an \nindividual move out of an institutional facility and into a community \nhome would be 100 percent federally funded for 1 year. After that first \nyear, the Federal Government would pay its usual rate. Under the \nprovisions of this bill, States can take advantage of $350 million \nannually for 5 years for a total of $1.75 billion.\n  These dollars can help reintegrate countless older Americans and \nAmericans with disabilities into a setting where they can be more \nactive citizens. For instance, this bill is supported by the Oregon \nChapter of Paralyzed Veterans because it helps honor and reintegrate \nthose veterans whose disabilities resulted from noble and selfless \nservice to this Nation.\n  Under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Olmstead Supreme \nCourt decision, we know that the needless institutionalization of \nAmericans with disabilities constitutes discrimination under the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act.\n  Americans everywhere realize the value of integrating Americans with \ndisabilities into our communities. Needlessly isolating productive \ncitizens from their communities, whether they are disabled or not, is \nunfair and unjust. It is time we work to reintegrate disabled Americans \nback into our communities.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this \nimportant bill and to support the freedom of choice for Americans with \ndisabilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/10/senate-section/article/S9236-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  LAOS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise today to express my concern \nover recent events in Laos. As a member of the Subcommittee on East \nAsian and Pacific Affairs of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, \nI have consistently monitored the human rights situation in Laos and \nother East Asian nations. Recent news reports indicate that the human \nrights situation continues to deteriorate in Laos, specifically for the \nHmong ethnic group.\n  As many of you may know, two European journalists and their \ntranslator, a Hmong-American pastor from Minnesota, were captured by \nthe Lao government on June 4, 2003 and sentenced to 15 years of prison. \nAfter serious diplomatic negotiations between the governments of \nBelgium, France, the United States and Laos, they were released from \nprison on Wednesday. While I am relieved that the Lao government has \nfreed these people, I remain concerned about the continuous allegations \nof human rights violations by the Lao government. Amnesty International \nreports that Lao nationals who accompanied the journalists remain in \ndetention without legal representation and are being tortured with \nsticks and bicycle chains, which I find horrifying. I also find \ntroubling reports by the freed journalists regarding the ``sham'' \ntrials they experienced.\n  In addition, Time magazine has recently released two articles that \naccuse the government of waging a war against the Hmong ethnic \ncommunity within Laos. The articles state that the Lao government \nattacked a Hmong village in October, killing 216 people and has \nthreatened to ``eradicate'' the population of Hmong. Time magazine also \nclaims that ``no political dissent has been allowed in [Laos for] 28 \nyears, nor any right of assembly. Scores of political prisoners and \nyouths have been detained for years in dark cells without trial; many \nhave been tortured.''\n  While I cannot confirm the specific allegations of the article, many \nof my Hmong constituents have raised similar concerns about the human \nrights conditions in Laos and the welfare of their families and friends \nwho are living there. I strongly believe that the United States cannot \nignore violations in Laos. I have consistently supported efforts to \npromote human rights and democracy in Laos, and in the 106th Congress, \nsponsored a resolution calling upon the Government of Laos to recognize \nand to respect the basic human rights of all its citizens, including \nethnic and religious minorities.\n  Once again, I ask the Lao government to allow international \nhumanitarian organizations to have access to areas in which Hmong and \nother ethnic minorities have resettled, to allow independent monitoring \nof prison conditions, and to release prisoners who have been \narbitrarily arrested because of their political or religious beliefs. \nThese violations must not continue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/10/senate-section/article/S9236-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9236-S9239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE WEISS REPORT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, during consideration of the motion to \nproceed to S. 11, I took exception with several findings included in \nthe Weiss Report on Medical Malpractice Caps that I believed \nmisinterpreted the data of the Medical Liability Monitor and the \nNational Practicioner Data Bank. Following the vote on the motion to \ninvoke cloture, I received a report supporting my conclusions from the \nPhysicians Insurance Association of America as well as a statement from \nthe Division of Practicioner Data Banks. I ask unanimous consent that \nthese documents be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S9237]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n The Weiss Ratings Report on Medical Malpractice Caps--Propagating the \n             Myth That Non-Economic Damage Caps Don't Work\n\n       On June 3, 2003, Weiss Ratings, Inc. published a report \n     regarding the performance of the medical malpractice \n     insurance industry entitled Medical Malpractice Caps The \n     Impact of Non-Economic Damage Caps on Physician Premiums, \n     Claims Payout Levels, and Availability of Coverage. The major \n     recommendation of the report is that ``Legislators should put \n     proposals involving non-economic damage caps on hold until \n     convincing evidence can be produced to demonstrate a true \n     benefit to doctors in the form of reduced med mal costs.'' \n     Unfortunately, the Weiss report is ill conceived, and \n     misleads the reader by falsely demonstrating that non-\n     economic damage caps have not worked. Both of the data \n     sources used by Weiss have gone on record disagreeing with \n     the report's methodology, as described herein.\n       The conclusions drawn by Weiss are opposite of those \n     previously published by reputable entities, such as the \n     Congressional Budget Office, US Department of Health and \n     Human Services, Joint Economic Committee of the United States \n     Congress, Standard & Poors, American Academy of Actuaries, \n     Tillinghast, and Milliman, USA, to name a few (see Appendix \n     A). Unlike Weiss, all of these highly respected organizations \n     have considerable experience and acceptance by government and \n     industry for their knowledge and analytical product.\n       The purpose of this document is to evaluate Weiss' use of \n     the data and analytical process. In short, Weiss misuses \n     published industry data in an effort to demonstrate that non-\n     economic damage caps enacted by several states have not been \n     effective in reducing medical malpractice premiums in those \n     states as compared to states without caps. Weiss \n     underestimates the ``average'' claim costs for the two groups \n     of states by employing inappropriate analytical technique to \n     represent the burden on insurers. This is an error that is \n     readily obvious to those who work with medical malpractice \n     claims data, and it misleads the reader to an inappropriate \n     conclusion.\n\n\n                        WHAT DID WEISS DO WRONG?\n\n     Grouping the States\n       Weiss has grouped 19 states as having caps on non-economic \n     damages, and 32 others (including the District of Columbia) \n     as not having caps. Unfortunately, states with effective \n     caps, such as California with a $250 thousand cap, are \n     considered the same as states having various levels of caps \n     up to and including $1 million. In fact, only 5 of the 19 \n     states have a $250 thousand dollar cap similar to that being \n     proposed under current legislation. Eleven of the states have \n     caps of $500 thousand or greater. No attempt has been made to \n     evaluate the effectiveness of caps at various levels, they \n     have simply been lumped together. The American Academy of \n     Actuaries has testified that caps are a key element of tort \n     reform, and must be set at a level low enough, such as \n     $250,000, to have an effect. Any comparison chosen to \n     demonstrate the effectiveness of non-economic damage caps \n     should be sensitive to the level of caps in the various \n     states and to their individual effectiveness.\n       In addition, as clearly shown on Appendix 1 of the Weiss \n     report, more than half of the states enacting non-economic \n     damage caps had not done so prior to the baseline date of \n     1991. Weiss compares premiums and claims costs for only two \n     years, 1991 and 2002. The caps enacted in 10 states were not \n     in place in 1991, and thus, these states should not be \n     included in the ``cap states'' category for this analysis. \n     Two other states had only adopted their caps in 1990, and the \n     beneficial effects of these laws may not have been recognized \n     in the data by 1991 due to constitutional challenge and \n     uncertainty about the ultimate effects of the caps.\n     Measuring the Premiums\n       Weiss uses the annual insurance rate surveys published by \n     Medical Liability Monitor (MLM) for three medical specialties \n     as the source of insurance premium data. He calculates median \n     average premiums by state and then calculates a median \n     premium for 1991 and 2002 for the two groups of states.\n       For example, Alabama had two insurers listed in the 2002 \n     study, each with a premium for the three specialties. Weiss \n     simply ranks the premiums from least to most, and then \n     selects the middle value (or mean average of the two middle \n     values when there is an even number of rates) as the median \n     average value, as shown below.\n\n           MEDICAL LIABILITY MONITOR RATE SURVEY DATA ALABAMA\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            Insurer                  Specialty      1991 rate  2002 rate\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFPIC...........................

However, these data \n     demonstrates many reasons why the use of the median is \n     improper:\n       Data for different insurers are used for the two comparison \n     years.\n       The median value is representative of only general surgery \n     rates because general surgery rates are always higher than \n     internal medicine and lower than OB/GYN.\n       Because two carriers are represented in 2002 and only one \n     in 1991, the median value chosen by Weiss (the average of the \n     two general surgery rates) is actually lower than the 1991 \n     rate. However, the actual general surgery rates for the only \n     carrier shown for both years increased--the opposite of \n     Weiss' result.\n       The premiums shown are not adjusted for various discounts \n     or surcharges, and do not reflect any dividends which may \n     have been paid back to policyholders, thus reducing their \n     total outlay. Medical malpractice insurers paid substantial \n     dividends in the 1991 era, which had been largely reduced by \n     2002 due to industry losses.\n       Using the product of this calculation to represent \n     insurance industry revenues is flawed for many additional \n     reasons. First, there is no certainty that any of the table \n     rates listed in MLM are actually charged. Carriers may have a \n     premium filed in a given state (or in multiple territories in \n     states), but may not write much business there. Weiss' \n     analysis gives no weight to the actual amount of insurance \n     sold by the various companies in any state, nor does it \n     reflect discounts or surcharges which are routinely applied \n     to standard premiums. In addition, many insurers pay \n     policyholder dividends, which in effect reduce the annual \n     premiums paid.\n       MLM has objected to Weiss' misuse of its data. In a July 7, \n     2003 email to Senate Majority Leader Frist, MLM Editor \n     Barbara Dillard states ``We believe it is misleading to use \n     median annual premiums compiled with data from Medical \n     Liability Monitor to demonstrate the effect of non-economic \n     damage limits on liability rates.''\n       The Weiss analysis only includes premium data for three \n     medical specialties, thus ignoring the experience for all of \n     the rest. Even more glaring is the fact that the MLM data \n     does not exist for seven of the capped states and five of the \n     non-capped states for 1991. But, this did not stop Weiss from \n     irresponsibly including these states in the analysis (see \n     Weiss's Appendix 1 and 2).\n       An analysis using actual premiums as reported to the \n     National Association of Insurance Commissioners (not medians) \n     is helpful in evaluating differences between states having \n     effective damage caps throughout the period of Weiss' \n     analysis and those without. Such premiums include surcharges \n     and discounts which may have been applied to standard rates.\n       The four states having a $250,000 cap prior to 1991 (CA, \n     CO, IN, KS) saw their total premiums increase by 28.0 percent \n     between 1991 and 2001 (2002 data not available yet). States \n     not having the $250,000 non-economic damage cap experienced a \n     collective 47.7 percent increase in premiums, over 70 percent \n     greater. See Appendix B for details. This wide gap in \n     premiums actually collected compares inversely to Weiss' \n     faulty conclusion that annual premiums in states with caps \n     increased by 48.2 percent as compared to 35.9 percent in \n     states without caps.\n     Measuring Claim Costs\n       In order to evaluate the difference in claim costs between \n     the two groups of states, Weiss analyzes median claim \n     payments by state for 1991 and 2002 as reported to the \n     National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB). The NPDB provides the \n     only readily available source of medical malpractice \n     insurance indemnity payments by state. However, in order to \n     use these data effectively, one must understand the nature of \n     the claim payment values reported, and the shortcomings from \n     that which might be normally expected (see Appendix C for \n     a discussion of the NPDB claim payment data).\n       The use of the median claim payment value greatly \n     compromises the accuracy of Weiss' analysis. While the median \n     (or middle value of the claim payment distribution) might be \n     an effective descriptor of what a plaintiff might receive as \n     payment (before paying almost half to his/her lawyer), it \n     cannot be used to measure the claim payment burden on \n     insurers. The use of total claim payments reported by state \n     shows a much larger differential result than Weiss' reported \n     payout increase of 83.3 percent for capped states as compared \n     to 127.9 percent for non-capped states.\n       The increase in total claim payments for the four states \n     having a $250,000 non-economic damage cap during the period \n     of the Weiss analysis is 52.8 percent, compared to 100.1 \n     percent for all other states--an 89.6 percent difference (See \n     Appendix D). Thus the experience in the capped states is \n     almost twice as good as that for states without effective \n     non-economic damage caps prior to 1991. Using his faulty \n     median calculation, Weiss would have us believe that the \n     difference is only 53.5 percent (127.9/83.3).\n       The NPDB has gone on record opposing Mr. Weiss' \n     methodology, saying that ``Although the statistical median is \n     usually the best measure of the `average' malpractice payment \n     received by claimants, it does not show the `burden on \n     insurers.' The `burden on insurers' is the total amount of \n     dollars paid, not the `average' or median payment.'' (see \n     Appendix E for NPDB statement).\n     Investment Performance\n       In addition to inappropriate analysis of premium and claims \n     data, the Weiss report comments on the investment performance \n     of\n\n[[Page S9238]]\n\n     medical malpractice insurers. Being a long tail line of \n     insurance, medical malpractice insurers routinely utilize the \n     investment income generated by the premiums they collect and \n     hold for the payment of claims in the future. It is no secret \n     that bond yields have declined over the past decade, and are \n     now at historically low levels.\n       In spite of the fact that medical malpractice insurers are \n     80 percent invested in bonds and have less than 10% invested \n     in the stock market, Weiss still concludes that stock market \n     losses are responsible for insurers' poor performance. While \n     the fall in interest rates has reduced the interest income \n     available to offset premiums, Weiss fails to mention that \n     when rates go down, bond values go up, and insurers have been \n     able to book capital gains to bolster their investment \n     income.\n       The total return on investments for the industry has \n     remained fairly stable, and does not explain why rates are \n     rising. Rates are rising because of increasing claim costs.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n       The Weiss report recommends that ``. . . legislators must \n     immediately put on hold all proposals involving non-economic \n     damage caps until convincing evidence can be produced to \n     demonstrate a true benefit to doctors in the form of reduced \n     med mal cost.'' This information exists, as reported herein \n     and by many other reputable sources, and now is the time for \n     the enactment of effective federal health care liability \n     reform.\n\n Appendix A--Reputable Sources Know That MICRA's Cap Reins in Premiums\n\n       Congressional Budget Office--``CBO's analysis indicated \n     that certain tort limitations, primarily caps on awards and \n     rules governing offsets from collateral-source benefits, \n     effectively reduce average premiums for medical malpractice \n     insurance. Consequently, CBO estimates that, in states that \n     currently do not have controls on malpractice torts, H.R. 5 \n     would significantly lower premiums for medical malpractice \n     insurance from what they would otherwise be under current \n     law. . . . premiums for medical malpractice insurance \n     ultimately would be an average of 25 percent to 30 percent \n     below what they would be under current law.''\n       [CBO Cost Estimate of H.R. 5, the HEALTH Act, March 10, \n     2003.]\n       U.S. Department of Health and Human Services--``States with \n     limits of $250,000 or $350,000 on non-economic damages have \n     average combined highest premium increases of 12-15 percent, \n     compared to 44 percent in states without caps on non-economic \n     damages.''\n       [Confronting the New Health Care Crisis: Improving Health \n     Care Quality and Lowering Costs by Fixing Our Medical \n     Liability System, U.S. Department of Health and Human \n     Services, July 24, 2002]\n       Joint Economic Committee of the United States Congress--\n     ``Tort reforms would reduce overall spending on healthcare, \n     saving between $67 and $106 Billion over ten years.''\n       [Florida] Governor's Select Task Force on Healthcare \n     Professional Liability Insurance (Report and recommendations \n     submitted January 29, 2003)--``The Task Force believes that a \n     cap on non-economic damages will bring relief to this current \n     crisis.

Although the Task \n     Force was offered other solutions, there is no other \n     alternative remedy that will immediately alleviate Florida's \n     crisis of availability and affordability of healthcare.

NPDB Payment Values\n\n       The National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) was designed to \n     collect information on health care providers which would \n     allow credentialling entities to identify individuals who had \n     accumulated a ``bad track record'' and who may move to a new \n     geographic location to start anew. While some of the data \n     fields in the data base are useful, it was not designed as a \n     medical malpractice research data base. The data are not well \n     suited for measuring the actual payment values of verdicts or \n     settlements in a malpractice case, as described below.\n       The Health Care Quality Improvement Act requires insurers \n     to report the first indemnity payment (check written) made on \n     behalf of any provider within 30 days of the date of payment. \n     It is this value which appears in the numeric field in the \n     NPDB data base, and which appears in the NPDB public use \n     file. This payment value must be analyzed in light of the \n     following:\n       A. The data reported to the NPDB is on a provider (doctor) \n     basis, and represents payments made on behalf of only one \n     provider. The Data Bank has no way of linking payments made \n     on behalf of multiple individual providers to aggregate the \n     total amount of the settlement or jury award. Thus, the total \n     value of settlements or jury awards made for the plaintiff \n     against multiple providers cannot be determined.\n       B. Insurers may make more than one indemnity payment on \n     behalf of a provider. Only the first payment is required to \n     be reported, and reporting entities are directed to explain \n     any anticipated future payments in a non-machinable paragraph \n     of description.\n       C. In cases involving continuing care (such as long term \n     medication), the provider may\n\n[[Page S9239]]\n\n     have been insured by more than one primary insurance carrier, \n     each of which may have made a payment for any individual \n     claim.\n       D. In cases where excess carriers or state-run compensation \n     funds make an excess payment (usually amounts over $1mil) in \n     addition to the primary insurer payment, two reports are sent \n     to the Data Bank, which then look like two smaller payments \n     for two separate claims instead of one larger payment.\n       E. In many cases, insurers do not apportion payments made \n     on behalf of multiple defendants, such as in a case where \n     $300,000 is paid on behalf of three doctors. In this \n     instance, the Data Bank instructs the reporting entity to \n     file a report for each doctor, each of which will have \n     $300,000 in the payment field. There is a separate field \n     which should indicate that a payment was made on behalf of \n     three practitioners. For these data records, the $300,000 \n     must be divided by 3 to get an accurate average payment \n     amount for each of the three data records.\n       F. The Data Bank estimates that they are only getting 50% \n     compliance with reporting entities. They have done quite a \n     bit of work looking at insurers reports, and have uncovered \n     little non-compliance. Thus, the problem may lie in self-\n     insured plans, etc., if the non-compliance does in fact \n     exist. In any event, the total amounts reported may not be \n     complete.\n\n                               Appendix D\n\n           STATES WITH CAPS OF $250,000 IN PLACE PRIOR TO

\nHealth Resources and Services Administration, U.S. Department of Health \n and Human Services, Concerning Use of Medians of Malpractice Payments \n  Reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank for Analysis of the \n          Impact of Caps on Malpractice Payments, July 2, 2003\n\n       The Weiss Ratings, Inc. report ``Medical Malpractice Caps: \n     The Impact of Non-Economic Damage Caps on Physician Premiums, \n     Claims Payout Levels, and Availability of Coverage'' mentions \n     data from the National Practitioner Data Bank in its \n     discussion of the relationship between caps on medical \n     malpractice payments and medical malpractice insurance \n     premiums. The report states on page 7:\n       Caps do reduce the burden on insurers--Using data provided \n     by the National Practitioner Data Bank, we compared the \n     median payouts in the 19 states with caps to those in the 32 \n     states without caps for the period between 1991 and 2002, \n     with the following results:\n       Payments reduced. In states without caps, the median payout \n     for the entire 12-year period was $116,297, ranging from \n     $75,000 on the low end to $220,000 on the high end. In states \n     with caps, the median was 15.7 percent lower, or $98,079, \n     ranging from $50,000 to $190,000. Since caps in many states \n     were not imposed until late in the 12-year period, this \n     represents a significant reduction.\n       Growth in payouts slowed substantially. The median payout \n     in the 32 states without caps increased by 127.9 percent, \n     from $65,831 in 1991 to $150,000 in 2002. In contrast, \n     payouts in the 19 states with caps increased at a far slower \n     pace--by 83.3 percent, from $60,000 in 1991 to $110,000 in \n     2002.\n       In short, it's clear that caps do accomplish their intended \n     purpose of lowering the average amount insurance companies \n     must pay out to satisfy med mal claims.\n       Although the statistical median is usually the best measure \n     of the ``average'' malpractice payment received by claimants, \n     it does not show the ``burden on insurers.'' The ``burden on \n     insurers'' is the total amount of dollars paid, not the \n     ``average'' or median payment.\n       Statistically, the median is the payment amount in the \n     middle of a rank-ordered list of all payments. Thus in a set \n     of 101 payments, 50 of which were for $1,000, 1 of which was \n     for $25,000, 49 of which were for $100,000, and 1 of which \n     was for $1,000,000, the median payment would be $25,000. \n     Arguing that the burden of payments on insurers is low \n     because the median payment is $25,000 is misleading. The \n     total amount paid cannot be determined through use of the \n     median. The burden on insurers would be better measured by \n     examining the total of all payments by insurers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/10/senate-section/article/S9239-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9239-S9240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   U.S. INSTITUTE OF PEACE'S 2003 NATIONAL PEACE ESSAY CONTEST WINNER\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, on Wednesday, June 25, \nGranite Bay Student Kevin Kiley visited my office as part of the U.S. \nInstitute of Peace's 2003 National Peace Essay Contest, NPEC, Awards \nWeek in Washington.\n  Mr. Kiley had been selected by the Institute as the California State \nwinner as well as the national award winner for his essay, ``Kuwait and \nKosovo: The Harm Principle and Humanitarian War.'' The U.S. Institute \nof Peace has sponsored the essay contest annually since 1986 in the \nbelief that expanding the study of peace, justice, freedom, and \nsecurity is vital to civic education.\n  I am proud of Mr. Kiley's exemplary essay, commend his dedication to \nthis studies, and congratulate his teachers at Granite Bay High School. \nThis young man, who is thoughtful and mature beyond his years, will be \na leader in his future endeavors in peace studies.\n  I would like to bring to my colleaguess' attention a copy of Mr. \nKiley's first place essay. I ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The essay follows.\n\n       Kuwait and Kosovo: The Harm Principle and Humanitarian War\n\n       War causes harm; of this there is no doubt. In determining \n     the justification of war, the question hence becomes: when is \n     it justified to cause harm? The only morally acceptable \n     answer is that causing harm is justified if it prevents \n     further harm. Thus, in general terms, the only justifiable \n     reason to go to war is to minimize harm--if war is the lesser \n     of two evils.\n       Underlying the issue of just and unjust war is the concept \n     of sovereignty, for declaring war on a nation is a direct \n     violation of its right to self-government. This adds another \n     element to the harms calculation involved in justifying war. \n     Even the United Nations accepts the view that sovereignty has \n     inherent value, stating in a 1970 Declaration, ``Every state \n     has an inalienable right to choose its political, economic, \n     social, and cultural system, without interference in any form \n     by another state.'' Waging war against a sovereign nation \n     constitutes a direct violation of this ``inalienable right.''\n       In determining what circumstances justify violating a \n     nation's sovereignty, the laws governing the conduct of \n     individuals provide a useful analogy. In On Liberty, John \n     Stuart Mill establishes the Harm Principle, a criterion for \n     when it is justified to violate an individual's sovereignty. \n     Mill writes, ``the only purpose for which power can be \n     rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized \n     community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.'' \n     Mill's aphorism can be taken a step further; it applies with \n     equal force to sovereign nations. Just as an individual's \n     freedom must be restricted if it harms other individuals, so \n     too must a nation's freedom be restricted if it harms other \n     nations. This principle, however, does not simply govern the \n     relationship between two warring nations, for today's complex \n     world is one of political interdependence. With the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization, the United Nations, the Arab \n     League, and other alliances, even those wars that are \n     relatively limited in scope are becoming ``world wars.'' \n     Therefore, in applying the Harm Principal to the realm of \n     nation states, any just war standard must specify what \n     circumstances justify intervention by an international \n     coalition. International intervention in Kuwait and Kosovo \n     illustrate the success and failure of meeting just war \n     criteria.\n       In 1990, Iraq sent shockwaves around the world by invading \n     Kuwait, its small but wealthy neighbor. Within twelve hours \n     of the invasion, ``all of Kuwait . . . was under Iraqi \n     control.'' Following Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's \n     overwhelming victory, the resolve of U.S. President George \n     Bush quickly became apparent; he immediately declared that \n     the invasion ``will not stand,'' that ``no nation should \n     rape, pillage, and brutalize its\n\n[[Page S9240]]\n\n     neighbor.'' In the five months between Iraq's invasion of \n     Kuwait and the dropping of the first U.S. bomb, Bush tried to \n     convince the American people, along with the international \n     community, that intervention was a moral responsibility.\n       At the time of the invasion, the depth of Hussein's motives \n     was unclear. Was he a power-hungry despot--another Hitler--or \n     was he simply trying to claim the territory he felt was \n     rightfully his? Would he stop with Kuwait, or did he have his \n     sights set on hegemony in the Middle East? While Hussein's \n     territorial ambitions remained uncertain, there were more \n     tangible consequences of appeasing Iraq's territorial gains. \n     Western oil interests in the region--and the fate of these \n     interests if Hussein were to gain control of OPEC--were \n     undoubtedly a weight on the scale. Moreover, beyond these \n     utilitarian considerations, the fact remained that \n     Kuwait's sovereignty had been violated, and according to \n     the Harm Principal, a military response was justified on \n     this basis alone.\n       When the war was over, the stated objectives of the United \n     States and its allies had been achieved: ``Kuwait was \n     liberated, Saudi sovereignty assured, Persian Gulf oil \n     secure.'' Given these results, the ejection of Iraq from \n     Kuwait was a just end, but a just end is only half of the \n     just war equation. For a war to be justified, the benefits \n     must outweigh the costs--the harm of action must be less than \n     the harm of inaction. Whether this was possible in the \n     Persian Gulf was a matter of much speculation. As with any \n     war, the loss of American lives was a foremost concern. This \n     concern led some--including General Collin Powell--to suggest \n     that economic sanctions might be a viable alternative to war. \n     In late 1990, however, it became increasingly clear that \n     sanctions would do little more than starve the Iraqi people. \n     According to a PBS Frontline report, ``the CIA was telling \n     President Bush it could take years for sanctions to drive \n     Saddam from Kuwait.'' Furthermore, it also became clear that \n     U.S. technology could enable the U.S. to fight a relatively \n     painless war, one with few U.S. lives lost and minimal \n     civilian casualties. And this optimistic outlook became a \n     reality, as the U.S. and its allies waged one of the most \n     flawless military campaigns in history. Thus, the Gulf War \n     meets the criteria of a just war: It achieved a just end and \n     minimized harms.\n       While the involvement of the United States in the Gulf War \n     demonstrates the validity of Mill's Harm Principle as a \n     justification for war, a key distinction must be made between \n     the Principle's applicability on an individual level and on a \n     national level. The constituent parts of an individual have \n     no inherent worth; it is only the individual himself that is \n     of value. Nations, conversely, are comprised of individuals. \n     Thus, the constituent parts of the nation are themselves \n     valuable. While Mill holds that morality demands the \n     individual be completely sovereign in his sphere--that no \n     just law could prevent him from harming himself--this is not \n     the case with nation states. For if the actions of a \n     government cause harm to its citizens, the sovereignty of the \n     nation and the sovereignty of the individuals conflict. And \n     on this basis, a case can be made for humanitarian war--\n     military intervention that prevents a nation from harming its \n     citizens, its constituent parts.\n       In the last decade, the most vivid example of humanitarian \n     intervention was the crisis in Kosovo, a ``paradigmatic \n     instance of humanitarian intervention in the very name of \n     humanity itself.'' There was little doubt, in 1999, that \n     Slobodan Milosevic's ethnic cleansing of Albanians \n     constituted a crime against humanity. While Milosevic's \n     actions did not directly harm another sovereign nation, they \n     so egregiously harmed his own people--so ``shocked the \n     conscience of mankind''--that international action was deemed \n     necessary. The end of saving Albanian lives was certainly \n     justified. In fact, the moral responsibility espoused by U.S. \n     President Bill Clinton was perhaps even greater than that \n     Bush spoke of in 1990. And aside from war, there existed no \n     viable option for fulfilling this responsibility. The means \n     employed by the Clinton Administration and NATO, however, \n     were inconsistent with just war principles.\n       The history of the Kosovo crisis is replete with \n     ``collateral damage'' to civilians. According to Jean \n     Elshtain, ``once we had exhausted the obvious military \n     targets, we degraded the infrastructure on which civilian \n     life depends.'' Largely as a result of high altitude \n     bombing by NATO forces, 2,000 civilians were killed and \n     6,00 wounded, and countless others would suffer and die \n     because of infrastructure destruction. This ``collateral \n     damage'' can be directly attributed to the ``no-cost'' \n     strategy employed by NATO troops, which refused to risk \n     American and European lives even as the welfare of the \n     Serbian people hung in the balance. In the end, this \n     overemphasis on some lives and devaluation of others \n     undermined the moral authority of NATO's crusade. In ``War \n     and Sacrifice in Kosovo,'' Paul W. Kahn sums up this \n     contradiction well when he writes of the ``incompatibility \n     between the morality of the ends, which are universal, and \n     the morality of the means, which seem to privilege a \n     particular community.''\n       The incompatibility Kahn speaks of not only caused \n     unnecessary civilian causalties, but also expedited the very \n     atrocities NATO forces had entered Kosovo to prevent. \n     According to Elshtain, NATO attacked Milosevic to halt ethnic \n     cleansing, but ``our means speeded up the process, as the \n     opening sorties in the bombing campaign gave Milosveic the \n     excuse he needed to declare marital law and move rapidly in \n     order to complete what he had already begun.'' As a tragic \n     consequence, an estimated 20,000 Kosovo Albanians were \n     murdered by Serbs in the first eleven weeks of bombing, \n     compared with some 2,500 people that had died before the \n     bombing campaign. Thus, the just end NATO entered Kosovo to \n     achieve was not merely tainted, but completely undercut by \n     unjust means.\n       The United States' crusade to liberate Kuwait, along with \n     NATO's effort to free the Albanians from the torturous grip \n     of Milosevic, demonstrate two separate, but equally \n     justifiable criteria for waging war. In the case of Kuwait, \n     the Harm Principal criterion was met, as one sovereign nation \n     had harmed another, and a successful war minimized costs. But \n     in the case of Kosovo, a righteous cause was rendered unjust \n     by immoral means. The conflicts in Kuwait and Kosovo \n     demonstrate two situations in which sovereignty can be \n     justifiably violated and illustrate the necessity of just \n     means in waging war.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/10/senate-section/article/S9240-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9240-S9241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FUNERAL OF WILLIAM GRAY REYNOLDS, JR.\n\n Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, when word of Bill's passing came \nlast Wednesday, I was with my 102-year-old mother in Salisbury, NC. \nMother had met Bill on many occasions, and she shared in my great grief \nat losing such a cherished friend. As I expressed frustration over the \nunfairness of Bill's death at such an early age, mother said, \n``Elizabeth, it isn't how long you live, it's how you live.''\n  Today we pay tribute to a remarkable individual who will always stand \nfor me as a shining example of how a truly good life should be lived.\n  Each of us here probably has a different word we would use to \ndescribe Bill. Words like: Kind. Thoughtful. Caring. Humble. Strong. \nCourageous. But perhaps the word that best captures Bill is one we hear \nall too infrequently these days. That word is ``gentleman.'' Gentle \nman.\n  Webster's defines a gentleman as ``a courteous, gracious, and \nhonorable man.'' I will always define a gentleman as Bill Reynolds.\n  I first became acquainted with this gentleman when we were young \nlawyers in the Nation's capital and found ourselves on opposite sides \nof the courtroom. Bill was an assistant United States attorney, and I \nwas taking cases for indigents--those who could not afford a lawyer.\n  The Washington, DC criminal court of those days was straight out of a \nDamon Runyon novel, with colorful personalities like Racehorse \nMitchell, a criminal who brought new meaning to the term \n``recidivist,'' and Judge Buddy Beard, a jurist who brought new meaning \nto the word ``irascible.'' As I watched Bill navigate and operate in \nthis world, it didn't take me long to appreciate his honesty, his \nintegrity, his legal skills and the ever present smile on his face and \ntwinkle in his eye.\n  Bill and I became fast friends, and our experiences in the courtroom \nprovided us with a lifetime of stories and smiles. I especially \nremember the night I was unexpectedly assigned by Judge Beard to my \nfirst case, a man accused of petting a lion at the zoo, a Greek \nimmigrant who spoke no English. Mr. Marinas, after climbing into the \nlion's cage, was charged with the crime of violating a Federal law that \nsays you are not to annoy or tease the animals at the National Zoo. \nSince he would have skipped town, I had to go to trial that very \nnight--a trial I somehow won by arguing that without the lion there as \na witness, how in the world could you know whether he was annoyed or \nteased? Bill's friend, Lee Freeman, the prosecuting attorney and first \nin my class at Harvard Law School, yelled, ``But your Honor, this man \nwas found in the antelope cage just 3 weeks ago!'' I thought, uh-oh, \ntake your victory and run! Bill was in the back of the courtroom \nproviding moral support, and neither of us could drive by a zoo after \nthat experience without a lot of laughter.\n  Outside of work, Bill and I visited each other's hometowns, and I had \nthe true privilege of becoming acquainted with his parents, brother, \nsisters and extended family--and traveling with the family on many \nweekend trips. How wonderful it was to see the love that Bill's family \nhad for one another, the joy they took in each other's company, and the \ncommitment they shared to use their resources to help those in need.\n\n[[Page S9241]]\n\n  As I continued my career in Washington and Bill returned to Richmond \nto help lead Reynolds Metals Corporation, his family business, the time \nwe spent together decreased, but the admiration and respect I held for \nhim only increased. I watched with pride as Bill earned a reputation as \na respected and effective leader of his industry, and as a wise and \nmost generous philanthropist.\n  As president of the American Red Cross, I was privileged to lead an \norganization that boasts over a million volunteers and I can't think of \na one who took more joy in volunteering--and in fundraising--than Bill. \nIf there is anyone here today Bill didn't recruit to play in the annual \nRed Cross Golf Classic he founded, then you must have been hiding from \nhim! And just 3 weeks ago, 3 weeks ago, he attended the Golf Classic \nDinner. I am told he was given a hero's welcome--though he modestly \ntried to discourage it,--and that everyone was so proud to tell how he \nknew Bill, about experiences they had shared. What a testimonial to the \nlove in that room for Bill. What a testimonial to his grit! If Bill \nReynolds had an enemy, it might only be someone he had put in prison. \nBrother Randy tells of a deep-sea fishing trip off the coast of \nFlorida. One of the crew on the boat said, ``Mr. Reynolds, you don't \nremember but you sent me to jail in DC!'' Even he felt no resentment, \nthough Bill felt a little nervous the rest of the fishing trip!\n  The Bible tells us that God loves a cheerful giver--and Bill was \ntruly that--a cheerful giver.\n  Joe Dippell shared with me something very typical of Bill. When Joe's \nson, Allen, was 7 years old and the family was visiting Bill here in \nRichmond, young Allen wanted everything he saw--he wanted this toy, he \nwanted that toy. Joe kept saying ``No, Allen, no, no, no.'' Later on, \nas they left to go play golf, Bill said ``Joe, follow me in your car.'' \nAnd suddenly Joe noticed son Allen had jumped in with Bill. Soon they \npulled up to a store--Bill and Allen went in and came out loaded with \nboxes. Yes, I bet you have guessed it--Bill, with his heart of gold, \nhad bought Allen every toy he wanted.\n  As an officer of the Missionary Emergency Fund, just recently Bill \ninstigated efforts to refurbish the Reynolds Lodge in my home state--in \nMontreat, NC, a part of the religiously based Montreat Conference \nCenter, and there are so many more examples.\n  What guided Bill to do so much and to give so much to so many others? \nI believe it was love: The love Bill had for God and for his fellow \nman. In the Bible we learn that the greatest commandment is to love God \nwith all one's heart, mind, soul and strength--and secondly, to love \nothers as oneself.\n  1st Corinthians, Chapter 13, ends with the words ``Now abideth faith, \nhope, and love, these three, but the greatest of these is love.''\n  I always thought that faith would be the greatest, but I have come to \nrealize that faith is just the means to love, because, as the Bible \nsays, God is love and love is the only thing that lasts.\n  I believe Bill knew this. Whether it was law or business or \nathletics, he excelled and succeeded in everything he put his mind to. \nThere were many accomplishments Bill never told me about, though I got \nto know him soon after they occurred. The obituary in the Richmond \nTimes Dispatch mentioned all-State honors in three sports as a high \nschool athlete; captain of the University of Pennsylvania tennis and \nsquash teams; student body president at the University of Pennsylvania; \nstudent body president at UVA Law School; recipient of the Red Cross \nPhilos Award--Philanthropist of the Year. Yes, I saw the extent of \nBill's humility and modesty only after his death.\n  But he knew that it is not the honors or the prestige or the \naccomplishments that really matter. Those don't go with us into \neternity; rather, it is the acts of love, kindness, caring, \ncompassion--because God is love, those go with us.\n  There is a little book I often carry in my briefcase by Henry \nDrummond, who lived in the 1800's, in Scotland. It is called ``The \nGreatest Thing in the World''--Love.\n  In it, Drummond writes that ``just as you have seen a man of science \ntake a beam of light and pass it through a crystal prism, as you have \nseen it come out the other side of the prism broken up into its \ncomponent colors red, blue, yellow, violet, orange, and all the colors \nof the rainbow,'' so, too, in First Corinthians does the Apostle Paul \npass love through a prism, and it comes out the other side broken up \ninto nine ingredients. As we celebrate Bill's life, think about these \ncomponents listed in 1st Corinthians: Patience. Kindness. Generosity. \nHumility. Courtesy. Unselfishness. Good temper. Guilelessness. \nSincerity. Those, the Bible tells us, are the nine ingredients of love. \nAnd I know we can all agree--those are characteristics Bill Reynolds \nexhibited each and every day of his life.\n  Just as Bill provided us with an example of how to live, he also \nprovided us an example of how to die. Throughout his battle with \ncancer, there were no complaints, no bitterness, no pity parties. \nTypically, Bill was more concerned about others, and when the course of \nhis illness became clear, Randy tells me Bill apologized to his sister, \nLouise, that he would not be there to help her on projects and missions \nthey shared.\n  I especially recall a visit with Bill in Richmond last November, soon \nafter my election to the Senate. Instead of discussing his battle, Bill \nwanted to talk politics--he loved politics--and he peppered me with \nquestions about my campaign, providing me with his keen insight into \nthe issues of the day. It was a time I will always remember, and the \nmeal we shared just a few months ago in Washington, where he attended \nthe Fentriss wedding. How his family and friends will miss his wisdom, \nhis smile, and the warmth of his friendship. How this community will \nmiss his leadership. How all of us are better off for having known this \ngood and faithful gentleman.\n  The Greek poet Sophocles wrote, ``One must wait until the evening to \nsee how splendid the day has been.''\n  Although the evening of Bill's life came much too soon, it is my hope \nthat we who loved him will take solace in the fact that in his final \ndays, Bill could look back at a life filled with accomplishment, a life \nfilled with family and friends, a life filled with love, and know \nwithout a doubt that the day had indeed been splendid.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/10/senate-section/article/S9241-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN HONOR OF THE CITY OF LATHRUP VILLAGE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on Saturday July 12, 2003, in my \nhome state of Michigan, residents of the city of Lathrup Village will \ngather to celebrate the city's 50th anniversary.\n  The city of Lathrup Village is a small residential community in \nsouthern Oakland County, just north of Detroit. Its quiet, tree-line \nstreets which are full of modest brick homes are the result of \nconsiderable foresight and vision by the city's founder, Louise Lathrup \nKelley who in 1923 acquired 1,000 acres of land in Southfield Township.\n  This area, originally known as Lathrup Townsite, was incorporated as \nthe City of Lathrup village in 1953. Since then, the residents and the \ncity have carried on Louise Lathrup Kelley's vision for community-\noriented small city living.\n  What Lathrup lacks in square miles, it makes up for in heart and a \nstrong sense of community. This is evident through the success of \nevents such as Lathrup's Summer Concerts in the Park series, which the \ncity hosts for residents throughout the summer months. Residents have \nalso created the Children's Garden in the city park, where children \nlearn a wide range of skills including how to grow vegetables and the \ndelicate art of raising butterflies.\n  From July 11th to 13th of this year, the Lathrup Village community \nwill be commemorating the city's 50th anniversary with a weekend full \nof celebration. It is sure to be a wonderful series of events that will \nfurther solidify the feeling of community that residents there have \nenjoyed for over five decades.\n  I know my Senate colleagues will join me in congratulating the city \nof Lathrup Village on this important milestone. I am proud to represent \nthis spirited city, and wish them many more years of success and \nprosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/10/senate-section/article/S9241-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9241-S9242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:32 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks,\n\n[[Page S9242]]\n\nannounced that the House has passed the following bills, in which it \nrequests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 438.

A bill to amend titles 10 and 14, United States Code, to \nprovide for the use of gold in the metal content of the Medal of Honor; \nto the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, today I introduce a bill that would help \ngive our most highly honored veterans a medal more worthy of their \nbravery and sacrifice by requiring the use of 90 percent gold in the \nCongressional Medal of Honor instead of gold-plated brass, as is \ncurrently used.\n  The Congressional Medal of Honor is the highest award our country \nbestows for valor in action against an enemy force. These are ordinary \nsoldiers who performed extraordinary deeds in battle, often giving what \nPresident Lincoln termed ``the final full measure'' in doing so.\n  This is the medal won by Marine Corps pilot, Captain Joe Foss, who in \nless than 30 days of combat over Guadalcanal, shot down 23 enemy \nplanes, three in one engagement, and is credited with turning-back an \nentire Japanese bombing mission before it could drop a single bomb.\n  This is the medal won by Army Private Edward Moskala who set aside \nhis personal safety one night on the Island of Okinawa to assault two \nmachine gun nests, provide cover for his unit as it withdrew, and \nrescue fallen comrades amidst a hail of enemy fire before finally \nsuffering a mortal wound.\n  This is the medal won by Pharmacist's Mate First Class Francis \nPierce, Jr., who on the island of Iwo Jima exposed himself repeatedly \nto enemy fire to save the lives of Marines he accompanied, traversing \nopen terrain to rescue comrades and assaulting enemy positions that \nendangered his wounded comrades.\n  This is the medal won by Marine Corps Second Lieutenant Robert Dale \nReem, who on the night of November 6, 1950, after leading three \nseparate assaults on an enemy position in the vicinity of Chinhung-ni, \nKorea, threw himself on top of an enemy grenade that landed amidst his \nmen.\n  This is the medal won by Air Force Captain Hilliard A. Wilbanks who \nmade repeated strafing runs over an advancing enemy element near Dalat, \nRepublic of Vietnam on February 24, 1967. Captain Wilbanks' aircraft, \nit should be noted, was neither armed nor armored. He made the assaults \nby sticking his rifle out the window and flying low over the enemy. His \naction saved the lives of friendly forces, but it cost him his own.\n  The feats that earned these medals are the stuff of legend. But they \nare not legends. They are actual deeds that inspire humility and \ngratitude in all of us. In bestowing the Congressional Medal of Honor, \nthe president enrolls the recipient in a sacred club of heroes.\n  Regrettably, the medal itself, though gold in color, is actually \nbrass plated with gold. It costs only about $30 to craft the award \nitself. I will be the first to tell you that the value of the \nCongressional Medal of Honor is not in the metal content of the award, \nbut in the deeds done to earn it. But if you compare the $30 we invest \nin this, our Nation's highest award for valor, with the $30,000 \nCongressional medals presented to foreign dignitaries, famous singers, \nand other civilians, you will agree that we can do better.\n  Put simply, this legislation will forge a medal more worthy of the \nesteem with which the nation holds those few who have earned the \nCongressional Medal of Honor through valor and heroism beyond compare.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objections, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1386\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. GOLD CONTENT FOR MEDAL OF HONOR.\n\n       (a) Requirement for Gold Content.--Sections 3741, 6241, and \n     8741 of title 10, United States Code, and section 491 of \n     title 14, United States Code, are each amended by inserting \n     ``the metal content of which is 90 percent gold and 10 \n     percent alloy and'' after ``appropriate design,''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply with respect to any award of the Medal of Honor \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 1388. A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \nreplace the Federal Election Commission with the Federal Election \nAdministration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, last year, Congress took the important \nstep of restoring the health and integrity of our campaign finance \nsystem when it enacted the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, \nBCRA. However, the Federal Election Commission, FEC, has continually \nacted as a bureaucratic barrier to reform of the system. Time and time \nagain, these unelected officials of the FEC have thwarted the \nenforcement of the Nation's campaign finance laws in deference to the \npartisan wishes of those who have appointed them.\n  Along with Senator Feingold, I rise today to introduce legislation \nentitled the Federal Election Administration Act of 2003. This \nlegislation creates a new independent agency, the Federal Election \nAdministration, FEA, which replaces the Federal Election Commission in \norder to create a new system that finally enforces Federal campaign \nfinance laws.\n  Although it was set up to administer and enforce the Federal campaign \nfinance laws, the FEC has not been doing its job. The FEC is a weak and \nfailing agency, structured by Congress to be slow and ineffective, \ncomposed of commissioners whose appointments are tightly controlled by \nthe Members of Congress and political parties they regulate, and has \nbeen impeded by a continual lack of resources. This legislation \nreplaces the current system with a more effective campaign finance \nenforcement system.\n  In its current form, the FEC has been faced with three major \nproblems. The first problem has been that the FEC was structured by \nCongress to be ineffective.\n  Prior to the creation of the FEC, Members of Congress feared that \nthis proposed enforcement agency ran the risk of becoming too powerful. \nTo ease these fears, Congress structured an agency designed to fail \nfrom the start. The FEC has six members, no more than three of whom can \nbe members of the same political party. In practice, this has meant \nthat there have been three Republicans and three Democrats as \ncommissioners. Only stalemate and inaction on key issues have resulted. \nOn important issues the votes have often been cast on a partisan basis, \nresulting in 3-3 deadlocks. Furthermore, the affirmative votes of four \nmembers are necessary for the FEC to act. Therefore, 3-3 ties have led \nto inaction.\n  Partisanship has encroached upon nearly every major decision the \nFEC's six commissioners make. These partisan standoffs have stopped the \nFEC from enforcing actions against politicians and special interest \ngroups, even when the FEC's general counsel has recommended that such \nenforcement proceed. FEC votes have been politicized to the point where \ncommissioners of both parties have banded together to reject their \nstaff's enforcement recommendations to serve the special interests of \nboth parties.\n  The FEC has lacked important powers. The FEC cannot make its own \nfindings that a violation occurred, cannot seek court injunctions to \nstop illegal activity, and cannot conduct random audits of campaigns. \nThe FEC cannot directly impose penalties, except in very minor matters. \nIn short, the FEC can do little to enforce the law. Compounding this \nproblem is that the FEC has sole jurisdiction over all enforcement of \ncampaign finance laws. No matter how slow the FEC's proceedings are, no \none can seek civil enforcement of the law through the courts. All \ncomplaints must be filed\n\n[[Page S9247]]\n\nwith the FEC and only the FEC has the authority to act on them.\n  This legislation addresses this first problem. First, the new Federal \nElection Administration will consist of only three members to remove \nthe possibility of deadlocked votes. There is a Chairman and two \nadditional members, all of whom are appointed by the President with the \nadvice and consent of the Senate. The Chairman will serve a term of ten \nyears and will have broad powers to manage and administer the agency, \nincluding the power to hire the staff director and general counsel, and \nto set the budget for the agency. The two other members will each serve \nsix year terms and cannot come from the same political party.\n  In the FEA, enforcement proceedings for violations of campaign \nfinance laws will be conducted before impartial administrative law \njudges, similar to those in agencies such as the SEC and the EPA. An \nadministrative law judge, ALJ, will conduct an enforcement proceeding \nafter the three-member FEA, by majority vote, makes an initial \ndetermination to pursue an enforcement action. The FEA general counsel \nwill represent the FEA in enforcement proceedings. The ALJ will have \nthe authority to make findings of fact and reach conclusions of law. \nThe general counsel and any respondent will have the right to appeal an \nALJ decision to the FEA. The decision of the FEA regarding such an \nappeal will constitute final agency action and be subject to judicial \nreview. By using ALJs, a system would be established for real \nenforcement not subject to partisan pressure.\n  An ALJ will have the authority to find that violations of law have \noccurred, and to impose civil penalties and issue cease and desist \norders, subject to an appeal to the FEA. The decision by the FEA \nregarding such an appeal will be final agency action and be subject to \njudicial review. The FEA will have the authority to apply to a federal \ndistrict court for a temporary restraining order or preliminary \ninjunction to prevent violations of law that would result in \nsubstantial harm to the public interest. The FEA will also have the \nauthority to conduct a limited number of random audits of campaign \ncommittees.\n  Unlike the FEC, the FEA will have real authority to act in a timely \nand effective way to function as a real enforcement agency.\n  The second problem with the FEC is that the commissioners appointed \nto the FEC have been chosen based on their political allegiances rather \nthan their qualifications and commitment to administer and enforce the \nlaw. As a result of this process, the FEC is a highly politicized \nagency beholden to the interests of federal officeholders and party \nleaders who name the commissioners and the campaign finance community \nthe agency is supposed to regulate.\n  FEC commissioner nominations are supposed to originate with the \nPresident and be confirmed by the Senate, but Congress really has the \ncontrol over who is nominated. Nominees to the FEC are selected by \nparty leaders in Congress and made official by the White House. Where \nthe President has objected to a choice promoted by Congress, the \ncongressional leaders have insisted on their nominees, and have usually \nwon. Another issue is that few FEC commissioners have a background in \nenforcing laws. Most have come from the community that the FEC \noversees--Congress, the political parties, and those in the campaign \nfinance system.\n\n  An example of the disproportionate control Congress has over FEC \nappointments was shown by the appointment of Bradley A. Smith in 2000 \nas a commissioner. The Smith case showed that an avowed opponent of the \ncampaign finance laws--someone who had called the laws unconstitutional \nand urged their repeal--could be forced onto the FEC by his Senate \nsponsors over the objection of the President, who nevertheless \nnominated him. Despite resistance, President Clinton named Smith to the \nFEC after Senate Republican leaders insisted on the nomination. The \nfurther inappropriateness of Smith serving on the FEC was shown when in \nFebruary 2002 he actively participated in the efforts in the House of \nRepresentative by reform opponents to kill campaign finance reform \nlegislation. Smith joined with another FEC member who also opposed \ncampaign finance laws. The two commissioners inserted themselves into \nthe fight during House consideration of the Shays-Meehan campaign \nfinance reform bill by helping House Republican leaders work to defeat \nthe bill.\n  Clearly, the fact that FEC commissioners have become so publicly \npartisan in the policy debates on the election laws places in doubt the \nFEC's ability to credible enforce the law when its own commissioners \nopenly denigrate the validity of those laws.\n  This legislation addresses this second problem by the following \nmeans. An individual may not be appointed to the new Federal Election \nAdministration if he or she is serving or has served as a member of the \nFEC subject to a term limit or during the four previous years, was a \ncandidate or elected officeholder, an officer, employee or attorney of \na candidate, officeholder or political party, or employed in certain \nexecutive branch positions. Such strict criteria on who may be \nappointed to the FEA would provide the best opportunity for obtaining \nhighly qualified and publicly credible and unbiased individuals to \neffectively and impartially enforce the campaign finance laws.\n  The last major problem with the FEC is that Congress has constantly \nabused its budget and oversight authority over the FEC. Time and time \nagain, Congress has cut its budget. This legislation addresses this \nproblem by having the budget of the new Federal Election Administration \nestablished by Congress based on a budget request prepared by its \nchairman and submitted directly to Congress. The General Accounting \nOffice, GAO, will conduct periodic studies of the funding for the new \nFEA and submit recommendations to Congress on the level of funding \nnecessary to provide adequate resources for the FEA to fulfill its \nduties. Unlike the FEC, the new agency will have the means to ensure \nthat it will receive the adequate resources to effectively enforce the \ncampaign finance laws.\n  In conclusion, the fact that FEC commissioners were never able to \nfind significant campaign finance violations by federal candidates and \ntheir political parties in the Democratic and Republican campaign \nfinance abuses that occurred in the 1996 elections--especially in the \nabuses of President Bill Clinton, his campaign officials and his \npolitical party--is the classic example of the problems with the FEC. \nFurthermore, when Congress enacted the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act \nof 2002, BCRA, the FEC undermined this new law by issuing regulations \nto implement BCRA that seriously weakened the law's main provisions. \nBoth examples highlight the FEC's history of failure as an oversight \nand enforcement agency and the need for its overhaul. Effective \nenforcement is essential for laws such as BCRA to work in the long run, \nand achieving that requires the establishment of a new system to \nenforce campaign finance laws.\n  With the establishment of this new Federal Election Administration to \nreplace the FEC as a more effective enforcement agency, the campaign \nfinance laws will now finally be taken seriously by candidates, \nparties, donors, and the public. Once this new agency is set up, the \nregulated community will comply with campaign finance laws because \nthose laws can no longer be violated without punishment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I am pleased to join with my partner \nin reform, the senior Senator from Arizona, to introduce the Federal \nElection Administration Act of 2003. When the Bipartisan Campaign \nReform Act was signed into law, Senator McCain and I and \nRepresentatives Shays and Meehan said we would continue our partnership \nto make sure that the law we passed is properly enforced. Much of what \nwe tried to do in BCRA was caused by failures of the federal Election \nCommission to enforce the law. In particular, the soft money loophole \nwas created by FEC rulings in the late 70s and early 80s, and \nexacerbated by failures to stop the wholesale evasion of the law in the \n90s.\n  We wanted to give the FEC a fair chance to implement the new law. In \nBCRA itself, we provided deadlines for promulgating regulations so \nparties, candidates, and outside groups would know and understand the \nnew rules of the game by the time the new law went into effect the day \nafter the last election. We participated in those rulemakings \nthroughout last summer\n\n[[Page S9248]]\n\nand fall, giving the FEC our very best effort to answer questions that \nwere raised about the meaning and effect of BCRA.\n  The FEC met the deadlines, but not our expectations. Time after time, \nthe FEC opened loopholes or potential loopholes rather than trying to \nfaithfully discern the intent of the law. It acted as a super \nlegislature, substituting its policy judgments for those of the \nCongress.\n  So the seeds of the bill that we are introducing today were sown in \nthe weeks and months following enactment of the McCain-Feingold/Shays-\nMeehan bill. After careful consideration, it is our judgment that the \ncurrent structure of the FEC cannot meet the challenges of enforcing \nthe election laws in the 21st century. A new start is needed, and this \nis a good time to do it, with the recent enactment of BCRA and a \npresidential election just around the corner.\n  In this bill, we replace the FEC with a new agency, the Federal \nElection Administration. The FEA will continue performing the reporting \nand disclosure function of the FEC in largely the same way. With \nrespect to enforcement, we have followed the model of other successful \nregulatory agencies such as the EPA, the NLRB, and the SEC. The new \nFederal Election Administration will have a strong Chair and a corps of \nAdministrative Law Judges to adjudicate complaints that the \nAdministration's professional staff will bring. The new agency will \nhave the power to determine violations of the election laws and assess \npenalties, subject, of course, to judicial review.\n  Our bill envisions a smaller body than the FEC, three members instead \nof six, with an odd number of members to try to avoid the gridlock that \nthe current equal number of Democratic and Republican Commissioners \nallows and even encourages. The Chair will have a ten-year term to \nencourage independence. The other members of the FEA will have \nstaggered six-year terms. Our hope is that the new agency will not be \nthe captive of the political parties, but instead, led by a strong and \nindependent Chair, will be the respected watchdog that the American \npeople want to see.\n  It is sad when the agency charged with enforcing the election laws is \njokingly referred to as the Failure to Enforce Commission. The American \npeople urged Congress to enact the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act and \nthey support it now. They want to see candidates and parties abide by \nit and by punished if they don't. This new agency will provide a new \nand better structure for achieving that goal. I want to thank my friend \nSenator McCain for all of this work on campaign finance reform over the \nlast eight years, and I look forward to working closely with him again \nto pass this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 1389. A bill to authorize appropriations for the Surface \nTransportation Board for fiscal years 2004 through 2008, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by Senator \nHollings in introducing a bipartisan bill to reauthorize the Surface \nTransportation Board, STB, for five years.\n  The STB is an independent agency established January 1, 1996, as the \nsuccessor to the Interstate Commerce Commission. It is responsible for \nthe economic regulation of interstate surface transportation, primarily \nrailroads. The STB's mission is to ensure that competitive, efficient, \nand safe transportation services are provided to meet the needs of \nshippers, receivers, and consumers. The agency has remained \nunauthorized since the end of fiscal year 1998, despite efforts by the \nSenate Commerce Committee to pass reauthorization legislation.\n  The Surface Transportation Board Reauthorization Act of 2003 would \nreauthorize the STB for fiscal years 2004 through 2008 and provide \nsufficient resources to ensure the Board is able to continue to carry \nout its responsibilities. Specifically, the legislation would authorize \n$20.5 million for fiscal year 2004, rising to $23.5 million in fiscal \nyear 2008. In fiscal year 2006, the legislation would authorize a \nhigher appropriation, totaling $23.8 million, to cover the estimated \ncosts that will be incurred to physically relocate the STB's offices. \nThe legislation also proposes that the Board's Chairmanship position be \nsubject to Senate confirmation, similar to other Boards and Commissions \nthroughout the federal government, including the National \nTransportation Safety Board, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, \nthe Export-Import Bank, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n  I know that some of my colleagues, including several members of the \nSenate Commerce Committee, are interested in considering more sweeping \nlegislation to amend the Staggers Rail Act, the landmark 1980 \nlegislation that partially deregulated the freight railroads. As I have \nstated on numerous occasions, rail service and rail shipper issues \nwarrant serious consideration. These matters have been the subject of \nmany hearings before the Senate Commerce Committee, and Senator \nHutchison will chair a Subcommittee hearing on captive shipper issues \nin the coming weeks. If a consensus is reached on other reforms needed \nto protect shippers and the public, additional legislation may be \nforthcoming from the Commerce Committee.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in moving this bill \nthrough the legislative process in the weeks ahead. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1389\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; AMENDMENT OF TITLE 49.\n\n       (a)  Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Surface \n     Transportation Board Reauthorization Act of 2003''.\n       (b) Amendment of Title 49.--Except as otherwise expressly \n     provided, whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal is \n     expressed in terms of an amendment to, or a repeal of, a \n     section or other provision, the reference shall be considered \n     to be made to a section or other provision of title 49, \n     United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION LEVELS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the Surface \n     Transportation Board $20,516,000 for fiscal year 2004, \n     $21,215,000 for fiscal year 2005, $23,770,000 for fiscal year \n     2006, $22,564,000 for fiscal year 2007, and $23,488,000 for \n     fiscal year 2008.\n\n     SEC. 3. CHAIRMAN DESIGNATED WITH SENATE CONFIRMATION.\n\n       Section 701(c)(1) is amended by striking ``President'' and \n     inserting ``president, by and with the advice and consent of \n     the Senate,''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 1392. A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch \nAct to improve the nutrition of students served under child nutrition \nprograms; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Crapo, and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 1393. A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch \nAct to reauthorize and expand the fruit and vegetable pilot program; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, no one can doubt that kids today face \ntremendous obstacles to eating right and making healthy choices.\n  Every day, they are bombarded with dozens of advertisements enticing \nthem to eat more and more unhealthy foods. Tens of billions of dollars \nare spent each year to convince our kids to buy the products. In the \nface of this advertising and marketing power, our efforts to help kids \neat healthier are more important than ever.\n  This is no less the case in our schools than elsewhere in society. \nEven in our schools, it's getting harder and harder to ensure that kids \nget healthy food. The sale of soda pop, candy, foods high in fat and \nlow in nutritional value, commonly called junk food, has become an \naccepted, but still unacceptable, reality in American schools. \nBallooning sales of soft drinks and candy in our schools undercut the \n$15 billion dollar investment our nation makes in child nutrition every \nyear.\n  I still believe that, given the chance, our kids can and will make \ngood choices about the foods they eat. We just don't give them these \nchoices.\n  To test this hypothesis that, given the opportunity, kids would make \ngood choices about the food they eat, I proposed and got adopted in the \nFarm Security and Rural Investment Act of\n\n[[Page S9249]]\n\n2002 a pilot program that provides grants to schools for the simple \npurpose of allowing them to use the money to purchase fresh fruits and \nvegetables for their students. Some schools use the grants to deliver \nbins of fruits and vegetables to their classrooms every day. Others set \nup kiosks in the halls. A few schools even put free fruits and \nvegetables in their vending machines.\n  Not long ago the Department of Agriculture released its assessment of \nthe pilot program. Not surprisingly, it received high marks. Schools \nreported that 98 percent of students were interested in the program. \nSchools also reported that, over the course of the program, 71 percent \nof students grew more, not less, interested in the program. Most \nimportantly, students told program evaluators that the pilot made them \nmuch more conscious about the junk food that they eat.\n  Over the course of the year my staff and I visited numerous schools \nin Iowa that participated in the pilot program. These visits simply \nconfirmed what USDA reported in its report on the pilot program. The \nenthusiasm was incredible. Students loved it. Teachers loved it. \nAdministrators loved it. Parents loved it. When I visited Harding \nMiddle School in Des Moines at the end of May, just as the pilot \nprogram was coming to an end, they gave me one message loud and clear--\n``keep the fruits and vegetables coming.''\n  Today I am introducing legislation, S. 1392, to do just that and to \nexpand the program to all 50 States.\n  Under this legislation, the pilot program would expand from its \ncurrent 4 states and tribal schools and 60,000 students to 50 states \nand over 1 million children. It would also expand the pilot to ensure \nthat additional Indian tribal schools are able to participate in the \nprogram.\n  It would do this at a reasonable price tag--only $75 dollars per \nstudent per year. This means that at a cost of just over $75 million \nper year, we can make fresh fruits and vegetables a constant presence \nin the life of over 1 million American schoolchildren. It is difficult \nfor me to imagine a more effective use of taxpayer dollars.\n  Today I am also introducing companion legislation, S. 1393, to the \nfruit and vegetable pilot program expansion. The first piece of \nlegislation seeks to provide kids with healthier food, and the second \ncomplements that by improving the overall nutritional environment of \nAmerican schools. It seeks to give kids more choices and the ability to \nchoose healthy foods.\n  Despite the fact that we invest over $15 billion annually in child \nnutrition, our nation's children still too often do not get good \nnutrition at their schools. Meals provided through the National School \nLunch Program and the School Breakfast Program must meet nutritional \nstandards. But there is far too much competition and interference with \nthese balanced meals. Vending machines, school snack bars, and a la \ncarte sales routinely provide kids with a wide variety of less healthy \nchoices.\n  A recent GAO report found that 43 percent of elementary schools, 74 \npercent of middle schools, and 98 percent of high schools have vending \nmachines, snack bars, canteens, and other places where students can \nreadily obtain foods that defeat the sound and balanced nutrition that \nchildren and adolescents need.\n  We talk about the importance of giving our kids lots of choices, but \nas junk foods become the norm and displace more nutritious choices, are \nwe giving kids more choices or less? I believe we should always provide \nkids with good tasting and healthy alternatives to the foods that \nprovide almost no nutritional benefits. The bills that I'm introducing \ntoday provide schools and students with more choices, not less. I want \nto make sure that the kids in Iowa schools and other schools across the \ncountry will be able to choose foods that both taste great and are \ngreat for their health and nutrition.\n  The omnipresence of junk food is one of the reasons that our society \nis confronting a lethal threat--obesity. Obesity is even more \npronounced among our children. According to the Centers for Disease \nControl, in the year 2000, 64 percent of all Americans were classified \nas either overweight or obese. Of these, 30 percent were actually \nobese. Among kids, the problem of obesity is exploding. In the last 20 \nyears, the number of overweight kids tripled.\n  This is nothing short of a public health crisis. It's past time to \nget serious about fighting obesity and we must fight obesity first at \nits root--childhood--where children learn habits that stay with them \nfor life.\n  A recent article in the journal Health Affairs estimated the cost of \nobesity to our nation at $93 billion annually. That is nearly a tenth \nof annual health care spending. Incredibly, obesity costs our society \nabout as much as smoking.\n  In response to the health threats our kids face at schools, many \nschools across the country are taking matters into their own hands. \nSome are providing healthier choices in their vending machines, school \nsnack bars, and a la carte sales. In Iowa, with support from the milk \nindustry, selected schools are working to replace soft drinks with \nmilk. The results are encouraging. Schools report that students are \nenthusiastic about these changes. It just goes to show that not only \nare students willing to accept healthier choices like fresh fruit and \nvegetables and milk, but that they actively want them.\n  We also know that schools have benefited financially and \nnutritionally from expanding the choices available to their children.\n  Faced with alarming statistics about childhood overweight and obesity \nrates, North Community High School in Minneapolis reevaluated the \nschool's beverage vending practices. With the support of the \nadministrative team, the principal contacted the district's Coca-Cola \nrepresentative, who was willing to work with North to provide healthier \nchoices. As a result, the school increased the number of machines from \nfour to 16, stocked 13 machines with water or 100 percent fruit/\nvegetable juice, stocked two machines with sports drinks, and limited \nsoda to one machine with limited hours of sale. They also instituted a \ncompetitive pricing system, selling water for $.75, sports drinks and \n100 percent fruit/vegetable juices for $1.00, and soda and fruit \ndrinks, e.g., Fruitopia, for $1.25. The water machines are \nstrategically placed in high traffic areas and students are now allowed \nto drink water in the classroom. Soda sales are down, but vending \nprofits increased by almost $4,000 and the total number of cases of \nbeverages has more than doubled from the previous school year, with \nwater being the best seller.\n  These are the kinds of efforts and innovations that we need to \nencourage and support. That is why the second bill that I am \nintroducing today creates a competitive incentive grant program to \nschools to improve the overall nutritional atmosphere in schools. Under \nthis program, the Secretary of Agriculture makes competitive grants to \nschools so that they can provide healthier vending alternatives, \nimprove the nutritional quality of their school meals, promote the \nconsumption of fruits and vegetables, and provide nutrition education.\n  With this support, other schools can follow in the footsteps of \nschools like North Community High School and institute practices that \nare good for the school and good for the students.\n  Because we know that success in this area requires the leadership and \ncommitment of a broad range of stakeholders, this bill gives a \npreference to schools that can demonstrate a multi-sectoral approach \nand engage the efforts of parents, businesses, and anyone else with a \nvested interest in the nutrition and educational success of our \nstudents. It also gives priority to applications that include a plan \nfor continued success once their federal grant money has been expended.\n  Finally, the legislation uses sound science, not special interests, \nto determine what kinds of nutritional standards our elementary, middle \nschools, and secondary schools should institute. To achieve this, my \nlegislation directs the Secretary of Agriculture to enter into an \nagreement with the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of \nSciences, one of the premier scientific institutions in this country. \nThe Institute of Medicine is directed to study the issue of children's \nnutritional needs at school and to make recommendations to the \nSecretary of Agriculture regarding appropriate standards for the sale \nof all foods in our schools.\n\n[[Page S9250]]\n\n  Based upon the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine, the \nSecretary is directed to promulgate regulations that will provide \nappropriate and adequate safeguards for the nutrition of our children \nat school.\n  Taken together, the two pieces of legislation that I am introducing \ntoday represent a new chapter in our nation's efforts to provide for \nthe health and safety of our kids. This body has a long history of \nbipartisan efforts on child nutrition and, with our child nutrition \nprograms up for reauthorization this year, I have every reason to \nbelieve that these efforts will continue this year. Having served on \nthe Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, I know \nthat the issue of child nutrition knows no partisan boundaries. \nDemocrats and Republicans alike have joined together over the years. I \ninvite my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in \ncosponsoring this legislation to give kids the healthy choices they \nwant and deserve and to safeguard the nutrition of our nation's \nchildren. If ever our children have been in greater need of this \nsupport, I cannot remember it, and so I invite my colleagues to join me \nin this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bills be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1392\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 15. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States to make eligible for the Office of \nPresident a person who has been a United States citizen for 20 years; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Equal \nOpportunity to Govern'' Amendment, which would amend the Constitution \nto permit any person who has been a United States citizen for at least \n20 years to be eligible for the Office of President. The Constitution, \nin its current form, prohibits a person who is not a native born \ncitizen of the United States from becoming President.\n  The purpose of the native born citizen requirement has long passed, \nand it is time for us--the elected representatives of this Nation or \nimmigrants--to remove this impediment. While there was scant debate on \nthis provision during the Constitutional Convention, it is apparent \nthat the decision to include the natural born citizen requirement in \nour Constitution was driven largely by the concern that a European \nmonarch, such as King George III's second son, the Duke of York, might \nbe imported to rule the United States.\n  This restriction has become an anachronism that is decidedly un-\nAmerican. Consistent with our democratic form of government, our \ncitizens should have every opportunity to choose their leaders free of \nunreasonable limitations. Indeed, no similar restriction bars other \ncritical members of government, including the Senate, the House of \nRepresentatives, the Supreme Court, or the President's most trusted \ncabinet officials.\n  Ours is a Nation of immigrants. The history of the United States is \nreplete with scores of great and patriotic Americans whose dedication \nto this country is beyond reproach, but who happen to have been born \noutside of Her borders. These include former secretaries of state Henry \nKissinger and Madeleine Albright; current Cabinet members Secretary of \nLabor Elaine L. Chao and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Mel \nMartinez; as well as Jennifer Granholm, the Governor of Michigan and \nbring young star\n\n[[Page S9252]]\n\nof the Democratic party. As our Constitution reads today, none of these \nwell-qualified, patriotic United States citizens could be a lawful \ncandidate for President.\n  Perhaps most disturbing is that the scores of foreign-born men and \nwomen who have risked their lives defending the freedoms and liberties \nof this great nation who remain ineligible for the Office of President. \nMore than 700 recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor--our \nNation's highest decoration for valor--have been immigrants. But no \nmatter how great their sacrifice, leadership, or love for this country, \nthey remain ineligible to be a candidate for President. This amendment \nwould remove this unfounded inequity.\n  Today I ask the members of this body if we desire to continue to \ninvite these brave men and women to defend this Nation's liberty, to \nprotect Her flag, to be willing to pay the ultimate sacrifice, and yet \ndeny them the opportunity to strive for the ultimate American dream--to \nbecome our President? I respectfully submit that we should not.\n  My proposal to amend the Constitution is not one I take lightly. As \nour founding fathers envisioned, our Constitution has stood the test of \ntime. It has remained largely intact for more than 200 years due to the \ncareful, deliberative, and principled approach of the framers. This is \ntruly an extraordinary achievement. On a few appropriate occasions, \nhowever, we have generated the will to surmount the cumbersome, but no \ndoubt necessary, hurdles to amend the Constitution.

IN APPRECIATION OF OUR ARMED FORCES AND REGARDING \n                   RESTORING STABILITY AND SECURITY IN IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States, with the support of forces from \n     Great Britain and other countries, historically and \n     courageously liberated Iraq in three weeks;\n       (2) Conditions on the ground in parts of Iraq continue to \n     pose a grave threat to American troops, thereby complicating \n     efforts to restore law and order and essentially public \n     services for Iraqis and these efforts are further complicated \n     by the absence of effective communications with the Iraqi \n     people;\n       (3) Ultimately, maintaining law and order in Iraq and \n     preserving its territorial integrity will require the \n     creation of a professionally trained Iraqi police force and a \n     reformed Iraqi military but that will take a significant \n     amount of time and in the meantime international armed forces \n     and police must assume these responsibilities;\n       (4) Approximately 145,000 U.S. troops are currently \n     deployed in Iraq, meaning that American troops comprise \n     roughly 90% of Coalition forces, and even if, as the \n     Department of Defense has stated, an additional 10,000 \n     international troops join the Coalition effort in Iraq by \n     September, Americans will still comprise roughly 85% of \n     Coalition forces;\n       (5) Maintaining the existing force level in Iraq currently \n     requires $3.9 billion each month;\n       (6) The Department of Defense has stated that it will \n     require one year to train a new Iraqi Army of 12,000 soldiers \n     and three years to train 40,000 soldiers;\n       (7) The Coalition Provisional Authority has stated that it \n     will require at least one year to recruit and train a police \n     force of 40,000 officers capable of assuming minimal policy \n     functions in Iraq, that it will require five years to recruit \n     and train a full force of 75,000 officers, and that at least \n     5500 additional international police are needed to train, \n     assist and jointly patrol with the existing Iraqi police \n     force;\n       (8) President Bush has noted that ``The rise of Iraq, as an \n     example of moderation and democracy and prosperity, is a \n     massive and long-term undertaking,'' and it is clear that \n     increasing the number of troops and police from countries \n     other than the United States will reduce risks to American \n     soldiers and the financial cost to the United States;\n       (9) Secretary Rumsfeld testified that ``We certainly want \n     assistance from NATO and from NATO countries'' and it is \n     clear that involving the North Atlantic Organization, as is \n     being done in Afghanistan and has been done in Kosovo and \n     Bosnia, allows the Coalition to maintain a robust military \n     presence while decreasing the exposure and risk to American \n     troops; and\n       (10) Rebuilding Iraq's neglected infrastructure and economy \n     and administering Iraq--including providing basic services \n     and paying public sector salaries--is likely to require tens \n     of billions of dollars over several years and projected Iraqi \n     oil revenues will be insufficient to meet these costs.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that\n       (1) It is in the national security interests of the United \n     States to remain engaged in Iraq in order to ensure a \n     peaceful, stable, unified Iraq with a representative \n     government;\n       (2) The President should request formally and expeditiously \n     that NATO raise a force for deployment in post-war Iraq \n     similar to what it has done in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Kosovo \n     and the Congress urges NATO allies and other nations to \n     provide troops and police to Coalition efforts in Iraq.\n       (3) The President should call on the United Nations to urge \n     its member states to provide military forces and civilian \n     police to promote stability and security in Iraq and \n     resources to help rebuild and administer Iraq.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1191.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Syria Accountability Act \n     of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 1002. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 \n     (September 28, 2001) mandates that all states ``refrain from \n     providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities \n     or persons involved in terrorist acts'', take ``the necessary \n     steps to prevent the commission of terrorist acts'', and \n     ``deny safe haven to those who finance, plan, support, or \n     commit terrorist acts''.\n       (2) The Government of Syria is currently prohibited by \n     United States law from receiving United States assistance \n     because it is listed as a state sponsor of terrorism.\n       (3) Although the Secretary of State lists Syria as a state \n     sponsor of terrorism and reports that Syria provides ``safe \n     haven and support to several terrorist groups'', fewer United \n     States sanctions apply with respect to Syria than with \n     respect to any other country that the Secretary lists as a \n     state sponsor of terrorism.\n       (4) Terrorist groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, the \n     Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the \n     Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General \n     Command, maintain offices, training camps, and other \n     facilities on Syrian territory and operate in areas of \n     Lebanon occupied by the Syrian armed forces and receive \n     supplies from Iran through Syria.\n       (5) United Nations Security Council Resolution 520 \n     (September 17, 1982) calls for ``strict respect of the \n     sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and political \n     independence of Lebanon under the sole and exclusive \n     authority of the Government of Lebanon through the Lebanese \n     Army throughout Lebanon''.\n       (6) More than 20,000 Syrian troops and security personnel \n     occupy much of the sovereign territory of Lebanon, thereby \n     exerting undue influence upon its government and undermining \n     its political independence.\n       (7) Since 1990 the Senate and House of Representatives have \n     passed seven bills and resolutions calling for the withdrawal \n     of Syrian armed forces from Lebanon.\n       (8) Large and increasing numbers of the Lebanese people \n     from across the political spectrum in Lebanon have mounted \n     peaceful and democratic calls for the withdrawal of the \n     Syrian Army from Lebanese soil.\n       (9) Israel has withdrawn all of its armed forces from \n     Lebanon in accordance with United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 425 (March 19, 1978), as certified by the United \n     Nations Secretary General.\n       (10) Even in the face of this United Nations certification \n     that acknowledged Israel's full compliance with Resolution \n     425, Syria permits attacks by Hizballah and other militant \n     organizations on Israeli outposts at Shebaa Farms, under the \n     false guise that it remains Lebanese land. Syria also permits \n     attacks on civilian targets in Israel.\n       (11) Syria will not allow Lebanon, a sovereign country, to \n     fulfill its obligation in accordance with Security Council \n     Resolution 425 to deploy its troops to southern Lebanon.\n       (12) As a result, the Israeli-Lebanese border and much of \n     southern Lebanon is under the control of Hizballah, which \n     continues to attack Israeli positions and allows Iranian \n     Revolutionary Guards and other militant groups to operate \n     freely in the area, destabilizing the entire region.\n       (13) The United States provides $40,000,000 in assistance \n     to the Lebanese people through private nongovernmental \n     organizations, $7,900,000 of which is provided to Lebanese-\n     American educational institutions.\n       (14) In the State of the Union address on January 29, 2002, \n     President George W. Bush declared that the United States will \n     ``work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and \n     their state sponsors the materials, technology, and expertise \n     to make and deliver weapons of mass destruction''.\n       (15) The Government of Syria continues to develop and \n     deploy short- and medium-range ballistic missiles.\n       (16) The Government of Syria is pursuing the development \n     and production of biological and chemical weapons.\n       (17) United Nations Security Council Resolution 661 (August \n     6, 1990) and subsequent relevant resolutions restrict the \n     sale of oil and other commodities by Iraq, except to the \n     extent authorized by other relevant resolutions.\n       (18) Syrian President Bashar Assad promised the Secretary \n     of State in February 2001 to end violations of Security \n     Council Resolution 661 but this pledge has not been \n     fulfilled.\n       (19) In direct violation of United Nations Sanctions, Syria \n     has been importing 200,000 barrels of Iraqi oil on a daily \n     basis since 2000, which has provided Iraq with up to \n     $1,200,000,000 annually.\n       (20) There are reports that Syria is pursuing the \n     development of chemical weapons, such as VX and Sarin, and is \n     harboring fugitive Iraqi officials.\n       (21) On April 20, 2003, President Bush said there were \n     positive signs that Syria will cooperate on the issue of \n     harboring fugitive Iraqi officials.\n\n     SEC. 1003. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Government of Syria should immediately and \n     unconditionally halt support for terrorism, permanently and \n     openly declare its total renunciation of all forms of \n     terrorism, and close all terrorist offices and facilities in \n     Syria, including the offices of Hamas, Hizballah, the Popular \n     Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Popular Front \n     for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command;\n       (2) in accordance with United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 520 (September 17, 1982), which calls for the \n     strict respect for Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial \n     integrity, the Government of Syria should immediately declare \n     its commitment to completely withdraw its armed forces, \n     including military, paramilitary, and security forces, from \n     Lebanon, and set a firm schedule for such withdrawal;\n       (3) the Government of Syria should halt the development and \n     deployment of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles and \n     cease the development and production of biological and \n     chemical weapons;\n       (4) the Government of Syria should halt illegal imports and \n     transshipments of Iraqi oil and come into full compliance \n     with United Nations Security Council Resolution 661 and \n     subsequent relevant resolutions;\n       (5) the Governments of Lebanon and Syria should enter into \n     serious unconditional bilateral negotiations with the \n     Government of Israel in order to realize a full and permanent \n     peace; and\n       (6) the United States should continue to provide \n     humanitarian and educational assistance to the people of \n     Lebanon only through appropriate private, nongovernmental \n     organizations and appropriate international organizations, \n     until such time as the Government of Lebanon asserts \n     sovereignty and control over all of its territory and borders \n     and achieves full political independence, as called for in \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 520.\n\n     SEC. 1004. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States that--\n       (1) Syria should bear responsibility for all attacks \n     committed by Hizballah and other terrorist groups with \n     offices or other facilities in Syria, or bases in areas of \n     Lebanon occupied by Syria;\n\n[[Page S9266]]\n\n       (2) the United States will work to deny Syria the ability \n     to support acts of international terrorism and efforts to \n     develop or acquire weapons of mass destruction;\n       (3) the Secretary of State will continue to list Syria as a \n     state sponsor of terrorism until Syria ends its support for \n     terrorism, including its support of Hizballah and other \n     terrorist groups in Lebanon and its hosting of terrorist \n     groups in Damascus, and comes into full compliance with \n     United States law relating to terrorism and United Nations \n     Security Council Resolution 1373 (September 28, 2001);\n       (4) the full restoration of Lebanon's sovereignty, \n     political independence, and territorial integrity is in the \n     national security interest of the United States;\n       (5) Syria is in violation of United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 520 (September 17, 1982) through its \n     continued occupation of Lebanese territory and its \n     encroachment upon its political independence;\n       (6) Syria's obligation to withdraw from Lebanon is not \n     conditioned upon progress in the Israeli-Syrian or Israeli-\n     Lebanese peace process but derives from Syria's obligation \n     under Security Council Resolution 520;\n       (7) Syria's acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and \n     ballistic missile programs threaten the security of the \n     Middle East and the national interests of the United States;\n       (8) Syria has violated United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 661 (August 6, 1990) and subsequent relevant \n     resolutions by purchasing oil from Iraq; and\n       (9) the United States will restrict assistance to Syria and \n     will oppose multilateral assistance for Syria until Syria \n     withdraws its armed forces from Lebanon, halts the \n     development and deployment of weapons of mass destruction and \n     ballistic missiles, and complies with Security Council \n     Resolution 661 and subsequent relevant resolutions.\n\n     SEC. 1005. PENALTIES AND AUTHORIZATION.\n\n       (a) Sanctions.--Unless the President makes the \n     certification described in subsection (d), the President \n     shall take the following actions:\n       (1) Prohibit the export to Syria, and prohibit the issuance \n     of a license for the export to Syria, of--\n       (A) any defense articles or defense services for which \n     special export controls are warranted under the Arms Export \n     Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.), as identified on the \n     United States Munitions List maintained under section 121.1 \n     of title 22, Code of Federal Regulations; and\n       (B) any item identified on the Commerce Control List \n     maintained under part 774 of title 15, Code of Federal \n     Regulations.\n       (2) Impose two or more of the following sanctions:\n       (A) Prohibit the export of products of the United States \n     (other than food and medicine) to Syria.\n       (B) Prohibit United States businesses from investing or \n     operating in Syria.\n       (C) Restrict travel of Syrian diplomats assigned to \n     Washington, District of Columbia or the United Nations in New \n     York, New York, to a 25-mile radius of Washington or the \n     United Nations headquarters building, respectively.\n       (D) Reduce United States diplomatic contacts with Syria \n     (other than those contacts required to protect United States \n     interests or carry out the purposes of this title).\n       (E) Block transactions in any property in which the \n     Government of Syria has any interest, by any person, or with \n     respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the \n     United States.\n       (b) Waiver.--The President may waive the application of \n     paragraph (2) of subsection (a) if--\n       (1) the President determines that it is in the national \n     security interest of the United States to do so; and\n       (2) submits to the appropriate congressional committees a \n     report that contains the reasons for such determination.\n       (c) Authority To Provide Assistance to Syria and Lebanon.--\n     The President is authorized to provide assistance to Syria \n     and Lebanon under chapter 1 of part I of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.)
