Mr. President, good morning to everyone on this pleasant \nSaturday morning.\n  Today the Senate convenes for a rare weekend session. I believe it \nreflects our commitment to completing the very important business that \nhas a direct impact on Americans. That is why we are here. We have \nimportant business before us and we will complete that business.\n  This morning, we will have the concluding remarks and amendments to \nthe Senate intelligence and homeland security reform resolution under \nlast night's order. At 11:15, we will begin the series of rollcall \nvotes, which will conclude our action on this resolution. There will be \nanywhere from three to five votes, depending on the number of \namendments that have been worked out. The final vote in the sequence \nwill be on a sense-of-the-Senate resolution on agricultural disasters.\n  Today, we will also consider any available conference reports that \narrive from the House, and that includes appropriation measures, as \nwell as the Department of Defense authorization.\n  We also have an agreement that the cloture vote on the FSC JOBS \nconference report will occur at 1 p.m. on Sunday. I hope that cloture \nis invoked and, once invoked, on the JOBS legislation, we can move \nexpeditiously toward passage of that conference report.\n  With that said, although we have made great progress toward finishing \nthe remaining items on our agenda, there is still work to do. \nIndividual members will ultimately determine how long the Senate will \nremain to complete our business. As I have stated repeatedly, we will \nstay in session until our work is done. I ask those individual Members \nto give consideration to the business we have before us and to our \ncommitment on completing this business, and that they give every \nconsideration to scheduling in that regard.\n  We are here through the weekend to work toward our goal, and I will \ncontinue to work with Senators to see if we can expedite our schedule \nfor finishing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/09/senate-section/article/S10899-6", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I also concur with the majority leader. I \nthink today is going to be a very important day, because we will now \nhave completed the first phase of the Senate's work in response to the \n9/11 Commission recommendations. I have said this now on several \noccasions, but I think it bears repeating--it would not have happened \nwere it not for the great effort made by the Senator from Kentucky and \nthe Senator from Nevada, our two assistant leaders. I congratulate them \nand I appreciate their excellent work.\n  The majority leader also noted an interest and absolute necessity of \nfinishing work on the foreign sales credit bill. I will be supporting \ncloture as well. I know there are all kinds of conflicting views about \nhow many votes, what kind of votes, and what time the vote should be on \nSunday. I know it is an inconvenience to a lot of Senators and we will \ntry to accommodate those concerns as best we can. I think a Sunday \nvote--at least one--is unavoidable. I apologize to those who are \ninconvenienced. I don't think we have any choice given our \ncircumstances. I also hope we can finish homeland security. As the \nmajority leader has said on several occasions, it is important that we \nfinish the homeland security bill. We cannot leave, as he has noted \nseveral times, without finishing that. It sends a terrible message to \nthe country if we are not in a position to complete our work. I know \nthe conferees are almost finished. So I hope we can complete our work \nover the course of the next several days.\n\n  We will work with the majority in making sure these unfinished items \nare completed, even though we cannot say\n\n[[Page S10900]]\n\nat this point how much more time it is going to take to do so. I \nappreciate the majority leader's determination to finish our work \nbefore we leave. We will work with him to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/09/senate-section/article/S10900-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask for the consideration of the modified \nversion of my amendment No. 4035, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4035, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of section 201, insert the following:\n       (i) Public Disclosure.--Section 8 of S. Res. 400 is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``shall notify the \n     President of such vote'' and inserting ``shall--\n       ``(A) first, notify the Majority Leader and Minority Leader \n     of the Senate of such vote; and\n       ``(B) second, consult with the Majority Leader and Minority \n     Leader before notifying the President of such vote.'';\n       (B) in paragraph (2), by striking ``transmitted to the \n     President'' and inserting ``transmitted to the Majority \n     Leader and the Minority Leader and the President''; and\n       (C) by amending paragraph (3) to read as follows:\n       ``(3) If the President, personally, in writing, notifies \n     the Majority Leader and Minority Leader of the Senate and the \n     select Committee of his objections to the disclosure of such \n     information as provided in paragraph (2), the Majority Leader \n     and Minority Leader jointly or the select Committee, by \n     majority vote, may refer the question of the disclosure of \n     such information to the Senate for consideration.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared on both \nsides. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4035), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have a number of amendments that are \nstill outstanding. We disposed of the Frist amendment this morning, and \nwe still have Collins, Nickles, Hutchison, Bingaman, and Rockefeller \nthat are in order. I don't know if they are going to offer all of those \namendments, but we have 1 hour and 5 minutes until we start voting. \nEveryone should understand, as I understand the order entered, a half \nhour over the next 65 minutes is for Senator Harkin. So we have 35 \nminutes to debate these amendments. If they are not debated, we will \nstart voting on them.\n  I think it would be unfortunate if people had to act on amendments \nwithout hearing something from someone. I hope they will either \nwithdraw the amendments or present them. It puts Senator McConnell and \nme in an awkward position when the amendments are in order and nobody \nis here to offer them. It is not fair to the Senate that there is not \nsomeone who lets us know whether they are going to be withdrawn or be \noffered, because some of the subject matter of the amendments is not \nvery clear, as least to this Senator.\n  I have been told the Rockefeller amendment is not going to be \noffered.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, floor staff also informs me that the \nCollins amendment will not be offered.\n  As Senator Reid indicated, we hope to hear from others who are on the \nlist as to what their intentions might be. If they want to offer their \namendment, now would be a good time to come and explain it.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator need to withdraw that \namendment?\n  Mr. REID. The Collins amendment is withdrawn?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It is the Chair's understanding that it \nwill not be offered. I do not know if it is pending.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is not pending.\n  Mr. REID. It is not pending, so I ask that it be deleted from our \nlist because it is on the list of amendments that was entered into last \nnight. So we still have the Nickles, Hutchison, and Bingaman \namendments.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I have been informed that Senator Nickles does intend \nto offer his amendment.\n\n\n  Amendment No. 4027 to Amendment No. 3981, and Amendment No. 4041 to \n                      Amendment No. 4027, en bloc\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4027 by Senator \nNickles and also a second-degree amendment by Senator Nickles, No. \n4041. As I indicated, Senator Nickles will be here to debate that \namendment later.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for Mr. Nickles, \n     for himself, and Mr. Conrad proposes an amendment numbered \n     4027.\n\n  The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for Mr. Nickles, for \nhimself, and Mr. Conrad proposes an amendment numbered 4041 to \namendment No. 4027.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4027\n\n(Purpose: To vest sole jurisdiction over the Federal budget process in \n                      the Committee on the Budget)\n\n       At the end of Section 101, insert the following:\n       ``(e) Jurisdiction of Budget Committee.--Notwithstanding \n     paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the Committee on the Budget \n     shall have exclusive jurisdiction over measures affecting the \n     congressional budget process, including:\n       (1) the functions, duties, and powers of the Budget \n     Committee;\n       (2) the functions, duties, and powers of the Congressional \n     Budget Office;\n       (3) the process by which Congress annually establishes the \n     appropriate levels of budget authority, outlays, revenues, \n     deficits of surpluses, and public debt--including \n     subdivisions thereof--and including the establishment of \n     mandatory ceilings on spending and appropriations, a floor on \n     revenues, timetables for congressional action on concurrent \n     resolutions, on the reporting of authorization bills, and on \n     the enactment of appropriation bills, and enforcement \n     mechanisms for budgetary limits and timetables;\n       (4) the limiting of backdoor spending devices;\n       (5) the timetables for Presidential submission of \n     appropriations and authorization requests;\n       (6) the definitions of what constitutes impoundment--such \n     as ``rescissions'' and ``deferrals'';\n       (7) the process and determination by which impoundments \n     must be reported to and considered by Congress;\n       (8) the mechanisms to insure Executive compliance with the \n     provisions of the Impoundment Control Act, title X--such as \n     GAO review and lawsuits;

Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Iowa, we have \na few amendments that may be offered. I am concerned that the offerors \nwill have no time at all to explain their amendments prior to the votes \nat 11:15. I am wondering if the Senator from Iowa would object if we \nhave Senators who want to offer amendments on our list, which they are \nentitled to do, prior to the vote at 11:15, how we could accommodate \nthem and give them an opportunity to explain what the amendment was \nabout.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I do not mind. I thought I had half an hour under the \nrule. I do not care when I take my half hour. I can take it now or I \nwill take it whenever. It does not make any difference to me.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, his half hour is unrelated to the \nunderlying bill.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct, and the time of the \nquorum has not been charged against the Senator from Iowa. He has 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I do not have to take it now if the Senator wants to do \nsomething else.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized for his 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand I have a half hour of time \nyielded to me. I may have to yield it to another Senator, but I will \ntake some time right now.\n\n\n                        Natural Disaster Relief\n\n  Mr. President, the resolution I have offered is very straightforward. \nIt simply reiterates the policy that this Senate and this Congress has \nendorsed repeatedly over the decades. It basically is that agricultural \ndisaster assistance should be designated as emergency spending and not \ntaken out of other farm programs. This is the way we have done this \ngoing back 50 years or more. In fact, I have looked and I have only \nfound one instance in the last 50 years where we have offset, as they \nsay, disaster assistance with some other money from the same program.\n  That was 2 years ago and that was corrected right away. We are now \nabout to do the same thing.\n  Mr. President, one of the few uncertainties about agriculture is the \nuncertainty of the weather. And that is true whether it is farming or \nranching, growing orchard crops or growing any other type of \nagricultural production. Even when a farmer has used his best \npractices, taken prudent steps to produce a crop, severe weather events \ncan destroy years of work and threaten their livelihood.\n  Let me just quote from the USDA Web site:\n\n       Natural disaster is a constant threat to America's farmers \n     and ranchers. From drought to flood, freeze, tornadoes, or \n     other calamity, natural events can severely hurt even the \n     best run agricultural operation.\n\n  We have responded to these disasters through emergency legislation in \nthe past because we believed it was essential to respond to natural \ndisasters to lessen the financial hardship involved. We do have \nprograms in place such as crop insurance, loans, and so forth. However, \nmajor disasters can easily overwhelm these programs, and that is why \nCongress has consistently responded to natural disasters by providing \nemergency assistance. This emergency assistance usually covers crop \nlosses, forages--that is hay and things like that--pasture losses for \nlivestock producers, funding for tree assistance programs, and again \nthere is some misconception that this disaster money makes the producer \nwhole, puts the producer where he would be if the disaster never \nhappened. That is just not true.\n  Let me give you an example. It is only available, first of all, if \nyou have over 35 percent loss of your expected production. So if you \nhave a loss under 35 percent, you don't get anything anyway. But let's \ntake an example of a Kansas farmer who, in a normal year, produces 100 \nbushels of grain sorghum per acre. Now he only harvests 80 bushels. \nWell, if the grain sorghum is worth $2.30 a bushel, that farmer will \nhave an income shortfall of $46 an acre, but he will not be eligible \nfor any disaster assistance because he only had a 20-percent loss, so \nhe gets nothing. If the yield is only 50 percent, that means he has a \n50-percent loss. His income shortfall is $115 an acre. Now the farmer \nis eligible for disaster assistance for 15 bushels of that loss--at a \nlow payment rate. So, again, it is only a small fraction of what he \ngets. He loses $115, and receives only about $20. So some people think \ndisaster assistance puts you back where you were if you were whole. No, \nit does not. It basically just kind of keeps you going, and that is \nabout it.\n  Now, you will hear a lot of reference to drought relief or a drought \nbill or drought emergency assistance. Well, that is a misconception. It \nhas been a misconception all along. While that may be the most common \nproblem, disaster legislation covers the whole range of weather-related \nlosses. The bill language covers losses ``due to damaging weather or \nrelated conditions.''\n  In addition to drought, the regulations that carry out disaster \nassistance include hurricanes, hail, floods, fires, freezes, tornadoes, \nmud slides, pest infestation, and other calamities--in short, just \nabout anything Mother Nature can throw agriculture's way. It doesn't \nmatter what weather event causes the loss. It doesn't matter if it is \npart of a hurricane that has a name or just a plain old ordinary storm \nthat strikes the Midwest. It doesn't matter whether the crop loss \nhappens in a catastrophic afternoon storm or whether it is the result \nof a drought that lasts 9 or 10 or 12 months. We have always included \nthose in disaster assistance and treated them alike. That is what we \npassed in the Senate a few weeks ago. We passed an amendment \nunanimously on a voice vote to cover all types of weather-related \ndisaster losses across the country and treated them the same.\n  That is basically what my resolution says. The White House and the \nHouse of Representatives decided to take a different approach. \nPresident Bush sent Congress the disaster assistance proposal that \nincluded agricultural disaster payments only for losses caused by \nhurricanes and left out assistance for a whole range of other disaster \nlosses across the country. Furthermore, this hurricane disaster \nassistance would be designated emergency spending, meaning that it \nwould not be\n\n[[Page S10902]]\n\ntaken away from other programs. The President was adamant that if \nCongress is going to respond to any other disasters across the country, \nthen the cost has to be offset from the farm bill, and that is what the \nHouse measure did. It is interesting, the States included in the House \nhurricane package are Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, South \nCarolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. So if \nyou are a farmer in those States and you have a hurricane-related loss, \nyour losses are covered without offsets. You get the emergency spending \nmeasure assistance. Here is the interesting wrinkle, Mr. President, in \nthe President's package. If you are a farmer in one of those hurricane \nStates that I just mentioned, but your loss was not from the \nhurricane--let's say you had a hailstorm. Let's say you had high wind \ndamage from a severe storm in May. Let's say you had a pest infestation \nor something like that. Guess what. You get no assistance. In the \nHouse, in what the President proposed, if you suffer loss from a \nhurricane, your payments are under emergency spending. But if you are \nin a hurricane State and you have another disaster caused by a \nhailstorm, well, then the cost of your assistance comes out of the farm \nbill.\n\n  What kind of nonsense is that?\n  A sugarcane farmer, God bless him, in Florida lost his crop because \nof the hurricane. That farmer gets compensated out of the emergency \npackage. Let's say you are a corn farmer in Ohio and your crop was \nknocked down by a tornado. Guess what. You are not in. Whatever \nassistance you get has to come out of the farm bill. So why is it, why \nis it that if you got hit by a hurricane, you are treated one way; if \nyou get hit by a tornado or a hailstorm or a fire or a drought, you are \ntreated another way. It absolutely makes no sense. So, again, we draw \nthese artificial lines. The President has drawn them. Why discriminate \nagainst certain farmers? If you are a farmer and you lose your crop, as \nI said, to a tornado or high winds in Ohio or Wisconsin or Iowa or \nMinnesota or Missouri, well, guess what. They are going to take it out \nof one pocket and put it into your other pocket. But if you are a \nfarmer down in Florida, they don't take it out of your pocket. The \nwhole country, all of us, help pay for those disasters as we have done \nfor the last 50 years.\n  Now the President wants to take the money out of the Conservation \nSecurity Program. That program covers the entire United States of \nAmerica. Why would you want to take money out of a State such as \nPennsylvania that uses conservation money or Ohio or Wisconsin or \nMinnesota or Iowa or Missouri, taking money out of those States to send \nto Texas or Oklahoma or Wyoming or Colorado to help the farmers who had \na drought? That doesn't make sense. It seems if you are going to have a \ndisaster assistance package, the whole country ought to pay for it, all \nof it. When you have an earthquake in Alaska, do we take the money out \nof one State, just one State, and pay for that--or two States--or do we \njust take it out of a State that maybe--we take it out of California \nbecause they have an earthquake and we send it to Alaska? No.\n  The entire United States of America, all of our people contribute to \nmake sure that anyone who is hurt by an earthquake in Alaska or \nCalifornia or a flood in Iowa gets compensated and gets help. We had a \nflood in Iowa in 1993 that devastated our State. We didn't take money \nout of South Dakota or we didn't take out of Missouri or another State, \nout of what they get. The whole country came to our assistance.\n  As I said, I feel sorry for the people who have been hit by \nhurricanes, and we should help them, but we ought to do it on a \nnational basis and not try to take it out of one pocket, one part to \nhelp another. That is not right. It is not right to discriminate \nagainst farmers.\n  One last thing I will say before I yield the floor. We don't take \naway a community's Federal funds for highways or housing or hospitals \nto fund civil disaster assistance. In other words, if we have a civil \ndisaster, why should we take the money out of the highway money? If we \nare going to help Florida out, why don't we take it out of Florida's \nhighway money? Take it out of their housing money? Take it out of their \nhospital money to pay for their civil disaster? We don't do that. So \nwhy should we do it in agriculture, on farmers? Why should we take it \nout of the farmers' pockets to pay for a disaster? Why don't we take \nthe money out of the highway money going to Florida to pay for the \nhurricane? Take it out of their hospital money? Take it out of their \nhousing money? We don't do that. We don't do it because it is not the \nright thing to do. We should not take it from the farm bill either.\n  I realize those of us who represent farmers and farm States, we get \nhit often because they say farmers get this and that. I want to point \nout, as I have pointed out time and time again, since we passed the \nfarm bill in 2002 and the President signed it in May of 2002, we have \nsaved the taxpayers of this country over $15 billion in less commodity \nprogram spending. I think that is a pretty healthy contribution by our \nfarmers and our ranchers to help reduce the deficit of this country. \nNow they want to take more money out of agriculture to pay for a \ndisaster. It is wrong. That is why I have offered this resolution which \nbasically says:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the 108th Congress \n     should provide the necessary funds to make disaster \n     assistance available for all customarily eligible \n     agricultural producers as emergency spending and not funded \n     by cuts to the farmer.\n\n  It is very simple and straightforward.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator has 16 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I don't know if anyone wants any time. I \nwill be glad to yield to my friend from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I rise today to support the ranking \nmember on the Senate Agriculture Committee in what he is saying. I am \nin my 18th year in the Senate. Only once before in that entire time \nhave we taken money from other farmers to provide the funds to cover a \nnatural disaster for others. That is just wrong. That is not the way we \nhave operated. We have always dealt with natural disasters through \nemergency funding because none of us can know who is going to get hit \nby a natural disaster. None of us can know who is going to have a \nhurricane or a drought or a freeze.\n  In my State we have had three of the four. We didn't have hurricanes. \nWe don't get hurricanes in North Dakota. But we have had drought in the \nsouthwestern part of the State. I have just taken a drought tour, and \nit looks like a moonscape. Nothing is growing. It is disastrous. The \ncorn crop is about a foot high. There are no ears in the corn crop.\n  I go to the northern part of my State, and it is flooded. It is \nunbelievable. We have a lake in north central North Dakota called \nDevils Lake. That lake has risen 25 feet in the last 7 years. That lake \nis now 2\\1/2\\ times the size of the District of Columbia, and it has \nrisen 25 vertical feet, taking up hundreds of thousands of acres.\n  We, as a Federal Government, have already had to buy out the entire \ntown of Church's Ferry. We have had other towns that are on the brink \nof being swallowed up. We have spent tens of millions of dollars \nprotecting the town of Devils Lake. We have moved over 600 structures.\n  All across the northern tier of North Dakota, something very unusual \nis happening. We have had extraordinarily wet conditions over a \nprolonged period. The result is 2 million acres they could not even \nplant this year--2 million acres. That is bigger than the size of the \nState of Delaware--land that couldn't be planted.\n  The land that could be planted is now so wet they can't drive the \nequipment in to harvest the crop. So you drive by the road and it looks \nlike a fabulous crop, like there is a tremendous barley crop out there. \nIt looks like 90- to 100-bushel barley. But you can't get into the land \nto take it off because the ground is soaked.\n  I was just at a farmer's home and he pointed up to the top of the \nrafters in his barn. He said: Senator, that is where the water is going \nto be 6 months from now, according to the State water commission, \nbecause the whole area is flooding.\n  In the midst of that we had a freeze in early August. Drought, flood, \nfreeze--I have lived in North Dakota all my life, and I have never seen \nsuch\n\n[[Page S10903]]\n\na collection of natural disasters. So while I have great sympathy for \nthe people of Florida and Southeastern United States who have suffered \nhurricanes, and I am prepared with my vote to help them, we would \nexpect the same in return. They are not the only ones who have been \nhurt. I have tens of thousands of farm families who are wondering now, \nIs Washington going to help or is Washington going to turn its back?\n  We have not been on the news. The networks haven't been out there \ncovering this drought. They have not covered this flooding because this \nis a slow-motion disaster. This is not the kind of thing that makes \ngood television, as the water rises in North Dakota. That doesn't make \ngood television. It is a slow-motion disaster, but it is a disaster \nnonetheless. People's lives are being devastated.\n  Always before we have had emergency funding--with one exception in \nthe 18 years I have been here. Always before, when an area suffered \nnatural disasters, we have voted emergency funding to give them some \nhelp.\n  Let me make clear to my colleagues--I have heard some say: If you \nwould have had preventive planning, you wouldn't have any losses \nbecause you didn't have to plant the crop. That is not the way it \nworks. You still have your land payment, you still have all your \nmanagement expenses, and in most cases people put on fertilizer in \nanticipation of being able to plant. This idea that they don't have \nexpenses is just wrong.\n  Then I have heard they will get more help than what they have lost. \nThat is just wrong. People have said: They have crop insurance. Crop \ninsurance will make them whole. No.\n  Crop insurance will not come anywhere close to making them whole; \nnowhere close. First of all, you have to have a 35-percent loss before \nyou get anything. Then you only get a percentage of your loss over 35 \npercent. That is not going to make people anywhere close to whole--\nnowhere close. Even if you take disaster assistance and crop insurance, \nyou are nowhere close to whole. You still have significant losses. That \nis the fact of the matter.\n  The disaster assistance we pass in the Senate is desperately needed, \nand it should not be taken away from other farmers in order to pay for \nit. We shouldn't take from what they need in order to try to provide \nassistance for those who have suffered natural disasters. That is not \nright. It is not fair. It has not been done before, with one exception \nin the 18 years I have been in the Senate. I had my staff go back and \nresearch the whole history. We have never done things that way with one \nexception.\n  We should not go down this path of turning our back on people who \nhave suffered natural disasters, whether it is a hurricane, whether it \nis a flood, whether it is a drought, whether it is a freeze, or some \nhorrific outbreak of disease. We need to stand ready to reach out with \na helping hand.\n  I thank the ranking member from the State of Iowa, Senator Harkin, \nfor standing up, fighting back and being very clear about what is at \nstake here; and to our leader, Senator Daschle. The truth is without \nSenator Daschle as our leader, we wouldn't have a prayer of getting the \nassistance our area desperately needs. That is a fact.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota for his very kind words. There are a number of people who \ndeserve great credit, beginning, of course, with our distinguished \nranking member on the Senate Agriculture Committee. He has been the \nmost forceful, the most passionate, the most articulate voice for \nagriculture and I am proud to call him my leader.\n  He and I were in the room when we wrote this a couple of years ago. I \nremember so vividly. It was in the room across the hall. This \nlegislation wouldn't even exist were it not for what Senator Harkin did \nin the room across the hall as we negotiated these issues and got the \ncommitment from this administration and from our Republican friends \nthat this conservation program would be fully funded. We got a \ncommitment. Almost before the ink was dry, that commitment withered \naway. It disappeared.\n  I can understand the frustration of the distinguished Senator, the \nanger and the disappointment that after being given the commitment over \nand over again it was virtually the last thing we decided. Only because \nhe held out as aggressively as he did, we finally said yes. OK. If this \nmeans getting the farm bill, we will agree to this and we will commit \nto funding. I was there in the room. I heard it myself, and here we \nare.\n  This isn't the first time. This is now the second time he has had to \ncome to the floor.\n  I know a lot of Senators are inconvenienced, but I must say nobody is \nmore inconvenienced by the doubletalk and the lack of commitment and \nthe willingness to keep their word than our ranchers and farmers who \nare so desperate for the help Senator Conrad and Senator Harkin have so \neloquently described.\n  Senator Johnson and I have the same situation in South Dakota. I \ntalked to a rancher in the southwest near Edgemont. He broke down in \ntears, telling me that he is now going to be forced to sell his herd--a \nherd he has had all of his life. He said, I have never seen anything \nlike this. His lips curled and he choked up. I felt so sorry for him. \nHe said, But I am not alone. I am at the end of my career.\n  I worry about those young farmers and ranchers who are just getting \nstarted. What are they going to do?\n  This assistance is critical. But the double standard is so outrageous \nthat I can understand why Member after Member representing farmer and \nrancher after farmer and rancher is coming to the floor to express \ntheir outrage and indignation.\n  You talk about heroes. I thank my colleague from South Dakota for \nmaking the effort he did so gallantly. Senator Johnson offered an \namendment to say let's treat this disaster assistance the way we are \ntreating all other disaster assistance. I understand it is about $11 \nbillion. Let us treat it exactly the same. He made a passionate defense \nof that argument and lost on a 6-to-5 vote, as I understand it. It was \na party-line vote.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, may I direct a question to my \ncolleague?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to yield for a question from the \nSenator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I want to report to the body that I have just come from \nthe Military Construction Subcommittee conference markup. Oddly enough, \nmilitary construction--the way things work around here--is now the \nvehicle for bringing up disaster relief to Florida and on the Northern \nPlains. We were able to obtain nearly a $3 billion drought relief \npackage on that bill, thanks to Senator Daschle in large part, and \nSenator Harkin, of course, with his leadership. But I don't believe it \nwould be on the floor at all were it not for Senator Daschle's \nleadership.\n  That drought relief passed with a unanimous bipartisan vote in the \nSenate earlier this year. Yet when it came back to the Military \nConstruction Subcommittee as part of this disaster aid we are adding, \nit had this very convoluted offset that is stretched out for over 10 \nyears.\n  I have to ask the leader, Senator Daschle, who has been through this \nand has championed agriculture for so many years as an extraordinary \nrepresentative and as a leader on rural and agricultural issues, if \nthere is any logic the leader can discern why disaster relief for \nhurricane victims is emergency funding, and disaster relief as it turns \nout now for farmers and ranchers suffering from drought is cannibalized \nout of the agriculture budget for the rest of the decade. What logic is \nthere to that? What fairness is there to that kind of approach to this \ndisaster relief bill that is now likely to pass? We are grateful for \ndisaster relief, but this uneven treatment between farmers \nand hurricane victims strikes me as sadly peculiar and an unfortunate \nprecedent that rural people will suffer from for years to come.\n\n  I would be interested in any response, given the great experience and \nleadership Senator Daschle has afforded rural America for all of these \nyears, whether he sees any logic to this kind of separate treatment of \nfarmers versus others in America today.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank my dear friend from South Dakota for his \nquestion and for his kind words.\n  I simply say there is no logical conclusion one can draw from this \nexcept\n\n[[Page S10904]]\n\nthat there are those in the administration and apparently here in \nCongress who believe farmers and ranchers ought to be subject to a \ndouble standard; that they aren't as poor as other victims and the \nother people who have experienced disasters of other kinds.\n  For some reason, this administration has minimized the losses in \nagriculture almost from the beginning. As the Senator so well knows, \nbecause he was right in the middle of the fight 2 years ago, we tried \nto persuade the administration to help farmers and ranchers with $6 \nbillion disaster assistance. That was actually passed here on the \nSenate floor. They sat on it. They stalled it. They did everything they \ncould to prevent it. Ultimately, all we got before the end of the year \nwas about $1 billion--$5 billion less. It is no surprise. This isn't \nsomething new for this administration or some of our colleagues in the \nCongress.\n  This is yet another illustration and pattern of demonstration of how \nminimally they are prepared to support agriculture and our farmers and \nranchers. It is a double standard. It is a shell game. They are telling \nfarmers and ranchers we are going to take money out of your right-hand \npocket and put it in your left-hand pocket, and we want you to feel \ngood about it. There is no net additional revenue to be provided to \nagriculture as a result of this disaster relief. We are simply taking \nit out of their right pocket and putting it in their left pocket.\n  I can't imagine--and Senator Conrad and others have noted how a \nrancher or a farmer could be anything but offended--that somebody would \ninsist farmers and ranchers pay for their own grass and drought \nassistance, disaster assistance and flood assistance, when at the very \nsame time, simultaneously, we are providing meaningful new assistance \nto the victims of hurricanes, which we all support.\n  The double standard, the shell game, the extraordinary intransigence \non the part of those who are opposing the Johnson amendment and \nopposing our efforts to make farmers and ranchers whole is \ninexplicable. There is no logic. I appreciate very much his words.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 8 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We all need leaders to organize us, to inspire us, to get \nus moving in the right direction. Our distinguished leader, Senator \nDaschle from South Dakota, was kind enough to say good things about me \nwith regard to the Agriculture bill, but we would never have gotten it \ntogether had it not been for his leadership. We, on this side of the \naisle, all rely on his inspiration and his leadership, pulling us \ntogether. Nowhere is that more evident than our fight for farmers and \nranchers and people who live in small towns and communities all over \nAmerica.\n  I thank my good friend and my leader from South Dakota for what he \nhas done for the people who live in the little towns such as my home \ntown, Cummings, IA, with 150 people, for the farmers and ranchers of \nIowa, South Dakota, and all over this country. Senator Daschle has been \ntheir voice and their leader, as he has been our leader. I daresay we \nwouldn't have half of the things we have for agriculture today had it \nnot been for Senator Daschle, in making sure we had a good farm bill 2 \nyears ago.\n  As Members can tell today, his passion is still there. I thank the \ngood farmers and ranchers and rural people of South Dakota for having \nhim here and having him as our leader.\n  Madam President, I ask that an editorial from the Des Moines Register \nof October 9 be printed at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will read one sentence from the editorial:\n\n       \"The reality of the situation is that there will be no \n     disaster money before we go home unless we provide budget \n     offsets,'' said the chairman of the House Agriculture \n     Committee, Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va.\n\n  Easy for him to say; farmers in his State are covered by the \nhurricane disaster assistance package. He doesn't have to worry about \nwhether it is emergency money.\n  What kind of selfishness is that around here? If you are from a State \nwhere you get the hurricane disaster assistance, to heck with everybody \nelse?\n  The Des Moines Register editorial said:\n\n       Cutting farm programs to pay for the assistance would \n     amount to taking money from growers in the Midwest and giving \n     it to producers in drought-stricken areas of Montana, the \n     Dakotas and other Plains states.\n\n  I want to help those farmers. They should be helped. But as Senator \nDaschle said, they should not take it out of one pocket and put it in \nanother.\n  I also ask that a letter from a number of different farm groups \nopposing the using of farm bill conservation money for disaster \nassistance be printed in the Record following my remarks. This is in \nopposition to the President's position.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask that a letter from a number of conservation groups \nbe printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks, asking that \nmoney not be taken out of the conservation title.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my \nremarks a letter to a number of Representatives on the House side from \na number of conservation groups also be printed at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  (See exhibit 4.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Lastly, I have heard the argument that drought is long \nterm; there is some kind of climate change, but for the western part of \nthe United States, which has had droughts for the last 4 or 5 years, we \ncannot continue to give disaster money if it is going to be a drought \none year after another.\n  Guess what. Florida sits in hurricane alley. They have had hurricanes \ngoing back for 100 years. Guess what. Hurricanes are going to hit \nFlorida next year and the year after and the year after. Should we say \nwe cannot give disaster money to Florida because this is a long-term \ntype thing? That is what I heard about drought assistance because we \nhave had it for 5 years. Because we have been hit by 5 years of \ndrought, that is long term and therefore we cannot help you?\n  Maybe we ought to take a look at hurricane alley. Maybe they \nshouldn't get help because they will get hit by another hurricane next \nyear or the year after. We don't get hit by hurricanes in Iowa. They do \nnot bother us. But we get hit by things such as tornados and hail \ndamage and drought and, yes, floods.\n  Lastly, this bill, in helping the drought-stricken farmers--and my \nfriend from North Dakota knows this very well--it only covers 1 year. \nWe have had a drought for 4, 5, or 6 years. Farmers who suffered crop \nlosses in both 2003 and 2004 will get to pick 1 year, either 2003 or \n2004, you pick one, that is all the disaster assistance you get. It \ndoes not cover 7 years; it covers 1 year.\n  I wanted to clear this up. I hear rumors and misconceptions around \nhere. I wanted to make the record clear that, yes, we have had some \nproblems--such as tornados. Oklahoma gets hit by tornados, and Kansas \nand Nebraska and Iowa. We have had a lot. We will next summer because \nwe are in tornado alley. Does that mean if a tornado strikes we should \nnot get any disaster money because we get hit by tornados every year? \nNo. Neither should the farmers in the Dakotas or Montana or places that \nhave a drought right now, nor should they be penalized because they \nhave been hit by some dry weather for a few years.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From the Des Moines Register, Oct. 9, 2004]\n\n             Midwest Farmers May Lose Out With Disaster Aid\n\n       Washington, DC.--Farmers hit by a succession of crop losses \n     hoped an election year would bring some extra cash from the \n     government.\n       However, House Republicans are pushing for cuts in farm \n     programs to pay for a $3 billion package of farm-disaster \n     assistance, and agriculture groups may drop their support for \n     the aid.\n\n[[Page S10905]]\n\n       Cutting farm programs to pay for the assistance would \n     amount to taking money from growers in the Midwest and giving \n     it to producers in drought-stricken areas of Montana, the \n     Dakotas and other Plains states. The prime target for the \n     cuts is the popular Conservation Security Program written by \n     Sen. Tom Harkin.\n       ``If disaster assistance comes out of the farm bill, then \n     we oppose disaster assistance,'' said Mary Kay Thatcher, a \n     lobbyist for the American Farm Bureau Federation.\n       Democrats accused Republicans of hypocrisy. The White House \n     is pushing Congress to pass special emergency assistance for \n     Florida hurricane victims, including farmers there, without \n     demanding spending cuts. Florida is a key state in the \n     presidential race. ``It is not right to treat farmers in one \n     part of this country different than farmers in another,'' \n     Harkin said.\n       The House passed legislation earlier in the week that would \n     pay for the drought assistance by capping the cost of the \n     Conservation Security Program.\n       ``The reality of the situation is that there will be no \n     disaster money before we go home unless we provide budget \n     offsets,'' said the chairman of the House Agriculture \n     Committee, Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va. Friday, lawmakers were \n     looking into trimming things other than the Conservation \n     Security Program because of technical problems with targeting \n     the conservation payments, congressional aides said. Harkin, \n     a Democrat, pledged to slow some must-pass bills unless \n     Republicans backed off making the cuts. Friday afternoon, he \n     blocked the Senate from considering amendments to an \n     intelligence-reform bill.\n       The Senate passed a version of the drought aid paid for by \n     adding to the federal budget deficit. Farmers could get \n     payments for losses in either 2003 or 2004.\n       Iowa farmers would likely receive about $200 million to \n     $250 million in disaster payments, primarily to cover damage \n     to soybean fields, according to Harkin's staff. The Iowa Farm \n     Bureau has estimated damage from the 2003 drought at $750 \n     million.\n       The Conservation Security Program is designed to reward \n     farmers for practices that prevent soil erosion and other \n     environmental problems.\n       Some 2,188 farms, including 290 in Iowa, were signed up for \n     the program this year. Enrollment was limited to 18 \n     watersheds, or river drainage areas. The National Corn \n     Growers Association never endorsed the disaster aid package, \n     partly out of concern that it mean reductions in other farm \n     spending, said Jon Doggett, a lobbyist for the group.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                                  October 7, 2004.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC\n\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC\n\n     Hon. Robert Byrd,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations and Subcommittee \n         on Homeland Security, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member: The House and Senate \n     have approved virtually identical legislation to provide \n     vitally important financial assistance to assist farmers and \n     ranchers who have suffered devastating crop losses due to \n     hurricanes and drought. Importantly, the provisions approved \n     by the House and Senate allow producers to choose to receive \n     assistance for either 2003 or 2004 crop losses. And, since \n     the legislation is similar to previous disaster programs, \n     USDA should be able to deliver the assistance in a timely and \n     cost efficient manner.\n       We understand that the free-standing legislation passed by \n     the House on October 6 may serve as the House position in the \n     conference on FY05 funding for Homeland Security. We are \n     concerned that the House provision providing assistance for \n     agricultural losses includes a funding offset, which reduces \n     funding for a conservation program authorized in the 2002 \n     farm bill. The Senate passed provision, which is included in \n     the Homeland Security bill does not include an off-set. As \n     you know, farm and commodity organizations have consistently \n     opposed opening the farm bill, which is carefully balanced \n     and has provided important, predictable financial stability \n     for farmers, ranchers and rural Americans. While the House \n     passed provision includes an off-set for a portion of the \n     agriculture assistance, the other assistance was approved \n     with an emergency designation and the House overwhelmingly \n     rejected an amendment that would have offset the entire bill.\n       The purpose of this letter is to respectfully urge the \n     conferees to retain the disaster assistance provisions as \n     part of the Homeland Security funding but to eliminate the \n     requirement that a portion of the funds for agricultural \n     disaster assistance be off-set by a reduction in conservation \n     programs or any other programs authorized by the 2002 farm \n     bill. We believe the delivery of much needed assistance to \n     farmers and ranchers suffering losses due to drought, \n     hurricanes and other adverse weather is critically important \n     to those who have suffered devastating losses, but we also \n     believe preservation of the provisions of the 2002 farm law \n     is important to all farmers and ranchers. We would also note \n     that expenditures under the 2002 farm bill have been \n     substantially less than that projected at the time of \n     passage. Unfortunately budget rules do not allow use of those \n     funds for other purposes, but we believe this should be a \n     favorable factor in the consideration of our request.\n       As always, thank you for your consideration of our views \n     and your leadership on matters critical to the U.S. \n     agricultural community.\n       Sincerely,\n         Alabama Farmers Federation\n         American Corn Growers Association\n         American Farm Bureau Federation\n         American Soybean Association\n         Ducks Unlimited\n         Georgia Peanut Commission\n         Independent Community Bankers of America\n         National Association of Farmer Elected Committees\n         National Association of State Departments of Agriculture\n         National Association of Wheat Growers\n         National Barley Growers Association\n         National Cotton Council\n         National Council of Farmer Cooperatives\n         National Farmers Organization\n         National Farmers Union\n         National Grain Sorghum Producers\n         National Milk Producers Federation\n         Southern Peanut Farmers Federation\n         National Sunflower Association\n         Soybean Producers of America\n         US Canola Association\n         USA Dry Pea & Lentil Council\n         USA Rice Federation\n         USA Rice Producers Association\n         Women Involved in Farm Economics.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n         American Fly Fishing Trade Association, American Land \n           Conservancy, Archery Trade Association, Bowhunting \n           Preservation Alliance, Congressional Sportsmen's \n           Foundation, Ducks Unlimited, International Hunter \n           Education Association, International Association of \n           Fish and Wildlife Agencies, Izaak Walton League of \n           America, Orion-The Hunters Institute, Pheasants \n           Forever, Sand County Foundation, Texas Wildlife \n           Association, Theodore Roosevelt Conservation \n           Partnership, The Wildlife Society, Wildlife Forever, \n           Wildlife Management Institute,\n                                                  October 7, 2004.\n     Hon.

The above listed \n     conservation and sportsmen's organizations, which represent a \n     diverse spectrum of interests with a combined membership of \n     millions, stand together urging you to reject any attempt to \n     offset the costs of the disaster package's assistance to U.S. \n     farmers and ranchers with cuts to the 2002 Farm Bill's \n     conservation assistance programs. We fully support a disaster \n     assistance package that is appropriately designated by \n     Congress as emergency spending.\n       Conservation funding was critical to securing passage of \n     the 2002 Farm Bill. These conservation programs have become \n     win-win solutions for landowners and wildlife, while at the \n     same time guard against economic impacts from droughts and \n     floods. Each of the programs is oversubscribed, with farmer \n     demand continuing to outpace available funding.\n       We strongly oppose the use of conservation program spending \n     as an offset for disaster assistance. If you have questions \n     about this issue, please contact Barton James (Ducks \n     Unlimited) at (202) 347-1530.\n       Thank you very much for your time and consideration of this \n     matter.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 4\n\n                                                  October 5, 2004.\n     Hon.

Harold Rogers,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Homeland Security, House Committee \n         on Appropriations, Rayburn HOB B-307, Washington, DC\n       Dear Appropriations Conferee: As you conference the fiscal \n     year 2005 Homeland Security appropriations bill and consider \n     the Senate-passed agricultural disaster package, we urge you \n     to reject any attempt to offset the costs of the disaster \n     package with cuts to the 2002 Farm Bill's conservation \n     assistance programs.\n       Conservation funding was critical to securing passage of \n     the 2002 Farm Bill. Conservation programs in the 2002 Farm \n     Bill provide farmers and ranchers with important financial \n     assistance while addressing the nation's urgent natural \n     resource and environmental needs. These programs guard \n     against heightened natural resource and economic impacts from \n     droughts and floods, and thus the long-term costs of weather \n     related disasters, by improving soil and water quality and \n     conservation. Each of the programs is oversubscribed, with \n     farmer demand continuing to outpace available funding.\n       We strongly oppose the use of conservation program spending \n     as an offset for the disaster package. In our view, it is \n     unfair to single out agricultural disasters for offsets and \n     unwise to single out conservation as the potential offset.\n       Thank you for considering our views.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Farmland Trust\n         American Rivers\n         Chesapeake Bay Foundation\n         Defenders of Wildlife\n         Environmental Defense\n         National Association of Conservation Districts\n         National Catholic Rural Life Conference\n         National Wildlife Federation\n         Natural Resources Defense Council\n         Sierra Club\n         Soil and Water Conservation Society\n         Sustainable Agriculture Coalition\n         Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 40 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Whatever time I have remaining I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me, in the few moments remaining, thank the Senator \nfrom Iowa. Yesterday, someone asked him what he was doing, and he said: \nI am supporting my farmers.\n  The fact is, farmers in his State, our State and others, have been \nhit by weather-related disasters. You ought not treat farmers in \ndifferent parts of the country in different ways. If you are going to \nprovide disaster assistance to people in one part of the country, those \nfarmers who have been hit with weather-related disasters in other parts \nof the country deserve to be helped as well.\n  This is a case of the Government saying to farmers during a tough \nperiod, you are not alone; we are here to help you. This is not a case \nof farmers begging to be helped. It is a case, for example, in our part \nof the country, where torrential rains wiped out the opportunity for \nfarmers to even plant a crop on 1.7 million acres. Think of that. There \nwere 1.7 million acres that could not be planted. These are farmers \nthat will lose their farms if we do not offer some help.\n  The Senator from Iowa has been doing something very simple and \npowerful in the Senate. He is standing up for family farmers.\n  My colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, myself, and others \nare insistent we provide disaster relief and do so in the right way.\n  What is being done in the conferences, back and forth, the ping-\nponging of inadequate proposals, proposals that are unusual, is not \nfair.\n  I commend the Senator from Iowa for being unwilling to sit by idly, \nsilently, and allowing this to happen. I stand with him, as does my \ncolleague, Senator Conrad, and many others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of Senator Bingaman, I ask permission to withdraw \nfrom the list the Bingaman-Domenici amendment as listed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nOhio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4027\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, later on today we will be discussing \nan amendment submitted by Senator Nickles. The amendment's alleged \npurpose is to clarify the shared jurisdiction of the congressional \nbudget process between Governmental Affairs and the budget situation \nthat grew out of the Budget Committee and the modern budget process of \n1974.\n  Senate committees rarely share jurisdiction, and joint referral of \nlegislation is accomplished by unanimous consent. Today, anything that \ndeals with the budget either coming out of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee or coming out of Budget has to be referred to the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee and within 30 days some action has to be \ntaken so there is a joint referral.\n  This amendment would eliminate that and say that all of the budgetary \nprocess is within the jurisdiction only of the Budget Committee and \nwould also require that instead of the nominations for the Director of \nthe Office of Management and Budget and the deputy director being the \nsole jurisdiction of the Governmental Affairs Committee, that would be \na joint jurisdiction. In other words, the Presidential appointee to \nDirector of Budget and Management, Deputy Director, and other people, \nwould have to come to the Governmental Affairs Committee and also go to \nthe Budget Committee for their approval.\n\n  I think one of the things we are trying to do here is to streamline \nthat whole process, that we have too many people who are being, \nfrankly, nominated, and too much advice and consent.\n  One of the things in an amendment to the Homeland Security Act that \nwe were able to get done was the provision that says we are going to \nask the administration to come back with recommendations on how they \ncan reduce the number of people who are sent to the Senate for advice \nand consent to streamline the process.\n  This amendment would make this Presidential appointment process in \nregard to the Director of Budget and Management and the Deputy Director \nmuch more complicated than it is today. I would also argue--with due \nrespect to the expertise that is on the Budget Committee--that this \nprocess has not been looked at since 1974.\n  As a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee and the oversight \nof Government management in the Federal workforce, I have been \nconcerned that we have not looked at that process since 1974--that we \nhave discussed the feasibility of going to a 2-year budget. There are \nmany things, in my opinion, that this body should be doing, and if it \nwere solely within the jurisdiction of the Budget Committee, it might \nnot get done. The Governmental Affairs Committee looks at the big \npicture.\n  I would also argue that too often in the Office of Budget and \nManagement, there is no ``M'' in OMB. I am pleased to say that this \nadministration has undertaken some very aggressive management \nresponsibilities. I, quite frankly, think they would not have \nundertaken those management responsibilities had it not been for the \nfact that they had to be confirmed by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee of the U.S. Senate.\n  I know the relationships that I have built personally with the \nDirector of the Office of Budget and Management; Sean O'Keefe, who was \nthe Deputy Director, and now Director Josh Bolten, have really accrued \nto the benefit of our country in terms of improving the management of \nGovernment.\n  So what I am trying to say is the budget process is important not \nonly to the Budget Committee but the budget process is important to the \nentire country and to the operation of Government because it has such a \nlarge impact on the whole operation of Government.\n  I respect the chairman of the Budget Committee, but as one who has \nbeen concerned about modernizing our procedures, I believe this would \nnot promote what is in the best interest of the Senate or, for that \nmatter, our country.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the human \ncapital changes that have occurred since 1999 that have come out of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S10907]]\n\nU.S. Senator George V. Voinovich, Ohio--An Agenda To Reform the Federal \n                       Workforce: Accomplishments\n\n       Senator Voinovich has made identifying and developing \n     solutions to the federal government's strategic human capital \n     challenges his highest priority for his Subcommittee on \n     Oversight of Government Management. He has held 15 hearings \n     on the subject, spoken at numerous public conferences, and \n     was a key participant in the Harvard University John F. \n     Kennedy School of Government Executive Sessions on the Future \n     of the Public Service in 2001-2002. He has brought together \n     the best minds in academia, government and the private sector \n     to address these issues and developed a forward-looking \n     legislative agenda. Taken together, the legislation he has \n     sponsored and cosponsored represents the most significant \n     governmentwide changes to the federal civil service system \n     since passage of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.\n       Legislation sponsored by Senator Voinovich enacted into \n     law:\n       Department of Defense Civilian Workforce Reshaping \n     Authority as part of the FY 2001 Defense Authorization, \n     became law on October 30, 2000.\n       Several major provisions of S. 2651, the Federal Workforce \n     Improvement Act of 2002, were included in the Homeland \n     Security Act of 2002, Public Law 107-296, November 25, 2002. \n     Its most important provisions: agency chief human capital \n     officers (at the 24 largest federal agencies); an interagency \n     chief human capital officers council (codifying the Human \n     Resources Management Council); an OPM-designed set of \n     systems, including metrics, for assessing agency human \n     capital management; inclusion of agency human capital \n     strategic planning in annual performance plans and program \n     performance reports required by GPRA; reform of the \n     competitive service hiring process (use of a category ranking \n     system instead of the Rule of Three); permanent extension, \n     revision, and expansion of voluntary separation incentive pay \n     and voluntary early retirement (``buyouts'' and ``early-\n     outs'');\n       S. 926, the Federal Employee Student Loan Assistance Act, \n     Public Law 108-123, November 11, 2003. The law raises to \n     $10,000 and $60,000, respectively, the annual and aggregate \n     limits of student loan repayment federal agencies may offer \n     employees as incentives.\n       S. 1683, the Federal Law Enforcement Pay and Benefits \n     Parity Act of 2003, Public Law 108-196, December 19, 2003. \n     The law required OPM to conduct a study of federal law \n     enforcement compensation and classification to inform reform \n     efforts. It was submitted to Congress on July 16, 2004.\n       S. 610, NASA Workforce Flexibility Act of 2004, Public Law \n     108-201, February 24, 2004. The law provides new personnel \n     flexibilities to the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration to recruit and retain a technology savvy \n     workforce for NASA's high-tech mission.\n       H.R. 2751, GAO Human Capital Reform Act of 2004, Public Law \n     108-271, July 7, 2004. H.R. 2751 was the House companion to \n     Senator Voinovich's bill S. 1522, which passed the Senate on \n     November 24, 2003. It provides several new personnel \n     flexibilities to the now U.S. Government Accountability \n     Office.\n       Legislation cosponsored by Senator Voinovich enacted into \n     law:\n       The Homeland Security Act of 2002, Public Law 107-296, \n     November 25, 2002, allowed the new department to design a new \n     personnel system for its 170,000 employees to meet its \n     mission needs.\n       The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2004, Public Law 108-136, November 24, 2003, includes the \n     National Security Personnel System (NSPS). Senator Voinovich \n     had a role in drafting the Senate version of NSPS, S. 1166. \n     NSPS will provide significant personnel flexibilities to the \n     Department of Defense similar to those at the Department of \n     Homeland Security. In addition, this Act contains a provision \n     that alleviates pay compression in the Senior Executive \n     Service. Senator Voinovich had introduced a separate bill, S. \n     768, to accomplish this.\n       Legislation sponsored by Senator Voinovich currently under \n     Congressional consideration:\n       S. 129, Federal Workforce Flexibility Act of 2003, was \n     passed by the Senate on April 8, 2004, and it contains \n     additional governmentwide human capital reforms. The House \n     Committee on Government Reform considered and reported S. 129 \n     to the full House on June 24, 2004. Senator Voinovich \n     understands that the bill should pass the House the week of \n     October 4th and return to the Senate for final passage.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I would like to emphasize for my colleagues how \nimportant it is that this jurisdiction in terms of the Director of \nBudget and Management and the Deputy Director remains in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee.\n  I would like to make one other point; that point is, the jurisdiction \nof our committee has been stripped out for the last couple of days. So \nI just urge my colleagues--I am going to ask for a vote. I think it is \nimportant to the management of our country.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to speak and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for my friend to say the jurisdiction of the \ncommittee has been stripped out in the last few days, he should come in \ncontact with reality. It simply is not true. How many times people come \nand say that does not make it true. The governmental affairs/homeland \nsecurity committee is going to be one of most powerful committees in \nthe Congress. Last year, as I understand, they had about 900 bills \nreferred to them. This next year, it will probably be 3,000 bills \nreferred to them. They have jurisdiction over wide-ranging matters. A \nfew little things have been taken from Governmental Affairs, but they \nhave been given a truckload of stuff.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator in \nNevada for his comments. He is exactly right. For anybody to suggest \nGovernmental Affairs has had their jurisdiction reduced here, I mean, \ncome on. Governmental Affairs has had their jurisdiction dramatically \nincreased.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today with my \nranking member, Senator Conrad, would consolidate jurisdiction for the \ncongressional budget process within the Senate Committee on the Budget \nand establish shared jurisdiction with the new Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs over the nomination and confirmation \nof the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The amendment \nwould preserve the Government Affairs Committee's jurisdiction over \nmanagement and accounting measures.\n  Under current Senate rules, jurisdiction over budget process matters \nis shared with the Committee on Governmental Affairs, a situation that \ngrew out of the creation of the Budget Committee and the modern budget \nprocess in 1974.\n  This shared jurisdiction is unique in the Senate, where committees \nrarely share jurisdiction, and where joint referral of legislation is \nonly accomplished by unanimous consent.\n  Since 1977, the Budget and Governmental Affairs Committees have \nreceived joint referral for legislation affecting the budget process \npursuant to a unanimous-consent agreement. Under that UC, if one \ncommittee acts on a bill the other committee must act within 30 days or \nbe automatically discharged. Our amendment would supercede this consent \nagreement.\n  We all know the Federal budget process is very complicated. The \nexpertise on this subject clearly resides in the Budget Committee, and \nSenator Conrad and I believe that is where these issues should be \naddressed.\n  Over the years, the Governmental Affairs Committee has done little \nwork on the budget process. Although the current jurisdictional \nsituation has not necessarily created significant problems, we believe \nit is simply unnecessary to have two committees involved in these \nissues.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee has a very broad and expansive \njurisdiction which the resolution being considered would expand even \nfurther to matters of homeland security.\n  Senator Conrad and I believe consolidating jurisdiction over budget \nprocess issues within the Budget Committee would eliminate confusion \nand guarantee that this work is performed by those with the expertise.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support our amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the \namendment from the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Nickles.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Ohio just got it wrong, what the \namendment of the Senator who is the chairman of the Budget Committee \ndoes. We do not take the jurisdiction of Governmental Affairs on \nmanagement issues at all, not at all. That is not what the amendment \ndoes.\n  What the amendment does do is end the duplication of the jurisdiction \nof the committees on budget process issues. I would submit to my \ncolleagues, it does not make any sense any longer, after 30 years, for \nGovernmental Affairs and Budget to have joint jurisdiction on budget \nprocess issues.\n\n[[Page S10908]]\n\n  The reason they have that joint jurisdiction is because Governmental \nAffairs wrote the Budget Act. There was no Budget Committee, so at that \ntime they had expertise that the Budget Committee simply did not have, \nso they were included on jurisdiction on budget process issues.\n  Well, 30 years have passed. The expertise on these issues is on the \nBudget Committee. It makes no sense in any management sense to have \njoint jurisdiction on budget process issues--not on the management \nissues. The management issues are retained by Governmental Affairs, as \nthey should be. But budget process issues, as the chairman of the \nBudget Committee has suggested in his amendment, ought to be the \njurisdiction of the Budget Committee.\n  Second, it makes no earthly sense for the nominee to be the Budget \nDirector only to go before the Governmental Affairs Committee. That is \nwhat happens now. I think my colleagues would be stunned--I must say, I \nwas very surprised, serving on the Budget Committee--that the Director \nof the Budget does not come before the Budget Committee. What sense \ndoes that make?\n  The amendment of the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator \nNickles of Oklahoma, does not expand the jurisdiction of the Senate \nBudget Committee. It simply eliminates the overlap in jurisdiction \nbetween the two committees on the narrow issue of budget process \nissues.\n  The expertise on budget process issues, on pay-go, on discretionary \ncaps, on oversight of budget agreements, does not reside with the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs; it resides in the Budget Committee. \nWe ought to clean up this overlap that has existed for 30 years that \nstarted for a good reason--because the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs wrote the Budget Act because there was no Budget Committee. But \nnow there is a Budget Committee. It has been in existence 30 years. It \nought to have jurisdiction over budget process issues. That just makes \ncommon sense.\n  Who could possibly defend the notion that a Budget Director should \nnot come before the Budget Committee for confirmation? It makes no \nearthly sense.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma is entirely reasonable. It \nis rational. It improves the operations of both committees. It does not \ntake jurisdiction to the Budget Committee; it simply reduces the common \njurisdiction that currently exists between Governmental Affairs and the \nBudget Committee on the narrow issue of budget process.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to yield after this statement.\n  And it gives to the Budget Committee the right to hear from the \nOffice of Management and Budget, the man who is named or the woman who \nis named Budget Director in the confirmation process. That just makes \ncommon sense.\n  I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. The question I would like to ask is, Has the procedure \nthat we now have in terms of the appointment--and this has been for 30 \nyears--diminished the effectiveness of the Budget Committee, because of \nthe fact that they have not participated in the nomination of the \nBudget Director?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I believe the answer simply has to be yes. It makes no \nearthly sense for the person who is named to be the budget director of \nthe United States not to come before the Budget Committee. What sense \ncould that possibly make?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from North Dakota has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I apologize to the Senator from Ohio. \nWe are running out of time, and the distinguished senior Senator from \nTexas has an amendment she needs to be able to describe.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4015 to Amendment No. 3981\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4015.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up a second-degree amendment \nNo. 4042.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4042 to amendment No. 4015.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To implement responsible subcommittee reorganization in the \n                      Committee on Appropriations)\n\n       Strike ``not later than 2 weeks'' and insert ``as soon as \n     possible''\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for adoption \nof the second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nsecond-degree amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4042) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, my amendment simply keeps what the \nSenate has said it wants, and that is an intelligence subcommittee on \nAppropriations, and it keeps the 13 subcommittees of Appropriations. It \nsays the Appropriations Committee will organize into 13 subcommittees \nwith the intelligence subcommittee as soon as possible after the \nconvening of the 109th Congress.\n  All my amendment does is keep the Appropriations subcommittees at the \nsame number, making sure there is one intelligence subcommittee, but it \ndoes not require the merging of Defense and Military Construction.\n  It may be that when the Appropriations Committee looks at all of the \noptions for the making of 13 subcommittees, that that will happen, but \nI think the Appropriations Committee should be the one that makes the \nrecommendations to the Senate. We do not have to rush to make this \ndecision for the Appropriations Committee.\n  According to the CRS, eliminating a subcommittee through a measure on \nthe Senate floor is unprecedented. In more than 200 years, the CRS \nsays, the Senate has never eliminated a subcommittee through floor \naction without the committee bringing it to the floor. The Senate has \ncreated subcommittees, as with the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on \nInvestigations in 1952, but not eliminated subcommittees. Merging \nsubcommittees to create room for the new one may be the right thing to \ndo, but the floor is the wrong place to do it.\n  What is proposed today will set a precedent that could impact every \ncommittee by pulling the ability of the committee to organize itself \nand having that agreed to by the Senate. This is a precedent that \nshould concern every committee. It should concern the majority and the \nminority. There is no reason to make this decision now.\n\n  Also, these changes must be made in conjunction with the House. The \nHouse Appropriations subcommittees and the Senate Appropriations \nsubcommittees should match so that when we conference, we will have a \nfinite subcommittee that deals with the same issues; otherwise, there \ncould be many problems with the appropriations process that would \ncomplicate an already complicated process.\n  The House has not made any decisions about reorganizing itself on the \nAppropriations Committee. The wise thing for the Senate to do would be \nto create the new intelligence subcommittee of the Appropriations \nCommittee, determine that there will be 13 subcommittees but require \nthe Appropriations Committee to do the reorganization, after which the \nSenate would\n\n[[Page S10909]]\n\nbe asked to agree. That is all my amendment does.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 \nminutes in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I serve on the Appropriations Committee with \nthe distinguished Senator from Texas. She certainly is one of the \nfinest Senators here. But on this issue I disagree with her. In the \nunderlying legislation before the Senate, there has been a \nconsolidation of Defense appropriations and Military Construction. This \ncertainly makes sense. The subject matter is related to the same \nplayers, same departments, military, same basis. It does not make sense \nto make the artificial divide for Construction. I have served as \nchairman of the Military Construction Subcommittee, and I enjoyed it, \nbut I always wondered why it was a separate subcommittee.\n  It does, however, make sense to pull intelligence from defense and \nmake it a separate subcommittee. That is what we have done. We have \ntalked to experts, and we think this is the best way to do it. We \nshould keep this plan intact. It is the right thing to do.\n  The legislation we now have before the Senate is a good package. I \ndon't think it should be splintered with trying to have the Committee \non Appropriations rearrange what we have done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the remaining time that I have to the Senator \nfrom Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4027\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I would just like to emphasize again \nthat the current situation is one that is working. Unless one can show \nthat it is not working in terms of the authority or the jurisdiction of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee, I would argue, why change it.\n  Secondly, this amendment would then subject the appointees of the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget, the Deputy Director, \nand other people to jurisdictions in two committees, which would make \nthe appointment process longer than it is today in an area that is \nparticularly important to the President. What he wants to do \nimmediately is to get his director of budget on board.\n  Secondly, I think we need to point out that the budget process is not \njust the jurisdiction of the Budget Committee. Under this amendment, if \nI want to put a bill in, for example, to reform the budget process to \n2-year budgets, to require that the budget include a presentation on \nthe accrued liabilities of the United States and, for that matter, go \nback and look at the Budget Act of 1974, which should be updated, that \nbill would have to go to the Budget Committee. If the members of that \ncommittee were unhappy with that, if they like the process of 1-year \nbudgets because of the fact that they like to take a bite out of the \napple each year, that bill would be dead.\n  Under the current situation, if someone has an idea of improving the \nbudget process that impacts not only the budget but the entire \noperation of Government, they can bring it to the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. We could handle that legislation, and then that legislation \nwould have to be referred to the Budget Committee for their \nconsideration. The fact is, this is too large a responsibility just to \nput it within the jurisdiction of the Budget Committee. I argue that it \nmakes a lot of sense to leave the situation as it is unless somebody \ncan tell me that it is not working.\n  I will say one other thing: Our Government's biggest problem today is \nmanagement. Having jurisdiction of the Office of Management and Budget \nin Governmental Affairs has given this Senator a lot of leverage to get \nthis administration to do some things that are important for the \ncountry.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like the record to reflect that when \nI spoke regarding Senator Voinovich earlier, I said there were \napproximately 900 bills referred to the Governmental Operations \nCommittee. I misspoke. It is 300. I want the record to reflect the \nproper number.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the first \nvote occur on the Nickles amendment, to be followed by a vote on the \nHutchison amendment.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 4041\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I believe we need the yeas and nays on the \nNickles amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Nickles second-degree amendment \nNo. 4041.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. \nCampbell), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Chambliss), the Senator from \nTexas (Mr. Cornyn), the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Craig), the Senator \nfrom South Carolina (Mr. Graham), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nSpecter), and the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. Sununu) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nTexas (Mr. Cornyn) would vote ``yea.''.\n  Mr. REID.

One minute to speak on the amendment just voted on by \nSenator Nickles, followed by 2 minutes equally divided by Senator Hatch \nand Senator Leahy.\n\n[[Page S10910]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Senator to modify his request to allow 1 minute \non each side prior to voting on the Hutchison amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

I especially thank my colleague and friend, Senator \nConrad, for his eloquent debate on it, as well as for his support and \ncosponsorship of the amendment.\n  I think it is a good amendment. I think it helps the budget process. \nAlso, I compliment my friend. It has been a pleasure to work with him \non the Budget Committee. This was a good, positive budget change. I \nthank him for his leadership on this amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nimmediately proceed to the consideration of H.R. 5107, the DNA bill, \nwhich is at the desk; further, that the bill be read a third time and \npassed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; provided \nfurther, that when the Senate receives from the House a correcting \nenrollment resolution relating to H.R. 5107, the Senate proceed to its \nconsideration and the resolution be agreed to and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table. Finally, I ask unanimous consent \nthat if the House does not adopt the correcting enrollment resolution \nby the end of this Congress, then the Senate action on H.R. 5107 be \nvitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 5107) was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this is the very important DNA bill which \nwill help resolve the difficulties with over 400,000 rape kits in this \ncountry, some of which are 20 years old or older.\n  Mr. President, I would just like to compliment Debbie Smith and Kirk \nBloodsworth, who are two of the initiating people who have helped bring \nthis about, but also all the people who worked so hard: Senator Leahy, \nSenator Biden, Senator Specter, Senator Feinstein, Senator DeWine and, \nof course on the House side, Chairman Sensenbrenner and Representative \nBill Delahunt for their dogged determination, and to Senators Kyl, \nSessions, and Cornyn who did a really great job on this bill; also \nstaff on both sides, in both Houses.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as the primary drafter of Title I of H.R. \n5107, I would like to make a few comments. After extensive consultation \nwith my colleagues, broad bipartisan consensus was reached and the \nlanguage in Title I was agreed to.\n  I would like to make it clear that it is not the intent of this bill \nto limit any laws in favor of crime victims that may currently exist, \nwhether these laws are statutory, regulatory, or found in case law. I \nwould like to turn to the bill itself and address the first section, \n(a)(1), the right of the crime victim to be reasonably protected. Of \ncourse the government cannot protect the crime victim in all \ncircumstances. However, where reasonable, the crime victim should be \nprovided accommodations such as a secure waiting area, away from the \ndefendant before and after and during breaks in the proceedings. The \nright to protection also extends to require reasonable conditions of \npre-trial and post-conviction relief that include protections for the \nvictim's safety.\n  I would like to address the notice provisions of (a)(2). The notice \nprovisions are important because if a victim fails to receive notice of \na public proceeding in the criminal case at which the victim's right \ncould otherwise have been exercised, that right has effectively been \ndenied. Public court proceedings include both trial level and appellate \nlevel court proceedings. It does not make sense to enact victims' \nrights that are rendered useless because the victim never knew of the \nproceeding at which the right had to be asserted. Simply put, a failure \nto provide notice of proceedings at which a right can be asserted is \nequivalent to a violation of the right itself.\n  Equally important to this right to notice of public proceedings is \nthe right to notice of the escape or release of the accused. This \nprovision helps to protect crime victims by notifying them that the \naccused is out on the streets.\n  For these rights to notice to be effective, notice must be \nsufficiently given in advance of a proceeding to give the crime victim \nthe opportunity to arrange his or her affairs in order to be able to \nattend that proceeding and any scheduling of proceedings should take \ninto account the victim's schedule to facilitate effective notice.\n  Restrictions on public proceedings are in 28 CFR Sec. 50.9 and it is \nnot the intent here today to alter the meaning of that provision.\n  Too often crime victims have been unable to exercise their rights \nbecause they were not informed of the proceedings. Pleas and \nsentencings have all too frequently occurred without the victim ever \nknowing that they were taking place. Victims are the persons who are \ndirectly harmed by the crime and they have a stake in the criminal \nprocess because of that harm. Their lives are significantly altered by \nthe crime and they have to live with the consequences for the rest of \ntheir lives. To deny them the opportunity to know of and be present at \nproceedings is counter to the fundamental principles of this country. \nIt is simply wrong. Moreover, victim safety requires that notice of the \nrelease or escape of an accused from custody be made in a timely manner \nto allow the victim to make informed choices about his or her own \nsafety. This provision ensures that takes place.\n  I would like to turn to (a)(3), which provides that the crime victim \nhas the right not to be excluded from any public proceedings. This \nlanguage was drafted in a way to ensure that the government would not \nbe responsible for paying for the victim's travel and lodging to a \nplace where they could attend the proceedings.\n  In all other respects, this section is intended to grant victims the \nright to attend and be present throughout all public proceedings.\n  This right is limited in two respects. First, the right is limited to \npublic proceedings, thus grand jury proceedings are excluded from the \nright. Second, the government or the defendant can request, and the \ncourt can order, judicial proceedings to be closed under existing laws. \nThis provision is not intended to alter those laws or their procedures \nin any way. There may be organized crime cases or cases involving \nnational security that require procedures that necessarily deny a crime \nvictim the right not to be excluded that would otherwise be provided \nunder this section. This is as it should be. National security matters \nand organized crime cases are especially challenging and there are \ntimes when there is a vital need for closed proceedings. In such cases, \nthe proceedings are not intended to be interpreted as ``public \nproceedings'' under this bill. In this regard, it is not our intent to \nalter 28 CFR Sec. 50.9 in any respect.\n  Despite these limitations, this bill allows crime victims, in the \nvast majority of cases, to attend the hearings and trial of the case \ninvolving their victimization. This is so important because crime \nvictims share an interest with the government in seeing that justice is \ndone in a criminal case and this interest supports the idea that \nvictims should not be excluded from public criminal proceedings, \nwhether these are pre-trial, trial, or post-trial proceedings.\n  When ``the court, after receiving clear and convincing evidence, \ndetermines that testimony by the victim would be materially altered if \nthe victim heard other testimony at that proceeding,'' a victim may be \nexcluded. The standards of ``clear and convincing evidence'' and \n``materially altered'' are extremely high and intended to make \nexclusion of the victim quite rare, especially since (b) says that \n``before making a determination described in subsection (a)(3), the \ncourt shall make every effort to permit the fullest attendance possible \nby the victim and shall consider reasonable alternatives to the \nexclusion of the victim from the\n\n[[Page S10911]]\n\ncriminal proceeding.'' It should be stressed that (b) requires that \n``the reasons for any decision denying relief under this chapter shall \nbe clearly stated on the record.'' A judge should explain in detail the \nprecise reasons why relief is being denied.\n  This right of crime victims not to be excluded from the proceedings \nprovides a foundation for (a)(4), which provides victims the right to \nreasonably be heard at any public proceeding involving release, plea, \nor sentencing. This provision is intended to allow crime victims to \ndirectly address the court in person. It is not necessary for the \nvictim to obtain the permission of either party to do so. This right is \na right independent of the government or the defendant that allows the \nvictim to address the court. To the extent the victim has the right to \nindependently address the court, the victim acts as an independent \nparticipant in the proceedings. When a victim invokes this right during \nplea and sentencing proceedings, it is intended that the he or she be \nallowed to provide all three types of victim impact: the character of \nthe victim, the impact of the crime on the victim, the victims' family \nand the community, and sentencing recommendations. Of course, the \nvictim may use a lawyer, at the victim's own expense, to assist in the \nexercise of this right. This bill does not provide victims with a right \nto counsel but recognizes that a victim may enlist a counsel on their \nown.\n\n  It is not the intent of the term ``reasonably'' in the phrase ``to be \nreasonably heard'' to provide any excuse for denying a victim the right \nto appear in person and directly address the court. Indeed, the very \npurpose of this section is to allow the victim to appear personally and \ndirectly address the court. This section would fail in its intent if \ncourts determined that written, rather than oral communication, could \ngenerally satisfy this right. On the other hand, the term \n``reasonably'' is meant to allow for alternative methods of \ncommunicating a victim's views to the court when the victim is unable \nto attend the proceedings. Such circumstances might arise, for example, \nif the victim is incarcerated on unrelated matters at the time of the \nproceedings or if a victim cannot afford to travel to a courthouse. In \nsuch cases, communication by the victim to the court is permitted by \nother reasonable means. In short, the victim of crime, or their \ncounsel, should be able to provide any information, as well as their \nopinion, directly to the court concerning the release, plea, or \nsentencing of the accused. This bill intends for this right to be heard \nto be an independent right of the victim.\n  It is important that the ``reasonably be heard'' language not be an \nexcuse for minimizing the victim's opportunity to be heard. Only if it \nis not practical for the victim to speak in person or if the victim \nwishes to be heard by the court in a different fashion should this \nprovision mean anything other than an in-person right to be heard.\n  Of course, in providing victim information or opinion it is important \nthat the victim be able to confer with the prosecutor concerning a \nvariety of matters and proceedings. Under (a)(5), the victim has a \nreasonable right to confer with the attorney for the government in the \ncase. This right is intended to be expansive. For example, the victim \nhas the right to confer with the government concerning any critical \nstage or disposition of the case. The right, however, it is not limited \nto these examples. This right to confer does not give the crime victim \nany right to direct the prosecution. Prosecutors should consider it \npart of their profession to be available to consult with crime victims \nabout concerns the victims may have which are pertinent to the case, \ncase proceedings or dispositions. Under this provision, victims are \nable to confer with the government's attorney about proceedings after \ncharging. I would note that the right to confer does impair the \nprosecutiorial discretion of the Attorney General or any officer under \nhis direction, as provided (d)(6).\n  I would like to turn now to restitution in (a)(6). This section \nprovides the right to full and timely restitution as provided in law. \nWe specifically intend to endorse the expansive definition of \nrestitution given by Judge Cassell in U.S. v. Bedonie and U.S. v. \nSerawop in May 2004. This right, together with the other rights in the \nact to be heard and confer with the government's attorney in this act, \nmeans that existing restitution laws will be more effective.\n  I would like to move on to (a)(7), which provides crime victims with \na right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay. This provision \ndoes not curtail the government's need for reasonable time to organize \nand prosecute its case. Nor is the provision intended to infringe on \nthe defendant's due process right to prepare a defense. Too often, \nhowever, delays in criminal proceedings occur for the mere convenience \nof the parties and those delays reach beyond the time needed for \ndefendant's due process or the government's need to prepare. The result \nof such delays is that victims cannot begin to put the criminal justice \nsystem behind them and they continue to be victimized. It is not right \nto hold crime victims under the stress and pressure of future court \nproceedings merely because it is convenient for the parties or the \ncourt.\n  This provision should be interpreted so that any decision to \nschedule, reschedule, or continue criminal cases should include victim \ninput through the victim's assertion of the right to be free from \nunreasonable delay.\n  I would add that the delays in criminal proceedings are among the \nmost chronic problems faced by victims. Whatever peace of mind a victim \nmight achieve after a crime is too often inexcusably postponed by \nunreasonable delays in the criminal case. A central reason for these \nrights is to force a change in a criminal justice culture which has \nfailed to focus on the legitimate interests of crime victims, a new \nfocus on limiting unreasonable delays in the criminal process to \naccommodate the victim is a positive start.\n  I would like to turn to (a)(8). The broad rights articulated in this \nsection are meant to be rights themselves and are not intended to just \nbe aspirational. One of these rights is the right to be treated with \nfairness. Of course, fairness includes the notion of due process. Too \noften victims of crime experience a secondary victimization at the \nhands of the criminal justice system. This provision is intended to \ndirect government agencies and employees, whether they are in executive \nor judicial branches, to treat victims of crime with the respect they \ndeserve and to afford them due process.\n  It is not the intent of this bill that its significance be whittled \ndown or marginalized by the courts or the executive branch. This \nlegislation is meant to correct, not continue, the legacy of the poor \ntreatment of crime victims in the criminal process. This legislation is \nmeant to ensure that cases like the McVeigh case, where victims of the \nOklahoma City bombing were effectively denied the right to attend the \ntrial and to avoid federal appeals courts from determining, as the \nTenth Circuit Court of Appeals did, that victims had no standing to \nseek review of their right to attend the trial under the former \nvictims' law that this bill replaces.\n  I would also like to comment on (b), which directs courts to ensure \nthat the rights in this law be afforded and to record, on the record, \nany reason for denying relief of an assertion of a crime victim. This \nprovision is critical because it is in the courts of this country that \nthese rights will be asserted and it is the courts that will be \nresponsible for enforcing them. Further, requiring a court to provide \nthe reasons for denial of relief is necessary for effective appeal of \nsuch denial.\n\n  Turning briefly to (c), there are several important things to point \nout. First, this provision requires that the government inform the \nvictim that the victim can seek the advice of the attorney, such as \nfrom the legal clinics for crime victims contemplated under this law, \nsuch as the law clinics at Arizona State University and those supported \nby the National Crime Victim Law Institute at the Law School at Lewis \nand Clark College in Portland, Oregon. This is an important protection \nfor crime victims because it ensures the independent and individual \nnature of their rights. Second, the notice section immediately \nfollowing limits the right to notice of release where such notice may \nendanger the safety of the person being released. There are cases, \nparticularly in domestic violence cases, where there is danger posed by \nan intimate partner if the intimate partner is\n\n[[Page S10912]]\n\nreleased. Such circumstances are not the norm, even in domestic \nviolence cases as a category of cases. This exception should not be \nrelied upon as an excuse to avoid notifying most victims.\n  I would now like to address the enforcement provisions of the bill in \n(d). This provision allows a crime victim to enter the criminal trial \ncourt during proceedings involving the crime against the victim, to \nstand with other counsel in the well of the court, and assert the \nrights provided by this bill. This provision ensures that crime victims \nhave standing to be heard in trial courts so that they are heard at the \nvery moment when their rights are at stake and this, in turn, forces \nthe criminal justice system to be responsive to a victim's rights in a \ntimely way. Importantly, however, the bill does not allow the defendant \nin the case to assert any of the victim's rights to obtain relief. This \nprohibition prevents the individual accused of the crime from \ndistorting a right intended for the benefit of the individual victim \ninto a weapon against justice.\n  The provision allows the crime victim's representative and the \nattorney for the government to go into a criminal trial court and \nassert the crime victim's rights. The inclusions of representatives and \nthe government's attorney in the provision are important for a number \nof reasons. First, allowing a representative to assert a crime victim's \nrights ensures that where a crime victim is unable to assert the rights \non his or her own for any reason, including incapacity, incompetence, \nminority, or death, those rights are not lost. The representative for \nthe crime victim can assert the rights. Second, a crime victim may \nchoose to enlist a private attorney to represent him or her in the \ncriminal case--this provision allows that attorney to enter an \nappearance on behalf of the victim in the criminal trial court and \nassert the victim's rights. The provision also recognizes that, at \ntimes, the government's attorney may be best situated to assert a crime \nvictim's rights either because the crime victim is not available at a \nparticular point in the trial or because, at times, the crime victim's \ninterests coincide with those of the government and it makes sense for \na single person to express those joined interests. Importantly, \nhowever, the provision does not mean that the government's attorney has \nthe authority to compromise or co-opt a victim's right. Nor does the \nprovision mean that by not asserting a victim's right the government's \nattorney has waived that right. The rights provided in this bill are \npersonal to the individual crime victim and it is that crime victim \nthat has the final word regarding which of the specific rights to \nassert and when. Waiver of any of the individual rights provided can \nonly happen by the victim's affirmative waiver of that specific right.\n  In sum, without the ability to enforce the rights in the criminal \ntrial and appellate courts of this country any rights afforded are, at \nbest, rhetoric. We are far past the point where lip service to victims' \nrights is acceptable. The enforcement provisions of this bill ensure \nthat never again are victim's rights provided in word but not in \nreality.\n  I want to turn to (d)(2) because it is an unfortunate reality that in \ntoday's world there are crimes that result in multiple victims. The \nreality of those situations is that a court may find that the sheer \nnumber of victims is so large that it is impracticable to accord each \nvictim the rights in this bill. The bill allows that when the court \nmakes that finding on the record the court must then fashion a \nprocedure that still gives effect to the bill and yet takes into \naccount the impracticability. For instance, in the Oklahoma City \nbombing case the number of victims was tremendous and attendance at any \none proceeding by all of them was impracticable so the court fashioned \na procedure that allowed victims to attend the proceedings by close \ncircuit television. This is merely one example. Another may be to allow \nvictims with a right to speak to be heard in writing or through other \nmethods. Importantly, courts must seek to identify methods that fit the \ncase before that to ensure that despite the high number of crime \nvictims, the rights in this bill are given effect. It is a tragic \nreality that cases may involve multiple victims and yet that fact is \nnot grounds for eviscerating the rights in this bill. Rather, that fact \nis grounds for the court to find an alternative procedure to give \neffect to this bill.\n  I now want to turn to another critical aspect of enforcement of \nvictims' rights, (d)(3). This subsection provides that a crime victim \nwho is denied any of his or her rights as a crime victim has standing \nto seek appellate review of that denial. Specifically, the provision \nallows a crime victim to apply for a writ of mandamus to the \nappropriate appellate court. The provision provides that court shall \ntake the writ and shall order the relief necessary to protect the crime \nvictim's right. This provision is critical for a couple of reasons. \nFirst, it gives the victim standing to appear before the appellate \ncourts of this country and ask for review of a possible error below. \nSecond, while mandamus is generally discretionary, this provision means \nthat courts must review these cases. Appellate review of denials of \nvictims' rights is just as important as the initial assertion of a \nvictim's right. This provision ensures review and encourages courts to \nbroadly defend the victims' rights.\n  Without the right to seek appellate review and a guarantee that the \nappellate court will hear the appeal and order relief, a victim is left \nto the mercy of the very trial court that may have erred. This \ncountry's appellate courts are designed to remedy errors of lower \ncourts and this provision requires them to do so for victim's rights. \nFor a victim's right to truly be honored, a victim must be able to \nassert the rights in trial courts, to then be able to have denials of \nthose rights reviewed at the appellate level, and to have the appellate \ncourt take the appeal and order relief. By providing for all of this, \nthis bill ensures that victims' rights will have meaning. It is the \nclear intent and expectation of Congress that the district and \nappellate courts will establish procedures that will allow for a prompt \nadjudication of any issues regarding the assertion of a victim's right, \nwhile giving meaning to the rights we establish.\n  I would like to turn our attention to (d)(4) because that also \nprovides an enforcement mechanism. This section provides that in any \nappeal, regardless of the party initiating the appeal, the government \ncan assert as error the district court's denial of a crime victim's \nright. This subsection is important for a couple of reasons. First, it \nallows the government to assert a victim's right on appeal even when it \nis the defendant who seeks appeal of his or her conviction. This \nensures that victims' rights are protected throughout the criminal \njustice process and that they do not fall by the wayside during what \ncan often be an extended appeal that the victim is not a party to.\n  I would like to turn to the next provision, (d)(5). This provision is \nnot intended to prevent courts from vacating decisions in non-trial \nproceedings, such as proceedings involving release, delay, pleas, or \nsentencings, in which victims' rights were not protected, and ordering \nthose proceedings to be redone.\n  It is important for victims' rights to be asserted and protected \nthroughout the criminal justice process, and for courts to have the \nauthority to redo proceedings such as release, delay, pleas, and \nsentencings, where victims' rights are abridged.\n  I want to turn to the definitions in the bill, contained in (e). \nThere are a couple of key points to be made about the definitions. A \n``crime victim'' is defined as a person directly and proximately harmed \nas a result of a federal offense or an offense in the District of \nColumbia. This is an intentionally broad definition because all victims \nof crime deserve to have their rights protected, whether or not they \nare the victim of the count charged. Additionally, crime victims may, \nfor any number of reasons, want to employ an attorney to represent them \nin court. This definition of crime victim allows crime victims to do \nthat. It also assures that when, for any reason, crime victims unable \nto assert rights on their own--those rights will still be protected.\n  Now I would like to turn to the portion of the bill concerning \nadministrative compliance with victims' rights. The provisions of (f) \nare relatively self-explanatory, but it important to point out that \nthese procedures are completely separate from and in no way limit the \nvictim's rights in the previous section.\n  I also would like to make it clear that it is the intention of the \nCongress\n\n[[Page S10913]]\n\nthat the money authorized in 1404D for the Director of the Office for \nVictims of Crimes ``for the support of organizations that provide legal \ncounsel and support services for victims in criminal cases for the \nenforcement of crime victims' rights in Federal jurisdictions, and in \nStates and tribal governments . . .'' is intended to support the work \nof the National Crime Victim Law Institute at the Law School at Lewis \nand Clark College in Portland, Oregon, and to replicate across the \nnation the clinics that it is supporting, fashioned after the Crime \nVictims Legal Assistance Project housed at Arizona State University \nCollege of Law and run by Arizona Voice for Crime Victims. The Director \nof OVC should take care to make sure that these funds go into the \nsupport of these programs so that crime victims can receive free legal \ncounsel to enforce their rights in our federal courts. Only in this way \nwill be able to fully and fairly test whether statutes are enough to \nprotect victims' rights. There is no substitute for testing these \nrights in our courts to see if they have the power to change a culture \nthat for too long has ignored the victim.\n  Let me comment briefly on the provision on reports. Under (a), the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts to report annually the number \nof times a right asserted in a criminal case is denied the relief \nrequested, and the reasons therefore, as well as the number of times a \nmandamus action was brought and the result of that mandamus.\n  Such reporting is the only way we in the Congress and other \ninterested parties can observe whether reforms we mandate are being \ncarried out. No one doubts the difficulty of obtaining case-by-case \ninformation of this nature. Yes, this information is critical to \nunderstanding whether federal statutes really can effectively protect \nvictim's rights or whether a constitutional amendment is necessary. We \nare certain that affected executive and judicial agencies can work \ntogether to implement effective administrative tools to record and \namass this data. We would certainly encourage the National Institute of \nJustice to support any needed research to get this system in place.\n  One final point. Throughout this Act reference is made to the \n``accused.'' The intent is for this word to be used in the broadest \nsense to include both those charged and convicted so that the rights we \nestablish apply throughout the criminal justice system.\n\n\n                                Title IV\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Before we agree to send this bill to the House, there are \na number of concerns raised with respect to the capital-counsel section \nof Title IV that I would like to address with my colleagues. I know \nthat this title has been of particular concern to my friend from Texas, \nSenator Cornyn.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Senator. I do have a number of concerns about \nthe Innocence Protection Act. Namely, I am concerned that under this \nbill, states effectively are required to adhere to a Federal regulatory \nsystem, answering to the Department of Justice, for defense and \nprosecution representation in State capital cases. However, I have been \nencouraged by recent modifications to the bill that lead me to believe \na greater balance has been struck between ensuring strong capital \nrepresentation systems and supporting the prosecution and sentencing of \nviolent criminals. Senator Hatch, is it your belief that such a balance \nhas been struck?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is my belief. And let me first say that I appreciate \nthe concerns of the Senator from Texas as well as those of Senators Kyl \nand Sessions, each of whom have worked very hard on this important \nissue. You bring to the debate a wealth of experience in this area, \nhaving served as Attorney General of your home State of Texas and as a \nJudge, and you have worked tirelessly on this, and I thank you for it.\n  The recent modifications to the bill are a great improvement. The \nbill is the result of the hard work and dedication of many on both \nsides of the aisle. Most importantly, we have significantly reworked \nthis bill so as to address the legitimate concerns you, Senators Kyl \nand Sessions as well as others have raised.\n  Specifically, we made some changes to the capital representation \nsection of the Innocence Protection Act. We worked with the House to \nadd language similar to language in the amendment that you offered in \nthe Judiciary Committee language that would require that a large \nmajority of the funding in this area to go to the trial level, rather \nthan to the appellate or habeas litigation. This shift in funding \nallocation is a further safeguard against your concerns that funds \nmight go to particular advocacy groups because they typically become \ninvolved in these cases at the appellate level.\n  Mr. CORNYN. On this issue--the issue of capital representation, I \nnote that there is a provision in place negotiated by Majority Leader \nDeLay and other members of the Texas delegation in the House designed \nto protect the capital representation system that is in place in Texas? \nDo I understand that correctly?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes. Section 421(d)(1)(C) was added specifically to ensure \nthat Texas, or any other State with a similarly structured system, \nwould qualify as an ``effective system'' under the statute. This \nprovision has been referred to as the ``Texas carve-out'' throughout \ndebate over this bill. It is appropriate in light of the changes Texas \nenacted in order to improve its capital-representation system just 3 \nyears ago.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Senator. I share the perspective that Texas' \nsystem is preserved as a so-called ``effective system'' under the \nstatute. And that is critically important. As you point out, in 2001, \nthe Texas Legislature passed the Texas Fair Defense Act to overhaul \nTexas' indigent criminal defense system. The legislation passed ensures \nprompt appointment of an attorney for indigent criminal defendants, \nprovides guidelines on method of appointment for counsel, establishes \nminimum standards for appointed attorneys in capital cases, and \nprovides both State resources and oversight of county's indigent \ndefense systems through a State Task Force on Indigent Defense. It is \nthis system or any future version of it that specifically is intended \nto be protected by this language, is it not?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is absolutely my understanding.\n  Mr. CORNYN. So under the DeLay proviso, Texas will not have to change \na thing in order to receive grants under this bill--it is automatically \npre-qualified?\n  Mr. HATCH. Absolutely. In fact, it is my understanding that at least \nhalf a dozen other states also will automatically pre-qualify for \nfunding under this proviso.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Senator. This so-called ``Texas carve-out'' \nis critical to my support for this bill. Without the carve-out, Texas \nand other States like it would not qualify for Federal grant funds, \neven though they already have an ``effective system'' for capital \nrepresentation. And, without the carve-out, Texas and other States like \nit would have no incentive to apply for Federal grant funds because the \nFederal grant funds to be received would not exceed the State funds \nthat would have to be spent to become eligible. On the other hand, \nbecause of the ``carve-out,'' Texas and other States like it can keep \nappointment power with locally-elected judges, maintain their own \ninnovations designed to improve--not make impossible--the effective \nrepresentation of capital defendants, and avoid the need for the \ncreation of a new, needlessly expensive, centralized bureaucracy often \ntimes controlled by those who oppose the death penalty such as was the \ncase with the former capital defense Resource Centers that were \ndisbanded by Congress in the 1990's.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would say that the ``carve-out'' is a compromise that is \nconsistent with past Federal assistance to the States' criminal justice \nsystems, and it sets appropriate limits on the level of Federal \ninvolvement in the administration of the death penalty at the state \nlevel.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Thank you for your work on this, Mr. Hatch, and for \nhelping to ensure that my home State of Texas qualifies as having an \n``effective system for providing competent legal representation'' under \nthe legislation.\n  I have two other questions for you. In the new postconviction testing \nremedy created by this legislation for Federal prisoners--at what \napparently will be section 3600(g) the bill allows the court\n\n[[Page S10914]]\n\nto order a new trial if a DNA test result, in light of all of the other \nevidence, establishes, and I quote, ``by compelling evidence that a new \ntrial would result in an acquittal.'' As you recall, the standard for \ngranting new trials in what can sometimes be old cases was much debated \nduring the Judiciary Committee's consideration of this bill. The \nCommittee almost voted in favor of changing this standard of proof from \n``would result in acquittal'' to ``did not commit the crime,'' and some \ndiscussed a middle option of raising the standard from preponderance of \nthe evidence to ``clear and convincing evidence.'' Ultimately, we chose \nto defer addressing this issue until negotiations on a final package \nwith the House of Representatives. And in the end, we chose neither of \nthe standards discussed, but instead opted for elevating the standard \nof proof to ``compelling evidence.''\n  We discussed at the time why ``compelling'' would be the best term of \nart for setting a standard for reopening litigation of an issue. In \nparticular, we looked to two cases that tell us what ``compelling'' \nmeans in this context--cases that give us confidence that we have set a \nhigh bar that will not allow the probably guilty to receive a new \ntrial--and go free if a new trial proves impossible--and also will not \nallow defendants to seek new trials on the basis of evidence that they \ncould have presented all along. As the Chairman of the Committee that \nreported this bill and the Senate companion bill's lead sponsor, I \nthink that you can speak with some authority on this matter, and \nclarify for the record the thinking that went into the House and \nSenate's selection of the word ``compelling.'' Would you do so?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be pleased to do so. In choosing the term \n``compelling,'' we relied on previous interpretation of that term in \ncases such as United States v. Walser, a 1993 case out of the Eleventh \nCircuit. That court analyzed a previous jury's decision--and whether it \ndisadvantaged the defendant--under a standard of ``compelling \nprejudice.'' The court there made clear that it could not find \n``compelling prejudice'' if ``under all the circumstances of [the] \nparticular case it is within the capacity of jurors'' to reach the \nproper result--in the case of this bill, to find that the defendant \ncommitted the crime. If, in light of the DNA test, it would not be \nwithin the capacity of jurors to conclude that the defendant is guilty, \na new trial must be granted under 3600(g). But if they could possibly \nfind guilty, no new trial is allowed. As the Eleventh Circuit \nexplained, under the ``compelling'' standard, if a decision is ``within \nthe jury's capacity''--if it is reasonably possible--then ``though the \ntask be difficult [for the hypothetical jury], there is no compelling \nprejudice''--or in our case, no compelling evidence requiring a new \ntrial.\n\n  As the Walser case also explains, you look to the trial transcript to \ndecide what constitutes ``compelling'' evidence. Obviously, it is the \ndefendant's burden to produce this evidence by other means if there is \nno trial transcript. If the defendant pleaded guilty, and received the \ninevitable benefits that come with a plea agreement, he cannot later \nturn the lack of a record against the State. It remains the defendant's \nburden of both persuasion and production to show that it would not have \nbeen possible for the jury to have concluded that he is guilty. This is \nagain implicit in the adoption of the term of art ``compelling''--as \nWalser elaborates, under the ``compelling'' standard, ``absent evidence \nto the contrary, we presume that the jury'' could properly reach the \nresult that it did.\n  The other case to which I believe that you referred is the Seventh \nCircuit's 1979 decision in NLRB v. Austin Development Center, which \nmakes clear that previously available evidence is not ``compelling'' \nevidence. The relevant passage from that case for our purposes was that \nonly ``[t]he discovery of new evidence is a compelling circumstance \njustifying relitigation. The proffer of evidence not presented earlier, \nhowever, will not justify relitigation where it is not shown that the \nevidence was unavailable at the time of the prior proceeding.'' In \nother words, for our purposes, if the DNA evidence that a prisoner \nrelies on is something that would have been available to him earlier, \nit does not qualify as ``compelling'' evidence justifying a new trial. \nIf he failed to seek a test when he could have, he cannot later use \nthat test result to argue for a new trial, once witnesses have died or \nbecome unavailable or had their memories fade, and other evidence has \ndeteriorated and disappeared. To allow a new trial under these \ncircumstances would be fundamentally unfair to society and its interest \nin the finality of criminal judgments. As some of my colleagues have \nnoted, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure specifically limits its \nliberal new-trial rule to new evidence discovered within 3 years. \nImplicit in that limit is the judgment that the same evidence cannot \ncarry the same weight in a new trial motion if it is brought at a later \ntime. By adopting the ``compelling'' standard in this bill, we make \nthat same judgement, and we protect these same societal interests.\n  I hope that this conforms to your previous understanding of this \nprovision and clarifies matters for the record, Senator. We have chosen \na tough standard here--in fact, I believe tougher than all those that \nwe have discussed previously. This is not a standard that will grant \nnew trials to people who probably did it--and then allow them to walk \nfree when prosecutors are unable to try them after the passage of time. \nI hope that you can have confidence in that, Senator.\n  Mr. CORNYN. It does conform to my previous understanding and I do \nhave confidence in it, Senator. Thank you. I regret taking up the \nSenate's time on this busy day, but I do have one other question, and \nthis pertains to the bill's changes to CODIS and NDIS, the DNA index \nsystems. It is my understanding that this bill places no limits on what \nStates can upload into CODIS--that is, into their own databases.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I also would like to clarify which profiles states are \nrequired to have expunged from NDIS--the national-exchange database--as \na condition of access. The bill allows States to upload anything that \nis collected ``under applicable legal authorities''--that is, that \nStates or local governments collect under their own laws or policies. \nAn exception is made, however, for two categories--unindicted arrestees \nand elimination-only samples. Then later, the bill provides that States \nmust seek expungement of samples if, and I quote, ``the person has not \nbeen convicted of an offense of the basis of which that analysis was or \ncould have been included in the index, and all charges for which the \nanalysis was or could have been included in the index have been \ndismissed or resulted in acquittal.''\n  It is my understanding that, just as what will now be U.S. Code \nsubsection (d)(2)(A)(i) requires that a person's analysis be expunged \nif it was originally uploaded on the basis of a criminal conviction and \nthat conviction is overturned, this new subsection (ii) will require \nthe analysis of the acquitted arrestee (or one for whom charges have \nbeen dismissed) to be expunged--but only if the analysis originally was \nor could have been included because he was an arrestee.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct. The new limitation that you noted--the \nnew subsection 14132(d)(2)(A)(ii) corresponds to the limited \n``unindicted arrestee'' category in the new (a)(1)(C). It does not \napply to DNA analyses uploaded under other ``applicable legal \nauthorities.'' Our intent was to provide States with maximum \nflexibility in exchanging DNA profile information through NDIS. The \nonly exception that we made in this bill was for arrestees, who had DNA \nsamples taken from them involuntarily, and who, because of those \ncircumstances, we give the right to have those samples withdrawn from \nNDIS.\n  Mr. CORNYN. As you know, I am a strong believer in the power of DNA \nto solve crimes. I want to see the United States develop as broad and \nas powerful a DNA database as possible. The States have a strong \ninterest in solving past crimes. I also believe that there is no reason \nto exclude DNA from CODIS simply because charges against an arrestee \nare dismissed or he is acquitted--fingerprints are kept in such cases, \nand there is no reason to treat DNA differently than fingerprints. The \nbill bars States from keeping an arrestee's DNA sample if charges are \ndropped or he is acquitted. There is no reason to do so. Experience \nshows that felony arrestees--even those who are\n\n[[Page S10915]]\n\nnot ultimately convicted--are a good population from which to predict \nother crimes. Excluding unindicted arrestees will simply prevent States \nfrom solving more crimes. I understand that legislative compromise has \nforced us to exclude arrestees--even those indicted--if charges against \nthem are dropped. I am glad to see that your understanding of the \nStates's otherwise broad authority conforms to my own understanding--\nthat outside of the arrestee-sample context, States may still upload \nand exchange any DNA collected under State and local laws, policies, \nand practices on the NDIS database.\n\n  In expressing this view, I would like to emphasize that keeping DNA \nsamples in CODIS and NDIS does not affect privacy--the analysis used \nhas no medical predictive value. The analysis of DNA that is kept in \nCODIS is what is called ``junk DNA''--it is impossible to determine \nanything medically sensitive from this DNA. For example, this DNA will \nnot allow a tester to determine if the donor is susceptible to \nparticular diseases. As the Justice Department noted in its official \nViews Letter on the predecessor to this bill, and I quote at length:\n\n       [T]here [are no] legitimate privacy concerns that require \n     the retention or expansion of these [H.R. 3214] expungement \n     provisions. The DNA identification system is already subject \n     to strict privacy rules, which generally limit the use of DNA \n     samples and DNA profiles in the system to law enforcement \n     identification purposes. See 42 U.S.C. 14132(b)-(c). \n     Moreover, the DNA profiles that are maintained in the \n     national index relate to 13 DNA sites that do not control any \n     traits or characteristics of individuals. Hence, the \n     databased information cannot be used to discern, for example, \n     anything about an individual's genetic illnesses, disorders, \n     or dispositions. Rather, by design, the information the \n     system retains in the databased DNA profiles is the \n     equivalent of a ``genetic fingerprint'' that uniquely \n     identifies an individual, but does not disclose other facts \n     about him.\n\n  To those still concerned about some kind of civil liberties violation \ninherent in maintaining a DNA database, I would ask, what about \nMedicare and Medicaid?--they keep lots of medically sensitive \ninformation. Why should we trust those agencies, but not the FBI? \nMisuse of the information in CODIS and NDIS--if even possible--is \nprohibited by law. The Medicare and Medicaid system keep vast stores of \nmedically sensitive information about people. If we are so afraid of \nCODIS and NDIS, what about Medicare?\n  And again--fingerprints are kept for all arrestees--should we now \nexpunge those too? The FBI maintains a database of fingerprints of \narrestees--without regard to whether the arrestee is later acquitted or \nconvicted. As Justice notes in its Views Letter on this bill, ``With \nrespect to the proposed exclusion of DNA profiles of unindicted \narrestees, it should be noted by way of comparison that there is no \nFederal policy that bars States from including fingerprints of \narrestees in State and Federal law enforcement databases prior to \nindictment.'' Since database DNA is no more sensitive than \nfingerprints, and we would expunge DNA under S. 1700, should we also \nstart throwing out fingerprints?\n  I would also note that keeping as broad a database as possible will \nstop many violent predators much earlier. As the Justice Department \nalso noted in its Views Letter, ``There is no reason to have a . . . \nFederal policy mandating expungement for DNA information. If the person \nwhose DNA it is does not commit other crimes, then the information \nsimply remains in a secure database and there is no adverse effect on \nhis life. But if he commits a murder, rape, or other serious crime, and \nDNA matching can identify him as the perpetrator, then it is good that \nthe information was retained.''\n  Finally, on this point, I would like to highlight the British \nexample: The British tried expunging arrestees' DNA and found that they \nended up with embarrassing ``improper'' matches from perpetrators who \nweren't supposed to get caught. Now they take DNA from all suspects \n(not just arrestees) and have a 2,000,000 profile database. As a \nresult, the British now get DNA matches from crimes scenes in 40 \npercent of all cases, and had 58,176 ``cold hits'' from crime scenes in \n2001-02.\n  According to a recent National Institutes of Justice-commissioned \nstudy titled ``The Application of DNA Technology in England and \nWales,'' the U.K. tried expunging DNA profiles for arrestees who are \nnot ultimately convicted and quickly realized that this was a mistake. \nAccording to the report:\n\n       While [a 1994 law] called for the expungement of profiles \n     of individuals who were not ultimately convicted, periodic \n     problems with the database administration ultimately led to a \n     number of cases in which suspects were identified by samples \n     which were retained in the system but should have been \n     removed. This lead to a number of court cases and a decision \n     from the House of Lords addressing the legality of such \n     convictions.\n       To address these public policy and legal issues, the House \n     of Lords passed [a 2001 law] which . . . provides for the \n     indefinite retention of DNA profiles on the [British \n     database] even if suspects are not convicted.'' . . . [The \n     new law] allows for the collection and retention of \n     biological samples and DNA profiles for anyone who becomes a \n     suspect during the course of a police investigation.\n\n  As a result of these changes, the British now have 2,000,000 DNA \nprofiles in their national database, they now get matches from 40 \npercent of all crime scenes with DNA, and they had 58,176 ``cold hits'' \nfrom crime scenes in 2001. Why wouldn't we want the same for our \ncountry?\n  Another NIJ-commission study, produced by Washington State University \nand titled the ``National Forensic DNA Study Report,'' notes that ``the \nDNA database must have a strong pool of offenders for comparison. . . . \nthe DNA database is a two-index system--a crime scene sample index, and \nan offender index. The effectiveness of either index is necessarily \nrestricted by any limitation on the other index.'' From the British \nexperience, we know that a broad database is highly effective. It is \ntime to replicate that experience here, before more preventable crimes \nare committed. I am glad that we have moved far in that direction--\ntoward the British model--though we still have maintained the \nunfortunate anachronism of requiring arrestees' analyses to be expunged \nif charges against them are dropped.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree with the Senator. I, too, am pleased that, with \nthe exception of samples collected from arrestees who have charges \ndismissed or are acquitted, States and local governments can now upload \nand compare analyses collected under applicable legal authorities on \nthe national database without running afoul of arbitrary expungement \nrequirements.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Chairman would permit, I also would like to pose \na few questions, in order to clarify for the record some new language \nadded to the bill. As the lead sponsor of the Senate legislation that \nbecame this bill, and Chairman of the committee that reported that \nbill, I believe that you have unique authority to clarify these \nmatters.\n  The modification to the bill that was approved on the Senate floor \ntoday changes who can serve on the capital-counsel entity that selects \nand manages counsel for State capital cases in States that do not have \na public defender program. The committee-passed version of the bill \nread that, to receive its portion of the funds for State capital \ncounsel, a State that does not have a public defender system must place \ncontrol of the appointment of defense counsel in ``an entity \nestablished by statute or by the highest State court with jurisdiction \nin criminal cases, which is composed of individuals with demonstrated \nknowledge and expertise in capital representation.'' The new version of \nthe bill reads that the entity must be ``composed of individuals with \ndemonstrated knowledge and expertise in capital cases, except for \nindividuals currently employed as prosecutors.''\n  Previously, the bill required that only defense--lawyers and maybe \nretired prosecutors, or anyone else who ``represented'' parties in \ncapital cases--be appointed to manage the entity. With today's \namendment, sitting trial and appellate judges can be appointed to \nmanage the capital-counsel entity--as well as anyone else with \nexperience with capital cases, including law professors or victims' \nadvocates--but not current prosecutors. Is that your understanding of \nthe new bill?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes. Anyone with knowledge of capital cases--not just \nsomeone who has litigated capital cases--can now serve on the entity. \nMost importantly, this includes members of the bench. It could also \ninclude law professors with knowledge of capital cases, or, as you \nmentioned, even advocates for crime victims--if they\n\n[[Page S10916]]\n\nhave a demonstrated familiarity with the death penalty. The interests \nof victims too often are left out in our justice system--I am pleased \nto see that we have now changed this bill to ensure that someone who \nhas experience in guiding crime victims through a capital trial would \nbe eligible to sit at the table of this important new capital-counsel \nentity. I think that such an entity certainly could benefit from \ndiverse perspectives on the criminal-justice system.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. But there is no requirement of such apportionment, is \nthere? If a State chooses to design its capital counsel entity so that, \nfor example, it is composed exclusively of trusted members of the \nbench, the State could do so, could it not?\n  Mr. HATCH. Absolutely. This a matter that is properly left up to the \nStates, and we have so left it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I also do not understand this bill to preclude the \nState from allowing the entity to delegate its authority--for example, \nthe State could have one statewide entity that then delegates its \nfunctions to particular judges in particular counties or districts. Is \nmy understanding correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. That understanding is correct. As long as the person to \nwhom authority is delegated would herself be eligible to serve on the \nentity, there is no reason to centralize all functions in one office. \nNor is there any limit or requirement as to how many people can serve \non the capital counsel entity. I know that in some of our discussions \nearlier this week, Senator Kyl posed the example of a State that \ncreates a panel of three judges--trial judges, appellate judges, or \nsome combination thereof--and has that panel carry out the functions of \nthe entity. With the modification to the bill made today, this would be \npermissible. The State could use 5 judges, or 12, or even 1, though I \ncan't imagine that the latter would be practical, except in the case \nwhere authority is delegated in local areas.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator. I am pleased that your \nunderstanding of these aspects of the bill matches mine. One final \npoint: I do not understand the bill to limit whom the State may vest \nwith the authority to appoint the members of the capital-counsel \nentity. The entity's members could be appointed by the governor, the \nattorney general, the Supreme Court, or any other official designated \nby State law or supreme-court rule. Is that correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes. There is no such restriction.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chairman.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to thank my friend from Utah. He and \nI have worked very hard, and, as he mentioned, we worked closely with \nChairman Sensenbrenner, Mr. Delahunt, and Mr. LaHood in the other body. \nYesterday was an extremely busy day as we met over and over again, well \ninto last evening and again early this morning, to make it possible.\n  I think this is also a day to rejoice on the part of courageous \npeople like Debbie Smith and Kirk Bloodsworth. Debbie waited years to \nsee this day, but she remained steadfast in her commitment to help \nother people. Kirk Bloodsworth faced an ordeal that nobody should have \nto face. That is why parts of this bill are named for each of them. I \nhope this achievement brings some kind of closure for them.\n  Mr. President, on February 1, 2000, I came to the floor to call \nattention to the growing national crisis in the administration of \ncapital punishment. I noted that since the reinstatement of capital \npunishment in the 1970s, 85 people had been found innocent and released \nfrom death row. And I urged Senators on both sides of the aisle, both \nthose who supported the death penalty and those who opposed it, to join \nin seeking ways to minimize the risk that innocent persons will be put \nto death. A few days later, I introduced the Innocence Protection Act \nof 2000.\n  That was more than 4 years ago. During that time, many more innocent \npeople have been freed from death row--the total is now 117, according \nto the Death Penalty Information Center. During that time, the \nRepublican Governor of Illinois commuted all the death sentences in his \nState to life in prison, having lost confidence in a system that \nexonerated more death row inmates than it executed. During that time, \nwe learned about problems at the Houston crime lab so serious that the \ncity's top police official called for a moratorium on executions of the \ninmates who were convicted based on evidence that the lab handled or \nanalyzed. And during that time, the bipartisan, bicameral coalition \nsupporting the Innocence Protection Act has continued to grow.\n  Earlier this week, the House of Representatives passed the Justice \nFor All Act of 2004, a wide-ranging criminal justice package that \nincludes the Innocence Protection Act. The House bill also includes the \nDebbie Smith Act and the DNA Sexual Assault Justice Act, which together \nauthorize more than $1 billion over the next 5 years to eliminate the \nDNA backlog crisis in the Nation's crime labs and fund other DNA-\nrelated programs. Finally, the House bill includes crime victims' \nrights provisions that I sponsored with Senators Feinstein and Kyl, and \nwhich already passed the Senate earlier this year.\n  Today, at long last, the Senate is poised to pass the Justice For All \nAct and to send this important legislation to the President. I hope he \nwill sign it, despite his Justice Department's continued efforts to \nkill this bill. The reforms it enacts will create a fairer system of \njustice, where the problems that have sent innocent people to death row \nare less likely to occur, where the American people can be more certain \nthat violent criminals are caught and convicted instead of the innocent \npeople who have been wrongly put behind bars for their crimes, and \nwhere victims and their families can be more certain of the accuracy, \nand finality, of the results.\n  This bill has been many years in the making, and there are many \npeople to acknowledge and thank. Let me begin by thanking Kirk \nBloodsworth, Debbie Smith, the Justice Project, and through them all \nthe crime victims and the victims of a flawed criminal justice system \nwho have made these changes possible. Without their commitment and \ndedication, these straightforward reforms simply would not have \nhappened. Kirk and Debbie sat patiently, hour after hour, through our \ncommittee's work on this bill, and their presence was strong and \neloquent testimony of the need for this legislation.\n  Part of this legislation is appropriately named for Kirk Bloodsworth. \nKirk was a young man, just out of the Marines, when he was arrested, \nconvicted, and sentenced to death for a heinous crime that he did not \ncommit. DNA evidence ultimately freed him and identified the real \nkiller. He became the first person in the United States to be freed \nfrom a death row crime through use of DNA evidence. The years he spent \nin prison were hard years, and he was treated horribly even after he \nwas released. He could have become embittered by all he has endured. \nBut instead, he has chosen to turn his experience into something \nconstructive, to help others, and one way he has chosen to help is by \nbeing part of the effort to enact this bill. Kirk and his wife, Brenda, \nare remarkable people, and I thank them both. I am proud to have come \nto know them through our work together on this constructive cause.\n  I want to commend the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, \nCongressman James Sensenbrenner, who spearheaded this effort in the \nHouse. Chairman Sensenbrenner deserves high praise for steering this \nbill through some very rough patches to final passage. We would not be \nwhere we are today without his leadership, tenacity, and steadfast \ncommitment to getting this done.\n  I also want to thank my longtime colleagues in this endeavor, \nRepresentative Bill Delahunt of Massachusetts and Representative Ray \nLaHood of Illinois. They have worked tirelessly over many years to pass \nthe Innocence Protection Act, and they deserve much of the credit for \nbuilding the strong support for the bill in the House.\n  I also want to acknowledge Senator Hatch, the chairman of our \nCommittee, with whom I have debated these issues for years and with \nwhom I have cosponsored many measures over the last 10 years. Had he \ncontinued to oppose these efforts we could never have been successful. \nOver the last couple of weeks he has focused on this bill, and the \nJudiciary Committee reported the Advancing Justice Through DNA \nTechnology Act under his leadership just a few weeks ago. I am grateful \nfor his help in overcoming objections to\n\n[[Page S10917]]\n\nthe bill from his side of the aisle. I know how hard he has worked to \ndo that.\n\n  Thanks, too, to the many Members on both sides of the aisle, in the \nSenate and in the House, who have supported this legislation over this \nlong struggle for reform. Working together, we have finally begun to \naddress the many problems facing our capital punishment system. Here in \nthe Senate, Senator Biden has championed additional funding for rape \nkit testing. Senators Kennedy, Kohl, Feingold, and Durbin have been \nlongtime and steadfast proponents of sensible reform. Senators \nFeinstein and Specter were strong supporters of the Innocence \nProtection Act in the 107th Congress, and have been constructive \npartners in the effort in this Congress. Senator Gordon Smith and \nSenator Collins were early cosponsors of the Innocence Protection Act \nas well. Senator DeWine was a lead sponsor of the Senate DNA bill, and \nhas made many important contributions. I have spoken to the majority \nleader a number of times over the last year having learned of his \ninterest in these matters and thank him for allowing the Senate to turn \nto this important matter even as we approach adjournment of this \nsession.\n  Many people have been generous with their time and expertise and \nexperience over the years. Steve Bright, Bryan Stevenson, George \nKendall, Jim Liebman, Larry Yackle, Scott Wallace, and Kyl O'Dowd have \noffered useful and important suggestions on how to improve State \nindigent defense systems. Peter Neufeld and Barry Scheck have been \ninvaluable resources on the intricacies of post-conviction DNA testing. \nRon Weich has offered superb legal counsel to both Republican and \nDemocratic Senators and their staffs as we have worked on this bill. \nPat Griffin's masterful advice has also been invaluable.\n  I have already mentioned the Justice Project, a nonprofit \norganization dedicated to criminal justice reform, which has been a \nstaunch supporter of this bill from the beginning. I particularly want \nto recognize the contributions of my good friend Bobby Muller, as well \nas John Terzano, Cheryl Feeley, Laura Burstein, Cynthia Thomet, and \nPeter Loge.\n  Finally, I want to thank several staff members of the Senate and \nHouse Judiciary Committees who worked tirelessly, some for years, to \naccomplish this goal. I commend the Chief Counsel to Chairman \nSensenbrenner, Phil Kiko. He was instrumental in keeping the process \nmoving over the past year. His hard work, fairness and judgment helped \nfulfill his chairman's dogged determination to get this done and make \nthese needed changes. Also on the chairman's staff, I acknowledge the \nefforts of Jay Apperson and Katy Crooks. I want to express my deep \ngratitude to Mark Agrast, former counsel for Representative Delahunt, \nand his successor, Christine Leonard.\n  In the Senate, I want to acknowledge several Judiciary Committee \nstaff members who made immeasurable contributions during this long and \nchallenging effort. On Chairman Hatch's staff, I want to thank Bruce \nArtim, Brett Tolman, and Michael Volkov, a former detailee, for \ninvesting so much of their time and expertise in helping us to arrive \nat this moment. My staff and I appreciate the contributions of Neil \nMacBride, Jonathan Meyer, and Louisa Terrell on Senator Biden's staff, \nDavid Hantman on Senator Feinstein's staff, and Robert Steinbuch with \nSenator DeWine.\n  On my own staff, I want to express my appreciation to an entire team \nof talented and dedicated attorneys and staff who have devoted \nthemselves so long to this effort and to this commitment to justice. \nJulie Katzman, a senior counsel on my staff, has devoted innumerable \nhours over the past 4\\1/2\\ years to accomplishing this goal, and I want \nto extend my deeply felt gratitude to her. Tara Magner began as a law \nclerk, and later as my counsel has dedicated herself to this effort \nwith superb results. Beryl Howell, my former general counsel, guided \nthis effort for years, and Bruce Cohen, my Chief Counsel, guided all of \ntheir efforts. Tim Rieser, Luke Albee, David Carle, and more all \nsupported and contributed to this extraordinary effort.\n  I also want personally to thank the Senate Legislative Counsel, in \nparticular Bill Jensen and Matt McGhie, who labor in obscurity to \nproduce the legislative text that is being constantly revised to \nreflect the understanding reached during this arduous process.\n  This bill is a rare example of bipartisan cooperation for a good \ncause. It reflects many years of work and intense negotiation. No one \nwho has worked on this bill is entirely satisfied with everything in \nit, but that is what the legislative process is all about finding the \nsubstantive, meaningful, middle ground that a broad majority can \nsupport.\n  The Justice For All Act is the most significant step we have taken in \nmany years to improve the quality of justice in this country. DNA is \nthe miracle forensic tool of our lifetimes. It has the power to convict \nthe guilty and to exonerate the innocent. And as DNA has become more \nand more available, it also has opened a window on the flaws of the \ndeath penalty process. This is a bill to put this powerful tool into \ngreater use in our police departments and our courtrooms. It also takes \na modest step toward addressing one of the most frequent causes of \nwrongful convictions in capital cases, the lack of adequate legal \ncounsel. These reforms, to put it simply, will mean better, faster, \nfairer criminal justice.\n  I thank each one of my colleagues in both bodies who worked hard to \nresolve conflicts and congratulate them on this legislative \nachievement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I compliment the chairman and ranking \nmember of the committee.\n  This bill was held up for a long while. Provisions were added to the \nbill, which I totally support, that will allow people who were wrongly \naccused of having committed crimes to be able to have DNA testing to \nprove their innocence.\n  I don't want anyone to misunderstand why this is so important. All of \nyou should know so you can tell your constituents. In fact, we set up a \nprovision in the crime bill whereby when there is a rape or a sexual \nassault, we have put a lot of money--you have put a lot of money over \nthe years into providing for training of police, training forensic \nnurses and doctors to be able to take DNA samples.\n  There are over 800,000 so-called rape case kits sitting on shelves of \nthe cities where you live and the States you represent. They have never \nbeen tested because of the cost of testing them. The bottom line is \nthat an estimated 48 percent of outstanding rapes could be solved by \njust comparing the database that will come from testing these kits and \nthe existing database in our State prison systems where DNA is already \non the record. This will liberate thousands of women from the fear and \nconcern that the man who raped them is out there and will be back \nagain.\n  We have done a good thing today. You should let your people back home \nknow. It is a big deal.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/09/senate-section/article/S10917-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10917-S10918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE REORGANIZATION--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The question is on agreeing to \nthe amendment No. 4027, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 4027), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4015\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes equally divided prior to \nthe vote on the Hutchison amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, my amendment keeps the intent of the \nSenate. It creates an intelligence subcommittee on Appropriations. It \nkeeps 13 subcommittees on Appropriations, but it allows the \nAppropriations Committee to do the reorganization within those \nparameters.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, there has never been \na subcommittee eliminated by the Senate without coming from a committee \nitself.\n  This would set a precedent that could affect committees for years to \ncome. It is not right, and there is no reason to have to do it on the \nSenate floor today. We must consult with the House so that our \nAppropriations Committees match. Appropriations are complicated\n\n[[Page S10918]]\n\nenough. Having Appropriations Committees that are different in the \nHouse from the Senate is not a wise decision, and we don't have to do \nit today.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt my amendment which keeps the \nintelligence subcommittee, it keeps 13 subcommittees in Appropriations, \nand allows the Appropriations Committee to do its job in reorganizing \naround those parameters.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the 9/11 Commission is watching what we are \ndoing. We have created an intelligence subcommittee on Appropriations. \nThat was very difficult to do. But we did it. The consolidation of \nDefense appropriations and Military Construction makes sense. The \nsubject matters are related, with the same players and same \ndepartments. It is military. It doesn't make sense to create an \nartificial divide different than this one.\n  The Appropriations Committee as it stands has all kinds of authority \nto organize within itself.\n  In short, we have done the work of the Senate. It is the right thing \nto do. It sets forth something that Governor Kean says makes sense.\n  I hope we will defeat this amendment and keep intact what we already \nhave.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the pending amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered, \nand the clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and \nnays be vitiated and there be a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to consideration of H.R. 5186, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the title of the bill.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       An act (H.R. 5186) to reduce certain special allowance \n     payments and provide additional teacher loan forgiveness on \n     Federal student loans.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this bill deserves to pass, but it's only \na down-payment on the real reform needed to close a flagrant loophole \nin the student loan program. The bill takes $285 million in excessive \nsubsidies to banks and gives it to college students and new teachers in \nthe form of increased forgiveness for student loans.\n  It is only a downpayment, however, because it does not close all of \nthe notorious 9.5 percent student loan loophole, and because even this \nreform will expire after one year. The bill is silent on the full \ninterest rate gouging that has taken place over the last 18 months--\nfunds that the Secretary of Education should have reclaimed on his own, \nand still should after this bill passes.\n  Obviously, our Republican colleagues hope that this modest action \nwill cool the public outcry that has erupted in the past month as the \nfull extent of this shameful loophole has come to light.\n  For almost 25 years, the taxpayer has been guaranteeing banks a 9.5 \npercent rate of return on a specific type of student loans. In 1993, \nCongress acted to end the guarantee, but a loophole emerged that even \nthe Government Accountability Office says the Bush administration has \nrefused to shut down.\n  Today's bill still leaves 40 percent of the loophole wide open. In \nother words, our Republican colleagues can no longer stand the heat \nfrom the loophole, and so they're now sacrificing 60 percent of it, in \nthe hope that their special interest friends in the student loan \nindustry can still retain the other 40 percent.\n  Sadly, under this Republican bill, the abuse will continue. New loans \nwill be\n\n[[Page S10919]]\n\nmade to new students that taxpayers will subsidize at a 9.5 percent \ninterest rate. It's madness. We should be allowing older borrowers to \nrefinance their student loans at today's market rates, instead of \nsubsidizing big banks at the high interest rates of the 1980s. We \nshould be helping students who are eligible for Pell Grants, instead of \nsubsidizing big banks needlessly.\n  Republicans claim that some of this subsidy will go to student \nbenefits. I say, it all should go to student benefits in whatever loan \nprogram a student participates. No one should be fooled. Half of the \nstudent loan loophole that this bill leaves wide open goes to for-\nprofit corporations like Nelnet and Sallie Mae.\n  The 9.5 percent guarantee is still highway robbery for special \ninterests. Our Republican colleagues reply that at least they're \nnarrowing the highway from five lanes to two lanes. Banks like Nelnet \nand Sallie Mae can still drive right through, collecting outrageous \nprofits at the expense of students and taxpayers.\n  I had hoped to offer an amendment to this bill that would close the \n9.5 percent loan loophole completely and permanently. But the \nRepublican Majority objects to that effort here and now. We will be \nback though on the first available vehicle to shut down this wasteful \ncorporate subsidy once and for all.\n  It's long past time for President Bush and Republicans find the \ncourage to stand up to their special interest friends, and do what's \nright for the Nation's students and taxpayers.\n  In most cases, lenders today receive a 3.6 percent rate of return on \nnew student loans. But for the last 11 years, the Government--\ntaxpayers--have been guaranteeing lenders a 9.5 percent rate of return \non a certain group of otherwise non-descript student loans. A 9.5 \npercent rate of interest might have made sense years ago, but it \ndoesn't today.\n  In 1993, Congress passed legislation intended to phase-out of \nexistence the 9.5 percent bank guarantee. But two key loopholes have \nkept that subsidy alive and well. The legislation before the Senate \ncloses one.\n  The first loophole--the one that isn't closed by this legislation--\nallows for what is called 9.5 percent loan ``recycling.'' A lender \nmakes a loan to a student--``Student A.'' Over the course of the next \n10 to 25 years, the lender is repaid by Student A and the lender gets a \nsubsidy payment guaranteeing a 9.5 percent rate of return.\n  Under the 1993 law, after one loan, there should be an end to that \n9.5 percent guarantee. But lenders have been recycling Student A \npayments and the attached Government subsidy into a new loans issued to \nnew students--``Student B''--and claiming a 9.5 percent guarantee on \nthose loans as well. So, 9.5 loans haven't been phased out at all. \nThey've being maintained. And the Department of Education has done \nnothing about it.\n  Worse, 18 months ago, lenders started growing the number of 9.5 \npercent loans through a process called ``transferring.'' A lender \nshifts a loan out of its tax-exempt bond estate into its taxable bond \nestate. When the loan shifts, the 9.5 percent guarantee shifts with it \nand the tax-exempt bond estate then has money available to it to issue \nnew 9.5 percent loans.\n  As a result of ``transferring,'' 9.5 percent loan bank subsidy \npayments have more than doubled in the last 18 months. The Bush \nadministration has refused to stop the process, despite Democrats' and \nGAO's urging.\n  A year ago, Senate Democrats proposed legislation to shut both \nloopholes down once and for all. The Senate Republicans did not act on \nthat proposal, did not introduce their own legislation, and did not \nhold a single hearing. They asked no oversight questions of the Bush \nadministration. In short, they did nothing.\n  Democrats requested a GAO investigation. We alerted non-partisan \nhigher education policy experts. We requested an SEC investigation. Two \nmonths ago, we blew the whistle in the media on the new, explosive \ngrowth in the 9.5 loan subsidy. Finally, our Republican friends \nresponded to the criticism with the legislation before us today.\n  But again, this bill doesn't get the job done. It leaves the \n``recycling'' loophole open, and it lasts only one year. Now, this \nremains a live issue in the Appropriations Committee. I would hope we \nwould follow the House's 413-13 vote lead in shutting down this \nloophole in its entirety. It's a change past due.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to commend Senator Gregg for \ntaking what I hope is one of many steps in closing what most, if not \nall of us agree, is an egregious loophole in current law relating to \nstudent loans.\n  In the 1980's, the Higher Education Act sought to attract more \nlenders to the student loan program by offering nonprofits a 9.5 \npercent rate on return on student loans in exchange for their \nparticipation in the program. At a time of high interest rates, it \nprovided an assurance to nonprofits that they could make student loans \nand stay afloat economically. The 9.5 percent subsidy was an incentive \nto bring the nonprofit sector into the lending business, to offer \nstudents more options in choosing a lender. The subsidy made sense at \nthe time.\n  In 1993, a time when interest rates were coming down, 9.5 percent \namounted to a windfall for lenders. Congress rescinded the policy but \ngrandfathered loans already made, assuming that the volume of these \nloans would decline as borrowers paid them off. That assumption turned \nout to be wrong.\n  Exploiting a loophole in current law, some lenders, including for-\nprofits that have acquired nonprofits, have been rolling new loans into \nold accounts, sometimes for as little as a day, to qualify for the \nsubsidy. That means that in today's market, some guaranteed a 9.5 \npercent profit on 3.4 percent student loans. The Federal Government is \nmaking up the 6.1 percent difference.\n  How egregious is this practice? From January 2004 to June 2004, one \nbank alone amassed over $3.2 billion in 9.5 percent loans by exploiting \nthis loophole. The General Accounting Office GAO, has found that the \noverall volume of loans receiving a 9.5 percent return has increased to \nmore than $17 billion this year from $11 billion in 1995. This is money \nthat should be going to the student loan program and the Pell grant \nprogram, not bank profits.\n  In response to this discovery, the Department of Education has been \nasked to issue new rules clarifying that the practice in question is, \nin fact, not within the intent of current law. They have refused to do \nso. They claim that their hands are tied, that only Congress can close \nthe current loophole. The GAO disagrees.\n  In a report issued September 21, the GAO states that the Department \ncould use less formal guidance to clarify or alter its position on the \npractice, or publish an interim rule that would close the loophole \nuntil a formal rulemaking process is complete. The GAO also suggests \nthat the Department publish an emergency rule. This type of rule allows \nFederal agencies to skip the formal process if they believe it would be \n``impracticable, unnecessary or contrary to public interest.'' The \nDepartment does not believe the current situation rises to that level. \nClearly, it is against the public interest, and against the interest of \nthe U.S. Treasury, to allow this practice to continue.\n  According to some, the payments in question could cost the U.S. \nTreasury nearly $1 billion by the end of this calendar year and at \nleast $5 billion over the next 10 years. This is money that could be \nused to send kids to college.\n  Mr. President, in response to this crisis, Senator Gregg has proposed \na bill to close the 9.5 percent loophole. There is just one problem \nwith his bill. It does not close the loophole completely and it does \nnot close the loophole permanently. The loophole should be completely \nand permanently closed.\n  I applaud Senator Gregg for taking this first step. Between enactment \nof the change and the time that it expires next year, his bill will \nachieve a $285 million savings for the student loan program. If we were \nto shut down the loophole completely, we would achieve a $400 million \nsavings within the same time frame. That would amount to an additional \n$115 million for student financial aid.\n  In response to Senator Gregg's bill, Senator Kennedy offered an \namendment to close the loophole completely and permanently. This is \nsomething that my Democratic colleagues and I have been fighting to do \nsince last October. Unfortunately, the amendment was not accepted.\n\n[[Page S10920]]\n\n  Mr. President, the Pell grant maximum has remained flat for 3 years. \nTuition is up. And all the while, the Federal government is giving away \na $1 billion annual subsidy through 9.5 percent loans. The Federal \nGovernment is paying hundreds of million of dollars in unnecessary \nsubsidies to student loan companies. The bill before us allows this \npractice to continue, even if it is to a lesser extent. I hope we will \nhave an opportunity in the near future to take definitive action to \ncorrect this egregious short-coming in the law.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I support the limited effort before us today \nto close a loophole in Federal student loan policy that has cost \ntaxpayers billions of dollars over the past decade.\n  In the 1980s, when there were fears that student loans would become \nscarce due to high interest rates, Congress provided lenders \nparticipating in the Federal Family Education Loan, FFEL, program a \nguaranteed minimum 9.5-percent return on student loans generated from \ntax-exempt bond funds. Congress did so to ensure that there would be \nlenders willing to make affordable loans for students.\n  In 1993, Congress sought to end the 9.5-percent guaranteed return on \nwhat had become a small subset of student loans due to a much lower \nnational interest rate environment, the growth in availability of other \nprivate bank and government-subsidized student loans, and the creation \nof Federal direct loans.\n  In doing so, a grandfather clause was enacted for outstanding 9.5-\npercent return, tax-exempt bond generated student loan funds. Rather \nthan end the 9.5-percent loans, this grandfather clause has worked as a \nloophole. Owners of 9.5-percent guaranteed loans continually recycle \nproceeds from tax-exempt bonds originally issued before 1993--creating \nin effect a revolving loan fund--and the Federal Government continues \nto guarantee a 9.5-percent rate of return on what is today \napproximately 1 out of every 20 student loans. Lenders of the remaining \n19 out of 20 student loans receive a much lower guaranteed interest \nrate--less than 4 percent.\n  This overpayment has grown dramatically over the past few years, as \nthis administration and Department of Education have failed to \nintervene and stop it. According to the Government Accountability \nOffice, GAO, the overpayment cost taxpayers well over $600 million by \nthe end of June 2004, up from $209 million in Fiscal Year 2001.\n  To finally close this loophole once and for all, I joined Senator \nKennedy in introducing S. 1793, the College Quality, Affordability, and \nDiversity Improvement Act last October, which among many provisions to \nexpand access to higher education, would eliminate the 9.5-percent \ngiveaway. More recently, I cosponsored legislation introduced last week \nby Senator Murray--S. 2861, the Student Loan Abuse Prevention Act--\nwhich would also permanently fix the abuse of the 9.5-percent rate and \nredirect the estimated savings of $5 billion over 10 years to increase \nthe maximum Pell grant for low-income students.\n  Regrettably, the bill before us today does not contain such a \ncomprehensive and permanent fix. This more limited effort provides only \na temporary 1-year solution and it continues to allow ``recycling'' of \nloans, as opposed to the bonds, by which the lender uses the income \nfrom current 9.5-percent guarantee. And, instead of using the more \nmodest savings from this bill to boost grants for low-income students \nstruggling to afford college, the savings will be used for a different \nbut important cause--providing help to certain teachers through loan \nforgiveness.\n  Considering how long it has taken the majority to act on this \nsituation, I am pleased we are taking this first, although, limited \nstep. I will be working with my colleagues to fully close this costly \nloophole in the upcoming Higher Education Act reauthorization process \nand capture these savings for students. I thank Senators Kennedy and \nMurray and their staffs for their leadership and work on this matter.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my ongoing work \nto protect taxpayers and help students by finally ending a special \ninterest subsidy.\n  As my colleagues know, I have been working to close a loophole that \nallows some banks to issue new students loans at outrageously inflated \nrates. These subsides were supposed to have ended more than ten years \nago, but they continue today, and taxpayers are footing the bill.\n  Just last year, this wasteful subsidy cost taxpayers $1 billion. \nImagine how many students we could have helped if that money went to \nPell Grants instead of the special interests. I believe we should close \nthis loophole--immediately and permanently--and use the savings to help \nmore students afford a college education.\n  It is outrageous that taxpayers are paying 30 times what they should \nfor these student loans. Interest rates haven't been at 9.5 percent in \nyears, but new loans--at that inflated rate--are being written every \nday because of this loophole.\n  On September 15, in the Appropriations Committee, I offered an \namendment to close the loophole. My amendment would have used those \nsavings--about $370 million--to increase grants to college students. My \namendment had the support of every Democrat on the Appropriations \nCommittee, but unfortunately the chairman and every Republican opposed \nit. They said they wanted to deal with it later.\n  So Senator Kennedy and I came here to the Senate floor and called on \nthe Department of Education to take action, since our colleagues were \nnot ready to act. Unfortunately, the Department of Education refused. \nAs the Government Accountability Office noted, the Department could \nhave closed this loophole with the stoke of a pen. Last week--seeing \nthat neither the Republican Congress nor the administration--were \nwilling to act, I introduced my own bill to permanently and fully close \nthis loophole and help our students.\n  My bill is called the Student Loan Abuse Prevention Act S. 2861, and \nI thank Senators Kennedy, Mikulski, Durbin, Reed, Dodd, and Clinton for \ncosponsoring it.\n  My bill would use all of the savings to increase Pell Grants for \nstudents. The day after I introduced my bill, Senator Gregg offered his \nown bill, which we are considering today. I am pleased that the \nRepublican leaders have finally offered a proposal. I am disappointed, \nhowever, that their plan does not fully close the loophole, expires \nafter 1 year, and will not help today's student afford college.\n  Let me say a word about each of those shortcomings. First, the Gregg \nbill does not fully close the loophole. This subsidy would still live \non. My bill says that lenders cannot create new loans at 9.5 percent. \nNo new subsidies--period. And that is important because in the past 2 \nyears lenders have used tricks to extend these outrageous subsidiaries, \nand we need to put an end to it. But the Republican bill is not a real \nfix. It does not stop these gimmicks entirely. In many cases, lenders \ncould keep writing new loans at 9.5 percent for decades. Under the \nRepublican bill, the outrageous subsidy will live on. So the first \nproblem with the Republican bill is that it does not fully close the \nloophole and will still overcharge taxpayers for this lender subsidy.\n  The second problem with the Gregg bill is that it expires after 1 \nyear. My bill will stop the subsidy forever. The Republican bill would \nexpire in a year. I want my colleagues to know that when we work on the \nHigher Education Act, I will again work for a permanent fix that \nprotects taxpayers--not just for 1 year--but forever.\n  The third problem with the Gregg bill is that it does nothing to help \nstudents who are trying to pay for college today. While there are a lot \nof good uses for this money, I would also like to see those dollars go \nstraight into the pockets of our students so they can pay for college.\n  So the Gregg bill before us has three big problems--it doesn't fully \nclose the loophole, it expires after a year, and it doesn't help \ntoday's college student. But--after all the work it has taken to get \nthe Republicans to finally address this--the Gregg bill is a step \nforward and one we should take while we can.\n  I believe that our students and taxpayers deserve better. They \ndeserve a real fix that is permanent and that helps today's students. \nBut, given the reluctance we have seen so far, given the votes against \nmy amendment last month, and the Bush administration's refusal to act, \nwe should pass this first step and stay on the job until it is done and \ndone right.\n\n[[Page S10921]]\n\n  And I remind my colleagues that we will revisit the Higher Education \nAct next year, and I will fight to close this loophole fully and \npermanently. From coast to coast, the price of college education is \nsoaring and parents and students are struggling. I will continue to \nfight for policies that put students above special interests and that \nprotect taxpayers from these wasteful subsidies.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4555, which was received \nfrom the House and is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4555) to amend the Public Health Service Act \n     to revise and extend provisions relating to mammography \n     quality standards.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate will \npass the Mammography Quality Standards Reauthorization Act of 2004, \nH.R. 4555. It is fitting that Congress is reauthorizing the Mammography \nQuality Standards Act, MQSA, during Breast Cancer Awareness Month. This \nimportant bill is about saving lives. That is what the MQSA does. \nAccurate mammograms detect breast cancer early, so women can get \ntreatment and be survivors.\n  Mammography is not perfect, but it is the best screening tool we have \nnow. I authored MQSA 12 years ago to improve the quality of mammograms \nso that they are safe and accurate. Before MQSA became law, there was \nan uneven and conflicting patchwork of standards for mammography in \nthis country. There were no national quality standards for personnel or \nequipment. Image quality of mammograms and patient exposure to \nradiation levels varied widely. The quality of mammography equipment \nwas poor. Physicians and technologists were poorly trained. Inspections \nwere lacking.\n  MQSA set Federal safety and quality assurance standards for \nmammography facilities for: personnel, including doctors who interpret \nmammograms; equipment; and operating procedures. By creating national \nstandards, Congress helped make mammograms a more reliable tool for \ndetecting breast cancer. In 1998, Congress improved MQSA by giving \ninformation on test results directly to the women being tested, so no \nwoman falls through the cracks because she never learns about a \nsuspicious finding on her mammogram.\n  Now Congress is renewing MQSA through 2007 and laying the foundation \nto improve it even more in the future. Next year, the Institute of \nMedicine, IOM, and the General Accountability Office, GAO, will release \nstudies examining a number of issues relating to MQSA and mammography. \nThese issues include ways to improve physicians' interpretations of \nmammograms, ways to ensure that sufficient numbers of adequately \ntrained personnel are recruited and retained at all levels, and access \nto mammography. I look forward to receiving these IOM and GAO \nrecommendations and considering them in the next MQSA reauthorization.\n  This legislation that the Senate passed today was passed by the House \nof Representatives earlier this week and now heads to the President for \nhis signature. I acknowledge and thank Congressman Dingell for his \nlongstanding leadership and work on MQSA, and appreciate the work of \nthe House Energy and Commerce Committee on this issue. I thank Senators \nGregg and Kennedy for working with me to make sure that the Senate made \nMQSA a priority in this Congress and that we reauthorized it this year. \nI also want to acknowledge Senator Ensign for his important work on \nMQSA. Senator Ensign joined me in introducing our MQSA reauthorization \nbill, S. 1879, that passed the Senate earlier this year.\n  I thank the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, American Cancer \nSociety, National Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations, American \nCollege of Radiology Association, Y-ME National Breast Cancer \nOrganization, and the National Breast Cancer Coalition for their input \nand advice during this reauthorization of MQSA.\n  This year about 216,000 cases of breast cancer are expected to be \ndiagnosed and over 40,000 women are expected to die of breast cancer in \nthis country. MQSA saves lives. That is why it is so important that \nCongress is renewing and working to strengthen MQSA.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable, and any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record \nwithout intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 4555) was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, just to clarify, the bills we just passed \nare fairly significant pieces of legislation, the most significant of \nwhich is a bill which Senator Kennedy and I and many people in this \nbody have been working on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. \nHe is right, we have just passed very important legislation, one of \nwhich is to reauthorize our mammogram quality standards. We have worked \nvery hard on a bipartisan basis. I would like to thank him for his \ncollegiality and cooperation. I see him smiling. Did I interrupt?\n  Mr. GREGG. I am happy to yield the floor to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. It was a little chaotic. I wanted to be quickly \ncomplimentary.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate that.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Literally, we are going to ensure the safety and \nsecurity of our mammograms. I just finished the Race for the Cure in \nBaltimore. I did more of a ``walk for the cure'' this morning. But when \nyou look at the survivors and you know what early detection from \nmammograms has meant, we really have done a good job.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Maryland for \nher generous comments and her hard work, especially on the mammogram \nbill which we just passed. I was trying to highlight one of these \npieces of legislation which essentially saves the taxpayers from paying \nout a $100 million windfall to people who give loans to students. Those \nindividuals were getting paid mostly by banks at 9.5 percent. This will \nroll that back to a reasonable interest rate of 4 percent. We will take \nthose additional monies that have been saved and use them to waive the \nrepayment requirements for teachers on their student loans for teachers \nwho go into underserved areas and teach special needs kids. This is a\n\n[[Page S10922]]\n\nvery important event and something that needed to be done, or we would \nhave ended up with a windfall to these lenders and these individuals \nwho go out and teach in these tough schools on difficult subject \nmatters would have ended up with large student loans.\n  This is a very positive step. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor his efforts in this area as the ranking member of the committee, \nand I thank the entire committee for its cooperation and appreciate the \nattention of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/09/senate-section/article/S10922-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10922-S10925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE REORGANIZATION--Continued\n\n\n Amendments Nos. 3989, 3994, and 4037, As Modified, and Amendment No. \n                  4045 to Amendment No. 3981, En Bloc\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3981, as modified \nand as amended, the McConnell-Reid substitute.\n  The amendment (No. 3981) was agreed to.\n\n\n                       section 101(b) and 101(c)\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Section 101(b) contains the jurisdiction for \nthe new Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Section \n101(b)(1) refers to the new jurisdiction of the new committee. The rest \nof Section 101(b) and all of Section 101(c) describes the existing \njurisdiction of the Governmental Affairs Committee and is not intended \nto make any changes to existing practice nor precedence regarding \nreferrals on those issues with regard to other committees.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I agree Section 101(b)(2) through Section 101(b)(13) \nand Section 101(c) makes no changes to the status quo regarding \njurisdiction over those items.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3981\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the managers of the resolution \nadopting this amendment. It achieves the goals of an amendment filed by \nmy distinguished colleague, the junior Senator from Texas, that I \ncosponsored. The language in the managers' amendment will make explicit \nthat the shared jurisdiction over ``government information'' that is \nprovided by rule 25 to the Judiciary Committee is not adversely \naffected by this resolution. I thank the Senator from Texas for his \nleadership on this matter and the managers for working with us to \nclarify the resolution.\n  Mr. McConnell. Mr. President, I said at the beginning of this debate \nthat after reforming the executive branch's intelligence and homeland \nsecurity agencies, we needed to put our own house in order. We can now \nsay that after years of demanding that other institutions reorganize \nand improve their performance, we have demanded the same of ourselves. \nAnd we succeeded.\n  This is no small achievement for the Senate, the cooling saucer of \nAmerican politics. We are very averse to change here.\n  We respect history in this institution. But today we avoided making \nthe mistake of falling victim to it. Learning from our mistakes prior \nto 9/11, we have changed the way we do business. This is a great \naccomplishment.\n  We recognized the need to reform the way we conduct oversight over \nthe most important issues of our day: intelligence and homeland \nsecurity.\n  I want to thank my good friend, Senator Reid. I have greatly enjoyed \nworking with him, and have marveled at his prodigious talents in \nresolving particularly contentious conflicts.\n  We have accomplished this difficult task thanks in large part to his \nhonest brokering and commitment to respecting the concerns of each and \nevery Senator. He is fair-minded, and he is effective. I look forward \nto working with him more often.\n  Let me also take a minute to thank his capable staff. Rich Verma, \nGregg Jaczko, and Gary Myrick, who worked on a truly bipartisan basis \nwith my staff. Their expertise on these issues, and their patience with \nHarry and me, are truly commendable. They deserve a great deal of \ncredit for managing the Working Group and cobbling together for us the \nmany suggestions made by our Members.\n  I would also like to thank my staff: Kyle Simmons and Robert Karem. \nBoth of these outstanding gentlemen were with me from the beginning of \nthis process and we would not be at this point without them. I would \nalso like to thank Mike Solo. He jumped right in to masterfully produce \nthis product and also helped steer it to passage on the floor. Finally, \nmy thanks to John Abegg and Brian Lewis for their counsel and able \nassistance.\n  I want to thank the members of the Congressional Oversight Working \nGroup themselves for their many good ideas, and for their patience and \nwillingness to work on a bipartisan basis to do something that is very \ndifficult, but also very worthwhile.\n  Not every Senator will be happy with the result of the Senate working \nits will on this resolution.\n  Some Members will complain this reform goes too far. Others will \ncomplain it does not go far enough.\n  I believe we have struck an appropriate balance of reform that \nimproves our ability to conduct oversight of intelligence and homeland \nsecurity during a very serious time for our country.\n\n[[Page S10923]]\n\n  On intelligence oversight, I am pleased the Senate not only accepted \nour suggested reforms of the Select Committee on Intelligence, but also \nimproved upon them by agreeing to modify the sequential referral of \ndefense-related intelligence legislation to the Armed Services \nCommittee so the process is more cooperative.\n  The working group wanted to improve the structure of the Committee to \nallow Members more time to become experts and give them many tools to \ndo their jobs. And we have done that.\n  Let me briefly summarize just a couple of our reforms:\n  Improved and enhanced the Intelligence Committee;\n  Included 9 recommendations of the 9/11 Commission;\n  Members now have a stronger Committee;\n  Without term limits, Members can better develop the expertise needed \nto conduct effective oversight;\n  Clarified jurisdictional lines and improves the coordination of \nmilitary intelligence matters between the Armed Services and \nIntelligence Committees.\n  Appropriations jurisdiction over oversight is currently dispersed \nthroughout multiple subcommittees. We have created an Intelligence \nSubcommittee of Appropriations to consolidate the roughly 80 percent of \nthe intelligence budget that will come under the jurisdiction of the \nnational intelligence director.\n  This subcommittee will help the Appropriations Committee to live up \nto its responsibility to exercise oversight over the national \nintelligence budget.\n  This legislation consolidates widely dispersed appropriations for \nnon-military intelligence under a single Subcommittee.\n  Allows the National Intelligence Director to work with only one \nSubcommittee to approve his budget.\n  Improves intelligence oversight by creating two sets of eyes on the \nbudget and activities of the assets under the National Intelligence \nDirector.\n  Jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security was too \ndispersed. Roughly 25 Congressional Committees or Subcommittees claimed \njurisdiction over Homeland Security yesterday. We have cut that number \ndown significantly.\n  The Senate worked its will on this Resolution, and in the end it \nsignificantly consolidated jurisdiction over Homeland Security.\n  Some will think the Senate went too far. Others will think the Senate \nhasn't gone far enough.\n  We introduced a Resolution that dramatically consolidated \njurisdiction in the new Committee. In an open process, the Senate \nworked its will and decided that the overlapping functions of certain \nagencies required exceptions.\n  While there have been some changes to our proposal, we have not let \nthe perfect be the enemy of the good. We have taken great strides \ntowards a level of consolidation many of us would have thought \nimpossible only weeks ago.\n  This reform puts the Homeland Security Committee in charge of those \nwho prepare to defend against terrorist attacks and those who respond \nto terrorist attacks. This is the most important work the Department \ndoes.\n  Protecting the Homeland is the core function of the Department, and \nthe Homeland Security Committee will acquire jurisdiction over the core \nentities of the Department that do just that.\n  Among other programs, the Homeland Security Committee will acquire \njurisdiction over the following Directorates:\n  Office of the Secretary--Responsible for integration of terrorist \nthreat warning, preparedness, and response. This alone is a huge \nresponsibility.\n  Undersecretary for Information Analysis and Infrastructure \nProtection.\n  Undersecretary for Science and Technology--Chemical, Biological, and \nNuclear defense research; and Homeland Security technology development.\n  Undersecretary for Emergency Preparedness and Response--FEMA; \nNational Domestic Preparedness Office; Integrated Hazard Information \nSystem; and Domestic Emergency Support Teams.\n  Undersecretary for Management.\n  We have consolidated all of this on top of the existing jurisdiction \nof the Government Reform Committee, including the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Senate has accomplished a great deal \ntoday. We have strengthened our Intelligence oversight, created a \nHomeland Security Committee under the new Homeland Security and \nGovernment Affairs Committee, and stood up a new Intelligence \nAppropriations Subcommittee.\n  I hope our Colleagues will pay attention to the reform we have \nenacted as they consider their Committee assignments for the 109th \nCongress. The American people will be better served by these reforms. \nAnd the Senate as a whole will benefit from their improved expertise \nand authorities over these critical policy matters.\n  We have no more important charge than keeping the American people \nsafe, and today we have improved our ability to do just that.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the Senate adopted S. Res. 445, \nthe Senate Intelligence and Homeland Security Oversight Reform \nresolution. This resolution will combine the oversight of most \nDepartment of Homeland Security functions and will provide jurisdiction \nover those functions to the Committee on Governmental Affairs, which \nwill be renamed the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  I will vote in favor of S. Res. 445. This resolution will help \nadvance the U.S. war on terror by consolidating and streamlining Senate \noversight over the Department of Homeland Security. I'm confident that \nthe Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs will serve \nan important role in promoting the safety and security of the people of \nthe United States.\n  As originally introduced, the resolution provided that the Committee \non Homeland Security and governmental Affairs would not have \njurisdiction over customs revenue functions. Instead, the drafters \nrecognized that, going forward, it's important to keep the jurisdiction \nover customs revenue functions within the Finance Committee, the \ncommittee that has exercised jurisdiction over these issues for the \npast 188 years. Moreover, with the United States collecting over $23 \nbillion annually in duties and trade related fees, the drafters \nrealized that it's important that the U.S. customs agencies be able to \nperform their revenue functions efficiently. Retention of Finance \nCommittee jurisdiction over these functions will greatly facilitate \nthis objective.\n  Senator Baucus and I introduced an amendment during debate on S. Res. \n445 that clarified the language concerning customs revenue functions \ncontained in the managers' resolution. Specifically, our amendment \nstated that the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nwill not have jurisdiction over the following functions performed by \nany employee of the Department of Homeland Security: any customs \nrevenue function including any function provided for in section 415 of \nthe Homeland Security Act of 2002; any commercial function or \ncommercial operation of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection or \nthe Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, including matters \nrelated to trade facilitation and trade regulation; or any other \nfunction related to those that I just mentioned that was exercised by \nthe U.S. Customs Service on the day before the effective date of the \nHomeland Security Act of 2002. In a colloquy between Senator Baucus and \nme on October 7, we more fully spelled out what is covered by our \namendment and the reasons why our amendment was necessary.\n  The Grassley-Baucus amendment was needed to elucidate non-security \nfunctions of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the Bureau \nof Immigration and Customs Enforcement that necessarily should remain \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. Our amendment passed \nby voice vote on October 7.\n  A transfer of customs revenue and commercial functions to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs would detract \nfrom that committee's main focus. Moreover, the removal of customs \nrevenue and commercial functions from the jurisdiction of the Finance \nCommittee\n\n[[Page S10924]]\n\nwould be disruptive to our efforts to advance a comprehensive \ninternational trade agenda for the United States. In adopting our \namendment, the Senate wisely avoided both of these outcomes. agenda for \nthe United States. In adopting our amendment, the Senate wisely avoided \nboth of these outcomes.\n\n  With passage of our amendment, the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs will be better able to focus on its core \nobjective, the protection of the United States from terrorist attacks. \nThe staff of the new committee should be expected to be experts in the \nfield of national security. They will work day-in and day-out to keep \nterrorists away from our shores and to protect Americans from attack. \nWith their focus on national security concerns, it would be unrealistic \nto expect them to learn the technical details of our country's customs \nlaws relating to revenue and commercial functions. The addition of \ncustoms revenue and commercial functions to their committee's agenda \nwould only distract them from their central focus, national security. \nIf that were to occur, Senate oversight of both the national security \nand international trade agendas of the United States would suffer.\n  Our amendment also recognizes that removal of customs revenue and \ncommercial functions from the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee \nwould be disruptive to U.S. businesses, and thus harmful to U.S. \neconomic interests. The Finance Committee has a long history--of some \n188 years--of exercising jurisdiction over tariffs and trade. This long \nhistory, and the technical expertise it has helped engender within the \ncommittee, provides the Finance Committee with an exceptional ability \nto provide sound oversight in the Congress over our government's \ncustoms revenue and commercial functions. Not surprisingly, the U.S. \nbusiness community has developed strong confidence in the workings of \nthis committee. Moreover, these same businessmen and women have doubts \nas to whether the committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs--with its focus on national security--would pay sufficient \nattention to trade compliance and revenue functions.\n  The U.S. business community acted, and quickly, this week upon \nhearing rumors of possible legislation to strip jurisdiction over \ncustoms revenue and commercial functions from the Finance Committee. \nLet me read to you excerpts from letters sent to me this week on this \nissue.\n  The National Retail Federation wrote that ``NRF's members are deeply \nconcerned that moving jurisdiction for duty collection process issues \nfrom the Finance Committee would serve to reduce U.S. interest in \npreserving trade revenues, and require members of those committees to \nspend a great deal of time on revenue issues that are not central to \nthe Government Affairs Committee's main jurisdictional interests. Of \nequal importance, the Senators who have served on Finance have \ndeveloped expertise in these complex revenue issues that many members \nof the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee do not \npossess and would have to develop.''\n  In another letter, the National Customs Brokers & Forwarders \nAssociation of America stated that ``protecting our borders is vital. \nAs we take measures to enhance security at our borders, however, we \nmust also carefully weigh the consequences to the flow of international \ntrade. . . . The Senate Finance Committee possesses the knowledge and \nexpertise necessary to provide effective oversight over Customs' \nbusiness facilitation issues. For over 200 years, the Finance Committee \nhas been involved in the details of customs processing and their role \nis significant in assuring that the Senate gives due consideration to \nthe practical consequences of security measures.''\n\n  The Business Coalition for Customs Modernization, which is composed \nof 24 major companies operating in the United States, voiced similar \nconcerns. It wrote that ``granting jurisdiction over the business \nfacilitation functions of the Customs Service to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Government Affairs--a committee concerned \nprimarily with security--will lead inevitably to commercial \nconsiderations being discounted heavily in the name of security, \nwithout thought about the effects on America's consumers. That will \nhurt the U.S. economy and undermine our strength and standard of living \nin the long run.''\n  As pointed out in these letters, as we move forward in enhancing our \nborder security efforts, it is important to keep in mind that a large \npart of homeland security is economic security. And international trade \nis a critical component of our economic security. Exports alone \naccounted for 25 percent of U.S. economic growth from 1990-2000. \nExports alone support an estimated 12 million jobs. Trade also promotes \nmore competitive businesses--as well as more choices of goods and \ninputs at lower prices for U.S. consumers. If we impede trade, we \nimpede our own economic growth and our own future well-being.\n  A concrete example can be found by looking at one sector of the \neconomy immediately following the events of September 11. Just 36 hours \nafter the attacks, Daimler-Chrysler announced that it would close one \nof its assembly plants because it could not get the parts it needed to \ncontinue operations from Canada. Similar circumstances caused Ford to \nlay idle five of its assembly plants--each producing an average of one \nmillion dollars worth of cars per hour--for a week.\n  Events like this make it clear that the United States must be at the \nforefront in developing the border technologies and enforcement, \nmethodologies which will enable our economy to prosper and grow in the \npost September 11 world. We cannot afford to do any less. The Finance \nCommittee has the experience and expertise to appropriately meet this \nchallenge. And I'm pleased that the resolution we passed today \nacknowledges the unique role of the Committee.\n  Finally, it only makes practical sense for the Finance Committee to \nretain jurisdiction over customs revenue and commercial functions. Rule \nXXV of the Standing Rules of the Senate provides that the Finance \nCommittee is the committee to which shall be referred all proposed \nlegislation, messages, petitions, memorials, and all other matters \nrelating to reciprocal trade agreements and tariffs. It also provides \nthat the Finance Committee has jurisdiction over customs. The reason \nthat the Finance Committee has jurisdiction over reciprocal trade \nagreements, tariffs, and customs is precisely because all of these \ntrade issues are all interrelated. Trade agreements set tariff levels, \nand customs personnel administer the U.S. laws relating to these \ntariffs. Therefore, as long as the Finance Committee has jurisdiction \nover reciprocal trade agreements and tariffs, this committee almost by \nnecessity must have jurisdiction over customs revenue and commercial \nfunctions.\n  For these reasons, I'm very pleased that the Senate voted this week \nfor the Finance Committee to retain jurisdiction over customs revenue \nand commercial functions. In doing so, the Senate permitted the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs to focus on its \ncore objective of national security, and prevented a disruption to U.S. \nbusinesses that could result if such jurisdiction were removed from the \nFinance Committee. In addition, given the Finance Committee's \njurisdiction over reciprocal trade agreements and tariffs, it only \nmakes sense for this committee also to maintain its jurisdiction over \ncustoms revenue and commercial functions of the Bureau of Customs and \nBorder Protection and the Bureau of Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement, even though these agencies are now housed in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, because of previous long-standing \ncommitments in the State of California and an unexpected family \nillness, I was not able to be present to vote on the Senate \nIntelligence Reform Resolution. Had I been present, I would have voted \n``yes.''\n  Earlier this week, the Senate overwhelmingly passed legislation to \nimplement recommendations of the 9/11 Commission in terms of reforming \nthe intelligence structure of the executive branch and strengthening \nour efforts at homeland security. That was an important bill, and I \nhope we can quickly resolve differences with the House so that it can \nbe sent to the President for his signature.\n  Equally important, however, is to implement intelligence reforms here \nin the Senate, as was also recommended by the 9/11 Commission.\n  This resolution strengthens the Senate Intelligence Committee, and it \ncreates a new Intelligence Appropriations Subcommittee. In addition, \nthe Government Affairs Committee will become the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, and the Committee will have greater \njurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security.\n  All three of these steps will streamline operations in the Senate and \nmake it easier for the Senate to conduct meaningful oversight of \nintelligence and homeland security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel).

Mr. President, I am not going to show any disrespect for \nthe distinguished leader, majority leader, who is talking right now, so \nI will wait until he is finished.\n  I was saying, I thank the distinguished majority leader for listening \nto what I am saying. I will be brief. I am not sure I will use 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. President, in my office hangs the Ten Commandments. We have heard \na lot about the Ten Commandments in recent years. I believe in the Ten \nCommandments. I believe we ought to respect those commandments, one of \nwhich says:\n\n       Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy.\n\n  I am not saying I am a good man. My Bible says that no man is good. \nNo man is good. But I think we ought to show some respect to those \nChristians in the body, and in our country, and many people who are not \nChristians, our Jewish friends, who believe in the Ten Commandments. As \na matter of fact, the Ten Commandments originate, as we know, at the \ntime when Moses went up on Mount Sinai and was given the tablets by God \nhimself, by the Almighty himself. So we believe that.\n  I am a Christian. I may not be the best one around. I don't claim to \nbe. But I do claim to be a Christian. I believe that way, and I believe \nthat we ought to observe the Ten Commandments. I think that this body, \nas the greatest legislative body in the world, together with the other \nbody, in particular should set an example of respecting the various \nreligions that make up our Nation. That is why I take the floor today.\n  I think we are setting a bad example. I don't think we are showing \nproper respect to Christians in our country, and all over the world, \nfor that matter, by publicly failing to observe that Commandment, that \nwe keep the Sabbath Day holy and remember it.\n  I want to say I am protesting the fact that we are going to have a \nvote on tomorrow. I told my leadership I had hoped we wouldn't have \nvotes on tomorrow. I also offered to say, Well, it is fine to have \nvotes after sundown. The old Sabbath ran until sundown. Let's have any \nvotes after sundown. If we have to have votes, let's have them after \nsundown. I asked my leaders to consider that. They did, and for various \nreasons they decided not to--that we had to have the vote.\n  I have to say as majority leader, when I was majority leader, I could \nhave easily put this vote over to Monday simply by adjourning and not \ncoming in tomorrow--which I would do, in this case. If this were an \nemergency, if something suddenly came up and it was a dire emergency, \nof course. You know the Bible says the ox may be in the ditch and we \nhave to get it out of the ditch. But the ox is not in the ditch here. \nWe have wasted a lot of time this year, and recently. We waste a lot of \ntime. We are not in session when we could be in session. Then all of a \nsudden, here we are going to have this vote on Sunday. There are \npracticing Christians who like to go to church and want to observe this \ncommandment.\n  So I say of course I will be in to vote. I have cast more rollcall \nvotes than any other Senator in the history of the country. I guess I \nwill not miss this one. But I am protesting. It could have been \notherwise. It didn't have to be. It didn't have to happen tomorrow. We \ncould have had it earlier. We jam these. We have a way around here in \nthe Senate lately of jamming. The leadership on the other side--I have \nto say the Republicans are in control of the body--they have a way of \njamming us. Maybe we are all at fault a little bit. But there is no \nreason why we should have to come in on a Sunday, on the Sabbath, and \nhave rollcall votes. I protest it today. I hope it won't be done again \nafter this year. I hope I will still be living and still be serving in \nthe body.\n\n  I hope leadership will take this into consideration in the future and \nget our work done before the Sabbath comes and avoid having meetings on \nthe Sabbath Day. It just isn't necessary. It is not a dire emergency. \nIf it were, as I said, and the ox were in the ditch, I would say let us \nget it out and let us go in and vote. If it is important to the safety \nof the Nation, to the safety of\n\n[[Page S10926]]\n\nthe American people, or whatever, dire, we have to do it, of course. I \nthink the Almighty would waive the Commandment as far as that is \nconcerned. I understand we have duties, but I don't think it has to be \ndone now.\n  I want to complain about the way we have done the business of the \nSenate--lagged along and dragged along and come in and have voting \nsessions on late Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday, and we go out on \nFriday. We don't come in until Monday late. There are all kinds of \nreasons which I will bring up at another time perhaps and talk again \nabout it.\n  I am not thinking at this point that we are going to be able to waive \nthis unless the majority leader will be of a mind to put this vote over \nuntil Monday.\n  May I have 1 more minute, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I don't see why we can't have the vote \ntoday, or if not today, move it over until Monday. That could be done. \nThe majority leader can easily do this, no question about it. I could \ndo it when I was majority leader. I respect the majority leader, and I \nrespect his doing whatever he has to do, but I am saying that a stitch \nin time would save nine.\n  As one Senator, I say that we should uphold the Commandments. I have \nalways felt that side of the aisle and this side of the aisle are \nhighly observant of the 10 Commandments and make a big to-do about \nreligion in this country. Why don't we have a little religion here \ntoday and put this vote over from tomorrow and not come in on Sunday? \nCan't we do that?\n  I thank the Senators for allowing me to say these few words. I thank \nthem. I will take my seat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/09/senate-section/article/S10926-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10926-S10928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PROVIDING AGRICULTURAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport Senate Resolution 454 by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 454) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate that the 108th Congress should provide the necessary \n     funds to make disaster assistance available for all \n     customarily eligible agricultural producers as emergency \n     spending and not funded by cuts in the farm bill.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the resolution by the \nSenator from Iowa, the ranking member on the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, and I wish to support his outrage to the rip-off of money \nfrom the Conservation Security Program to pay for Agriculture disaster \naid.\n  The Conservation Security Program exists because of the heroic \nefforts of the Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin.\n  It was reported out of the Senate Agriculture Committee, on which I \nam proud to serve,\n  It passes the Senate, the House, and it was signed into law by the \nPresident in 2002.\n  The program is underway, and it is benefiting farmers in my State of \nMinnesota and elsewhere.\n  The bill the Senate passed back then also included disaster aid--but \nthe House bill do not.\n  In Conference Committees, the House opposed disaster aid, the White \nHouse opposed disaster aid, so the final legislation contained no \ndisaster aid.\n  It was a terrible hole in an otherwise excellent Bill, for its \ncounter-cyclical program. As crop prices go up--price supports go \ndown--farmers make more money from higher market prices and taxpayers \nsave money.\n  Everyone wins except farmers who suffer disasters and lose most or \nall of their crops. They get no benefit from higher market prices \nbecause they have little or no product to sell.\n  Because of a cruel twist of fate, they watch their hard work amount \nto nothing--nothing except destitution and bankruptcy.\n\n  If there were ever a time when government should lend a helping hand, \nit's in the face of a natural disaster.\n  Disaster aid is all of us insuring every one of us.\n  Hurricane, tornado, flood drought, frost, heat wave, epidemic, who \namong us is not potentially vulnerable to a disaster?\n  And if we lose our home, business, or farm, and are left destitute by \nthat disaster, and if we have paid our taxes for years to benefit \nothers, shouldn't our fellow citizens extend a hand to help us back on \nour feet?\n  Not a hand out but a hand up, a hand back up to productivity, \nprofitability and dignity.\n  The House of Representatives would not extend that helping hand to \nAmerica's farmers. The White House would not extend that helping hand \nto America's farmers. So much for compassionate conservatism.\n  I guess that means you are very conservative with your compassion. It \ndoesn't go very far. It goes mainly to those who don't need it. And \nthere is little left for those who do.\n  This time a number of us in the Senate insisted upon disaster aid for \nour farmers who have suffered losses during the last 2 years.\n  A couple of weeks ago, the House sent over a $2 billion hurricane \ndisaster aid bill. We were asked to pass it without debate. The \nPresident was traveling to Florida the next day. Just like that, $2 \nbillion, with no questions asked, no offset.\n\n  I supported that aid. But I made it clear, as did my colleagues, that \nI would not support further disaster aid that did not include \nMinnesota's farmers.\n  Now we have that disaster aid. In part; it covers only 1 of the past \n2 years.\n  So those farmers hit the hardest--those who had the exceptional \nmisfortune to suffer natural disasters in both years--they will receive \nno help for 1 of those 2 years.\n  That is compassionate conservatism--those hurt the worst get only \nhalf the help. Unfortunately, that was the best we could do. But we \ncertainly did not expect that disaster aid would be taken away from \nconservation security, robbing one farmer to help another.\n  Helping hurricane victims didn't come out of another program. \nHurricane victims won't have to choose between one of two hurricanes.\n  This isn't right. It isn't just. And it's certainly not \ncompassionate.\n  This offset is not only unfair, it is unnecessary. The 2002 farm bill \nhas spent $16 billion less than originally designed, due to higher \nmarket prices.\n  The counter-cyclical program designed by Senator Harkin has worked--\n$16 billion budgeted has not been expended. It will not be expended. \nBut--we are told--OMB will not count those savings.\n\n  And once again, the Legislative Branch, which constitutionally has \nthe right to appropriate--is toadying up to the Executive Branch.\n  As Senator Byrd has reminded us so eloquently, we serve with the \nExecutive Branch; we don't serve under the Executive Branch.\n  I think the House and the White House are all too eager to gut \nanother farm program and this is their excuse.\n  Well, we have an election upcoming and no that day America's Farmers \nshould reject that excuse.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, disaster assistance has nearly always \nbeen designated as emergency spending, just like the President's \nsupplemental request now, which he wants to designate as emergency \nspending. The Senate spoke clearly by approving our agricultural \ndisaster aid amendment that treats agricultural disaster just like any \nother disaster, as emergency spending and not off-set by other \nprograms.\n  The President's supplemental request calls for agricultural emergency \ndisaster aid for farmers and ranchers, but only for those whose crops \nor livestock have been damaged by a hurricane or tropical storm. And as \nI said, he did not require that the assistance be offset. If we are \ngoing to treat all farmers and ranchers the same, the disaster aid for \nthem should make no difference if it is because of a drought in Texas, \nColorado or South Dakota, or a flood in Ohio or Pennsylvania or West \nVirginia.\n  There is a huge disparity in matching up the disaster assistance \nspending, which will occur in fiscal year 2005, against the offset, \nwhich is spread across fiscal years 2006 through 2014. Because of this \nmismatch there would be a budget point of order against this conference \nreport if it includes the offset from the farm bill as an offset for \nthe farm bill. This is another reason why the disaster assistance \nshould be designated emergency spending as it\n\n[[Page S10927]]\n\nhas been for many, many years--with only one exception, which was \nreversed not long afterward.\n  This budget problem is so significant that I would think, or at least \nhope, that the conferees and the leadership would be embarrassed to \nbring such an obvious budget gimmick to the floor. Let me explain \nfurther. The agricultural disaster package dollars will practically all \nbe expended in fiscal 2005.\n  However, the offset that the House adopted does not kick in until \nfiscal 2006 according to CBO scoring. The offset would save $56 million \nin fiscal 2006, then the per-year savings would increase over the \nyears, but the full offset would not be achieved until the end of \nfiscal 2014. Of course, I am not arguing for taking more out of the \nfarm bill earlier. I am just saying that this entire idea of offsetting \na disaster program that pays out in one year out of mandatory spending \nover the next 10 years is a charade. It will cannibalize money from the \nfarm bill and dramatically damage the conservation title of the farm \nbill. It will reduce the farm bill baseline and damage our ability to \nwrite the next farm bill in a few years. And it is a precedent that \nties the hands of the appropriations committee to respond to future \ndisasters.\n  The point of the whole exercise? To come up with a budget gimmick \nthat is not really even an offset and which raises a budget point of \norder. Again, the larger point here is that it makes no sense to \nrequire offsets for emergency disaster assistance legislation. A \ndisaster is a disaster no matter where it is--and an emergency is an \nemergency, no matter where it is. We should simply recognize the wisdom \nand the necessity of funding agricultural disaster measures through the \nemergency spending designation--which is the overwhelming precedent \nover many years. Again, with only one exception we can find ever--in \nthe past many decades in which we have responded to disaster losses.\n  American farmers and ranchers help keep food affordable in this \ncountry and also help to feed the world. They produce the food and \nfiber that is so vital to our economy while protecting our soil, \nhelping to keep our waters clean, and reducing air pollution across the \ncountry. And, they are the basis for the strongest part of our Nation's \neconomic engine--in fact, food and fiber comprise roughly 16 percent of \nour gross domestic product.\n  Farmers and ranchers did not ask for floods or frost or drought. \nCongress needs to respond to these natural disasters by providing \nassistance to those affected including the nation's farmers and \nranchers to help restore financial stability in times of such losses, \nand since we have traditionally provided such assistance on an \nemergency basis without cutting programs to the class of those \nsuffering--we should continue to do so as the Senate has already \nsupported.\n  Mr. President, I am deeply concerned today at the manner in which the \nCongress, and more specifically conferees to the fiscal year 2005 \nHomeland Security Appropriations bill, have chosen to address disaster \nfunding. Our agriculture producers in South Dakota and across America \nhave waited a long time for substantive relief--relief that will enable \nour family farmers and agricultural communities to survive through hard \ntimes--and the majority leadership has chosen to provide emergency \nrelief for hurricane victims while requiring farmers and ranchers on \nthe Northern Plains to cannibalize an already underfunded conservation \nprogram in order to secure moderate drought assistance.\n  With respect to the Conservation Security Program, the CSP budget was \nfunded at only 41 million dollars for Fiscal Year 2004. The severe \nfunding limitations on the program allowed the Natural Resources \nConservation Service to write only around 2,000 contracts, and limited \nwatersheds were chosen, not one of which was in my home State of South \nDakota. South Dakota has already been shortchanged because of decreased \nconservation dollars, and I would urge my colleagues to ensure CSP can \noperate as intended under the farm bill.\n  The disaster package that was attached to the Homeland Security \nfunding bill had bipartisan support and was approved in the Senate by a \nvoice vote. Given the enormous savings we have experienced with farm \nbill price support programs, totaling nearly $16 billion, we shouldn't \nbe robbing Peter to pay Paul to provide any type of substantive relief. \nFarmers shouldn't have to pay any more, and they shouldn't have to \nchoose between crucial environmental programs and substantive disaster \nrelief.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, is the FSC bill now before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n\n\n                      Intelligence Reorganization\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the chairman of the committee is here and \nwishes to speak on that measure. We have a number of people on this \nside who have been waiting today to speak. They will not be able to \nspeak until he finishes his statement, unless he decides not to give it \nimmediately.\n  I am going to give a very brief statement on the measure we just \ncompleted, that Senator McConnell and I worked on, a very short \nstatement. Then with the permission of the manager of the bill, the \nchairman of the committee, I will go into a rollcall, so to speak, \nfollowing your statement, who will speak on this side and who will \nspeak on your side.\n  Mr. President, as I said earlier this week on more than one occasion, \nchange is very difficult. Sometimes change is what we have to do. The \nevents of 9/11 were very bad, and as a result of that, reluctantly, \nenergetically, and enthusiastically, the 9/11 Commission was formed and \nthey met for a year. They did wonderful work. But for the 9/11 \nCommission, we could not have done the reorganization of this body that \nwe completed. As they found, our intelligence oversight was weak. Our \nhomeland security oversight was fractionalized. We can and must do \nbetter for this institution and the country. The legislation just \npassed does that.\n  We have recommended four additional ways to strengthen the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, which is no longer a select committee; it is \nan ``A'' committee. We have also recommended the creation of an \nAppropriations subcommittee on intelligence. I thought we should have \nthat as the last issue--the appropriations aspect of it. My friend, the \nSenator from Texas, offered an amendment that says there will be an \nintelligence subcommittee of Appropriations. But it is up to the \nAppropriations Committee as to whether they merge Military Construction \nand Defense or come up with something else. But there will be a \nfreestanding intelligence subcommittee on appropriations which, as \nGovernor Kean says, is in keeping with the spirit of the Commission's \nrecommendations.\n  We have also consolidated homeland security oversight in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. We have taken 10 committees' \njurisdiction. From some, we took away five or six items. Significant \nthings were taken from these committees. For example, from Environment \nand Public Works, my committee, we took FEMA, which is a very important \npart of what goes on in our country. That is the way it was through the \n10 committees from which we took jurisdiction. We have consolidated \nhomeland security oversight in the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  We know there are some who think we did too much. We have had \ncommittee chairmen and ranking members really complain about what we \ndid. They said: Why are you doing this? You are taking these things we \nhave worked on for 105 years. What right do you have to do that and \ncreate this monstrous committee? But we felt it was the right thing to \ndo--to bring together, the best we could, these homeland security \nfunctions. We did that.\n  There were others who thought we didn't go far enough. I say to them, \nthey should have listened to the complaints and the admonitions we \nreceived from chairmen and ranking members and members of these \ncommittees. There can be no doubt that the new homeland security and \ngovernmental affairs committee will be one of the most powerful \ncommittees in the history of the Senate.\n  The committee will exercise its vast jurisdiction effectively under \nthe leadership of Senators Collins and Lieberman. They are \ndisappointed; they wanted everything. But they got most everything. I \nam sure they will do a good job there. Remember, the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, before we started, was a pretty powerful committee. \nNow it is a committee that is a very powerful committee.\n  We would not have gotten here without the support of Senators Frist \nand Daschle. I said at a press conference that Senator McConnell and I \njust had, the next time Senator Daschle calls me and says, I have a \nlittle job for you, I am going to get a few more details about what \nthat little job is before accepting it. I think Senator McConnell feels \nthe same way. This has been very hard. I have a few Members on my side, \nchairmen, who are upset at me. But we did the right thing. We did the \nright thing.\n\n  Anyway, I appreciate the support of the two leaders who formed a \nworking group for this resolution. I express my appreciation to the \nmembers of my working group, my task force. They were so supportive and \ndid such a good job in helping us get to where we are. I appreciate the \nfeedback we got from members of our working group, and all Senators \nwere committed to reforming the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I want to personally thank Senator Mitch McConnell. It \nhas been difficult for him and for me. But I said last night on the \nfloor and I will say it again this afternoon--it is true that I \ncertainly cannot understand totally the Presiding Officer's feelings \nbecause he has been in actual mortal combat, and the relationships \nformed there, I guess, are as close as any relationships could be. I \ndidn't fight in the jungles in Vietnam as did the Presiding Officer. \nSenator McConnell and I fought in the ``jungles'' of the Senate and, as \na result of working as we did in the last almost month on this, we \nformed a very close friendship--something we didn't have before. I will \nalways remember this time we spent, and I express publicly my \nadmiration for the Senator from Kentucky for sticking with the program. \nIt wasn't easy to do.\n  I have the greatest respect for his staff, Robert Karem, Kyle \nSimmons, Mike Solon, Brian Lewis, and John Abegg. They worked very \nhard. Two people on my staff worked very hard. Rich Verma worked so \nhard. He is a lawyer and we used his negotiation skills on many \noccasions. And then Gregg Jaczko, who has a Ph.D. in physics. We needed \nhis scientific background. He understands the legislative process, and \nhe has done an outstanding job. I hope everybody in the Senate feels \ngood about the work he has done because he has been selected by Senator \nDaschle to be a member of the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, \nthe NRC. His nomination is pending in the Senate now. He did an \noutstanding job working with Robert, Kyle, Mike, Brian, and John.\n  I have thanked the members of the 9/11 Commission. I thank the \nfamilies who were impacted by the attacks on our country. We would not \nbe in the position we are today without their efforts. We have made our \ncountry safer as a result of what happened in the legislation that was \nmarshaled and passed by Senators Lieberman and Collins, and the work \ndone by Senator McConnell and myself is going to make our country \nsafer. Serious times call for serious action. That is what we have done \nhere. I appreciate very much my colleagues' support.\n  Following the statement of the Senator from Iowa, on our side of the \naisle, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Harkin be recognized for 5 \nminutes, Senator Dorgan for 20 minutes, Senator Dayton for 10 minutes, \nSenator Jack Reed for 30 minutes, and Senator Landrieu to follow for a \ntime of 90 minutes.\n  Mr. President, Senator DeWine is the Republican who is the only one \nwho has come forward, other than Senator Grassley. Because of the \ngentleman he is, he said he would be willing to wait until Senator Reed \nfinishes his statement. I appreciate that very much. Senator DeWine \nwants to be recognized for up to 1 hour. Again, I ask unanimous consent \nthat that be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, is it the \nSenator's anticipation that we go back and forth?\n\n[[Page S10929]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Yes. If there are people who come with relatively short \nstatements who are on the majority side, we would fit those in between \nthe statements. We want to make sure Senator DeWine, who is being such \na nice person, doesn't get jammed in the process. He, in fact, has \nagreed to let these others go before him. If a Republican comes over, \nwe can do that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, may I have an hour after Senator DeWine?\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kennedy be given up to \n1 hour following Senator DeWine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am glad that we are finally getting up \nthe FSC/ETI bill, the JOBS bill as it is sometimes referred to, because \nthis bill will create jobs in manufacturing.\n  As everyone knows, the World Trade Organization has ruled that our \nForeign Sales Corporation extraterritorial income legislation that has \nbeen on the books for quite a few years is an illegal export subsidy \nand has authorized up to $4 billion a year in sanctions against U.S. \nexports. These sanctions actually began way back in the month of March \nthis year. They now are at 12 percent and they are going to increase 1 \npercent each month that we do not repeal the existing law. By November, \nthey will be at 13 percent, and Senator Frist rightly has called these \n``Euro taxes'' on our exporters.\n  It has been a long road to what I hope will be final passage of this \nlegislation. Both bodies passed bills to deal with the Euro taxes. Both \nbodies struggled to get this to conference. Nothing has been easy, but \nwe are at last in the final stages.\n  Now that we are at the doorway of final passage, we cannot fritter \naway the opportunity to eliminate this tax put on our exports to Europe \nby the European Union.\n  American workers, especially those in the manufacturing sector, put \nin the work necessary to make the U.S. the most productive economy in \nthe world. We Senators have to employ the same work ethic. We have to \nmatch our constituents' work productivity. We cannot delay on this \nmatter any longer. We cannot leave the job site without finishing our \nwork.\n  I will inform my colleagues of what happened during the conference \nthis week. It was one of the most open and unusual conferences between \nthe Senate Finance Committee and the Ways and Means Committee of the \nHouse that we have ever had. There were 18 House conferees and 23 \nSenate conferees. The conference chairman, Chairman Thomas of the Ways \nand Means Committee, started the ball rolling with a discussion draft. \nThe discussion draft reflected the core elements of both bills.\n  The main piece complied with our WTO obligation by repealing the \nForeign Sales Corporation extraterritorial income regime. In its place, \nwe provide a deduction for all manufacturers, big and small. That was a \nsignificant movement toward the Senate position.\n  In one move, Chairman Thomas addressed the top Senate priority; that \nis, that all manufacturers receive the benefit of the deduction.\n  The next piece of the discussion draft included a package of \ninternational tax reforms that will make America's manufacturers yet \nmore competitive. This package reflects the priorities of both the \nSenate and the House bill.\n  Finally, the discussion draft included identical and near identical \nprovisions from both bills. Revenue neutrality was another important \nprinciple of the Senate bill, and I appreciate Chairman Thomas's \ncooperation on this Senate priority. Indeed, it was the bipartisan \nFinance Committee staff that refined the offsets that made this bill \nviable in the first place.\n  After presentation of the discussion draft, each Member had an \nopportunity to put forth their priorities by filing amendments for the \npublic conference. Finance Committee conferees recognized the \nsimilarity to the customs of the Senate Finance Committee markup, the \nway we have done it traditionally in the Senate Finance Committee. This \nprocess was very unusual for a conference. Normally, conferees go \nthrough a series of meetings and exchange of offers or some other \nelongated process.\n  I have been a member of the Finance Committee for nearly 20 years, \nand I can tell my colleagues that in nearly all cases, conferees debate \nthe issues in private. Nearly all of the toughest decisions come down \nto private negotiations between the two chairmen. Those decisions are \nreached after conferee input.\n\n  In this conference, however, all discussions were aired publicly. \nSometimes conferences take months. Sometimes they end without \naccomplishing anything before the adjournment of a Congress. We had \nneither option before us. We were in an unusual and sensitive situation \nbecause we are coming up now to adjournment of this Congress. Unusual \nsituations require then unusual procedures. We had only a few days \nremaining to enact this measure. That is not much time, but we are here \nnow before the Senate, and this bill has passed the House of \nRepresentatives already.\n  The bottom line is that we have to move this measure to the President \nof the United States. I am fully committed to getting this bill done \nbefore we leave for the elections.\n  I appreciate the House's willingness to open up this process and let \ntransparency occur through the amendment process. I would also like to \nthank my Finance Committee conferees, particularly my friend and \nranking member, Senator Baucus. We would not be here--in fact, we would \nnot have even gotten this bill through the Senate without the \nbipartisan spirit of the Finance Committee members and Senator Baucus's \nefforts in that. That spirit remained in place as we took the final \nsteps in the conference committee between the House and Senate.\n  Both the House and Senate agreed on the basic structure of the bill \nand on the policy. In addition to the major movement to the Senate on \nthe structure of the manufacturing deduction and revenue neutrality, \nmany Senate priorities have been addressed. An expanded renewable \nelectricity reduction credit is included. This was a high priority for \nSenate conferees Bingaman, Smith, Daschle, Hatch, Baucus, Snowe, \nBreaux, Lincoln, Conrad, Bunning, and Gregg.\n  Chairman Thomas recognized this as an important bipartisan mark and \nincluded section 450 in his mark even though it cost over $2 billion to \naccommodate the Senate on this issue, within the spirit of revenue \nneutrality.\n  We have a very good small business package as well included in the \nconference report. The bill before us extends small business expensing \nfor another 2 years. The bill contains significant S corporation \nreforms. Even though the subchapter S corporation provisions were House \nprovisions, they have historically been Senate priorities. We have \nprobably the most comprehensive agricultural and rural community tax \nincentive package ever.\n  I thank Chairman Thomas for including these Senate priorities in his \nmark. For everyone, there is a substantial overhaul of the fuel excise \ntax system, with a VEETC proposal, fuel fraud, and also biodiesel \nprovisions.\n  These provisions will mean more highway money for more States. \nAccording to Federal statistics for the current fiscal year, 37 of 50 \nStates will receive more highway money because of the VEETC proposals \nin this bill. There will still be more highway money for all States \nfrom provisions in this bill by shutting down fraud when people do not \npay the fuel tax that is required under existing law. VEETC and fuel \nfraud provisions are estimated to put over $24 billion into the highway \ntrust fund.\n  Now, I point out that this bill does not contain many special \ninterest members' provisions. If my colleagues will recall, the JOBS \nbill passed the Senate 92 to 5. In part, the bill received such \nwidespread support because many Member items were accommodated when \nthis bill first went through the Senate. Literally dozens of narrow tax \nbenefits were adopted in committee and also added on the floor. Those \nprovisions also unnecessarily caused the bill to be defined as a \nspecial interest bill. Senator Baucus and I put out a staff analysis \nthat showed only a small portion of the bill's revenue was absorbed by \nthese individual Members' items. But that did not stop the criticism of \nthose items, either by Members of the Congress or by the press writing \nabout this bill, emphasizing things\n\n[[Page S10930]]\n\nthat were only a small part of the legislation.\n\n  The House bill also, however, contained Member items. They were fewer \nin number, but very significantly defined. Most of those items enjoyed \nsome Senate support.\n  In addition to the press criticism, the President also made clear to \nme he would not support a bill that is heavily laden with so many of \nthese narrow items.\n  Neither side got everything they wanted. For example, the House made \na huge concession by giving up its rate cut for only C corporations. \nThey had invested $15 billion for this in small C corporations, and \nanother $64 billion for large C manufacturing corporations. They \nrelented on this point in order to accommodate the Senate concerns \nabout extending the manufacturing rate cut to all manufacturers, \nregardless of whether they were C corporations, S corporations, \npartnerships, or individuals.\n  We have heard harsh complaints about the conference bill from Senator \nLandrieu because the bill does not contain her reservist amendments. I \nwould like to set the record straight on that point. The Senate voted \nin support of her amendment in conference. We approved it and presented \nit to the House for inclusion in the conference bill. The House \nrejected that amendment. The conference was open to the public. \nEveryone witnessed the vote. There were no back-room deals on the \nreservist amendment.\n  Finally, as a premise, let me note we knew the House would not accept \nas much in revenue offsets.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Indeed, the bill before us is smaller in size by more \nthan $30 billion than the Senate-passed JOBS bill.\n  There has been some grumbling about how much the bill grew beyond the \nsimple repeal of foreign sales corporations' extraterritorial income \nprovisions. One of the reasons it grew is because the Finance Committee \nfound sufficient offsets, most of which are loophole closers--loophole \nclosers Senator Kerry spoke about in the debate, that he wanted to \nclose. We did this to allow Members to have enough revenue to offset \nparticular Senators' interests in this bill.\n  This is also true of Senator Landrieu's reservist amendment. Not only \ndid we support it but we found a way to pay for it. We modified the \nforeign housing exclusion for high-income U.S. employees working \noverseas. Unfortunately, the House rejected that offset, and in turn \nthe specific amendment.\n  I think the Senate is being distracted by too much emphasis upon \nparticular specific Member priorities. I believe the core benefits of \nthe bill should not be sacrificed to narrow items. The core benefits go \nto manufacturers. It is all about creating jobs in particular, \nparticularly about creating jobs in manufacturing in America, where \nthere has been some concern expressed in the Senate about outsourcing. \nSo that is what this bill is all about. That is not to say we did not \nattempt to include a number of Members' issues from both sides of the \naisle, and from both bodies of Congress. There was a balance that \nneeded to be struck in order to get a compromise out of the conference \ncommittee. I committed to Chairman Thomas that I would defend the mark \nas a whole. Chairman Thomas made a similar commitment. That commitment \nenabled us to accommodate Member items that had broad support.\n  Let's finish the job this week before we leave. There is no excuse \nfor allowing partisanship to hold up this bill. I will remind everyone, \none more time, this bill passed the Senate Finance Committee on a \nbipartisan vote, 19 to 2. Only two Senators, both on my side of the \naisle, not on the Democrats' side, voted against this bill. Both of \nthose Senators, however, put their own special concerns aside for the \ngreater good, and are supporting this conference report. This is a \nbipartisan bill that reflects everyone's concerns, both Republican and \nDemocrat.\n\n  I will describe once again the history of this bill. The JOBS bill \nwas a bipartisan bill from the ground up. The framework was laid by \nSenator Baucus when he was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee in \nthe year 2002. In July 2002 we had a hearing to address the FSC/ETI \ncontroversy within the World Trade Organization. We have heard from a \ncross-section of industries that would be damaged by the repeal of the \nextraterritorial income laws we had on the books for the last few \nyears. We also heard from U.S. companies that were clamoring for \ninternational tax reform, because our tax rules were hurting their \ncompetitiveness in foreign markets. Their foreign competitors were \nrunning circles around them because of our international tax rules.\n  During this hearing, Senator Bob Graham of Florida and Senator Hatch \nexpressed concerns about how our international tax laws were impairing \nthe competitiveness of U.S. companies. After some discussion back there \nin the fall of 2002, we formed a blue ribbon commission to study this \nproblem. We all decided that decisive action was more important than a \ncommission. During that hearing, Chairman Baucus formed an \ninternational tax working group that was joined by Senator Graham, \nSenator Hatch, and this Senator, and was open to any other Finance \nCommittee Senator interested in participating.\n  The bipartisan Finance Committee working group developed a framework \nthat formed the basis of the bill that is before us this very day. We \ndirected our staff to engage in an exhaustive analysis of the many \ninternational reform proposals that have been offered. We sought to \nglean the very best ideas from as many sources as possible. Senator \nBaucus and I also formed a bipartisan bicameral working group, with the \nchairman and ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, in an \neffort to find some common ground on dealing with the repeal of FSC/\nETI. That effort did not go so well. But it did inspire Senator Baucus \nand this Senator to continue our Senate bipartisan development of a \nFSC/ETI repeal and international tax reform package.\n  We continued our efforts in cooperation with Senator Hatch and \nSenator Graham and a few other members of the Finance Committee who \nwanted to do what was fair and right in complying with the World Trade \nOrganization ruling. We continued our bipartisan efforts when I became \nchairman--again, in the year 2003. In July 2003 we held two hearings on \nthe FSC/ETI and the international reform issues. One hearing focused on \nthe effect of our tax policies on business competition within the \nUnited States and the other on international business competition. \nThese two hearings led to the bipartisan Senate bill that passed \nearlier, 92 to 5.\n  Let me review what is in the bill before us, because most of it comes \nfrom our bipartisan Senate bill. The core part of the bill repeals the \ncurrent FSC/ETI provisions that are in our current tax law and were \nruled out of order by the World Trade Organization because they are \ncontrary even to the laws of our own Congress.\n  FSC/ETI reduces the income tax on goods manufactured in the U.S. and \nexported overseas by as much as 3 to 8 rate points. That is, if a \ncorporation's tax rate is 35 percent, the tax rate on export income is \nsomewhere between 27 and 32 percent instead of that maximum of 35 \npercent.\n  It lowered the U.S. corporate rate on goods made in the United States \nand sold overseas to make us competitive because of the fact that the \nEuropean Union and those countries do not export their value-added tax. \nThe World Trade Organization has determined that the FSC/ETI is an \nimpermissible export subsidy and has authorized the European Union to \nimpose up to $4 billion a year of sanctions against U.S. exports until \nwe get rid of FSC/ETI, which this bill does.\n  Those sanctions begin March 1. They are up as high as 12 percent \nright now. They can go up as high as 17 percent. They can even go \nhigher than that if the European Union institutes longer phase-ins.\n  Our companies carry this burden because Congress has failed to act \nfor 2 or 3 years. That is why we must pass this bill before we leave \nWashington for our campaigning.\n  This should be a very serious concern of all Members because the \nsanctions are hitting commodity products such as agricultural goods, \ntimber and paper, as well as other manufactured products. Presently, \nabout 89 percent of the FSC-ETI export benefits go to the manufacturing \nsector.\n  Repeal of FSC-ETI raises around $55 billion over 10 years. If that \nmoney is\n\n[[Page S10931]]\n\nnot sent back into the manufacturing sector, which this bill does, \nthere will be a $50 billion tax increase on manufacturing. It is \nmathematically impossible for it doing anything else.\n  That is why the bill before us takes all $55 billion of the FSC-ETI \nrepeal money and sends it back to the manufacturing sector in the form \nof a 3-point tax rate cut on manufacturing income; in other words, that \ncorporate tax of 35 percent being reduced down to 32 percent.\n  This tax rate is for manufacturing in the United States. No company \nthat manufacturers offshore will benefit from it. We start phasing in \nthose cuts next year. The cuts apply to sole proprietors, partnerships, \nfarmers, individuals, family businesses, multinational corporations, \nand foreign companies that set up manufacturing plants in the United \nStates.\n  In total, this bill provides over $76 billion of tax relief to our \nU.S.-based manufacturing sector to promote factory hiring in the United \nStates--$76 billion not lost to the Federal Treasury because it is \noffset.\n  This bill also contains another $7 billion for small businesses, \nlocal communities, inland shipping, and other local business concerns.\n  There has been chatter in the press about the short-line railroad \nprovision benefiting big railroad companies. That is not true. Short \nlines are the small spurs that run off of the main railway systems and \ngenerally connect to local community businesses such as our grain \nelevators and our small factories. They connect them to the main rail \narteries. They are often owned by small rail companies or local \ncommunity businesses. This short-rail provision is vital to farming and \nrural communities across America, as well as secondary cities that do \nnot have the benefit of massive public rail systems.\n  This bill also contains an agricultural and small business package \nwhich devotes $5 billion to our home communities.\n  As I said before, this is probably the most comprehensive \nagricultural and rural community tax incentive package ever passed by \nthe Congress.\n  We also include international tax reforms, mostly in foreign tax \ncredit areas, and most of which benefit the manufacturing sector.\n  The international tax reforms largely fix problems our domestic \ncompanies face with the complexities of the foreign tax credit. These \nreforms are necessary if we are to level the playing field for U.S. \ncompanies that compete with our trading partners, particularly those \ncompanies that are in countries that have value-added tax and they \ndon't export that tax like we export our income tax as part of our cost \nof production.\n  You will hear arguments that the international reforms provide an \nincentive to move jobs offshore. Read the bill and you will find that \nis not true. We have carefully selected international reforms that do \nnot provide offshore incentives.\n  Our bill also includes a House version of the Homeland Reinvestment \nAct which will temporarily reduce tax on foreign earnings that are \nbrought into the United States for investment here at home instead of \noverseas. The Senate version of this provision is the work of Senators \nEnsign, Boxer, and Smith, a bipartisan measure.\n\n  We included a provision that allows naval shipbuilders to use a \nmethod of accounting which results in more favorable income tax \ntreatment.\n  There are enhanced depreciation provisions to help the ailing airline \nindustry.\n  The bill also expands the new markets tax credit to high outmigration \ncounties. These credits help economic development in rural counties \nthat have lost over 10 percent of their population.\n  We have also included the Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act. We have a \nspecial dividend allocation rule which benefits farm cooperatives.\n  We have other farm provisions that give cattlemen tax-free treatment \nif they replace livestock because of drought, flood, or other weather-\nrelated conditions--things all beyond the control of the farmer.\n  We included a provision that allows payments under the National \nHealth Service Corps loan repayment program to be exempt from tax. This \nis an important measure to enhance the delivery of medical services to \nrural areas that do not have the proper number of health practitioners.\n  The bill before us contains several energy provisions that were voted \nout of the Finance Committee that had been previously approved by the \nfull Senate in the JOBS bill.\n  I have already spoken about VEETC, which is short for volumetric \nethanol excise tax credit. This provision would add up to $14.2 billion \nof revenue to the highway trust fund over the 6-year life of the \nupcoming transportation bill now pending before Congress. This \nprovision alone could create as many as 674,000 new jobs in America.\n  The energy tax package also includes a new incentive for the \nproduction of renewable biodiesel--biodiesel made from soybeans--and \nhence, mixed at a 20-percent mixture with petroleum diesel, clean \nburning, no sulfur in that 20 percent, as an example of being \nenvironmentally friendly.\n  Anyway, the biodiesel provision means jobs in our heartland. \nRenewable fuels have directly generated over 150,000 new jobs. In fact, \nin 2004 alone, this industry will add 22,000 new jobs.\n  The bill also includes a provision to accelerate the production of \nnatural gas from Alaska and the construction of a natural gas pipeline \nfrom Alaska to the lower 48 States. According to our own Department of \nLabor's Bureau of Economic Analysis, construction of the Alaska natural \ngas pipeline would create nearly 400,000 jobs in construction, \ntrucking, manufacturing, and other service sectors.\n  The bill provides all of this tax relief, nearly $140 billion worth, \nand yet is revenue neutral, meaning we reduce taxes over here, close \ncorporate loopholes over here, raise a certain amount of money to make \nup for what is less taxation over here. It is revenue neutral--no \nadditional money added, no additional dollars added to the national \ndebt; not one dime to the Federal deficit.\n  The tax relief in this bill is paid for by extending Customs user \nfees, shutting down abusive corporate tax shelters, and attacking the \nabusive tax strategy used by Enron, which we unearthed during my \nFinance Committee Enron investigation.\n\n  Last October, the Finance Committee held hearings on the status of \nthese abusive corporate tax shelter activities. During that hearing, we \nreceived anonymous testimony from a leasing industry executive \ndescribing how U.S. corporations are able to take tax deductions for \nthe pair of sewer lines in the New York subway station.\n  Let me explain ``anonymous.'' This meant the person was testifying \nbefore the committee. We knew who he was, but he was not identified to \nthe public. But he knew what he was talking about. We have a situation \nwhere major corporations, through these abusive tax shelters, are \nclaiming tax deductions on taxpayer-funded infrastructure, mostly by \nmunicipalities located both in the United States and overseas. Imagine \nour surprise on the Senate Finance Committee to learn that the U.S. \ntaxpayer is subsidizing the cost of electric transmission lines in the \nAustralian outback. No one believes that, but it showed up in our \ninvestigation.\n  I could go on with a lot of other examples, but the bill before the \nSenate ends this corporate tax shelter abuse.\n  It was shortly after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that \nwe saw the beginning of the exodus of U.S. companies moving their \ncorporate headquarters to tax havens overseas, just setting up a shell \ncorporation, basically just a mailbox, for the sole purpose of evading \nU.S. corporate taxes. It was the events of September 11, 2001, and the \nensuing stock market plunge that provided companies with cost-efficient \nways to get out of the United States. That is one thing, but to get out \nof the United States just to cheat on their taxes and leaving \neverything else in the United States--that is the problem.\n  Members may recall the video I played for some members in which a big \nfour accounting firm partner said that U.S. companies were resistant to \nthis scheme out of some post-September 11 sense of patriotism and \nnational duty. This big four accounting firm partner said patriotism \nwould have to take a back seat when they see their improved earnings \nper share. Isn't that a nice thing to be talking\n\n[[Page S10932]]\n\nabout within 2 or 3 months after losing 3,000 Americans in the \nterrorist attacks on New York City and the Pentagon?\n  In this bill before the Senate, patriotism is not taking a back seat. \nThis bill includes measures to shut down this type of corporate \nexpatriations that are there for the sole purpose of dashing from the \ncountry and stashing the cash, as opposed to those patriotic \ncorporations that are staying in America and paying and playing here.\n  I am not pleased with the effective date that came out of the \nconference, but this bill does shut down for the future more of these \ncorporate tax shelter abuses that we call inversions. They are done. In \nfact, this bill represents the most comprehensive attack on tax \nshelters since 1986.\n  There is a great deal of good in this bill. We can rescue the \nmanufacturing sector. We can give companies less reason to outsource \nbecause the cost of capital--as one of the arguments for outsourcing--\nwill be less if this bill passes.\n  We also end European Union sanctions. By passing this bill we can \nrespond to the recent rise in gas prices through our encouragement of \nmore renewable fuels, and we can shut down every known corporate tax \nshelter abuse.\n  It is time to pass what is a very important bill to aid our \nmanufacturing sector, remove tariffs off our farmers' backs, create \njobs for our workers, and to place the Senate back on its footing, to \ndo its job, and move legislation that benefits the American working men \nand women.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand there was an order, and I am allowed to \nspeak for 5 minutes.\n\n\n                          Disaster Assistance\n\n  I take this time first to thank all the Senators who voted for S. \n454, expressing the sense of the Senate that disaster assistance ought \nto be emergency spending and not taken as an offset out of any other \nprogram, especially the farm bill.\n  The vote was overwhelming, 71 to 14. Once again, as we have in the \npast, the Senate has spoken very loudly and clearly that when a \ndisaster strikes, wherever it is, this is an emergency. It ought to be \ntaken out of the whole pot of Government money rather than invading a \nprogram and taking money out it as an offset.\n  Again, I have the deepest sympathy for all the people who got hit by \nthe hurricane in Florida and other States. They ought to be \ncompensated. That is a true emergency. It is a disaster. But we have \nhad disasters in other parts of the country. We have had floods, \ntornados, droughts, all kind of things. Just because it is not a big \nhurricane does not mean it is not just as devastating. It is. It makes \nno sense why we should have to then offset, take money out of existing \nfarm programs, to pay for agricultural disaster assistance. But that is \nthe position of President Bush and of the House leadership. We do not \nrequire offsets to respond to the hurricane disaster, and we should not \ndo it for any other disaster.\n  Seventy-one Senators again spoke and said emergencies are \nemergencies. Disasters require emergency spending.\n  I have to point out that last night in the debate in St. Louis the \nPresident said he had fought for strong conservation provisions in the \nfarm bill. I was there when the President signed the farm bill in May \n2002, and he touted the conservation title and how much he supported it \nand that one of the main reasons he was signing it was because of the \nstrong conservation title.\n  Yet today, his people, the President's own people from the White \nHouse and OMB, are up here telling the members of the House and \nSenators that in order to respond to the droughts, flooding, tornados \nand other disasters we have had around the country, that the disaster \npayments have to be taken out of the farm bill and that the place to \ntake them is from conservation.\n  Yes, you heard me correctly. The President of the United States, who \nso loudly last night said he fought for a strong conservation title in \nthe farm bill, today, his people are up here and saying to take money \nout of conservation to pay for agricultural disaster assistance.\n  I am sorry, can someone please join the dots for me? What is \nhappening? The President is saying one thing, but his people are up \nhere doing exactly the opposite. Does the President not know what his \npeople are doing up here or have they not informed him or what is going \non?\n\n  The farmers and ranchers of this country, as well as Americans who \nsupport conservation, ought to know that there is a provision soon \ncoming before the Senate that will take money out of conservation to \npay for disasters. It is wrong. Seventy-one Senators just spoke and \nsaid it is wrong. Yet the White House is insisting that disaster money \nhas to be taken out of conservation.\n  The White House and the House insist on provisions that basically \ntake money away with hand and give it back with the other and say to \nfarmers and ranchers: You are better off. It is a cruel hoax for \nagricultural producers. Farmers who receive disaster payments should \nnot suffer the loss of other farm bill benefits. Nor should our \nNation's farmers as a whole, the majority of whom will not receive any \ndisaster payments, be forced to bear the cost of disaster assistance by \nhaving farm bill benefits taken away to be transferred to a disaster \nprogram for only some farmers.\n  Why should the farmers in Pennsylvania have their conservation \nfunding taken away from them to transfer to farmers in Nebraska or \nWyoming or Colorado or Oklahoma or Texas or wherever the disaster may \nbe. The White House did not say to do that for Florida's hurricane \nlosses. They did not say to take money away from Alaska or Ohio or \nplaces like that to go to Florida. No, and they should not have. We \nshould all pitch in as we have before, the whole country, to respond to \nthe hurricane recovery. We pitch in because it is a disaster and \nemergency and so we fund it as an emergency, not by taking funding away \nfrom other vital programs. Yet for agricultural disaster assistance \nresponding to droughts, or floods or other disasters, the White House \nand the House leadership are telling farmers and ranchers they will \nhave to bear the cost of it by losing conservation funding from the \nfarm bill.\n  I am sorry, it is not right and not fair. And 71 Senators said it is \nnot.\n  Again, I ask the President: Please, Mr. President, you touted the \nconservation program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent for just 30 more seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, you touted the conservation program. Last \nnight you said you fought for a strong conservation title in the farm \nbill. And now you are taking money out of conservation to pay for \ndisasters. Please, Mr. President, I am telling you, get ahold of your \npeople who are at OMB--your people. They work for you. Get them on the \nphone right now and tell them, this agricultural disaster money ought \nto come out of emergency assistance, just like you proposed for the \nhurricanes, and not out of farmers' own pockets.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I understand there is a unanimous consent \nagreement. I ask unanimous consent it be modified so I may be \nrecognized now according to the time allocated under the unanimous \nconsent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, as a preliminary point, let me say I had \nthe privilege yesterday to go up to Walter Reed Army Hospital to visit \nsoldiers who have been injured in action defending this country and \nalso to visit the rehabilitation facilities there. And any time you go \nto Walter Reed, you are inspired by the courage, the selfless service, \nand the sacrifice of these outstanding young men and women. But I\n\n[[Page S10933]]\n\nwant to relay something I think is particularly appropriate but is not \noften said.\n  As I was leaving the room of an injured soldier from the 509th \nParachute Infantry Regiment, his parents--his mother and father--were \nthere, and his father stopped me and said: Senator, I want to make sure \nyou know something. The people in this hospital are extraordinary. They \nhave treated my son with extraordinary care. He is my child, but all \nthe people I have known here in this hospital treat my son as if he was \ntheir child.\n  That is an extraordinary compliment to the men and women of Walter \nReed, the Army Medical Corps, the doctors, the nurses, the technicians, \nthe occupational therapists, the janitors, the clerks. And it is not \njust Walter Reed, it is Bethesda, it is the Air Force Health System.\n  I do not think we spend enough time thanking those valiant soldiers, \nsailors, and air men and women for what they do. And certainly those \nsoldiers who have suffered and are being treated, rehabilitated, we owe \nthem more than we can ever repay. We have to match their courage with \nwise and thoughtful policy.\n\n\n       Operational Deployment of the Ground-Based Missile System\n\n  Madam President, I am going to spend a few moments talking about a \npolicy which I do not consider to be the wisest and the most \nthoughtful, and that is the President's likely declaration, within a \nfew days, of the operational deployment of the ground-based missile \nsystem. We have constructed a test bed in Alaska. We are trying to \nassemble a system that will work to protect this country. I think \noperational testing is in order. In fact, I would hope that the \nadministration would actually follow the law more rigorously and \nprovide for a scheme of operational testing. But that is not the case.\n  To declare this immature, technologically challenged system as \ndeployed and operational today is a political judgment, not a military \njudgment. I think we should refrain from blatant political judgments \nwhen the security of the United States is in the balance.\n  Simply stated, this system is so immature and technologically \nchallenged that they canceled the last test. And it defies me to \nunderstand how, after cancelling the test, you can turn around and say: \nIt will work. It is operational. It defies common sense. It defies \nlogic. It is something I think, again, that simply is a political \nstatement.\n  Now, intercept tests are the critical means by which a missile \nsystem, any military system that is technologically sophisticated, must \nbe validated, must be tested. It is the only way we can truly assess \nwhether a system will work, whether it meets a minimum criteria for \ndeployment, to put it in the hands of American fighting forces.\n  The last intercept flight test of the system was conducted almost 2 \nyears ago in December 2002. It was a failure.\n  Six days after the test failed, the President announced that the U.S. \nwould deploy the missile defense system by the end of 2004. It is \nalmost like watching a piece of military equipment crash and burn and \nthen suddenly say it is operational. Again, it defies logic. It defies \ncommon sense.\n\n  Since the time of the last test failure in 2002, there have been \nseven other planned tests. They have all been canceled. Again, we are \nnot able to test this system. How in good faith can we say it is \noperationally workable? The tests have been postponed, deferred. None \nof these tests have taken place.\n  None of the major components of the system, neither the new \noperational interceptor, nor the operational radar, nor the operational \nbattle management system have ever been tested at all against a real \ntest target. Yet the President will say, I assume in a few days, this \nsystem is capable of protecting the United States.\n  In addition to all these test delays and cancellations, the \nadministration has essentially eliminated any effective oversight over \nthe missile defense test program, avoiding standards and laws that have \nbeen on the books for at least 20 years.\n  Years of hard experience have shown that it is much more expensive to \nfix a problem with a military system after you have built and deployed \nit than it is to fix it before it is deployed. Because of this, more \nthan 20 years ago, Congress passed laws which required all major \ndefense systems to undergo a full set of realistic operational tests \nprior to spending large amounts of money on full production and \ndeployment of the system. These tests were to be judged by an \nindependent test authority called the Director of Operational Test and \nEvaluation. This law is still in effect today.\n  Thanks to this law, we have been able to avoid some of the mistakes \nwe made in the 1970s and the 1980s, where we declared systems deployed \nand operational without adequate testing. These are high-profile \nsystems, like the B-1 bomber, the Sergeant York gun, and the Bradley \nFighting Vehicle. We were able to make certain corrections to the B-1 \nand the Bradley. They were eventually fixed at a cost of billions of \ndollars. The Sergeant York gun was unable to be fixed. That was \ncanceled. But we wasted billions of dollars by deploying these systems \nprematurely.\n  If the missile system is truly as important as the administration \nthinks, then we should take the time to test this system to make sure \nit works instead of trying to convince people, by press release, that \nit does work.\n  The missile system has been exempted by the administration from the \noversight of the independent Director of Operational Testing, and they \nhave plunged ahead with full-rate production of the program with no \nindependent testing at all. Incredibly, the administration has no plans \nto ever conduct realistic independent operational tests on this missile \ndefense system. This avoids 20 years of law, practice, and indeed \ncommon sense. The politics of deploying a missile defense at any cost \nprior to the election has trumped any desire to make sure the system \nactually works and, if history is any guide, will likely result in the \nwaste of a large amount of money to fix the system after it has been \ndeployed.\n  If we can--and I think we should, indeed, with deliberate speed--\ndeploy a system that is operationally effective, we should do that. But \nto take a system where the major components haven't even been tested \nand say it works is being intellectually dishonest and deceptive to the \nAmerican people.\n  On August 18, Secretary Rumsfeld described the missile defense \ndeployment as the ``triumph of hope and vision over pessimism and \nskepticism.'' Actually it is a triumph of best wishes over reality. And \nhope is not a plan. We found that out in Iraq. Only a system that is \nrigorously tested, where improvements are made test by test by test, \nwill get us to where we want to go and must be, a system that we are \nconfident will work if it is called upon to defend the country.\n  Now this lack of testing is not a result of any lack of funds. The \nadministration has lavished funding on this system. The budget request \nfor fiscal year 2005 is $10.2 billion. It is the largest single-year \nbudget request for any weapons program in the history of the United \nStates. For perspective, the fiscal year 2005 budget request for \nmissile defense is more than the Army's total research and development \nbudget for this year. And we know we have an Army engaged in combat, in \ntrying circumstances, that needs to develop new approaches, new sensors \nfor the troops, new observation devices, new ways to deal with \ninsurgencies in built-up areas, new ways to deter and defend against \nimprovised explosive devices. Their budget is a fraction of the budget \nthat is being lavished upon this system. It is twice the budget for the \nBureau of Customs and Border Protection in the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, and it is nearly twice the Department's allocation for the \nCoast Guard--two times Coast Guard, two times Customs and Border \nProtection.\n  The ultimate costs of this system are unknown because the \nadministration steadfastly refuses to provide to Congress any \ninformation on how much missile defense they want to buy and how much \nit will cost. Recent estimates by the Congressional Budget Office \nindicate the Bush administration's Missile Defense Program could exceed \n$100 billion. Nowhere is that $100 billion being factored into ongoing \ndefense budgets as we move forward over the next 5 to 10 years, and it \nwill have to come from somewhere. Again, we\n\n[[Page S10934]]\n\nneed a system, but we have to be honest about how much it will work and \nhow we are going to pay for it. That honesty is not present today.\n  The other factor--and this is interesting--in contrast to the numbers \nthat are being allocated for the Coast Guard and the Customs Service is \nthat an intercontinental launch against the United States is probably \nless likely than other means of detonating a weapon of mass destruction \nin the United States. First of all, there are only two countries that \ncurrently have the capability: Russia and China. The Bush \nadministration points--and I think rightfully so--with concern to North \nKorea. But that country has never successfully launched any missile \ncapable of reaching the United States. Furthermore, North Korea has \nobserved a self-imposed moratorium on long-range missile testing for 6 \nyears since their last test failed in 1998.\n  But even if North Korea develops such a capacity, why would they \nlaunch a missile against the United States? Our early warning \nsatellites will pick up the launch. It will tell us definitely and \ndecisively where it is coming from, and we will retaliate swiftly and \nwith devastating force that will likely destroy that regime. Why would \nthey want to do that, particularly if they could attack us by other \nmeans, perhaps concealing a weapon of mass destruction in a container \nthat comes to the United States since only a small percentage are \nopened?\n  Again, the budget for the Customs Service and the Border Protection \nService is a fraction of what we are spending on this particular \nthreat.\n  Now, that is not just my conceptual view. In December 2001, the U.S. \nintelligence community completed an assessment of the foreign ballistic \nmissile threat to this country. The assessment was entitled ``Foreign \nMissile Development and the Ballistic Missile Threat Through 2015.'' \nTheir conclusions:\n\n       [T]he intelligence community judges that U.S. territory is \n     more likely to be attacked with [weapons of mass destruction] \n     using nonmissile means, primarily because such means: Are \n     less expensive than developing and producing ICBMs; can be \n     covertly developed and employed; the source of the weapon \n     could be masked in an attempt to evade retaliation; it \n     probably would be more reliable than ICBMs that have not \n     completed rigorous testing and validation programs; and \n     probably would be much more accurate than emerging ICBMs over \n     the next 15 years.\n\n  This is what the intelligence community said in 2001 looking forward \nto 2015. Yet since that time, the Bush administration has spent \nbillions of dollars more on the development of this untested, unproven \nmissile defense than it has on protection of our ports and borders \nwhere the real threats are likely to come from.\n  We should be very careful about making sure we take scarce dollars \nand apply them to the most likely threats. Some have said: Well, don't \nmake those comparisons. We to have defend against every threat. \nFrankly, the simple contrast between the money we are spending on \nmissile defense versus the Coast Guard and border patrol seems to be \ndirectly in contradiction to the intelligence community estimate of \nwhat the most likely threat would be. That is not wise policy.\n  There is also a huge opportunity cost for us. While we are lavishing \nmoney on this system, there are other programs--for example, the \nDepartment of Energy program called the Global Threat Reduction \nInitiative--which are not being adequately funded. This Department of \nEnergy program is designed to help secure loose nuclear materials that \nare around the globe so that terrorists don't get their hands on them. \nAnd what is the most vital threat to the United States today? A \nterrorist group could obtain nuclear materials or a nuclear device, \nsmuggle those materials into the United States, and attack us here. \nThat is what the intelligence community assumes is the most likely \nthreat. Yet we are not going to the source and securing and eliminating \nthe nuclear material that is too abundant in the world.\n  There is another program that the administration is proposing, which \nis the airborne laser program, another part of this elaborate construct \nof missile defenses. The airborne lasers are designed to shoot down \nballistic missiles in their first stage as they blast off and start \ngoing into space. This program has been plagued by problems throughout, \nproblems which have delayed the program by a year, reduced the laser \npower by more than half, and have many wondering whether this program \nis doomed to fail.\n  By the way, using the same criteria of missile defense--i.e., test \nfailures followed by numerous cancellations--I wonder why the \nadministration doesn't declare the airborne laser operational. It works \nperhaps as well as our national missile defense.\n  During the same time the administration has been spending far less on \nsecurity for our Nation's ports, it has been spending a great deal of \nmoney on the airborne laser. The Bush administration's fiscal year 2005 \nbudget proposes a $50 million cut to the 2004 level of U.S. port \nsecurity funding, the grant funding that we use to help our ports all \nacross this country. Yet there they are still investing extraordinary \namounts, almost a half a billion dollars, in the airborne laser. So \nwhile it is a risky, possibly doomed program, the money keeps flowing \nwhile we do not have adequate resources to protect our ports.\n  The other aspect of this dilemma is that the administration has never \nbeen able to open up this process to a transparent approach, where \nscientists can look at this data. Of course, we are going to protect \nthe security and the proprietary information here, but they have been \noverly secretive. And the reason is obvious: it doesn't seem to work, \nand they don't want that information out as they are getting ready to \ndeclare it operational.\n  They also never really had the opportunity or the will to have \nrealistic tests. All of these tests have been carefully scripted. All \nof these tests have relied upon nonrealistic scenarios. The incoming \nmissile has a homing beacon on it to help guide the interceptor to it. \nThey don't use realistic decoys, which any country attacking the United \nStates, you would have to assume, would have decoys as well as a real \nwarhead. And there is no element of surprise. A real enemy missile \nattack would not be scripted, would not have a convenient homing beacon \non the target, would likely have realistic decoys and would be a \nsurprise attack.\n  Frankly, if we had warning of the pending attack, we would take \npreemptive action immediately, take out the missile on the launch pad.\n  During the entire time of the Bush administration, there has been \nessentially no progress made toward the goal of realistic missile \ndefense tests against realistic targets.\n  An effective missile defense is something we should all work for. But \na missile defense that is based upon a press release and not tested is \nnot an effective missile defense. Saying it is operational doesn't make \nit operational. What makes it operational is rigorous testing under \nrealistic circumstances. This administration has never done that.\n  I believe we should proceed forward with all deliberate speed to \ndevelop and deploy a missile system. I don't think we should allow \nourselves to make a political judgment and declare it operational by \npress release and not validation through testing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to discuss the FSC \nbill. Some may view this as a tax bill, and it is; some have called it \nthe American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and I think that is fair; I am \nsure it will do that.\n  But let me say to the Members of the Senate, my colleagues, what this \nbill could have been, what this bill should have been, and what it was \nwhen it left here, when we sent it to the conference committee. What it \nshould have been, what it could have been, what it was was the most \nimportant public health bill to be considered by this Congress.\n  Before the FDA provision to regulate tobacco was stripped out by the \nconference committee, it was the most important public health bill to \nbe considered by this Congress. It was the most important children's \nhealth bill to come before this Congress. Tragically, the conference \ncommittee stripped out the FDA provision that would have, for the first \ntime, put the marketing of the sale of tobacco under the same terms and \nconditions as the sale of every other product in this country. In this \nbill, which has so many things in it, there just wasn't room, according \nto\n\n[[Page S10935]]\n\nthe conference committee, for this FDA provision.\n  This is a sad day for the Congress. This Senate voted on an \namendment, 78 to 15, to include the tobacco buyout that helped tobacco \nfarmers, which I supported and continue to support, coupled with, for \nthe first time, having the tobacco controlled like every other product \nin this country and regulated by the Government. This bill we have in \nfront of us represents a missed opportunity. It is a missed opportunity \nto help our children, our grandchildren, and the public health. Two \nthousand children a day in this country start smoking; 400,000 people a \nyear die of tobacco-related diseases. Yet we failed in this bill; we \nturned our back on this historic opportunity.\n\n  I truly believe that in public life, as well as in life as \nindividuals, we are judged not only by what we do, but also by what we \nfail to do. I think we ultimately are held accountable for what we \ndon't do. So I intend to vote no on this bill. I intend to vote no on \ncloture because of the failure of the conferees to include this \nhistoric provision. We had the opportunity and missed the opportunity \nto close this loophole in the law, to deal with this anomaly in the \nlaw. Every product that comes on the market is regulated. When you walk \nin the supermarket today and you buy a product, every single product is \nregulated. The ingredients are on the package. If there is a claim that \nis made, that has to be substantiated. Every single product, except \none, and that product is tobacco--cigarettes and smokeless tobacco; \nthey are exempt. King tobacco is exempt in the law today. That is \nwrong.\n  This bill, as we sent it out of the Senate, in the wisdom of the \nSenate, would have changed that. Yet the conferees stripped out that \nprovision. So we should vote no on cloture and on the conference \nreport.\n  This was a historic opportunity that will not come again. The \ncoupling of the tobacco buyout and the coupling of the FDA-controlled \ntobacco--we will not have the opportunity to do that again. This bill, \nin fact, contained the tobacco buyout. I support that. If this bill \npasses, the tobacco buyout will be done and we will no longer have the \nopportunity to couple these together. We will have lost that--let's be \ncandid--political opportunity to put these two together. So we have \nlost that chance and that opportunity.\n  A yes vote on this conference report, a yes vote on cloture says it \nwas OK to strip that out. A yes vote says it is OK to turn our backs on \nour kids once again on this issue. A yes vote says it is OK, the status \nquo is fine, and business as usual is fine.\n  How long are we going to tolerate this? How long are we going to say \ntobacco is different than every other product in this country? How long \nare we going to say tobacco should not be regulated? How long are we \ngoing to say when one goes in and buys products on the market, every \nother product is regulated, one knows what they are buying but not \ntobacco? Why should tobacco be different?\n  Some Members may say, I cannot vote against this bill; there is too \nmuch in it. It has too much for my State, too many good things.\n  There are a lot of good things in there. There are things for my home \nState of Ohio. There are some things in there that are not that good, \nbut there are some good things in that bill, and I know that.\n  I have been in politics and Government for 30 years. I have been in \nthe Senate for 10 years. I have cast a lot of votes. When people say, I \ncannot vote no, when people say I have to do it, I say this to them: I \nhave been in politics for 30 years, and they do not have to do \nanything. There is nothing that compels anybody to vote any way on any \nbill. The longer one is doing this, I think the more they realize that.\n  So I say to my colleagues, they do not have to vote for this bill. \nThey do not have to vote for cloture. There is nothing that compels \nthem to. It is the wrong vote.\n  Sometimes one has to look at the big picture. Sometimes I think my \ncolleagues have to stand back from what would appear to be the \nparochial interests and look at the big interests, but I would maintain \nthat if they look at the interests of their State and look at the \ninterests of the people of their State, not to mention the interests of \nthe people of their country, they will come to the conclusion that \nvoting no on the motion on cloture, no on this bill is the right thing \nto do.\n  Look at my home State of Ohio. Yes, there are good things in here for \nOhio, but I will read to my colleagues the statistics from Ohio. I \nshare them with my colleagues as an example of what their State is \nprobably like as well.\n  Here are the statistics from the State of Ohio: 22.2 percent of high \nschool students smoke; 12.8 percent of the male high school students \nuse smokeless or spit tobacco. The number of kids under 18 who become \nnew daily smokers each year is 36,800. The number of kids who are \nexposed--this is all just Ohio, now. The number of kids who are exposed \nto secondhand smoke at home, 919,000; packs of cigarettes bought or \nsmoked by kids each year in Ohio, 36.3 million; adults in Ohio who \nsmoke, 2,251,000. That is 26.6 percent.\n  How about deaths from smoking? Adults who die each year from their \nown smoking, that is 18,900 just in my home State of Ohio. Kids now \nunder 18 and alive in Ohio who will ultimately, if they continue to \nsmoke, die prematurely from smoking, 314,000. Adults, children, and \nbabies who die each year from others' smoking, that is secondhand \nsmoke, is estimated between 1,800 to 3,200.\n  If we do not care about people, what about dollars and cents? Well, \nannual health care costs in Ohio directly caused by smoking, $3.41 \nbillion. That is ``billion.'' Portions covered by the State Medicaid \nprogram, that is what you and I pay if you are a resident of Ohio, \n$1.11 billion, and it goes on. Smoking-caused productivity losses in \nOhio, that is $4.14 billion; resident State and Federal tax burden from \nsmoking-caused Government expenditures, that is $534 per household.\n\n  Those are the figures. I look at this vote and I try to balance the \nfact that there are some good things that might be in here for my State \nversus what we could have achieved, what we could have done, and it is \na pretty easy choice.\n  The conference committee had no business scuttling the will of the \nSenate and throwing out the FDA provision. It was wrong. They should \nnot have done that.\n  I ask unanimous consent to use a few items in my speech. I am looking \nat them right now. They are some packages of cigarettes, a macaroni and \ncheese carton, yogurt, as well as a Sports Illustrated Magazine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I will explain a little bit to my colleagues what the \nbill we sent to the conference committee would have done, because I \nwant to explain the gravity of this. I will talk a little bit about the \nnature of what the tobacco companies can do that nobody else can do.\n  I will start with macaroni and cheese. We all buy it. If one has \nkids, they buy it, anyway. We all know what it is. I ask my colleagues, \nwhen they go home tonight, to look at the carton of macaroni and cheese \nand read what is in it. I am not going to bother to read everything \nthat is in it but it has everything. It has calories, salt; then there \nis a whole long list of enriched macaroni, durum wheat flour, citric \nacid, sodium phosphate. It goes on and on. The thing one has to do is \nhave pretty good eyes. If one is my age, they have to hold it back a \nlittle bit to make sure they can read it well, but it is there, and it \ncan be read. Everything one wants to know, and probably more; every \nhealth item in the world.\n  The same company makes Marlboros. Try to figure out what is in here. \nIf you do not smoke, go buy one, anyway, and take a look at it, or pick \nit up if you do not want to support the tobacco companies. Take a look. \nThere is nothing on here. There is a Surgeon General warning but there \nis not a whole lot on here. One cannot tell what is on here.\n  Do my colleagues know why? Tobacco is exempt. Nobody regulates them. \nNobody requires them to list what is in here. The same company: One \nmakes macaroni and cheese and one makes Marlboros. Why? Because it is \nnot in the law. How long are we going to put up with this? It is wrong.\n  Now I will turn to the claims that cigarettes make. Marlboro Lights, \nwell, that must mean something. I am sure it means something, but we do \nnot\n\n[[Page S10936]]\n\nknow what it means. Yogurt, light yogurt. When you see light yogurt, it \nmeans something. When you turn it around, it says one-third fewer \ncalories, and it better be one-third fewer calories. Definable, \nmeasurable; it means something. If it is on cigarettes, it doesn't mean \nanything. It may mean something. I don't know what it means. Again, no \nGovernment regulation. Cigarette companies are exempt. A loophole this \nlaw would have closed, now they stripped it out and it will not close \nit now. Tell me that is right. Explain that to the American taxpayer. \nExplain that to American citizens. Why? No explanation. There is no \nlogic behind that.\n\n  How about the claims of cigarettes? ``Premium Lights.'' Again we are \nback to the ``lights.'' ``All of the taste, less of the toxins.'' The \naverage person who buys cigarettes probably thinks this means \nsomething. Maybe it does. Maybe it doesn't. We will never know. We will \nnever know as long as this Congress continues to refuse to regulate the \ntobacco industry. We will never know. The American consumer will never \nknow whether, when the cigarette companies put claims on here like \n``all of the taste, less of the toxins,'' that is really true or \nwhether ``less of the toxins'' means anything. Most people would think \nit would. Maybe that is healthier or not as dangerous, but we don't \nknow that and we never will know it until this Congress changes the \nstatus quo.\n  Here is another one. This is Eclipse, ``20 Class A cigarettes,'' it \nsays. Here is what it says on the back, and again who knows if this is \ntrue:\n\n       Scientific studies show that compared with other \n     cigarettes, Eclipse may present less risk of cancer, \n     bronchitis, and possibly emphysema, reduces secondhand smoke \n     by 80 percent, leaves no lingering odor in hair or clothes.\n\n  That is important. Then, of course, they add:\n\n       All cigarettes present some health risk, including Eclipse.\n\n  That is nice of them to say. Again, how do we know the accuracy of \nthis claim? But again the average consumer picks this up and feels a \nlittle better with this. There is nobody to test it, nobody to regulate \nit.\n  Some people say: Mike DeWine, adults ought to know no cigarette is \nsafe. So buyer beware. Who cares?\n  I don't think that is the right attitude because I believe some \nadults do rely on less tar, less this, lighter, and scientific studies \nhave shown that.\n  But what about kids? It is here that the cigarette companies reach \nthe low point, absolutely the low point where nobody can defend them. I \nwill challenge anybody to come to this floor and defend what they are \ndoing. I have a whole bag of these. This is what they are doing. The \ncigarettes I am holding in front of me are not focused on a 57-year-old \nCamel smoker, I will guarantee. I don't see any 57-year-old Camel \nsmokers smoking this stuff. These are aimed at kids. Let me read it to \nyou:\n  Camel Mandarin Mint:\n\n       A blend of menthol and citrus flavor.\n\n  This is Liquid Coconut Flavor, Liquid Zoo:\n\n       An exotic blend of coconut flavored tobacco for a sweet, \n     fresh taste and aroma.\n\n  Camel Beach Breezer:\n\n       Sultry, smooth and swingin'.\n\n  Oh, this one, this is the old one, I guess; this is a\n  Camel Kauai Kolada:\n\n       Hawaiian hints of pineapple and coconut.\n\n  There we go. It goes on and on.\n  This is really exotic. This is Mocha Taboo:\n\n       Inviting and surprising, Mocha Taboo will entice you with \n     its sweet indulgence, while leaving you with a refreshment \n     that's unmistakably menthol.\n\n  And again, Liquid Zoo flavored cigarettes:\n\n       An exotic blend of coconut flavored tobaccos for a sweet, \n     fresh taste and aroma.\n\n  I invite my colleagues, if any Senator wants to, to come up later and \nactually smell these; it will not permeate the entire Chamber, but if \nyou get close you can smell them. This is something kids would like. \nThis is clearly targeted at kids, and this is what they are selling. \nNothing stops them from selling this. This bill would at least stop \nthem from selling this trash. It is not prohibition. But these products \nare designed for one reason and one reason only--to get kids hooked. It \nis an entry level drug. You entice them, you get them in, start them on \nthis, and move them to something else. There is no other reason. When \nwe vote for this conference report and condone what the conferees have \ndone, we are saying it is OK to allow this to continue.\n  This is Sports Illustrated. Any kid in this country who likes \nsports--I have had a whole household full of them, and I still have one \nat home--reads Sports Illustrated. This is a new edition, ``Smashing In \nSt. Louis.'' Everybody reads Sports Illustrated. Why should kids be \nsubjected to full-page ads in Sports Illustrated, full-page, color, \ninviting ads? There it is.\n  We have tolerated this for too long in this country. I had a Senator, \nwhen we were discussing this off the floor, tell me that he didn't \ntrust the FDA. I have had people tell me that. I guess my reaction to \nthat would be, do you trust the people who are trying to hook our kids \nwith this stuff? Do you trust them? Do you want them to continue to try \nto hook our kids with this stuff? I hope not.\n  People would say it is too late, this bill is already done. I agree, \nthis bill is done. But we should be sending a message and we should be \nsaying we are not going to tolerate this Senate passing this bill, this \nFDA reform, sending it on to the House, and then having it stripped out \nof this conference report. It is too serious an issue. It is too \nimportant.\n  I am not the only one who feels that this is a public health vote of \nimmense importance. I have a letter from the American Lung Association \ndated October 7. I would like to read it in part:\n\n       Dear Senator DeWine: How can the Congress give $10 billion \n     to tobacco growers without requiring anyone to exit the \n     tobacco farming business and fail to do anything for public \n     health? This in unconscionable.\n       Over 440,000 people die prematurely from tobacco-related \n     illness each year and two thousand children become addicted \n     regular smokers every day. Nearly 90 percent of lung cancer \n     and 80 to 90 percent of emphysema and chronic bronchitis are \n     caused by tobacco use. Despite this deadly assault on lung \n     health, tobacco products are the most unregulated consumer \n     products on the market today....\n       Please implore your colleagues to change course and include \n     the FDA oversight of tobacco in the FSC bill.\n       Tobacco companies continue to aggressively market their \n     products to our children, cynically targeting ``replacement \n     smokers'' for those who die or quit smoking. New flavored \n     cigarettes including R.J. Reynolds' Camel Exotic Blends Kauai \n     Koloda with ``Hawaiian hints of pineapple and coconut'' and \n     Kool Caribbean Chill and Mocha Taboo are aimed at young \n     people. The tobacco companies make health claims of ``reduced \n     carcinogens'' or ``less toxins'' without any oversight of the \n     veracity of the statements or their impact on health.\n       FDA regulation of tobacco would:\n       Ban flavored cigarettes.\n       Stop illegal sales of tobacco products to children and \n     adolescents.\n       Require changes in tobacco products, such as the reduction \n     or elimination of harmful chemicals, to make them less \n     harmful or less addictive.\n       Restrict advertising and promotions that appeal to children \n     and adolescents.\n\n  That was from the American Lung Association.\n  This is a letter from the American Thoracic Society:\n\n       Dear Senator DeWine: Congress is about to give the Big \n     Tobacco the one thing they want, continued access to the most \n     attractive market for their deadly products--our children. \n     Don't let Big Tobacco continue to peddle their products to \n     our children.\n       The best way to protect our nation's children from the \n     continuing disease and addiction caused Big Tobacco and their \n     deadly products is by granting the Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA) the authority to regulate tobacco.\n       The bipartisan compromised reached in the Senate FSC bill \n     would have granted the FDA the authority needed to regulate \n     tobacco and reduce underage smoking throughout America. \n     Unfortunately, during conference the supporters of Big \n     Tobacco struck the one provision that would have given our \n     children a fighting chance against the pervasive marketing \n     power of tobacco companies.\n       If Congress fails to give FDA the authority to regulate \n     tobacco, our children will pay the price. Children will pay \n     the price through a lifetime of addiction to tobacco \n     products. Children will pay through the diseases associated \n     with tobacco addiction--lung disease, heart disease and \n     cancer. Children will pay the price, literally, with their \n     lives.\n\n  Here is another letter from the Ohio Children's Hospital Association:\n\n       Dear Senator DeWine: I write today to express the terrible \n     disappointment felt among Ohio's children's hospitals that \n     Congress has lost an opportunity to protect the health of \n     America's children. This is a shameful waste of\n\n[[Page S10937]]\n\n     a rare opportunity to take the bold action needed to reduce a \n     staggeringly dangerous health risk that hurts kids and \n     increases the cost of health care.\n       Ohio has been working hard to reduce youth smoking, and \n     children's hospitals have long been at the frontlines of this \n     battle to protect our children from the devastating tool that \n     tobacco exacts. But, for every step forward we take (youth \n     smoking in Ohio is down recently), we face a barrage of new \n     and cunning attempts by the tobacco industry to regain its \n     foothold with Ohio's children. The tobacco industry is \n     spending more than ever to market its products in ways that \n     appeal to children. As a depressing example, we now face the \n     prospect of candy-flavored cigarettes.\n       Across the country, every day 2,000 more children become \n     regular smokers, one-third of whom will die prematurely as a \n     result.\n       FDA regulation of tobacco products represents the best tool \n     for combating the tobacco industry's reckless assault on our \n     children's health. We need the FDA to have the authority to \n     subject tobacco products to the same rigorous standards we \n     impose on other consumer products, including ingredient \n     disclosure, truthful packaging and advertising, and \n     manufacturing controls.\n\n  Here is a letter from the American Heart Association:\n\n       To the Members of the U.S. Senate: On behalf of the \n     American Heart Associations' 22.5 million volunteers and \n     advocates, I write you to express our deep dismay over the \n     Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) conference vote that failed \n     to grant the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authority to \n     regulate tobacco products. This represents a squandered \n     opportunity to protect the public against dangerous tobacco \n     products, a failure to protect our children from the \n     marketing of tobacco products, and also the adoption of the \n     wrong tobacco buyout plan. How can Congress explain such \n     neglect for our nation's health?\n       Tobacco use is responsible for more than 440,000 deaths \n     each year, with more than one in three from heart disease or \n     stroke. Each day, 4,000 youth try their first cigarette and \n     2,000 become regular daily smokers. This FDA legislation \n     offered our best chance to reverse that trend and reduce the \n     senseless death and disease that results from tobacco use.\n\n  Finally, a letter from Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids:\n       Dear Senator DeWine: We were profoundly disappointed by \n     yesterday's decision by the House/Senate conference on the \n     FSC legislation not to include provisions establishing FDA \n     regulation of tobacco products. An historic opportunity to \n     protect the Nation's children and the nation's health was \n     lost.\n       Enacting FDA regulation of tobacco products is the single \n     most important thing Congress could do to reduce cancer, \n     heart disease, emphysema, chronic bronchitis and a host of \n     other diseases. It is the single most important thing \n     Congress could do to improve the health of our children and \n     protect our children from unscrupulous marketing by an \n     industry that produces a product that kills one out of two \n     long-term users. Close to 90 percent of all tobacco users \n     start as children. First and foremost, it is our children who \n     were ignored and who are the big losers by the decision not \n     to include FDA in the FSC/ETI legislation.\n       The tragedy is not only that an opportunity to prevent \n     disease has slipped through our fingers, but also that \n     literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of kids, one \n     addicted, eventually will die of these tobacco-related \n     diseases. And these deaths will be needless. They will occur \n     because of the actions of the House/Senate Conferees who \n     failed to include FDA in the original Conference draft and \n     who voted not to add it to the final bill. Tobacco use is \n     also a leading cause of premature birth. If congress had \n     given FDA authority over tobacco products, Congress could \n     have dramatically reduced the number of children born \n     prematurely with serious medical programs due to tobacco use.\n       Rarely does Congress have the opportunity to take an action \n     that will improve the lives and well being of millions of \n     Americans. This was such an opportunity. Tobacco companies \n     market candy flavored cigarettes, promote their products in a \n     myriad of ways that make them more appealing to children, \n     hide the truth about the dangers of their products and fail \n     to take even the most minimal steps to reduce the number of \n     Americans who die from tobacco use. By the decision not to \n     include the FDA provisions adopted overwhelmingly by the \n     Senate in this bill, Congress is doing nothing to stop them.\n       Yesterday's vote by the FSA conference committee against \n     FDA authority over tobacco is a big victory for the tobacco \n     industry that will carry a heavy price in lives lost and kids \n     addicted to tobacco. The Nation will also pay a price in \n     growing cynicism about government when Congress appears \n     willing to trade tax breaks for kid's lives. We urge all \n     Senators and Members of Congress to oppose the FSC Conference \n     Report until the FDA provisions are included.\n\n  In conclusion, I think if you gave the average American a list, maybe \nif you give them a quiz and you said here is a list of macaroni and \ncheese, peanut butter, granola bars, milk, cheese, cigarettes, bottled \nwater, and asked them to check which one of these products the \nGovernment does not regulate, check which one of these products the \nmaker of the product doesn't have to list the ingredients, which one of \nthese products was not tested, which one of these products the maker of \nthe product can put a claim on and not have to substantiate, which one \nwill the average American pick?\n  You would think they would pick the one product that by design or if \nit is used as intended, admittedly we all know is dangerous to your \nhealth.\n  I don't think so. It defies common sense. No one in their right mind \nwould pick that product. No one in their right mind, if we were \nstarting all over again, would say, That is the product we are not \ngoing to regulate; we are not going to list the ingredients on that \nproduct; that is the worst product we are going to allow the \nmanufacturer to make any claim they want--lighter, better, safer, \nwhatever they want to say. Yet that is the status of the law today.\n  By approving this conference report and by saying, yes, we are going \nto move forward with it--that will be the vote tomorrow--we are \nacquiescing in that. We are saying it is OK to give up the opportunity \nwe had, the best shot we have had in years to change the status quo and \nto say we are not going to tolerate this anymore; we are not going to \nput up with this anymore. The time is here to change that. It defies \ncommon sense.\n  There are historic votes in this Chamber. This is a historic vote. \nThis is a historic time. This was a historic opportunity to make a \ndifference and to change things.\n  I often think, as a public official and as an American, we do not \nwant to be on the wrong side of history. We all have our own list of \nthings that if we were here or if we were involved in this debate 10 \nyears, 20 years ago, 50 years ago, 100 years ago we would not have \nwanted to be on a particular side. I don't want to be overly dramatic, \nbut Members do not want to be on the wrong side of this debate. We may \nlose this time, but there will be a day when the American people rise \nup and say they have had enough, and this Congress hears it and this \nCongress takes votes to finally regulate this product, as we do every \nother product, and finally say we have had enough. We are going to make \nthe tobacco companies list what is in the product, list the \ningredients, come clean with the American people and say, This is what \nis in it, and hold them to the same standard we hold for a company that \nmakes peanut butter of macaroni and cheese, a granola bar, a bottle of \nwater or milk. They should not be above the law.\n  Someday that will happen. I say to my colleagues, that day will come. \nThat day may not be this session of Congress, but it will come. People \ndo want to be on the right side of history. We will regulate them. We \nwill bring them into the mainstream.\n  This is a very dangerous product. We are not going to go to \nprohibition. That has not worked in this country. It did not work with \nalcohol, and it will not work with cigarettes. That is not what this \ndebate is about. This debate is about common sense, about doing what is \nrational, about doing something that makes good common sense.\n  I conclude by urging my colleagues to vote no on this bill, to vote \nno on cloture, to send a message strongly and loudly that we have had \nenough, and it is time to bring tobacco into the mainstream of the law. \nNo longer should they be outside the law. A ``no'' vote tomorrow is a \nvote for safety and the health of our kids. It is a vote or the safety \nand the health of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the hour is late in the afternoon on a \nSaturday, and I know there are many different matters of interest, \nprimarily sports taking place across this country at the universities \nand high schools across our Nation. Young people are out there, parents \nare out there, families are out there, but I hope there are some who \nhad the good opportunity to listen to my friend and colleague from Ohio \nState who spoke so clearly and eloquently as to what the real challenge \nis for this institution, the Senate, in protecting the children of this \nNation.\n\n[[Page S10938]]\n\n  The Senator laid out the kind of persuasive and irrefutable case that \nhelped gain 78 Members of the Senate who supported the DeWine-Kennedy \nproposal earlier this last month, but the amendment was dropped, as the \nSenator from Ohio pointed out, in the course of the consideration of \nthe underlying legislation.\n  There are public leaders who are talking about children all over this \ncountry. They talk about children being our future. They are our \nfuture. As the Senator from Ohio points out, we have missed the golden \nopportunity to make an extraordinary difference in the lives of their \nchildren and families.\n  We hear a great deal, as we should, about family values. This \nlegislation is as much a part of family values as we could have, to the \nextent that legislation is bound in family values. We know that \nbasically family values start with parents, work through their \nchildren's relationship with each other and their parents, and their \nown common sense about their responsibilities as young people for \nthemselves and for their families and for others. Family values \ninvolves caring about what happens not only to our children and our \nimmediate families but also to children whose lives we can impact.\n  This legislation which was supported by the overwhelming majority of \nthis Senate, could make such an extraordinary difference to children \ntoday, tomorrow, and to the future. As has been pointed out, we have \nmissed that extraordinary opportunity.\n  For that reason and for other reasons which I will outline briefly in \na few moments, I intend to vote no on the conference report and no on \ncloture.\n  This country has had a very full education about the dangers of \nsmoking. I can remember the 1964 Surgeon General's report that talked \nabout the dangers of smoking and youth. That was a wake-up call to \nparents all across this country. Then we had Surgeon General Koop, who \nwas an extraordinary Surgeon General.\n  Last night the President of the United States was asked about any \nmistakes he might have made in public life, and we did not hear any. I \nfreely admit one of the important mistakes I made was voting against \nEverett Koop to be Surgeon General because we saw through his life and \nthrough his commitment not only as the Surgeon General but afterwards, \nas well, that once he made that judgment that cigarettes were addictive \nand cancerous, he spent a great part of his life educating families all \nacross this country. This Nation owes a great deal to his work and his \ncommitment and his education to families.\n  That was a wake-up call for America. We went on through the period of \nthe 1980s when we had Dr. Kessler, head of the FDA, who drafted the \nregulations which were circumvented by the tobacco industry, and put \naside those regulations that were the result of hours and hours and \nhours and hours and weeks and weeks and weeks, and days and days and \ndays and months and months and months of careful, scientific testimony, \nthose for and against it.\n  Nonetheless, he came through with outstanding recommendations. We \nincorporated those recommendations as a point of reference to put them \ninto effect because they have been tried and tested and they should \nhave been put into effect to provide the protections for the young \nchildren of this country.\n  Then we had--I can remember, and I bet most families can remember--\nthat extraordinary day when we had the presidents of all the important \ntobacco companies who testified in front of my friend and an \nextraordinary Congressman, Henry Waxman, who all raised their hands and \nswore--swore--to the Lord on high that they, as the chief executives of \nthe tobacco companies, did not believe cigarettes were addictive and \ndid not believe they were dangerous to your health, in complete \nconflict with all the evidentiary science at that time.\n  Well, we heard so many of them recant that testimony later. It has \nall been part of a parade, a parade of distortion and misrepresentation \nby the tobacco companies and their representatives to not the older \nmembers of our society but to the children in our society in order to \nbring them in and start them smoking and get them on the path to \naddiction.\n  I have been fortunate to be the chairman of the Health Committee in \nthe Senate. I am ranking member now. How many days, how many weeks, how \nmany months of hearings we have had about the problems young people \nhave with their addiction, their attachment to dangerous drugs. \nCigarettes are right up there. As the science would say, they are as \naddictive as heroin and cocaine. That is the science. That is not just \nan opinion of the Senator from Massachusetts, that is the science. It \nis as addictive as cocaine and heroin, yet we allow that to take place.\n  Then we had the comprehensive legislation in 1998 to try to deal with \na range of different tobacco issues. The basic core part of the DeWine-\nKennedy legislation on FDA was here before the Senate essentially at \nthat time for 6 weeks and no one contested its importance. Go back and \nread the record. No one really questioned that if we were going to have \na comprehensive tobacco bill at that time that particular provision \ndeserved at least support. There were no amendments on that, none. All \nthese voices now: Oh, well, we can't have the FDA, absolutely not. We \ndon't need more regulation--we did not have a single amendment on that, \nnone; no amendments.\n  I had the good opportunity to effectively reintroduce that \nlegislation with the majority leader, Senator Frist, who did so much in \nthe drafting of the original legislation, one of the important leaders \nin this body on health care policy. This provision is basically very \nmainstream, if that gives assurance to some people. It is a very \nmainstream proposal, but it does the job in terms of protection.\n  So we had this proposal that was considered in the Senate, and was \naccepted, that would make such an extraordinary difference. As I was \nmentioning, the very simple fact is, this product, which is so \naddictive, so dangerous to the children of this country, not only to \nthe children themselves but also to their families, is something that \nwe should have addressed.\n  But this administration and, quite frankly, the leadership on that \nWays and Means Committee, our Republican leadership, said: Absolutely \nnot. We are not going to tolerate it. We are not going to accept it. We \nwill not let it happen. And it did not.\n  I pay respect to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle because \nthe progress that we made has not been just a partisan effort. The good \nSenator from Ohio has been a leader. There have been many. The Senator \nfrom Oregon, Mr. Smith; the Senator from Maine, Olympia Snowe; John \nMcCain from Arizona; Orrin Hatch from Utah; Senator Chafee from Rhode \nIsland; and many others have been willing to stand on this issue. This \nhas not been a Republican or Democratic issue. But this administration \nhas made a different judgment than those good Republicans who supported \nthis effort in here and also a number of them supported us in the \nconference.\n\n  There has to be responsibility. There should be some accountability \naround here somewhere. We are elected as officials. We make judgments, \nwe make choices, and we ought be held accountable for them. That was a \ndecision that was made by the administration not to include it. If this \nadministration said to include it, it would be in that bill tomorrow \nwhen we vote on it on the floor of the Senate. We had the support of \nsome of the tobacco industries, with the Philip Morris industry.\n  Tomorrow, when the Senate addresses the underlying legislation, we \nare also going to voice vote and send back to the House of \nRepresentatives the DeWine-Kennedy FDA legislation. The Senate will \npass that. We will send it back to the House. We have not given up \nhope.\n  Senator DeWine and I have not given up hope that perhaps in some \nlameduck Congress, perhaps when the glare of the campaign in the last 4 \nweeks of the campaign--I would have thought it would have been a pretty \ngood issue because people, parents, care about this, to indicate \nsupport for it. But, in any event, perhaps after the glare of the \ncampaign is over, in a postcampaign time, when we meet, perhaps we can \nget a different reaction. So we take some hope and we want to give the \nassurance to those who have given us strong support that we are not \ngiving up and we are not giving in.\n  Mr. President, I have a few letters that I will mention, and then \nthere are\n\n[[Page S10939]]\n\na few final items I want to talk about. We have a detailed presentation \non exactly what this legislation does. I want to make sure that is in \nthis part of the Record. I ask unanimous consent that be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I started smoking when I was 12 years old. My mother \n     smoked, and my friends told me it would make me ``cool.'' \n     Since my mother was always at the hospital with my father, \n     helping him while he was losing his battle against cancer, \n     there was no one around to notice that I had begun smoking. \n     That was in 1973. I smoked until Jan. 1, 1990, when I was 28 \n     years old, and I have been smoke-free for almost 14 years. \n     Quitting was probably the hardest thing I have ever done, but \n     it was definitely the smartest. My mother smoked until she \n     got diagnosed with lung cancer in 1994, which is also the \n     year her only grandchild was born. They removed part of her \n     lung, and since she believed she had ``beat'' the cancer, she \n     began smoking again. Five years and five CT scans later, they \n     found another tumor in her lung, this time inoperable and \n     supposedly untreatable. The doctors gave her six to ten \n     months to live. Knowing how short her time was, 1999 turned \n     out to be an extremely painful year for all of us. Over the \n     next four years, my mother suffered terribly, often unable to \n     eat and using a stomach tube, constantly taking medication \n     and losing lucidity, often too tired and too weak to be with \n     her little granddaughter, whom she completely adored. We \n     watched her waste away to 80 pounds, the cancer having \n     invaded her bones, causing her to fall, taking away her \n     independence, which she always valued highly. She died on \n     April 21, 2003, the day after Easter, at only 67 years old. \n     She was my best friend, and my daughter's, too. I miss our \n     daily phone calls, and I will miss her warm, inviting \n     presence this holiday season, as I do every single day. My 9 \n     year-old daughter has seen what horror cigarettes can cause; \n     I doubt that she will ever forget that cigarettes took her \n     ``Nonni'' away from her, but she is coming to the age where \n     social pressures will be on her to conform to the ``crowd.'' \n     I hope that she will be strong, and that there will be enough \n     education in her school to help her to learn how to deal with \n     people who try to coerce her into using this drug, among \n     others. Thank you for allowing me to share my story.--\n     Lorraine T., Ipswich MA, November 10, 2003.\n                                  ____\n\n       My father never liked to dance much. Yet, as we stood \n     hugging, watching my best friend dance with her father at her \n     wedding, Dad promised to dance with me at my wedding.\n       At age 39, he had a stroke that left him paralyzed on his \n     left side. He was able to regain most of the use of his limbs \n     through years of hard work. Unfortunately, he wasn't able to \n     quit his addiction to cigarettes.\n       One month before his 50th birthday, he died from a tobacco \n     related heart attack. He didn't live to fulfill his promise \n     to dance with me at my wedding.--Donna M., Melrose MA, \n     January 12, 2004.\n                                  ____\n\n       Today is like every other day I miss my mom so much, I look \n     at my kids and realize ``nanny'' is not here to see how cute \n     they have become. I am a only child and lost my mom 3 years \n     ago to lung cancer. I can remember the moment the doctor told \n     me she was going to die, and in the same breath she said ``I \n     truly believe what the tobacco companies are getting away \n     with is criminal.'' I have from that day on not been able to \n     understand why they are allowed to sell something that has \n     killed so many, and is going to kill so many more. It is \n     heartbreaking to see a young teen smoking, Sometimes I say \n     something, yes they think I'm crazy. However there life to me \n     is so precious. No I may not know them, but I wish they would \n     listen. If they saw their mom or dad gasping for breath, if \n     they saw their moms pelvic bones vividly sticking out would \n     this change their minds and make them want to quit? I hope \n     so, I don't want any more families to feel this pain and \n     utter loneliness that I have had to endure. My children are \n     the ones who get me through the bad days. They warm my heart \n     taking away the sadness. I have taught them early on how bad \n     and deadly tobacco is, and they also know that's why \n     ``nanny'' is no longer here, and how much she loved them! \n     Thank you.--Linda F., Middleboro MA, September 23, 2003.\n                                  ____\n\n       In November 2002 we learned that my mother, Gloria, had \n     stage four lung cancer. What started as pain in her hip and \n     was explained away as arthritis pain was actually bone \n     cancer--yes, it had already spread from her lungs before she \n     knew she even had it. Mom had quit smoking what seems like a \n     very long time ago . . . yet, it came back to haunt us.\n       She fought a fight I never knew she had in her. An \n     agonizing fight that I hope her story will prevent someone--\n     or many someones--from ever having to fight. She lost all of \n     the weight she had struggled to lose most of her adult life. \n     She lost her hair. She lost her appetite. She lost sleep. She \n     lost her freedom--unable to get around without pain, unable \n     to drive, often unable to be alone. There were so many things \n     that she lost . . . too many to mention.\n       But, what she did not lose was her faith. And it was her \n     faith that carried her through those long months.\n       Mom fought for a year. She fought to the end. She died last \n     October with one regret. That she would not live to see her \n     new Granddaughter.\n       Her Granddaughter was born 8 months and 23 days after Mom \n     passed away. She is now 4 weeks old (today!) and it is my \n     hope that she will never breathe someone's secondhand smoke. \n     That she will never have a friend who takes up smoking. And \n     that she will never have to watch someone she loves die from \n     such a horrible, preventable thing as lung cancer. I will \n     share Mom's picture with all of the children I know. I will \n     show them her smiling face. . . . even at the end when she \n     smiled because she knew that she was going to be going home \n     soon. And I will tell them of how much she loved children. \n     And how she never, never wants to hear that they have taken \n     up smoking. I will tell them that the reason she is so thin \n     in the picture is because she was sick. I will show them the \n     pictures when she had lost most of her hair. I will tell them \n     how much I miss her. And I will make them promise me--and \n     Mom--that they will never, never smoke or be around anyone \n     who is smoking. I LOVE YOU MOM!--Sarah Z., South Easton MA, \n     October 4, 2004.\n                                  ____\n\n       I have now been a smoker for over 8 years. I am only 24 \n     years old. I already have a severe smokers cough that only \n     gets worse with the cold weather. I live in New England. I \n     sometimes read the side of the packs with the Surgeon \n     Generals warnings. They say that smoking can cause babies to \n     be low birth weight. Well two years ago I had a daughter. I \n     did not smoke all the time when I was pregnant but I guess \n     you still could have called me a smoker. My daughter was 8 \n     pounds she was definitely not under-weight. Now don't get me \n     wrong I am not saying this to be proud. Every time I look at \n     her I wonder if I did any other damage to her. I am so \n     ashamed of myself. Yet right now I am dying for a smoke. This \n     is such an addiction I don't think that I will ever overcome \n     it, I want to and God knows how I have tried. I want to be \n     around when my daughter grows-up, to see her get married and \n     to see any future grandchildren I might have. If I keep up \n     this way I am not going to see any of it, it is so \n     depressing.\n       Well the only thing I can say is that if there were \n     stricter regulations when I was a minor I probably never \n     would have started smoking. I know that sounds cliche but you \n     can't miss something you never had . . . now I have had it \n     and I cannot go without it. I feel like a junkie even though \n     I am not. I will be scorned by the non-smoking community. I \n     will be the pariah for the smokers. I only wish that I could \n     quit.\n       I hope someone will not smoke once reading this . . . but \n     then again I am only one person . . . barely able to make a \n     difference. Maybe just once before it's too late. Just to \n     quit for my little daughters sake . . . she does need to know \n     . . . mommy cares what she thinks.--Tori H., South Boston MA, \n     November 12, 2003.\n\n  (Mr. WARNER assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Over the next four years, my mother suffered \n     terribly, often unable to eat and using a stomach tube, \n     constantly taking medication and losing lucidity, often too \n     tired and too weak to be with her little granddaughter, whom \n     she completely adored. We watched her waste away to 80 \n     pounds, the cancer having invaded her bones, causing her to \n     fall, taking away her independence, which she always valued \n     highly. She died April 21, 2003, the day after Easter, at \n     only 67 years old. She was my best friend, and my daughter's, \n     too. . . .\n       My 9 year-old daughter has seen what horror cigarettes can \n     cause; I doubt that she will ever forget that cigarettes took \n     her ``Nonni'' away from her, but she is coming to the age \n     where social pressures will be on her to conform to the \n     ``crowd.'' I hope she will be strong, and that there will be \n     enough education in her school to help her to learn how to \n     deal with people who try to coerce her into using this drug, \n     among others. . . . Lorraine T., Ipswich MA.\n\n  Here is another letter from Donna M., from Melrose, MA, of this year:\n\n       My father never liked to dance much. Yet, as we stood \n     hugging, watching my best friend dance with her father at a \n     wedding, Dad promised to dance with me at my wedding.\n       At age 39, he had a stroke that left him paralyzed on his \n     left side. He was unable to regain most of the use of his \n     limbs through years of hard work. Unfortunately, he wasn't \n     able to quit his addiction to cigarettes.\n       One month before his 50th birthday, my Dad died from a \n     tobacco related heart attack. He didn't live to fulfill his \n     promise to dance with me at my wedding.\n\n  Here is a letter from Linda F., of Middleboro, MA:\n\n       Today is like every other day. I miss my mom so much. I \n     look at my kids and realize ``nanny'' is not here to see how \n     cute they\n\n[[Page S10940]]\n\n     have become. I am an only child and lost my mom 3 years ago \n     to lung cancer. I can remember the moment the doctor told me \n     she was going to die, and in the same breath she said ``I \n     truly believe what the tobacco companies are getting away \n     with is criminal.'' I have from that day on not been able to \n     understand why they are allowed to sell something that has \n     killed so many, and is going to kill so many more.\n\n  Then the letter continues.\n  This is from Sarah Z. from South Easton, MA, October 4, 2004:\n\n       In November 2002 we learned that my mother, Gloria, had \n     stage four lung cancer. Mom fought for a year. She fought to \n     the end. She died last October with one regret. That she \n     would not live to see her new granddaughter. Her \n     granddaughter was born 8 months and 23 days after Mom passed \n     away. She is now 4 weeks old (today!) and it is my hope that \n     she will never breathe someone's secondhand smoke. That she \n     will never have a friend who takes up smoking. And that she \n     will never have to watch someone she loves die from such a \n     horrible, preventable thing as lung cancer.\n\n  And Tori H, South Boston:\n\n       I have now been a smoker for 8 years. I am only 24 years \n     old. I already have a severe smoker's cough. It only gets \n     worse with cold weather. I live in New England. I sometimes \n     read the side of the packs with the Surgeon General's \n     warnings. They say smoking can cause babies to be low birth \n     weight . . . I did not smoke all the time when I was pregnant \n     but I guess you could have called me a smoker . . . My \n     daughter was 8 pounds; she was definitely not under-weight. \n     Now don't get me wrong--I am not saying this to be proud. \n     Every time I look at her I wonder if I did any other damage \n     to her. I am so ashamed of myself. Yet right now I am dying \n     for a smoke. This is such an addiction. I don't think I will \n     ever overcome it. I want to and God knows how I have tried. I \n     want to be around when my daughter grows up, to see her get \n     married and to see any future grandchildren I might have. If \n     I keep up this way I am not going to see any of it; it is so \n     depressing.\n\n  The letters go on, and they make the case. If there are any who think \nthis is a partisan issue, look at what the Bush administration's \nDepartment of Justice filed in the final proposed findings of fact of \nthe United States in the tobacco litigation brought by the Federal \nGovernment against tobacco companies.\n  This is the current administration's finding, page 21: Cigarette \nsmoking, particularly that begun by young people, continues to be the \nleading cause of preventable disease and premature mortality in the \nUnited States. For children and adolescents, one out of three will die \nof smoking-related disease. As part of a scheme to defraud, defendants \nhave intentionally marketed cigarettes to youth under the legal smoking \nage and falsely denied that they have done so.\n  We could go on. I have their brief notes right here about what is \nhappening. These are the statistics in terms of the young people who \nget started smoking. It begins early. When adults who are daily smokers \nbegan smoking: 89 percent by the age of 18; 62 percent by the age of \n16; 37 percent by the age of 14; and 16 percent by the age of 12.\n  You can ask why. Well, just look at this chart. This is advertising \nin billions of dollars. These are billions of dollars of advertising \nand how this has gone up and has continued in 2003 and 2004. That is \ntargeted, as these various ads demonstrate: Winston, three young people \nout in the surf with a surfboard. The sun is setting. Additive free. \nNaturally smooth. Leave the bull behind, just pick up a Winston.\n  This is from Elle magazine, all targeted toward young people: Camel, \nTurkish blends. And there you see the advertisement, all focused on the \nyouth.\n\n  Here is Rolling Stone: Stir the senses, Salem. All to appeal to the \nyoung people.\n  And it has great success because, like any narcotic, you get them \nhooked at that age, and it is very difficult to stop.\n  My friend from Ohio mentioned the costs for the taxpayers as well. We \nare motivated because of our concern for the children and children's \nhealth and the family's health. But if that doesn't move you, just look \nat the annual cost in the United States: the Medicaid payments, $23 \nbillion; $20 billion in Medicare payments; other Federal payments, $8 \nbillion; smoking during pregnancy, $4 billion; total health cost, $75 \nbillion. And if you add lost productivity to that, you are talking over \n$150 billion a year in direct costs to the American taxpayer.\n  This makes sense, obviously, and is the most important for the \nchildren so they aren't going to be addicted and their health is going \nto be protected. It is for the other members of the families as well so \nthat those young people who are eventually going to be parents are \ngoing to be protected. But if that doesn't get you and the pocketbook \nissues don't get you, you can see that you are paying billions and \nbillions of dollars.\n  These are the conclusions about the activities of tobacco companies \neven by this Justice Department.\n  This is why this is so important and an opportunity missed.\n  Let me conclude on this subject by referring to the letters of \nsupport we received from some groups:\n\n     Dear Senator Kennedy, Congress has an historic opportunity to \n     embrace responsible legislation that will help to reduce \n     suffering and death caused by the tobacco. The House-Senate \n     conferees should include the DeWine-Kennedy language. On July \n     15, the U.S. Senate took an unprecedented step towards \n     granting the Food and Drug Administration effective \n     authority. The Senate passed the DeWine amendment. The \n     overwhelmingly bipartisan amendment linked the FDA with the \n     tobacco buyout. Our organizations view this approach as \n     critical to accomplishing our goal, securing FDA authority \n     over tobacco products. Tobacco use kills more than 400,000 \n     Americans each year. Across our Nation, more than $75 billion \n     in health costs and, according to the Centers for Disease \n     Control, tobacco use by pregnant women alone costs $400 \n     million to $500 million. And every day another 2,000 children \n     become regular smokers. A third will die prematurely as a \n     result. Now we have an opportunity to do something about it. \n     Yet tobacco products are virtually unregulated. For decades \n     the tobacco companies have marketed to our children, deceived \n     consumers about the harm their products caused, and failed to \n     take any meaningful steps to make their products less \n     harmful. The DeWine-Kennedy language would finally end the \n     special protection enjoyed by the tobacco industry to protect \n     our children and the Nation's health. This legislation meets \n     the standards long established by the public health community \n     for a strong FDA regulation bill that protects the public \n     health. It would give the FDA the necessary tools and \n     resources to effectively regulate the manufacture, marketing, \n     labeling, distribution and sale of tobacco products.\n\n  Then it continues:\n\n       The public health community worked in good faith to achieve \n     this much-needed bipartisan legislation that protects the \n     public health and can be enacted in this session. We remain \n     concerned that opponents of an effective FDA will seek to \n     weaken the provision prior to final passage. Our organization \n     will work. Please support.\n\n  Those include the American Academy of Family Physicians, American \nAcademy of Nurse Practitioners, American Academy of Pediatrics, \nAmerican College of Cardiology, American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists, American College of Physicians, American College of \nPreventive Medicine, American Heart Association, American Lung \nAssociation, the Medical Association, American Women's Medical \nAssociation, the Public Health Association, the School Health \nAssociation, the Children's Defense Fund, and the Campaign for Tobacco \nFree Kids.\n  I thank them in particular.\n  The FSC conference report that we are being asked to consider ignores \nfundamental issues that broad bipartisan majorities of the Senate have \nstrongly supported. On vital matters concerning the protection of \nchildren's health, preserving the overtime rights of workers, and \ndefending American jobs from outsourcing to foreign lands, the cynical \nactions of a few have blocked the will of the majority.\n  The House conferees were more interested in protecting big tobacco \ncompanies' profits than they were in protecting children. They would \nrather create tax incentives for multinational corporations to move \nmillions of American jobs overseas than save millions of our kids from \na lifetime of addiction and premature death.\n  We were not the ones who chose to link tobacco issues to this tax \nbill. That was a decision made by the House Republican leadership. But \nit is absolutely irresponsible to address a quota buyout for tobacco \nfarmers, as this conference report does, while ignoring the urgent need \nfor FDA authority to prevent cigarette companies from entrapping our \nkids. The conferees have left us no choice but to oppose passage of \nthis conference report.\n  The importance to our children of authorizing the FDA to regulate \ntobacco products cannot be overstated. Smoking is the number one \npreventable\n\n[[Page S10941]]\n\ncause of death in America. It kills well over 400,000 Americans each \nyear, and nearly all of them started smoking as children. They are \nseduced by the tobacco companies before they are mature enough to \nrecognize the enormous health risks of smoking, and become addicted \nwhile still teenagers.\n  We feel so strongly about this issue because FDA authority is the \nmost important legislation Congress can pass to protect our children \nfrom the number one preventable cause of death in America--smoking. We \ncannot in good conscience allow the Federal agency most responsible for \nprotecting the public health to remain powerless to deal with the \nenormous health risks of cigarettes.\n  The stakes are vast. Each day, 5,000 children try their first \ncigarette. Two thousand of them will become daily smokers, and nearly a \nthousand will die prematurely from tobacco-induced diseases. The fact \nis that more than 90 percent of adult smokers began smoking as \nteenagers.\n  Smoking can cause lifelong dreams to go up in smoke. Smoking can mean \nyour hopes for an active life--of hikes with your children, and bike \nriding and long walks--are beyond your reach. You simply don't have the \nlung capacity and the stamina to do what you wish you could do. It can \nmean that your hope of enjoying your grandchildren and appreciating \nyour retirement are gone, as you suffer from tobacco-induced disease \nand an early death. The most recent studies document the fact that \nsmokers, on average, die 10 years earlier than non-smokers. That is \nwhat can happen to your lifestyle when you start smoking as a teenager.\n  How many addicted smokers today are glad to be smoking? How many \nAmericans with smoking-induced lung cancer or emphysema are glad to be \nsmokers? How many addicted smokers can look their children and \ngrandchildren in the eyes and say they are proud to smoke cigarettes. \nHow many wish they could easily put out that last cigarette, and never \nlook back? I think we all know the answers to these questions. That is \nwhy this issue is so important.\n  The Senate amendment which passed with the support of 78 Members set \nforth a fair and balanced approach to FDA regulation. It created a new \nsection in FDA jurisdiction for the regulation of tobacco products, \nwith standards that allow for consideration of the unique issues raised \nby tobacco use. It was sensitive to the concerns of tobacco farmers, \nsmall businesses, and nicotine-dependent smokers. But, it clearly gave \nFDA the authority it needs in order to prevent youth smoking and to \nreduce addiction to this highly lethal product.\n  The Senate amendment also provided financial relief for hard-pressed \ntobacco farmers, much more generous relief than is contained in the \nconference report. It incorporated bipartisan legislation introduced by \nthirteen tobacco-state Senators led by Senator McConnell, to buy back \ntobacco quota from farmers. It would have provided $12 billion to \nfinancially vulnerable tobacco farmers and tobacco communities. The \nmoney to fund the buyout would come from an assessment on tobacco \ncompanies. This proposal was a legitimate buyout plan designed by \ntobacco-state members for the benefit of their tobacco farming \nconstituents. Instead, the House designed proposal in the conference \nreport forces tobacco farmers to settle for more than $2 billion less \nthan they would have received if the Senate proposal had been accepted. \nFor example, it will pay North Carolina farmers $800 million less than \nthe Senate amendment. It will pay Kentucky farmers $500 million less. \nThat is a very substantial difference. For small farmers who actually \ntend the land themselves, it is a 25 percent cut in what they will \nreceive. So in reality, the farmers are losers too. Only the tobacco \ncompanies who will pay billions less are winners.\n  The heart of the Senate amendment was the FDA provision--which would \nlead to fewer children starting to smoke, and to fewer adults suffering \nwith tobacco-induced disease and now that provision is gone. Public \nhealth groups told us it was the most important legislation we could \npass to deal with the nation's number one health hazard.\n\n  We must deal firmly with tobacco company marketing practices that \ntarget children and mislead the public. The Food and Drug \nAdministration needs broad authority to regulate the sale, \ndistribution, and advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. The \ntobacco industry currently spends over eleven billion dollars a year to \npromote its products. The amount has actually grown dramatically since \nthe Master Settlement Agreement was signed.\n  Much of that money is spent in ways designed to tempt children to \nstart smoking, before they are mature enough to appreciate the enormity \nof the health risk. The industry knows that 90 percent of smokers begin \nas children and are addicted by the time they reach adulthood.\n  Documents obtained from tobacco companies prove, in the companies' \nown words, the magnitude of the industry's efforts to trap children \ninto dependency on their deadly product. Recent studies by the \nInstitute of Medicine and the Centers for Disease Control show the \nsubstantial role of industry advertising in decisions by young people \nto use tobacco products.\n  If we are serious about reducing youth smoking, FDA must have the \npower to prevent industry advertising designed to appeal to children \nwherever it will be seen by children. The Senate-passed legislation \nwould give FDA the ability to stop tobacco advertising which glamorizes \nsmoking from appearing where it will be seen by significant numbers of \nchildren. It grants FDA full authority to regulate tobacco advertising \n``consistent with and to the full extent permitted by the First \nAmendment.''\n  FDA authority must also extend to the sale of tobacco products. \nNearly every State makes it illegal to sell cigarettes to children \nunder 18, but surveys show that those laws are rarely enforced and \nfrequently violated. FDA must have the power to limit the sale of \ncigarettes to face-to-face transactions in which the age of the \npurchaser can be verified by identification. This means an end to self-\nservice displays and vending machine sales, except in adult-only \nfacilities. There must also be serious enforcement efforts with real \npenalties for those caught selling tobacco products to children. This \nis the only way to ensure that children under 18 are not able to buy \ncigarettes.\n  The FDA conducted the longest rulemaking proceeding in its history, \nstudying which regulations would most effectively reduce the number of \nchildren who smoke. Seven hundred thousand public comments were \nreceived in the course of that rulemaking. At the conclusion of its \nproceeding, the Agency promulgated rules on the manner in which \ncigarettes are advertised and sold. Due to litigation, most of those \nregulations were never implemented. If we are serious about curbing \nyouth smoking as much as possible, as soon as possible; it makes no \nsense to require FDA to reinvent the wheel by conducting a new multi-\nyear rulemaking process on the same issues. The Senate legislation \nwould give the youth access and advertising restrictions already \ndeveloped by FDA the immediate force of law, as if they had been issued \nunder the new statute.\n  The legislation also provides for stronger warnings on all cigarette \nand smokeless tobacco packages, and in all print advertisements. These \nwarnings will be more explicit in their description of the medical \nproblems which can result from tobacco use. The FDA is given the \nauthority to change the text of these warning labels periodically, to \nkeep their impact strong.\n  Nicotine in cigarettes is highly addictive. Medical experts say that \nit is as addictive as heroin or cocaine. Yet for decades, tobacco \ncompanies have vehemently denied the addictiveness of their products. \nNo one can forget the parade of tobacco executives who testified under \noath before Congress that smoking cigarettes is not addictive. \nOverwhelming evidence in industry documents obtained through the \ndiscovery process proves that the companies not only knew of this \naddictiveness for decades, but actually relied on it as the basis for \ntheir marketing strategy. As we now know, cigarette manufacturers \nchemically manipulated the nicotine in their products to make it even \nmore addictive.\n  The tobacco industry has a long, dishonorable history of providing \nmisleading information about the health\n\n[[Page S10942]]\n\nconsequences of smoking. These companies have repeatedly sought to \ncharacterize their products as far less hazardous than they are. They \nmade minor innovations in product design seem far more significant for \nthe health of the user than they actually were. It is essential that \nFDA have clear and unambiguous authority to prevent such \nmisrepresentations in the future. The largest disinformation campaign \nin the history of the corporate world must end.\n  Given the addictiveness of tobacco products, it is essential that the \nFDA have the authority to effectively regulate them for the protection \nof the public health. Over 40 million Americans are currently addicted \nto cigarettes. No responsible public health official believes that \ncigarettes should be banned. A ban would leave forty million people \nwithout a way to satisfy their drug dependency. FDA should be able to \ntake the necessary steps to help addicted smokers overcome their \naddiction, and to make the product less toxic for smokers who are \nunable or unwilling to stop. To do so, FDA must have the authority to \nreduce or remove hazardous ingredients from cigarettes, to the extent \nthat it becomes scientifically feasible. The inherent risk in smoking \nshould not be unnecessarily compounded.\n\n  Recent statements by several tobacco companies make clear that they \nplan to develop what they characterize as ``reduced risk'' cigarettes. \nThe Senate legislation would require manufacturers to submit such \n``reduced risk'' products to the FDA for analysis before they can be \nmarketed. No health-related claims would be permitted until they have \nbeen verified to the FDA's satisfaction. These safeguards are essential \nto prevent deceptive industry marketing campaigns, which could lull the \npublic into a false sense of health safety.\n  Tobacco use kills more Americans every year than AIDS, alcohol, car \naccidents, murders, suicides and fires combined. Nearly 90 percent of \nlung cancer cases, nearly 1 in 3 cancer deaths, and 1 in 5 deaths from \nheart disease are tobacco-related. Tobacco use results in $75 billion \nin annual health care costs and $157 billion in total cost. \nUnfortunately, smoking will remain the number one preventable cause of \ndeath in America until Congress is willing to do what it takes to bring \nthis health crisis under control. Congress must vest FDA not only with \nthe responsibility for regulating tobacco products, but with full \nauthority to do the job effectively.\n  The Senate legislation would give the FDA the legal authority it \nneeds--to reduce youth smoking by preventing tobacco advertising which \ntargets children--to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors--to \nhelp smokers overcome their addiction--to make tobacco products less \ntoxic for those who continue to use them--and to prevent the tobacco \nindustry from misleading the public about the dangers of smoking.\n  If the conference report is approved in its current form, we will \nhave lost a golden opportunity to address this critical health issue. \nCongress will have put the well-being of our children last, behind a \nlong parade of special interests clamoring for their tax breaks. It is \nnot enough to just pay lip service to what is right for our children. \nYou have got to be willing to fight for their health and their future. \nYou have to make it a top priority.\n  While we are extremely disappointed that FDA authority over tobacco \nproducts is not in the conference report, this legislation will, I am \nconfident, become law in the not too distant future. It is clearly an \nidea whose time has come. It passed the Senate on a strong bipartisan \nvote last summer. I am very pleased that the Senate has agreed to pass \na freestanding FDA bill this weekend and send it to the House as a \nreaffirmation of our support. It is a powerful statement of this body's \ncommitment to protecting the health of our children, and seeing this \nlegislation through to enactment. The battle goes on, and we will \nprevail.\n  They have been spectacular spokespersons for children and children's \nhealth and we are indebted to that organization.\n  The list goes on. There are 68 March of Dimes organizations. Every \norganization in public health is behind this proposal.\n  Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Ohio. I join him in \nletting families know we are not going to let up, give up, or give in. \nThis was a very reasonable measure, a reasonable response. As he has \npointed out, it is the most important public health legislation this \nCongress, or any recent Congress up to the Congress of 7 years ago, \nwhen we passed the CHIP program, with the difference this would make in \nterms of children and children's health. We missed this opportunity. We \nare not giving up and we are not giving in. We want to let those who \nare opposed to us know we are coming at them and we are going to keep \nafter this until we get the job done.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, another provision was included in the \nbill that passed the Senate and was dropped by the conference as well. \nWe had the dropping of the FDA provisions--which I believe in and of \nitself is enough to oppose this legislation--but we also know there was \nanother provision that related to how we were going to treat American \nworkers that was dropped.\n  Since this legislation initially was drafted, in order to respond to \nthe World Trade Organization which found some tax provisions worked in \nsuch a way as to violate various international agreements, it was about \na $5 billion fix that was needed. Instead, we have a $140 billion \nsolution for a $5 billion fix. Do you hear me? The rest of those are \ntax goodies for special interests. So since this was allegedly a jobs \nbill, we thought we would add an amendment to it. The principal sponsor \nwas my friend and colleague Senator Harkin, who provided such \nextraordinary leadership on this overtime issue. We added this \nprovision that would effectively declare the proposal of the \nadministration that dealt with denying workers overtime who worked more \nthan 40 hours a week, that we would effectively vitiate the \nadministration's proposal. Since the underlying legislation dealt with \nworkers and the impact on manufacturing and jobs, this was a related \nmatter.\n  It is useful to remind ourselves how often this institution has \naddressed the question of the proposal by this President in terms of \novertime. We have voted three times in the Senate to reject the \nadministration's proposal to deny overtime. We rejected it on September \n10, 54-45; it was a bipartisan effort. On May 4, 52-47. Also on May 4, \n99-0. So we acted on that and we added to it.\n  You can say, well, the House of Representatives has not faced this \nissue. Our answer to that is the House has faced this issue. They voted \nOctober 2, 2003, 221-203, effectively to vitiate the Bush overtime \nproposal. They voted September 9, 223-193. So that is two times in the \nHouse and three times in the Senate. We had it in the conference and, \nnonetheless, this administration said no.\n\n  The administration has said no to an increase in the minimum wage for \n7 million Americans who are working at minimum wage. They said no to an \nextension of unemployment compensation for workers who paid into the \nunemployment compensation fund. And they have said no to eliminating \nthe ban on the elimination of overtime.\n  I watched the debate, like many other Americans, last night, and I \nlistened to one of the questions that my friend and colleague, the next \nPresident of the United States, answered in talking about the lost \nnumber of jobs. He indicated that under this administration they had \nlost 1.6 million jobs. Lo and behold, today, with all the fact-checkers \nall over the country, they said that is not right; John Kerry should \nhave said they only lost 800,000 jobs. Do you want to know why? The \nother 800,000 have been added in the public sector. I thought this \nadministration was adding jobs in the private sector. They have failed \nin the private sector. They are trying to sharpshoot on that issue, and \nit doesn't go.\n  Let's look at where we are now in the last month with the \nadministration's economy. They had announcements yesterday that 96,000 \njobs had been created last month. It is interesting to note that a \nthird of those jobs are temporary. What does that mean? Temporary jobs \npay 40 percent, on average, less than regular jobs. Yes. What else? \nTemporary jobs don't give you benefits. Very few, if any, give you \nhealth insurance, let alone pensions. We have\n\n[[Page S10943]]\n\na third temporary jobs, and a third government jobs, and a third \nprivate jobs out of the 96,000. So it is not a good time in terms of \nthe American economy.\n  I want to point this out again and come back to the issue of \novertime. As I mentioned, we had passed those provisions in the House \nand in the Senate. Now the administration continues to want to \nimplement them. Who are the people affected most by overtime? The \npeople who are affected the most by overtime are interesting: Nurses \nare affected by overtime; nursery school teachers, the ones who are \ngoing to work with the children in nursery schools and programs in the \nHead Start Programs; clerical workers; computer programers, et cetera. \nThese are the ones. Nurses, of course, are first responders.\n  It is almost as though this administration doesn't understand how \nhard American families are working in the United States of America. \nThis is an extraordinary chart. This chart demonstrates that Americans' \nwork hours have increased more than in any other industrialized country \nfrom 1970 to 2002. It is effectively up 20 percent. The next nearest \ncountry is Canada, up 16, and Australia is up 3.2 percent.\n  Americans are working harder and harder, and they are having an \nenormous difficulty in keeping pace. They cannot even keep economic \npace, in terms of what they have to buy. One of the few benefits, of \ncourse, is the question of overtime. What happens when you eliminate \novertime? Let's remind the workers who are out there who may be \nwatching; let's remind them of something they know all too well. If you \nhave overtime protections, your chances of working more than 40 hours a \nweek are only 19 percent. But if you don't have overtime protections, \nyour chances of working more than 40 hours a week are 44 percent. That \nis for 40 hours a week. If it is 50 hours a week, your chances of \nworking are three times more if you don't have the overtime protections \nthan if you do.\n  Make no mistake on what this is about. This is about exploiting \nAmerican workers, treating them on the cheap. That is what this is \nabout.\n  Well, Senator Kennedy, how can you say that? Let me give a couple of \nexamples why we can say it.\n  When the Bush rule was in the making, the Department of Labor asked \nfor comment on the proposed regulation. In looking through the records, \nthis is what we find out: Here is when the rule to eliminate overtime \nwas being considered. The administration solicited the views of a \nnumber of different groups and industries. Now we have the National \nAssociation of Mutual Insurance Companies supports the section:\n\n       . . . of the proposed regulations that provides that claims \n     adjustors, including those working for insurance companies, \n     satisfy the FLSAs administrative exemption. . . .\n\n  That is from the National Association of Mutual Insurance, June 25, \n2003.\n  On April 23, 2004:\n\n       Insurance claims adjustors generally meet the duties \n     requirements for the administrative exemption, whether they \n     work for an insurance company or the other type of company. . \n     . .\n\n  There is the industry's interest. There is the administration's \nanswer.\n  Here is another group that got exemption. Here is the overtime for \nfuneral directors and embalmers:\n\n       [T]he National Funeral Directors' Association believes that \n     funeral directors and embalmers who have successfully \n     completed a course of study . . . licensed by the state in \n     which they practice are professional employees.\n\n  Then we have:\n\n       Licensed funeral directors and embalmers . . .\n\n  It is almost the same direct language for industry after industry, \nright down the line. This was not an issue for simplification. This was \nlooking out for special interests. And who is paying the piper? It is \ngoing to be the workers, working longer and harder for less.\n  As a result, this is what happens in this country:\n  In the last 3 years, we have seen 800,000 more children who are \nliving in poverty. The total percent of those living in poverty in the \nUnited States has grown, but the number of children is 800,000 more \nliving in poverty; 12 million children hungry or on the verge of \nhunger; 8 million Americans unemployed. Nearly 3 million have lost \nunemployment benefits since the Republicans ended the program. Seven \nmillion low-wage workers waiting 7 years for a minimum-wage increase. \nThese are men and women of dignity. They work hard, play by the rules. \nThey are primarily women. The income of low-income single mothers has \ngone down by three percent every year in the Bush economy.\n  There are 7 million who have been waiting for an increase in the \nminimum wage. Bush 1 supported an increase in the minimum wage. This \ndid not use to be a partisan issue. It was so interesting in the course \nof this session, when I offered the increase in the minimum wage, when \nwe had what they call the welfare reform proposal, the TANF proposal. \nWhat did the Republican leadership do? They pulled the bill so we could \nnot even get a vote on it. Imagine that. They would not even let the \nSenate of the United States vote on it. I offered it again on the State \nDepartment reauthorization bill because the Republican leadership would \nnot give us an opportunity to vote on the minimum wage. What did they \ndo? They pulled that bill, too. They do not even let us get a vote in \nthe Senate on the issue of increasing the minimum wage.\n  Sixty percent of those who receive the minimum wage are women. One-\nthird of those have children. This is a civil rights issue, a \nchildren's issue, a fairness issue. Americans understand if someone is \ngoing to work 52 weeks of the year, 40 hours a week, they should not \nhave to live in poverty. But do my colleagues think we have an \nopportunity to do something about it? No.\n  Still, we are taking away the--we have 4.3 million more Americans in \npoverty than when the President took office and we have 2.6 million \nfewer Americans who have a pension under Bush's watch.\n\n  On the issue of overtime, I will take a moment of the Senate's time \nto relate the concerns of one worker who will be affected by the new \nregulation. He says:\n\n       My name is Randy Flemming. I live in Haysville, KS--outside \n     Wichita--and I work as an Engineering Technician in Boeing's \n     Metrology Lab.\n       I'm also proud to say that I'm a military veteran. I served \n     in the U.S. Air Force from August 1973 until February 1979.\n       I've worked for Boeing for 23 years. During that time, I've \n     been able to build a good, solid life for my family and I've \n     raised a son who now has a good career and children of his \n     own. There are two things that helped make that possible.\n       First, the training I received in the Air Force made me \n     qualified for a good civilian job. That was one of the main \n     attractions when I enlisted as a young man back in Iowa. I \n     think it's still one of the main reasons young people today \n     decide to enlist. Military training opens up better job \n     opportunities--and if you don't believe me, just look at the \n     recruiting ads on TV.\n       The second thing is overtime pay. That's how I was able to \n     give my son the college education that has opened doors for \n     him. Some years, when the company was busy and I had those \n     college bills to pay, overtime pay was probably 10 percent or \n     more of my income. My daughter is next. Danielle is only 8, \n     but we'll be counting on my overtime to help get her a \n     college degree, too, when that time comes. For my family \n     overtime pay has made all the difference.\n       That's where I'm coming from. Why did I come to Washington? \n     I came to talk about an issue that is very important back \n     home and to me personally as a working man, a family man and \n     a veteran. The issue is overtime rights.\n       The changes that this administration is trying to make in \n     the overtime regulations would break the government's bargain \n     with the men and women in the military and would close down \n     opportunities that working vets and their families thought \n     that they could count on.\n       When I signed up back in 1973, the Air Force and I made a \n     deal that I thought was fair. They got a good chunk of my \n     time and I got training to help me build the rest of my life. \n     There was no part of that deal that said I would have to give \n     up my right to overtime pay.\n\n  This was the threat that was going to be under the initial \nregulations and rules by the Department of Labor that said the training \nin the military would count as professional training for the first time \nin the history, if you got the training in the military. Then they \npulled those regulations back and they changed the language around. \nInterestingly, all they had to do was just say, for veterans it did not \ncount. But the Department of Labor would not do that, and many of the \nveterans groups still feel that they are threatened by the existing \nrules and regulations.\n  And then he continues:\n\n\n[[Page S10944]]\n\n\n       You've heard of the marriage penalty? Well, I think that \n     what these new rules do is create a military penalty. If you \n     got your training in the military, no matter what your white \n     collar profession is, your employer can make you work as many \n     hours as they want and not pay you a dime extra. If that's \n     not bait and switch, I don't know what it is. . . .\n       I'm luckier than some other veterans because I have a union \n     contract that will protect my rights for a while anyway. But \n     we know the pressure will be on, because my employer is one \n     that pushed for these new rules and they've been trying hard \n     to get rid of our union.\n       And for all those who want to let these military penalty \n     rules go through, I have a deal I'd like to propose. If you \n     think it's okay for the government to renege on its deal, I \nthink it should be your job to tell our military men and women in Iraq \nthat when they come home, their service to their country will be used \nas a way to cut their overtime pay.\n\n  I am still very concerned about those provisions. The administration \nsays it has addressed it. It did not address it the way the veterans \nwant.\n  We should not be about cutting off overtime when we are having the \neconomic challenges we are facing in this country today. It is the \nwrong economic policy. It is unfair and it was wrong for the \nadministration to cut this out.\n  There is one final point I want to make on the proposal we have \nbefore us.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 16\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there is one other provision of this \nunderlying conference report I want to address. A top worry of many \nAmericans is that their jobs may be shipped overseas. We have heard for \nyears about manufacturing jobs being sent to other countries. Today, \nmillions of Americans with other types of jobs face that risk, too. \nEvery day we hear new stories about jobs in health care, financial \nservices, information technologies going overseas in this high-tech \nage.\n  Yet, the Bush administration says shipping jobs overseas is a good \nthing. It was in the President's own annual economic report:\n\n       When a good or service is produced more cheaply abroad, it \n     makes more sense to import it than to make it or provide it \n     domestically.\n\n  The President's chief economic adviser Gregory Mankiw has even said \nthat shipping jobs to other countries is ``probably a plus for the \neconomy in the long run.''\n  Treasury Secretary Snow has also defended corporations sending jobs \noverseas, saying they need to do what they need to do. He said anything \nthat makes a company more competitive, including offshoring jobs, is \ngood for corporate shareholders, it is good for their consumers, and it \nis good for their employees.\n  As recently as July, John Marburger, the President's science adviser, \nsaid that shipping jobs overseas is not necessarily a bad thing. \nAmerican workers deserve better than this. They deserve better than to \nhave their jobs exported with the President as the cheerleader in chief \nwaving goodbye.\n  Shipping jobs overseas is a problem that is only going to grow. \nExperts project 3.4 million jobs, with total wages worth more than $150 \nbillion, could be sent overseas in the next 11 years, including more \nthan a half-million computer jobs and more than 600,000 business and \nmanagement jobs. Lou Dobbs on CNN is keeping a running tally of \ncompanies that have sent jobs overseas. He is now at almost a thousand \ncompanies.\n  Many jobs that have already gone overseas have been in manufacturing. \nThis is a loss that has taken a heavy toll on our economy. We have lost \nnearly 2.7 million manufacturing jobs since this Bush administration \ntook office. It is a nationwide problem affecting almost every State in \nthe Union. Forty-seven of the 50 States have lost manufacturing jobs \nunder this President. For example, Ohio has lost 165,000 manufacturing \njobs; Pennsylvania has lost 150,000 jobs; Massachusetts, my home State, \nhas lost 84,000 jobs; Texas, the President's home State, has lost \n170,000 manufacturing jobs.\n  The loss of these manufacturing jobs is especially serious because \nthey pay good wages and benefits, and each manufacturing job creates \nclose to three other jobs in other sectors of the economy.\n  As this chart indicates, for every 100 jobs in retail, they create 88 \nmore jobs; for every 100 jobs in business services, they create 154 \njobs; for every 100 jobs in manufacturing, 291.\n  The Bush administration wants to ignore this serious problem, too. \nThey have suggested cooking the books to create the appearance of job \ngrowth in the manufacturing sector. They want to count flipping \nhamburgers and other fast food jobs as manufacturing jobs to make up \nfor the loss of millions of manufacturing jobs under President Bush's \nwatch.\n  Providing more tax breaks for multinational corporations is the wrong \nthing to do, and that is exactly what this bill does. For any of those \nMembers who are interested in the particular details, they ought to \njust read Senator Bob Graham's excellent presentation on this very \npoint. He has addressed the Senate frequently on it, and has identified \nit.\n  I have not the time this afternoon to go into it, but I want to give \nassurance to the Members on this, that we are providing in this \nlegislation tax breaks for multinational corporations. It is more than \nthe loss of the $40 billion in tax revenue which has been added in this \njobs bill that could be used for many better purposes that is \ntroubling. What is most disturbing is the fact that many of these \ninternational provisions will actually encourage companies to shift \neven more American jobs to low-wage countries.\n  The international provisions should have been removed from the bill \nand the tax dollars saved should be used to increase the tax benefits \nfor domestic manufacturing. It makes no sense to expand the value of \nthe foreign tax credits which multinational corporations receive.\n  Under the legislation, these companies would pay even less in U.S. \ntaxes on the profits they earn from their business abroad than they do \ntoday--$40 billion less. This will create further incentives for them \nto move jobs abroad, undermining the intent of the legislation.\n  From the perspective of preserving American jobs, one of the worst \nfeatures of this corporate tax law is a special tax subsidy for \nmultinationals known as deferral. If a U.S. company moves its operation \nabroad, it can defer paying U.S. taxes on the profits it makes overseas \nuntil the companies choose to send those profits back to America.\n  In essence, it allows the corporation to decide when it will pay the \ntaxes it owes the U.S. Government. That is a luxury that companies \nmaking products and providing services here at home do not have. This \nis an enormous competitive advantage which the Tax Code gives to \ncompanies doing the wrong thing, eliminating American jobs, over \ncompanies doing the right thing, preserving the jobs in the United \nStates. That feature alone ought to be enough to have Members of this \nbody vote no at the time of the consideration of the conference report.\n  I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair. I will reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY, Mr. President. I make a few points regarding the FDA \nissue and the regulation of tobacco. I voted for the FDA provision in \nthis bill. I voted in conference to include FDA regulation of tobacco. \nBut the House refused to accept it.\n  I voted for this, despite the growing problems that are coming to \nlight about the FDA falling down on its current responsibilities.\n  Just in the last few months, the FDA has come under investigation, \nincluding from my own committee, regarding the way its failed regarding \ndrugs causing suicide in children.\n  And where was the FDA regarding the recent Vioxx catastrophy and how \nit causes heart attacks? Just yesterday, it was revealed by my Finance \nCommittee that it looks like the FDA pressured employees to suppress \nnegative findings regarding Vioxx.\n  And, in today's paper, we read about what looks like the FDA falling \ndown on the job in regard to the Flu vaccine crisis.\n  So, I hope some around here aren't trying to mislead the American \npeople into thinking that FDA regulation is some kind of panacea for \nsmoking.\n  I heard one Senator from the other side say that we sided with the \ntobacco companies when the FDA provision failed. Well that's \ninteresting.\n\n[[Page S10945]]\n\n  That's surely what opponents would like you to think. But, there's a \ndirty little secret involved here. Or, at least it's a secret vis a vis \nthe public.\n  The fact is, the tobacco companies are divided on whether there \nshould be FDA regulation. In fact, the largest tobacco company actually \nsupports FDA regulation, and has been lobbying heavily and pouring \nmoney into the effort to get it.\n  Why? Well, for one thing, a great deal of its business is overseas, \nand it will therefore be immune from FDA regulation. This will give it \na competitive edge against its competitors. So, the tobacco companies, \nor at least the biggest one, is much more in favor of FDA regulation \nthan against it.\n  Therefore, anybody trying to frame this as tobacco vesus kids, or \ntobacco versus health groups, is just flatly misleading the public.\n  But, even for those of us who pushed for FDA oversight, our legs were \ncut right out from under us during the negotiations. And guess who cut \nthe legs right out from under us? The leadership of the Democratic \nparty cut the legs right out from under us. That's who.\n  The leader of the Democratic party, Senator Kerry, went down to North \nCarolina to talk to tobacco farmers. Guess what he said? He said he'd \nsupport a tobacco buyout with or without FDA regulation.\n  So, it looks to me like the senior Senator from Massachusetts didn't \ncommunicate very well with the junior Senator from Massachusetts--or \nvice-versa.\n  Moreover, we had the democratic Senate campaign chairman saying the \nsame thing last week. He said he didn't need FDA regulation with a \ntobacco buyout.\n  And, he even had his candidate for the North Carolina Senate seat up \nhere lobbying right over in the conference committee room to get this \nbuyout through, with or without FDA. Can you believe that?\n  And, to add insult to injury to the Democratic Senators from \nMassachusetts, and Iowa, the Senate Democratic leader even signed the \nconference report.\n  So, obviously, when the House leadership knew the votes were there in \nthe Senate for a buyout without FDA, they weren't about to agree to it \nin conference, and there's no way we could have successfully pushed it.\n  Now, what more does it take from their own leaders to undermine what \nthe Democratic Senators from Iowa and Massachusetts wanted to do? Seems \nto me the need to get their own house in order before criticizing \nothers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we still have a number of speakers. Under \nthe order which we had set up, in which we would go back and forth with \nthe majority and minority, it is now the majority's turn.\n  It is my understanding Senator Stevens, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, is on his way here to give a very short \nstatement. I am wondering if that is, in fact, the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will change places with you so you can \nmake the unanimous consent request.\n  As I understand it, Senator Stevens has asked for 5 minutes to make a \nspeech before I make mine.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding we are also ready to move to the \nDefense Authorization conference report.\n  Mr. HATCH. Then, as I also understand it, the order should be Senator \nWarner to make his unanimous consent request, Senator Stevens for 5 \nminutes, then I for whatever time I need, and then Senator Landrieu for \nwhatever time she wanted.\n  Mr. REID. I thought it was going to be Senator Warner for 5 minutes, \nSenator Stevens for 5 minutes, and then Senator Landrieu for an hour \nand half.\n  Mr. HATCH. If we can do it the way I suggested, it would be very \nacceptable.\n  I ask unanimous consent that be the order.\n  Mr. REID. The order has already been established. As soon as we \nfinish with Senator Warner and Senator Stevens, Senator Hatch will take \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hatch).

REAGAN NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR \n                        2005--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on the bill (H.R. 4200) and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     4200), to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2005 for \n     military activities of the Department of Defense, for \n     military construction, and for defense activities of the \n     Department of Energy, to prescribe personnel strengths for \n     such fiscal year for the Armed Forces, and for other \n     purposes, having met, have agreed that the House recede from \n     its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, and agree to \n     the same with an amendment, and the Senate agree to the same, \n     signed by a majority of the conferees on the part of both \n     Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the proceedings of the House in \nthe Record for Friday, October 8, 2004.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of the distinguished ranking \nmember, Mr. Levin, and myself, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nconference report be adopted and the motion to reconsider be laid on \nthe table, all with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this conference report represents the hard \nwork of many, many individuals. I first thank my distinguished ranking \nmember, Mr. Levin of Michigan, together with our subcommittee chairmen \nand all members of the committee. This was truly a bipartisan effort \nfrom start to finish. We achieved an extraordinary piece of \nlegislation. I am proud to say, at the request of the chairman, myself, \nthe bill is named the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2005.\n  We do that in honor of our late President's extraordinary \ncontributions to the men and women of the Armed Forces in his capacity \nas President and in his role as Commander in Chief at that time.\n  This conference report provides $420.6 billion for defense, an \nincrease of $19.3 billion above the amount authorized by Congress last \nyear. The report also authorizes an additional $25 billion for war-\nrelated costs in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I am proud to bring the conference report for the Ronald W. Reagan \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 before the \nSenate for final passage. I thank my ranking member and partner for \nthese 26 years, the senior Senator from Michigan, Carl Levin, for his \nconsistently constructive help and leadership in bringing this \nimportant legislation to the floor. I would also like to thank our \nsubcommittee chairman and ranking members, and all committee members \nfor their hard work on this conference report. I am pleased that this \nlegislation report has the unanimous support of the members of the \ncommittee.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Duncan Hunter and Congressman Skelton \nfor their leadership and teamwork in producing this conference \nagreement.\n  No committee succeeds without a dedicated, professional staff, and I \nbelieve our committee has one of the finest on Capitol Hill. I \nparticularly want to recognize the efforts of the Committee Staff \nDirector, Judy Ansley and the Democratic Staff Director, Rick DeBobes \nin bringing this process to a successful conclusion. They have led a \ngreat staff, all of whom deserve great credit and recognition. This \ndedicated professional staff worked very long hours and helped the \nmembers reach the agreements that are contained in the conference \nreport before us. I ask that the names of all members of the committee \nstaff be printed in the record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. Warner. As we consider this conference report, we remain a nation \nat\n\n[[Page S10946]]\n\nwar against terrorism around the world. There is no doubt that we will \nwin this war because of the extraordinary Americans who volunteer to \nserve the cause of peace and freedom. All Americans are in their debt, \nand they and their families deserve our unwavering support. The legacy \nof President Ronald W. Reagan, to whom we and the Nation paid our last \nrespects a few short months ago, is memorialized in this legislation. I \ncan think of no better way to honor the service and sacrifice of the \nmen and women of our Armed Forces and their families, than to provide \nthem with the pay and benefits they so richly deserve, and to give them \nthe equipment they need to carry out their critical missions on behalf \nof our Nation, as President Reagan fought so hard to do when he was \nPresident and their Commander-in-Chief.\n  This bill provides much needed benefits to those now serving in the \nArmed Forces--Reserve and Active Duty--as well as addressing long-\nstanding needs of military retirees and veterans, and their families \nwho served this Nation so well. There were many contentious issues to \nresolve--BRAC, Buy America, Tanker replacement, housing privatization \nand TRICARE for Reservists, among others. We did resolve them, however, \nand I am proud we have achieved our goal of concluding a conference \nwhich sends a strong message of support to our men and women in \nuniform.\n  As we stand here today hundreds of thousands of soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and Marines, Active and Reserve, and countless civilians who \nsupport them, are serving bravely around the world from the Persian \nGulf region and Afghanistan to Europe and North Korea. All Americans \nare justifiably proud of what the U.S. Armed Forces and their coalition \npartners have accomplished in the global war on terrorism. We are ever \nmindful that the defense of our homeland begins on the distant \nbattlefields of the world.\n\n  We must pause and remember that military success is not achieved \nwithout significant sacrifice. No matter how well conducted, military \nvictory does not come without sacrifice and loss. We extend our \nheartfelt sympathies to the families and loved ones of those who have \nlost their lives in these operations and in other military operations \nto make America and the world safer. We mourn their loss and resolve to \nforever remember their service. We give thanks to those who serve and \nhave served their Nation with distinction throughout our history. We \nare blessed to have this new generation of great Americans, so \ncommitted to American traditions, values and ideals, carrying on the \ntraditions of those who preceded them with such dedication and valor.\n  Without a doubt, the U.S. military is the most capable military force \nin the world today, a model of excellence, and the standard by which \nothers are measured. The provisions in this conference report sustain \nand improve on that excellence.\n  This conference report continues the momentum of recent years in \nmaking real increases in defense spending--a 3.4 percent increase--to \nsustain readiness, enhance the quality of life of our military \npersonnel and their families, modernize and transform the U.S. Armed \nForces to meet current and future threats, and take care of our \nretirees and veterans. The conference report before us provides $420.6 \nbillion for defense, an increase of $19.3 billion above the amount \nauthorized by Congress last year. The conference report also authorizes \nan additional $25. billion for war-related costs in Afghanistan and \nIraq.\n  There are many things contained in this conference report that are \nimportant and of which I am very proud, but I want to highlight just a \nfew. First and foremost is the 3.5 percent pay raise for our men and \nwomen in uniform, and a new healthcare benefit for reservists who serve \non extended active duty. Second, we have reached agreement on how to \nproceed in procuring new aerial refueling aircraft in a prudent manner, \nconsistent with existing laws and regulations. Third, we have preserved \nthe 2005 BRAC round--a much needed review of our basing infrastructure. \nThis is critical for the efficiency and smart posturing of our Armed \nForces to meet future challenges.\n  There are many other important initiatives, such as housing \nprivatization, improved survivor benefits, funding for missile defense \nand other weapons systems. These important initiatives and authorities \nare contained in the conference report before you.\n  This conference report sends a clear signal to our citizens, and to \nnations around the world, that the United States is committed to a \nstrong national defense. More important, this conference report sends a \nclear signal to our men and women in uniform, from the newest private \nto the most senior flag and general officer, that they have the support \nof the American people.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support of this conference report.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n           Committee Staff of the Committee on Armed Services\n\n     Judith A.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Chairman of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee and my good friend, Senator Warner, in \nurging the adoption of the conference report on H.R. 4200, the National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005. We began work on this \nbill with our mark-up in early May. Since that time, we have spent 5 \nweeks on the Senate floor and nearly 4 months in conference. This \nconference agreement would not have been possible without the strength \nand perseverance of Senator Warner.\n  This conference report will promote the national defense, improve the \nquality of life of our men and women in uniform, and make the \ninvestments we need to meet the challenges of the 21st century. First \nand foremost, the bill before us continues the increases in \ncompensation and quality of life that our service men and women and \ntheir families deserve as they face the hardships imposed by continuing \nmilitary operations around the world.\n  Mr. President, we all know that our Armed Forces today are deployed \nin harms' way around the world. As we stand on the Senate floor today, \nmore than 130,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines are engaged in \ntaking on an aggressive insurgency and winning the peace in Iraq, with \ntens of thousands more supporting the war effort\n\n[[Page S10947]]\n\nfrom outside the country. At the same time, our military continues to \nbear the brunt of the continuing effort to stabilize and rebuild \nAfghanistan, keep the peace in Bosnia, Kosovo, and the Sinai, and \ncontain the threat of North Korea--while also preparing to execute \nother missions in support of the national military strategy.\n  It has been clear to many of us for some time now that the Army and \nMarine Corps are simply stretched too thin, and that additional troops \nare badly needed to meet our worldwide commitments. I am pleased that \nthis bill takes an important step toward that objective by increasing \nthe active duty end strength of the Army by 20,000 and the active duty \nend strength of the Marine Corps by 3,000.\n  I am also pleased that the bill before us contains much of the \namendment offered on the Senate floor by Senator Daschle and Senator \nGraham to provide expanded TRICARE benefits for the National Guard and \nReserve members who have made so many sacrifices and contributed so \nmuch to our nation over the last three years. In particular, the \nconference report would:\n  Make permanent the temporary authority for free TRICARE health care \ncoverage for National Guard and Reserve members and their families up \nto 90 days before a mobilized service member reports for active duty \nand for 180 days after release from active duty; and\n  Authorize a new TRICARE benefit for Guard and Reserve members and \ntheir families when the member is not on active duty.\n  Under this provision, National Guard and Reserve members who are \nmobilized would be authorized, upon release from active duty, to enroll \nin TRICARE Prime for 1 year for every 90 days spent on active duty. \nThis is the least that we can do for these brave men and women.\n  The bill would take a number of other important steps to improve the \nlives of our men and women in uniform. For example, the bill would:\n  Authorize a 3.5 percent across-the-board pay raise for military \npersonnel;\n  Authorize a permanent increase in the rate of special pay for duty \nsubject to hostile fire or imminent danger;\n  Authorize a permanent increase in the rate of the family separation \nallowance;\n  Improve the Survivor Benefit Plan by eliminating the reduction in SBP \nbenefits for surviving spouses over age 62, phased in over 3\\1/2\\ \nyears;\n  Ensure fair treatment of our disabled veterans by repealing the \nphase-in of concurrent receipt of retired pay and VA disability pay to \nmilitary retirees with service-connected disabilities rated as 100 \npercent; and\n  Authorized a new program of educational assistance to members of the \nSelective Reserve, based on the GI Bill.\n  The bill would also directly address a number of specific problems \nand issues that have arisen in the course of our continuing operations \nin Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  First, the bill would provide our Armed Forces new flexibility to \nrespond to changing circumstances on the ground by authorizing the use \nof up to $300 million for the Commanders' Emergency Response Program in \nIraq and Afghanistan, under which commanders may use funds for small \nhumanitarian and reconstruction projects; authorizing the use of up to \n$500 million for assistance to Iraq and Afghanistan military or \nsecurity forces to enhance their ability to combat terrorism and \nsupport U.S. or coalition military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan; \nand authorizing the Special Operations Command to expend up to $25 \nmillion of existing funds to provide support to foreign forces, \nirregular forces, groups, or individuals, engaged in supporting or \nfacilitating ongoing military operations by the United States special \noperations forces to combat terrorism; establishing a new rapid \nacquisition program to enable the Department of Defense to quickly \nacquire equipment needed by a combatant commander to eliminate \ndeficiencies in equipment that have resulted in combat fatalities; and \nraising the thresholds for the use of streamlined acquisition \nprocedures outside the United States in support of contingency \noperations.\n  Second, the bill contains important language from amendments offered \nby Senators Durbin and Leahy on the Senate floor, reaffirming the \nprohibition against subjecting any person in the custody or under the \nphysical control of the United States to ``torture or cruel, inhuman, \nor degrading treatment or punishment that is prohibited by the \nConstitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.'' These \nprovisions send an important message to the world that the United \nStates will not permit, condone, tolerate, or encourage the kind of \nbehavior so graphically depicted in the photographs from Abu Ghraib \nprison in Iraq. We all know that the abuses that occurred at Abu Ghraib \nand elsewhere have undermined the hard work and sacrifices of our \nmilitary and tarnished the image of our armed forces. The provisions \nincluded in the conference report reaffirm that we are a Nation of laws \nand send the message that Congress will not accept mixed messages or \nambiguous statements on the fundamental issue of human rights and \ndignity.\n  The bill contains several other important provisions addressing \nongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. These include:\n  A provision originally written by Senator Dodd, which authorizes \nreimbursement of service members and their families for purchases of \nbody armor and other protective equipment at a time when the Department \nof Defense did not have sufficient protective gear in Iraq to protect \nour men and women in uniform; a provision addressing deficiencies in \nthe oversight and management of contractors on the ground in Iraq, and \nrequiring the issuance of specific guidance and regulations to enhance \nthe safety of contractor employees and improve coordination between our \narmed forces and the contractors who are there to support their \nrebuilding efforts; and a provision reauthorizing and extending the CPA \nInspector General to ensure that we have continuing oversight over \nfraud, waste and abuse in the expenditure of funds for the rebuilding \nof Iraq.\n  The conference report also includes a number of provisions that will \nhelp improve the management of the Department of Defense and other \nfederal agencies. These include: the Collins-Levin amendment permitting \nfederal employees to be heard, for the first time, in bid protests \nappealing the results of public-private competitions; a provision that \nwould extend the authority for energy savings performance contracts for \nan additional 2 years, enabling federal agencies to save hundreds of \nmillions of dollars through improved energy efficiency; a provision \nthat should help resolve the controversy over the Air Force's proposed \nlease of tanker aircraft by prohibiting the Air Force from entering a \nlease and instead requiring the use of a traditional multi-year \ncontract; a provision that would require the Department of Defense to \ndevelop and implement a business enterprise architecture to gain better \ncontrol over its finances; and a provision directing the Secretary of \nDefense to develop policies and regulations to discourage other \ncountries from imposing ``offset agreements'' in defense trade, and \nthereby undermining our defense industrial base.\n  Finally, I am pleased that the conference report contains a series of \nprovisions that will establish a workers' compensation-like program for \nnuclear workers who have cancers and other occupational-related \ninjuries. The program will be administered by the Department of Labor \nand establishes a compensation scheme for both employees and survivors. \nCovered employees would receive the compensation benefits, as well as \nmedical benefits under the provisions. The total amount of compensation \nunder the provision would be capped at $250,000. Also included are \nprovisions that would extend to uranium miners the opportunity to seek \nthis workers' compensation-like benefit. Employees can elect to apply \nfor this benefit or they may choose to remain in their individual \nstate's workers' compensation system.\n  Mr. President, this is a good conference report, but no conference \nreport is perfect.\n  I strongly disagree with a provision in the bill that would attempt \nto transfer from the Department of Defense to the Treasury the \nresponsibility to provide the funding for military health care. \nPrograms do not become ``free'' just because they are moved outside the \nDefense budget. That is why this provision was strongly opposed by the\n\n[[Page S10948]]\n\nchairman and ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.\n  I am deeply disappointed that the House conferees refused to accept \nimportant Senate provisions addressing hate crimes. Acts of violence \nand bigotry based on factors like race, religion, national origin, \ngender, sexual orientation, or disability can undermine our nation's \nfabric by placing in question our continuing commitment to acceptance \nand diversity. The Kennedy-Smith hate crimes bill would address this \nproblem head-on. The Senate has now passed the hate crimes bill on two \nseparate occasions, and each time, the House has refused even to \nconsider the provision on the merits.\n  I am equally disappointed that the House refused to include the Boxer \namendment on abortion. Under the law as it stands today, Medicare funds \nmay be used for abortions in cases of rape or incest, but Department of \nDefense funds may not. This kind of discrimination against women who \nput their lives on the line for their country is incomprehensible to \nme.\n  I am disappointed that, faced with a veto threat, we were able to get \nless than half of the provisions that we wanted to codify sound \npractices in public-private competition of work currently performed by \ngovernment employees.\n  Finally, I am disappointed that this conference report includes a \nHouse provision reducing the authority of the base closure commission \nto address bases not recommended for closure or realignment by the \nSecretary of Defense.\n  Despite my concerns about these issues, I will vote for this bill \nbecause it contains so many other provisions that are so important for \nour national defense and for our men and women and uniform. At a time \nwhen our armed forces are under hostile fire in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nit is vitally important that we enact a defense authorization bill that \nprovides the training and equipment that our military needs and the \ncompensation and benefits that they deserve.\n  I would like to thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Warner, once again for the effective leadership that he \nprovided in bringing this bill through conference and back to the \nSenate floor. Senator Warner's inclusiveness and openness in the way he \nmanages the Committee and the conference have resulted in a far better \nbill than we would otherwise have had.\n  I would also like to thank the minority members of our Committee for \nthe able work that they have done in support of this bill throughout \nthe past year, starting with hearings in the Spring, and continuing \nthrough mark-up, floor deliberation, and conference. We have a truly \ntalented group of members, whose dedication to the national defense \nshows in their work.\n  I would be remiss if I did not also mention the work of our dedicated \ncommittee staff, on both sides of the aisle. It is the hard work of \nthis staff--under the able leadership of Judy Ansley and Rick DeBobes--\nthat has made this bill possible. Rick and Judy and the staff have been \nworking literally around the clock for the last month to put this \nconference report, and I think that the Senate owes a debt of gratitude \nto every one of them.\n  On the Majority staff Judy Ansley, Chuck Alsup, June Borawski, Leah \nBrewer, Alison Brill, Jennifer Cave, David Cherington, Marie Dickenson, \nRegine Dubey, Andy Florell, Brian Green, Bill Greenwalt, Bruce Hock, \nGary Howard, Jennifer Key, Greg Kiley, Tom MacKenzie, Elaine McCusker, \nLucian Niemeyer, Stan O'Connor, Cindy Pearson, Paula Philbin, Ben \nRubin, Lynn Rusten, Katie Sendak, Joe Sixeas, Rob Soofer, Diana Tabler, \nDick Walsh, Bridget Ward, Nick West, and Kelley Wilson.\n  On the Minority staff Rick DeBobes, Chris Cowart, Dan Cox, Madelyn \nCreedon, Mitch Crosswait, Brie Eisen, Evelyn Farkas, Richard \nFieldhouse, Creighton Greene, Bridget Higgins, Mike Kuiken, Maren Leed, \nGary Leeling, Peter Levine, Mike McCord, Bill Monahan, and Arun \nSeraphin.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nbill.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, while I support Senate passage of H.R. \n4200, the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2005, and will not object to its passage, I am nevertheless \nconcerned with language appearing in section 1225, ``Bilateral \nExchanges and Trade in Defense Articles and Defense Services Between \nthe United States and the United Kingdom and Australia.'' My concerns \nare shared by the ranking Democratic member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Biden.\n  We maintain an amicable and beneficial working relationship between \nthe Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees. In many years \npast, we opposed efforts by the Armed Services Committee to legislate \non matters under our Committee's unique jurisdiction. Last June, we \noffered an amendment to the defense authorization bill because we \nunderstood that our own authorization bill would not proceed, and that \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee supported all of the provisions we \noffered. We also sought to provide a response to certain provisions in \nthe House defense authorization bill.\n  The Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner, \nintroduced Senate Amendment 3429 to S. 2400, the Senate version of the \ndefense authorization bill, on June 7, 2004. This amendment was \nidentical to language in our committee's bill that provided exceptions \nto the requirements in subsection (j) of section 38 of the Arms Export \nControl Act regarding the content of any bilateral agreement that would \nwaive International Traffic in Arms Regulations--the ITAR, 22 CFR 120-\n130--export license requirements for transfers of defense items or \ndefense services to the United Kingdom and Australia. This legislation \nwould have, in the case of the agreement with the Government of \nAustralia, excepted the agreement from section 38(j)(2)(A) and, in the \ncase of the agreement with the Government of the United Kingdom, \nexcepted that agreement from the requirements of section 38 \n(j)(1)(A)(ii), (2)(A)(i), and (2)(A)(ii). The administration supported \nthat language, and so did Senator Warner when he offered our language \non his bill.\n  The issue of the ITAR exemption agreements is a complex and important \ntopic and, unfortunately, has become a major irritant in our special \nrelationship with the United Kingdom. Perhaps more unfortunately, the \nbill the Senate will pass today will include not our language but \nrather language that may be prejudicial to U.S. interests on several \ngrounds.\n  First, the bill no longer provides the exceptions we sought. \nEnactment of this provision may therefore make any future efforts to \nobtain such statutory exceptions for these most important allies all \nthe more difficult. The Senate will now have effectively endorsed the \nHouse position. This may well harm our bilateral relationship with the \nUnited Kingdom.\n  Second, the language of section 1225(b) states: ``The Secretary of \nState shall ensure that any license application submitted for the \nexport of defense articles or defense services to Australia or the \nUnited Kingdom is expeditiously processed by the Department of State, \nin consultation with the Department of Defense, without referral to any \nother Federal department or agency, except where the item is classified \nor exceptional circumstances apply.'' This language could do great harm \nto our government's ability to provide necessary and complete \ninteragency review of munitions license applications. The phrase \n``without referral to any other Federal department or agency'' is new \nlaw, and it far exceeds what wisdom would dictate. Under this language, \nthe Departments of Justice and Homeland Security would not be allowed \nto review any case not involving classified defense items, unless it \nmet an ``exceptional circumstances'' standard. The vast majority of \ndefense exports to the United Kingdom and Australia that are governed \nunder the ITAR are not classified items, and while the Foreign \nRelations Committee supports expeditious consideration of munitions \nlicense applications for these allies, we are concerned by provisions \nthat could deny our government the ability to effectively staff and \nreview license applications.\n  This concern is heightened by the fact that the provisions of section \n1225 apply to all arms exports to the United Kingdom and Australia, \nirrespective of end-user. The bilateral agreements negotiated with the \nUnited Kingdom and Australia take a different approach. They afford \nrelief from export license\n\n[[Page S10949]]\n\nrequirements for certain unclassified exports, rather than merely \nexpedited processing, but they also are limited in their application of \na waiver to a finite group of U.S.-approved end-users. That limit is a \nsensible accommodation of U.S. national security concerns, and it is \ndifficult to understand why the National Defense Authorization Act \nconferees decided to ignore it.\n  I fully expect that the Foreign Relations Committee and the House \nInternational Relations Committee will revisit this issue next year in \nan effort to correct the failings of the measure that is now before us.\n\n\n                              Section 133\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to review with my colleague \nSection 133 of the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2005. Under the leadership of Senate Armed Services \nCommittee Chairman Warner and Ranking Member Levin, Congress has agreed \nto amend Section 135 of the National Defense Authorization Act for \nfiscal year 2004 by expressly prohibiting the Air Force from using \npreviously granted authority to acquire, through a lease or purchase, \nBoeing 767 aircraft for use as aerial refueling tankers.\n  This provision succeeds in accomplishing Chairman Warner's primary \nobjective, as he stated in this chamber on October 23, 2003, to put the \ntanker replacement program back into a traditional budget, procurement, \nand authorization track. In other words, the Air Force's program to \nmodernize its tanker fleet must be subject to the aerial refueling \nanalysis of alternatives, the aerial refueling portion of the Mobility \nCapabilities Study, a new aerial refueling validated capabilities \ndocument and operational requirements document in accordance with all \napplicable Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instructions, and the \nexpress approval of a Defense Acquisition Board in full accordance with \nDepartment of Defense regulations.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator from Arizona is correct. Section 133 \nspecifically revokes the authority previously granted under Section \n8159 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year \n2002, to the Air Force to lease aircraft for use as tankers. The \nconferees expressed their intent very strongly on this issue in \neliminating all references to leasing aircraft throughout Section 135.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chairman for clarifying the intent of the \nlegislation with respect to the prohibition on leasing tanker aircraft. \nNow, let's turn to what authority Section 133 grants with respect to \npurchase of tanker aircraft.\n  Mr. WARNER. Section 133 bars the Air Force from executing a contract \nfor the multiyear purchase of aircraft specified under Section 8159, \nthat is, general purpose Boeing 767 aircraft that would be modified as \nan aerial refueling aircraft. Section 8159 would have precluded full \nand open competition.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Chairman is correct. This means that, under Section \n133, the Air Force may not acquire, either by lease or purchase, Boeing \n767s without full and open competition. In other words, any program to \nacquire tankers must start from the beginning, as the Senator properly \nstated last year, on a traditional budget, procurement, and \nauthorization track.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator from Arizona is correct. I thank him for that \nclarification.\n  Mr. McCAIN. One last question. Have we obtained an opinion from the \nCongressional Budget Office as to how it would score the acquisition of \ntankers under Section 133?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, we have. The Congressional Budget Office would score \nthis provision as a traditional procurement program which would \nexpressly require the Air Force to pay for each tanker in the year it \nis purchased.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator. I am grateful to the gentleman from \nVirginia for his leadership in this 3-year odyssey. I remind my \ncolleagues that three out of the four defense committees that were \nrequired to approve the original proposal to lease 100 tankers, did so \nwithout so much as reading the contract for that $30 billion \nprocurement proposal. It was the Senate Armed Services Committee that \nput the brakes on that costly and misguided misadventure. That having \nbeen said, the final chapter on the tanker lease program cannot be \nclosed until those among Air Force leadership who engaged in misconduct \nare held accountable.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from Arizona for his steadfast \nleadership and vigilance on this critical issue. There could be no \ndoubt as to the gentleman's sincerity in always protecting the \ninterests of taxpayers and the warfighter.\n  Mr. Kennedy. Mr. President, it is reprehensible that the GOP House \nleadership demanded the removal of the hate crimes provision from the \nDefense Authorization Act.\n  The provision had solid support in both the Senate and the House. \nUnder the leadership of Senator Warner and Senator Gordon Smith, the \nSenate approved it as an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill in \nJuly by the nearly 2-to-1 bipartisan majority of 65 to 33. Eighteen \nRepublicans joined all the Democrats in approving this measure. Last \nweek, by a vote of 213 to 186, the House instructed its conferees to \nsupport this provision in the conference report on the bill.\n  The hate crimes provision is an essential response to a serious \nproblem which continues to plague the nation. Since the September 11 \nattacks, we've had a shameful increase in the number of hate crimes \ncommitted in our country against Arabs and Muslims--murders, beatings, \narson, attacks on mosques, shootings, and other assaults. In 2001, \nanti-Muslim incidents were the second highest-reported hate crimes \nbased on religion--second only to anti-Jewish hate crimes.\n  Nevertheless, under current law, the Justice Department has to fight \nthese vicious crimes with one hand tied behind its back. Outdated pre-\n9/11 restrictions limit Federal jurisdiction in hate crimes based on \nreligion. Hate crimes based on sexual orientation are not even covered \nby the law. How can House Republican leaders say they're fighting a war \non terrorism, when they're not prepared to fight it here at home?\n  Clearly, President Bush is worried about his right-wing base in the \ncoming election, and the implication is obvious that the White House \nsent word to its Republican allies in the House--block the hate crimes \nprovision, even if blocking it denies the clear will of the majority.\n  The carefully selected White House candidate for the Senate in \nFlorida used the hate crimes issue to smear his opponent in the \nRepublican primary in August. Former Congressman Bill McCollum, a \nrespected law-and-order Republican, was smeared as ``anti-family'' and \n``the new darling of the homosexual extremists'' and lost the primary--\nbecause he supported the hate crimes legislation. There is nothing \n``anti-family'' or divisive about the hate crimes bill. It protects all \nvictims of hate-motivated violence: citizens of all races, all \nreligions, all sexual orientations. No one is left out.\n  Sadly, the despicable smear against Congressman McCollum in Florida \nis only one example of the vicious campaign tactics used by Republicans \nthis year. In West Virginia and Arkansas, the Republican National \nCommittee has sent out flyers suggesting that ``liberals'' want to ban \nthe Bible. My colleague Senator Robert Byrd aptly described it as a \n``desperation tactic'' and ``an insult to the intelligence of voters'' \nin his State.\n  In Oklahoma, the National Republican Senate Campaign is running a \nrace-baiting advertisement on television attacking Democratic Senate \ncandidate Brad Carson's record on immigration by showing images of \nHispanic farm workers and African Americans receiving welfare dollars. \nWe've seen such campaign appeals to racism and bigotry before in this \ncountry. Most of us hoped we would never see them again.\n  When President Bush condones outrageous tactics like these, how can \nhe claim with a straight face that he's lived up to his campaign \npromise to be a uniter, not a divider?\n  The administration is wrong to have ordered its allies in the House \nto block our bipartisan hate crimes provision. However, this is not the \nend of our battle. We will be back again and again, and we will \ncontinue to bring this legislation up every opportunity we can until it \nis signed into law. It's heartening to know that we may soon have a \nPresident who will sign it--a President who is honestly committed to \nuniting, not dividing, the country.\n\n[[Page S10950]]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the \nconferees on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2005, for reforming the Energy Employee's Occupational Illness Act, \nEEOICPA, and ensuring that the Radiation Exposure Compensation Program, \nRECA, receives additional mandatory funding to pay the workers whose \nclaims were originally subject to additional appropriations.\n  I view the reform of EEOICPA's subtitle D as particularly \nsignificant. From November 2003 through March 2004, the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee held three hearings on this program. These \nhearings determined that the current program's subtitle D was not \npaying injured atomic workers. Subtitle D relied on the DOE to \ndetermine causation with a subsequent referral to State compensation \nsystems. Typically these State compensations not only add add \nadditional delay to the process but they are adversarial in nature \nbecause insurers can contest the claim against a sick and dying worker. \nAs a result of these three Senate hearings, there was a bipartisan \neffort by 20 Senators to move subtitle D from the Department of Energy \nto the Department of Labor, where EEOICPA's subtitle B is administered. \nThe Department of Labor specializes in providing worker compensation, \nso it only seems reasonable to consolidate the program there. \nOriginally, the Senate's proposed reform of subtitle D required the \nDepartment of Labor to adjudicate each claim according to the workers' \nrespective State compensation standard. This compensation procedure, \nwhile insuring that the original intent of EEOICPA remained intact, was \ndetermined by the conferees to be too hard to administer. In my view, \nand it was stated in the March 2004 hearing, the proper course of \naction to pay these sick workers was to use a uniform standard funded \nfrom a mandatory account similar to subtitle B.\n  The conference report's version of EEOICPA's subtitle D takes the \nright approach. Instead of a compensation scheme tied to each State as \nin the Senate proposal, the conference report chooses a uniform payment \nschedule according to disability and lost wages, for both living and \ndeceased persons. Most importantly, subtitle D is funded out of the \nsubtitle B mandatory account so it does not end up like the RECA \nprogram in lacking the necessary compensation funds once a positive \ndetermination is made. I am also pleased that the language contains the \nombudsman provision, even though it is only authorized for three years. \nThe ombudsman will report to Congress on the transition from the \nDepartment of Energy to the Department of Labor, and whether the intent \nof the reform language is adhered to, which is the quick compensation \nof sick workers.\n  I would like to thank the many Senate staffers listed below who held \ntogether as a group for the past seven months; their names are found at \nthe end of this statement. Through this strong bipartisan effort, more \nwas accomplished than any by any single member. I hope this effort sets \na tone for other endeavors that we pursue in Congress.\n\n       Elizabeth Bellville, Office of Senator DeWine;\n       Catherine Boland, Office of Senator Voinovich;\n       David Cherington, Senate Armed Services Committee;\n       Doug Clapp, Office of Senator Murray;\n       Madelyn Creedon, Senate Armed Services Committee;\n       Angela Becker-Dippman, Office of Senator Cantwell;\n       Ken Ende, Office of Senator Murkowski;\n       Jonathan Epstein, Office of Senator Bingaman;\n       Holly Fechner, Health Education and Labor Committee;\n       Tom Horgan, Health Education and Labor Committee;\n       Kurt Kovarik, Office of Senator Grassley;\n       Kate Kimpan, Office of Senator Bunning;\n       Pete Lyons, Energy and Natural Resources Committee;\n       Sara Mills, Office of Senator Reid;\n       Beth Stein, Office of Senator Harkin;\n       Kristine Svinicki, Office of Senator Craig;\n       Katie Swaney, Office of Senator Talent;\n       Kim Taylor, Office of Senator Bunning;\n       Jason Unger, Office of Senator Reid;\n       Dan Utech, Office of Senator Clinton;\n       Tim Valentine, Office of Senator Alexander;\n       Karina Waller, Office of Senator Stevens;\n       Jenny Wing, Office of Senator Harkin;\n       Portia Wu, Health Education and Labor Committee.\n\n  Again, my thanks to the Chairman and Ranking members of both the \nHouse and Senate Armed Services Committees for ensuring that these \ninnocent atomic workers, who helped win the cold war, clean up its \nformer nuclear sites, and continue to maintain our nuclear deterrent, \nare adequately compensated for the injuries they sustained working at \nDOE's nuclear facilities.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I strongly support passage of the \nconference report on HR 4200, the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2005. This legislation funds over $420 billion for \ndefense programs, which is a 3.4 percent increase or $20.9 billion \nabove the amount authorized by Congress last year.\n  While I am pleased that we are able to act on this legislation prior \nto adjourning for the elections, I would be remiss if I did not mention \nthat once again, the Defense Appropriations Act has been signed into \nlaw prior to final action on the Defense Authorization Act. The \nresponsibilities of authorizors and appropriators are expected to be \ndistinct. The Defense Authorization Act lays out the blueprint for the \npolicies and funding levels for the Department of Defense and its \nprograms. The role of the Appropriations Committee is to allocate \nfunding based on policies provided by authorization bills. In reality \nhowever, the Appropriators' function, has expanded dramatically, and \nthe Appropriations Committee now engages in significant policy decision \nmaking and micromanagement, largely usurping the role of the \nauthorizing committees. I hope next year we will succeed in passing the \nauthorization measure prior to the appropriations measure.\n  The men and women of our Nation's Armed Forces put their lives on the \nline every day to protect the very freedoms we Americans hold dear. It \nis our obligation to provide key quality of life benefits to the \nmembers of our military. Great strides will be made by this bill \ntowards accomplishing that goal. For example, this Conference Report \nauthorizes a 3.5 percent across-the-board pay raise for all military \npersonnel. It repeals the requirement for military members to pay \nsubsistence charges while hospitalized, and adds $7.8 million for \nexpanded care and services at the Walter Reed Amputee Patient Care \nCenter. Also, included in the conference report is a permanent increase \nin the rate of family separation allowance from $100 per month to $250 \nper month as well as a permanent increase in the rate of special pay \nfor duty subject to hostile fire or imminent danger from $150 per month \nto $225 per month.\n  We continue to be increasingly reliant on the men and women of our \nReserve forces and National Guard. In fact, around 40 percent of all \nthe ground troops in Iraq and Afghanistan are composed of National \nGuard and Reserve forces as well as nearly all of the ground forces in \nKosovo, Bosnia, and the Sinai. Many of these soldiers and sailors leave \nbehind friends, families, and careers to defend our nation. \nAccordingly, it is the responsibility of policy makers to ensure we \nlook after the needs of these patriots. Included in the conference \nreport is the authorization for full medical and dental examinations \nand requisite inoculations when reservists mobilize and demobilize as \nwell as a new requirement for pre-separation physical examinations for \nmembers of the reserve component. This provision is critical to \nmaintain and, in some circumstances, increase the readiness of the \ntotal force.\n  In the Senate version of this legislation, we passed an important \namendment to authorize an increase in the size of our Army by 20,000 \nand size of our Marine Corps by 3,000. I am very pleased this provision \nwas included in the conference report. This increase is absolutely \nvital in our Army's ability to carry out its mission in the global war \non terror. There is no shortage of evidence supporting an increase in \nArmy endstrength. Recently, the Army pulled 3,600 troops out of South \nKorea to fill critical needs in Iraq. The Department of Defense should \nbe able to move troops around as needed to address critical needs. \nHowever, in this case, we are sacrificing our readiness on the Korean \npeninsula because we do not have enough solders serving in the Army.\n  After returning home for a short period of time, soldiers and Marines \nare\n\n[[Page S10951]]\n\nalready making preparations for their second tour in Iraq or \nAfghanistan in as many years. This is not good for morale, this is not \ngood for retention, this is not good for readiness, and this is not \ngood for the soldier's families. Eventually, recruitment will be \nseriously affected by these trends.\n  Additionally, the Army recently announced a new stop-loss policy. \nWhile, I certainly recognize the Army's authority and necessity to \nissue stop loss orders, their issuance in this instance is yet another \nreason why we need to increase the size of the Army. For all the \nbenefits in group cohesion that results from extended tours, the Army \nwill be facing a serious crisis when it comes time for these soldiers \nto reenlist on their own accord. I am concerned about the effect that \nthese stop-loss orders will have on the morale of our Army. While I \nstill do not believe that we need a draft, we do need to increase the \nsize of the Army to carry out important defense missions.\n  Once again, I am disappointed that the development of this \nlegislation lent the opportunity for the annual buy America battle. In \na similar fashion as last year, the Senate had to beat back a provision \nin the house version of the legislation that sought to protect \nparochial interests at the cost of our defense industry and American \njobs. It seems as if every year, we fight the same fight in conference. \nI am pleased that once again, the Senate prevailed over the \nprotectionist leanings in the House.\n  As I have stated countless times before, we need to provide American \nservicemen and women with the best equipment at the best price for the \nAmerican taxpayer. By following this simple philosophy, we will protect \nboth the men and women in uniform, as well as our domestic defense \nindustry.\n  The international considerations of buy America provisions are \nimmense. Isolationist, go-it-alone approaches have serious consequences \non our relationship with our allies. Our country is threatened when we \nignore our trade agreements. Currently, the U.S. enjoys a trade balance \nin defense exports of 6-to-1 in its favor with respect to Europe, and \nabout 12-to-1 with respect to the rest of the world. We don't need \nprotectionist measures to insulate our defense or aerospace industries. \nIf we enact laws that isolate our domestic defense industry, our allies \nwill retaliate and the ability to sell U.S. equipment as a means to \ngreater interoperability with NATO and non-NATO allies would be \nseriously undercut. Critical international programs, such as the Joint \nStrike Fighter and missile defense, would likely be terminated as our \nallies reassess our defense cooperative trading relationship.\n  The Senate also successfully defeated an amendment during Senate \nconsideration and again in conference aimed at crippling the upcoming \nBRAC round. BRAC has taken on a new significance in the war against \nterror. There has not been a time in recent memory when it has been \nmore important not to waste money on non-essential expenditures. To \ncontinue to sustain an infrastructure that exceeds our strategic and \ntactical needs will make less funding available to the forces that we \nare relying on to destroy the international network of terrorism. I am \nonce again pleased that the Senate put the good of the Department of \nDefense over parochial interests and protected the upcoming BRAC round.\n  The Department of Defense has come out with very fair and reasonable \ncriteria used to select what bases are chosen for BRAC. I have every \nconfidence the Secretary of Defense will carry out this round of BRAC \nin a just and consistent manner. Sooner or later surplus bases must be \nclosed. Delaying or canceling BRAC would only make the process more \ndifficult and painful than necessary. The sooner the issue is \naddressed, the greater will be the savings that will ultimately go \ntoward defense modernization and better pay and benefits for our hard \nworking service members.\n  I understand that some of my colleagues are concerned about the \npotential negative effects a base closure may have on their local \neconomy. But let me point out that previous base closure rounds have \nhad many success stories. For example, after England Air Force Base \nclosed in 1992, Alexandria, LA, benefitted from the creation of over \n1,400 jobs--nearly double the number of jobs lost. Across the U.S., \nabout 60,000 new jobs have been created at closing military bases. At \nbases closed more than 2 years, nearly 75 percent of the civilian jobs \nhave been replaced. This is not to say that base closures are easy for \nany community, but it does suggest that communities can and will \ncontinue to thrive.\n  Another issue of considerable diverse views during conference \ndeliberations concerned the aerial refueling tanker lease program. I \nwould be remiss if I did not take the opportunity to praise the \nleadership of Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Warner and \nRanking Member Levin for their steadfast vigilance during the three-\nyear odyssey on the Air Force's failed Boeing 767 tanker program. I \nremind my colleagues, again, that three out of the four defense \ncommittees that were required to approve the original proposal to lease \n100 tankers, did so without so much as reading the contract for the $30 \nbillion procurement proposal. It was the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee that \nput the brakes on that costly and misguided misadventure. And lest one \nthought otherwise, the Boeing 767 tanker investigations in the \nDepartment of Justice, Department of Defense, Office of Inspector \nGeneral and the U.S. Senate are continuing and expanding.\n  Under Section 133 of the National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2005, the Air Force may not enter into a sole-source \nmultiyear contract for the lease or purchase of Boeing 767s. Indeed, \nthe Conference Report makes clear that, at the end of the day, the Air \nForce's plan to modernize or update its fleet must be subject to full \nand open competition and the traditional budget, procurement and \nauthorization track. The conference report brings the Air Force's plan \nback to square one.\n  The bottom line here is this. The aerial refueling tanker provision \nin the defense authorization bill does much to inject much needed \nsunlight in a program that has largely been insulated from public \nscrutiny. In so doing, this provision, that was adopted, directs the \nAir Force to begin--anew from the beginning--in its program to \nmodernize its tanker fleet. The Air Force will have to now fully \nconsider the Congress's direction, prohibiting the retirement of KC-\n135E tanker aircraft, as a worthwhile alternative to updating tankers \nthrough KC-135E to R conversions. The tanker legislation in this bill \nensures that any effort by the Air Force to modernize and replace its \nfleet of tankers is done responsibly. We should expect no less from the \nAir Force. That having been said, the final chapter on the failed \ntanker lease program cannot be closed until those among Air Force \nleadership who engaged in misconduct, are held accountable.\n  I also would like to thank the chairman and ranking member, as well \nas Senators Dodd, DeWine, and Hollings for their assistance in \nreauthorizing the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program through \nFiscal Year 2009. This program uses a competitive, merit-based review \nprocess to give grants directly to local fire departments for \nequipment, training, and fire prevention programs. Our nation's \nfirefighters must be prepared to respond to a myriad of threats, and \nthis legislation will help ensure that they are adequately trained and \nequipped to meet them.\n  Mr. President, Americans are blessed with nearly limitless freedoms \nand liberties. In exchange for all our country gives to us, it does not \ndemand much in return. Yet throughout our history, millions of people \nhave volunteered to give back to their nation through military service. \nThe selfless acts of courage and sacrifice made by the men and women in \nour armed services have elevated our nation to the greatness we enjoy \ntoday.\n  America is defined not by its power but by its ideals. One of the \ngreat strengths of the American public is the desire to serve a cause \ngreater than our own self interest. All too often, our younger \ngenerations are accused of selfishness and an unwillingness to \nsacrifice. I disagree. I see generations of people yearning to serve \nand help their fellow citizens. Each year, thousands of our young \nAmericans decide to dedicate a few years or even a full career to\n\n[[Page S10952]]\n\nprotecting the rights and liberties of others. They often do this with \nvery real risks to their lives. They volunteer to do this not for \nprofit, nor for self promotion, but out of a sense of duty, service, \nand patriotism.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly on the fiscal \nyear 2005 national Defense authorization conference report.\n  I acknowledge the leadership of the senior Senator from Virginia, Mr. \nJohn Warner, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, in bringing this \nbill to final passage. Of course, I must also recognize the ranking \nmember, Senator Carl Levin. I had the privilege of working with them on \nthe committee for several years and I can attest that each year they \nwork together tirelessly to pass the Defense authorization bill because \nthey understand how absolutely vital this legislation is to the \neffectiveness and well-being of our Armed Forces.\n  For that matter, I also recognize every Senator on the committee for \ntheir efforts because this conference report authorizes the equipment, \nthe training, and the operational funds necessary to support our troops \nwho are right now operating across the globe to make our Nation and the \nworld more secure.\n  It also reflects the service and sacrifice of our troops by making a \nsolid investment in their quality of life by increasing their pay and \nenhancing educational and health care opportunities for our active duty \nmilitary members, our National Guard and Reserve troops and their \nfamily members. And that is only right, for today we are asking a great \ndeal of our gallant young men and women as they guard our Nation at \nhome and abroad and, of course, risk their lives every day to restore \nfreedom and prosperity to the oppressed peoples of Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  This legislation also recognizes that we owe a continuing debt to \nthose who have served honorably by continuing to work on full \nconcurrent receipt for those with a service connected disability, the \nsame benefit available to every other retired Federal employee, the \nability to collect full retirement pay and disability entitlements \nwithout offsets. Last year we made great strides in addressing the \ndisparity by which disabled military retirees have their pension \nbenefits reduced, dollar for dollar, by the amount of disability \nbenefits they receive from the Department of Veterans Affairs. And this \nbill goes even further by removing disabled retirees, who are rated as \n100 percent disabled, from the 10-year phase-in period. Thanks to this \nbill, those retirees will be authorized for full concurrent receipt \neffective January 2005.\n  This bill also finally corrects an inequity to those who have doubly \nsacrificed for our Nation, survivors of those who served this Nation \nwell and honorably. First, they sacrificed each day as their loved one \ndefended our Nation and they again sacrificed when they laid their hero \nto rest. And how did we repay them, by reducing their survivor benefit \npayment by over 30 percent once they reached age 62.\n  In the first session of this Congress, I sponsored S. 451, along with \n46 cosponsors, a bill to correct this inequity. My colleague, Senator \nLandrieu, sponsored a similar measure for the same reasons. This year \nwe worked together during the debate to include an amendment that would \nprovide survivors relief from this ``widow's tax.'' I am very pleased \nto note that the conferees also recognized the unfairness of this \nreduction and approved a provision that will, over the next 3\\1/2\\ \nyears, raise the percentage of the annuity available for survivors from \n35 percent after age 62 back to the 55 percent they were collecting \nbefore their birthday.\n  This bill provides $420.6 billion for Defense programs in fiscal year \n2005, an increase of $19.3 billion above the amount authorized by the \nCongress last year. In addition, the conferees authorized $25.0 billion \nfor additional war-related costs for Operations Iraqi Freedom and \nEnduring Freedom, including more than $2 billion for force protection \nmeasures, including armor, munitions, communications and surveillance \nprograms.\n  In particular, this bill also provides a little over $10 billion in \nan area that is critical to the security of the Nation, our \nshipbuilding capacity. It has become more and more apparent that as we \nengage the forces of terrorism around the world we have become \nincreasingly dependent on the ability of our Navy to not only deliver \ntroops and munitions to the fight, but to act as the sea base from \nwhich our forces can operate without restrictions virtually anywhere in \nthe world.\n  Yet, as a former chair of the Seapower Subcommittee, I remain \nconcerned about the Navy's shipbuilding program, particularly with \nrespect to the surface combatant force. As part of the 2001 Quadrennial \nDefense Review, the Navy and DoD approved a plan for maintaining a 310-\nship Navy including 116 surface combatants, cruisers, destroyers and \nfrigates. By the end of fiscal year 2003, the Navy's surface combatant \nfleet had fallen to 106 ships and the Navy has notified Congress that \nby the end of fiscal year 2004, it was their intent to reduce the force \nof surface combatants to 103 ships.\n  Therefore, I am encouraged that this authorization provides $3.6 \nbillion for the construction of three DDG-51 Arleigh-Burke class \ndestroyers for it is these ships, along with cruisers and frigates, \nthat provide protection to the carriers and amphibious ships deployed \nto the Persian Gulf and around the world to prosecute the war on \nterrorism. Moreover, it adds $100 million for the DDG in service \nmodernization program to begin the insertion of advanced technologies \nthat will dramatically reduce operation and support costs to the fleet \nand mitigate the risk of back-fitting these technologies on older \nships. Above all, we must pursue every path necessary to provide \ntechnologies to our sailors that will ease their workload, enhance \ntheir training opportunities and increase the survivability of their \nships.\n\n  However, this is the last planned funding for the DDG-51 acquisition \nprogram, and the next generation of surface combatants, the DD(X) and \nthe Littoral Combat Ship, LCS, are being funded in the research and \ndevelopment accounts. Although this authorization provides $1.5 billion \nfor the continued development of the DD(X), including an additional \n$84.4 million for the detailed design of the second DD(X) and $350 \nmillion for the continued development of the LCS in the RDT accounts, \nthere is a looming gap in the shipbuilding and conversion, Navy account \nfor surface combatants.\n  Without a focused effort on the part of the Navy to commit and invest \nin a robust surface combatant program, I am concerned not only about \nthe ability of the Navy's surface combatant force to maintain current \noperating tempos but the continuing viability of our shipbuilding \nindustrial base. Many have noted that in spite of Congress' efforts to \nstabilize the workload in our surface combatant shipyards, the Navy's \nchanging construction profile is undermining those efforts.\n  I urge the Navy to heed the stated concerns of Congress, especially \nthose of us with shipyards facing an uncertain future and do everything \nin their power to stabilize their shipbuilding accounts both in terms \nof budget and in schedule.\n  Importantly, this bill sets aside $66.5 billion in the research and \ndevelopment accounts to develop the advanced technologies our troops \nwill use to maintain their technological superiority over their \nadversaries. Significantly, conferees authorized $11.2 billion for the \ncritical science and technology programs which brings us close to the \ngoal of setting aside 3 percent of the defense budget to invest in the \n``seed corn'' of our future military capability.\n  Much of that S investment will be executed at universities and \ncolleges throughout America. For example, the University of Maine \nsystem has been on the forefront of the development of advanced \nengineered wood structures and composites. The bill provides funds so \nthe university can develop the advanced lightweight structures the Army \nneeds to meet the requirement to establish forward operating bases for \nour expeditionary forces in the far-flung regions of the world.\n  In addition, this bill also authorizes continued research at the \nUniversity of Maine into the structural reliability of fiber-reinforced \npolymers composites in ship assemblies that will help define and \nultimately control the significant property variations found composite \nplates used in Navy ship construction.\n\n[[Page S10953]]\n\n  I am deeply disappointed that the House provision to delay the 2005 \nBRAC round by 2 years was not maintained in this bill because I believe \nfervently that closing domestic bases at a time we are engaged in a \nglobal war is not in the best interests of our Nation.\n  During the Senate debate on the fiscal year 2005 authorization bill, \nI and my colleagues, Senators Lott, Dorgan and Feinstein offered an \namendment that would have delayed the 2005 Base Realignment and Closing \nProcess, BRAC, for 2 years in order to focus on a closing process for \nour overseas military installations because we believed that the Nation \nmust reassess its current overseas force structure and adjust it to \nmeet the threats of today. Unfortunately, our amendment was narrowly \ndefeated by a vote of 47 to 49.\n  Since then, the President has announced a force restructuring that \nincludes the closure of several overseas military facilities and a \nredeployment of troops and assets back to the United States. This is \nexactly the reason we offered our amendment and I continue to strongly \nbelieve that until our global defense posture is defined and our \nforeign basing requirements are thoroughly understood, closing our \ndomestic bases is premature and ill-advised.\n  Finally, and most importantly, the bill continues our commitment to \nthe men and women in the armed forces and their families through the \nenactment of several important pay and benefits provisions. First, it \nincludes an across-the-board pay raise of 3.5 percent for all military \npersonnel. It also contains a number of provisions that will directly \naid the families of service members. For example, the bill removed the \nexisting funding limitations on the military housing privatization \nauthorities, which will allow the military services to continue to \npartner with the private sector to provide the highest quality housing \nfor military members and their families in the shortest amount of time.\n  This authorization rightly recognizes that our Reservists and \nNational Guard troops play an increasingly vital role in the war on \nterrorism, and extends to them expanded benefits in critical areas such \nas medical care and special pay rates. The bill approves permanent \neligibility for up to 90 days of TRICARE coverage for Reserve members \nand their families prior to mobilization, and 180 days of transitional \nhealth benefits for Reserves, active duty members, and their families \nwhen the member separates from active duty service. It also authorizes \na new program of educational assistance to members of the Selected \nReserve, providing varying amounts of aid depending on the length of \ntime they were mobilized.\n  Overall, this authorization provides the men and women of our armed \nforces with the equipment they need to accomplish their mission, the \nquality of life they have earned and security for their families. For \nthese reasons, I support this legislation and urge my colleagues to \npass this conference report unanimously because in a time when our \nNation is facing unprecedented security challenges and dangers, we can \ndo no less.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as chair of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I express my views on the Conference \nReport for H.R. 4200, the fiscal year 2005 DOD Authorization Act. \nDefense authorization legislation typically contains a variety of \nprovisions pertaining to government contracting, and these provisions \nhave a significant impact on the ability of small firms to compete for \nFederal procurement dollars. Small businesses will find that this \nreport contains both positive and negative provisions.\n  First, I express my deep disappointment with the decision of the \nConference Committee to remove from the act the legislative language \nrequiring consideration of small business interests by the Office of \nFederal Procurement Policy's advisory panel on reform of government \ncontract laws, extending the panel's term, and specifically requiring \nthe panel to reports its findings to the Congressional small business \ncommittees. I originally proposed this language as Senate Amendment No. \n3273. It was adopted unanimously by the Senate and codified in Section \n805 of the DOD Authorization Act.\n  The work of this advisory panel, like its predecessor panels, is \ncritical to the long-range direction of acquisition reforms. This \npanel, authorized by Section 1423 of the fiscal year 2004 National \nDefense Authorization Act, was to emphasize the study of commercial \npractices, performance-based contracting, the performance of \nacquisition functions across agency lines of responsibility, and the \nuse of Governmentwide contracts. In making appointments to the panel, \nthe administrator for Federal Procurement Policy was required to \nconsult the agency heads as well as the House and Senate Armed Services \nCommittees, Governmental Affairs Committee, and House Government Reform \nCommittees. The panel's authorizing legislation required it to prepare \na written report with recommendations and to submit this report to \nthese named Committees along with the Office of Federal Procurement \nPolicy Administrator, or OFPP.\n  Curiously, the panel's mandate was silent with regards to small \nbusiness contracting, even though the Federal Government is committed \nby law to the goal of awarding 23 percent of all prime contracts to \nsmall businesses. My amendment, as adopted by the Senate, responded to \nthis glaring omission by extending the panel's reporting period, \nrequiring the panel to make recommendations on assuring small business \nparticipation in Government contracting, and directing the panel to \nsubmit its report to the House and Senate Small Business Committees.\n  Because of President Bush's strong support for small business \ncontractors, the policies of Section 805 had solid backing from the \nadministration. Over the summer, I wrote to the White House and \nrequested that small businesses be represented both in the composition \nand in the work of this panel. In reply, OFPP Acting Administrator \nRobert Burton responded that, ``Based on your suggestion, I will ensure \nthat senior level representation from the Small Business Administration \nwill serve on the panel. Moreover the Office of Federal Procurement \nPolicy will request the panel to specifically address small business \ncontracting and subcontracting issues.''\n  Some recent changes to Federal procurement laws have had the effect \nof decreasing competition, accountability, and transparency in the \nprocurement process while increasing the barriers to entry faced by \nsmall business contractors. Section 805 was designed to address this \nunfortunate trend, and I believe it should not have been removed.\n  I am particularly disappointed the conference report contradicts the \npublic position of the administration that small business interests \ndeserve consideration in formulating Federal procurement reforms by the \nOffice of Federal Procurement Policy advisory panel. However, let me be \nclear: the Conference Committee's decision to remove Section 805 does \nnot overrule the commitment of the OFPP administrator and does not \nprevent the Senate Small Business Committee from closely monitoring the \nwork of the panel and holding in-depth oversight hearings on its \nreport.\n  In addition, I find unfortunate the choice to permit exemption of the \nentire landscaping and pest control industries from the application of \nthe Small Business Act. Adoption of this provision was not marked up by \neither the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship or \nthe House Committee on Small Business.\n  I also regret the conference committee's decision not to authorize \ntransitional counseling on federal procurement opportunities at the DOD \nand the Department of Veterans Affairs facilities. Our veterans, \nespecially service-disabled veterans, deserve immediate assistance. \nHowever, I am encouraged that the Conference Committee directed the \nComptroller General to conduct a study on this subject. I am also very \npleased that HUBZone and service-disabled veteran-owned small \nbusinesses can now participate in the DOD Mentor-Protege Program, \npreserved the parity between the small business reserve threshold and \nthe simplified acquisition threshold in future threshold adjustments \nfor inflation, limited the period of multi-year task order contracts to \n10 years, protected small businesses engaged in the DOD satellite \nprocurement against arbitrary changes, and refused to adopt changes to \nsource selection criteria which may have favored large businesses over \nsmall contractors.\n\n[[Page S10954]]\n\n  In conclusion, I again commend President Bush and Acting OFPP \nAdministrator Burton for the administration's continued steadfast \nsupport of small business-friendly procurement policies. I look forward \nto continuing to work closely with the Office of Federal Procurement \nPolicy.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to \nSenators Warner and Levin for their expert guidance for moving this \nhuge piece of legislation through the Congress. This will now go to the \nPresident of the United States.\n  One of the provisions in this legislation is so important to me--more \nimportant to 40,000 100-percent disabled Americans. Those who are 100-\npercent disabled will receive the concurrent receipts immediately. We \nhad a 10-year phaseout. That will no longer be the case.\n  That was not easy, but it is really wonderful because, first of all, \nthose 40,000 are either disabled, unable to work at all and, frankly, \nthe vast majority of them may not live 10 years to receive their \nbenefits. This is so important that these most dedicated members of our \narmed services, who are 100-percent disabled, will receive these \nbenefits immediately.\n  I appreciate very much the work of the chairman and ranking member, \nSenator Levin.\n  I also want to express my appreciation to Senator Harkin. Senator \nHarkin basically had a hold on the work we do around here, meaning he \nwas going to slow everything up. Senator Harkin is a veteran himself. \nHe understands that this is not something which needs to be held up.\n  I want the Record to be spread with the appreciation of the four \nleaders for Senator Harkin's cooperation in this matter to allow this \nbill to go to the President right now.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join in that. Senator Harkin was \nactually a Naval aviator. We have discussed that distinguished part of \nhis career many times.\n  I thank the distinguished senior Senator from Nevada. He very quietly \nworks on issues. I can remember a year ago we stood in this well when \nwe weren't able to achieve that goal, the distinguished Senator from \nNevada himself--I think Senator McCain was very active and Senator \nLevin. We said: All right. This year we can't get it, but next year we \nwill. Through the Senator's absolute resolute determination that was \naccomplished. He did it for a category of veterans who are well \ndeserved of this recognition by the Congress and the American people \nfor their services.\n  I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/09/senate-section/article/S10954-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10954-S10957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TECHNICAL CORRECTION IN ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 4200\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I believe this has been cleared on both \nsides.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H. Con. Res. 514, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 514) directing the \n     Clerk of the House of Representatives to make a technical \n     correction in the enrollment of the bill H.R. 4200.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the concurrent \nresolution be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the concurrent resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 514) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Alaska, \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair.\n  The House passed the military construction appropriations bill as \nwell as the homeland security bill. No one voted against the bills. The \nfirst one was 374-0 and the second was 368-0.\n  Military construction contains $2.8 billion for the drought and $11.6 \nbillion for disasters which includes the hurricanes. This bill affects \nall our States with farms that are suffering from the drought and it \nhelps states like Florida and Alabama that were in the path of the \nhurricanes. FEMA will likely run out of money tonight, Saturday, \nOctober 9.\n  On October 1 FEMA had $836 million which included a $500 million \ncarryover from FY 2004 and a $336 million apportionment under the \ncontinuing resolution. That means they get 51 days worth of cash since \nthe CR takes us through November 20. But FEMA tells me that they burn \nthrough this money at approximately $65 million to $79 million a day. \nThe balance in the disaster, fund yesterday, Friday, October 8, was \nonly $150 million. The fund runs dry tonight.\n  It is true they can re-apportion under the CR, which means they can \ntransfer funds from other areas but it will have to be taken from \nplaces like our Federal air marshals, air cargo inspections, port \nsecurity, and more.\n  On homeland, many believe we will be attacked before the election. \nThere is a continuing resolution in affect until November 20 but \ngetting this bill increases much of the effort we are making to protect \nthe United States.\n  It also has new programs that cannot be started until we pass this \nbill. Some of the program I refer to are radiations detection, aviation \nsecurity technology, border surveillance, additional detention and \nremoval programs. Getting more screeners at airports is on hold. All \nfirst responder grant allocations would be put on hold.\n  The Coast Guard will not be able to re-engine the HH-65 helicopter \nfor at least 6 months, causing the Coast Guard to continue to \nexperience alarming rates of engine failures. At current funding \nlevels, there are insufficient funds to support the Coast Guard's \nincreased force presence in Iraq port security units, patrol boats, and \nsecurity forces on oil rigs.\n  Cargo screening will remain only at current levels--we will forgo a \ntripling of cargo screening on passenger aircraft. Research and \ndevelopment of new technologies for cargo security will be delayed.\n  TSA will not hire replacement screeners to fill vacancies at \nairports, causing longer lines at airports, particularly around the \nholiday period. TSA will delay airport modifications to install \nexplosive detection devices to screen for explosives in carry-on \nbaggage as recommended by the 9/11 Commission.\n\n  The department will not be able to hire additional Federal air \nmarshals, FAMs and, in fact, may have to lay off FAMs that they have on \nstaff, up to 500.\n  This bill includes significant increases in the intelligence \ncapabilities of the department. A continuing resolution will prevent \nthat expansion from taking place leaving the nation at risk.\n  Under a continuing resolution the Transportation Security \nAdministration has very little funding for rail and transit security. \nAll of the additional funding available for inspectors, canine teams, \nresearch and other activities is in the fiscal year 2005 appropriation. \nNone of the additional funding for letters of intent for airport \nsecurity modifications will be available.\n  Seven hundred and ninety-two new Coast Guard personnel will not be \nhired to enforce maritime security plans.\n  It prevents interoperable communications and personal protective \nequipment from reaching rural and smaller communities.\n  Fire departments will remain critically understaffed without the \nimplementation of the SAFER Act.\n  The biowatch program will not be expanded in major urban areas, \naffecting our ability to detect the release of biological agents in the \nair.\n  It stops the procurement of 250 additional radiation detection/\ninspection systems.\n  It delays procurement of border surveillance systems to monitor and \ndefend U.S. borders.\n  It delays Container Security Initiative, CSI needed to stay on \nschedule to add up 22 more ports to existing 25.\n  It delays establishment of fugitive operation teams and hinders \nimmigration enforcement--limiting detention and arrest operations of \ncriminal alien\n\n[[Page S10955]]\n\nfugitives and hindering our ability to keep jailed aliens from being \nreleased into our communities.\n  It delays staffing up for overseas operations to ensure no visas are \ngranted to foreign visitors who pose a security risk.\n  It delays adding 750 beds to hold alien detainees, allowing 5,000 \ndeportable aliens to stay in our communities.\n  It delays support to reduce the backlog in immigration prosecutions.\n  Delaying the bill delay this Nation's security. Delaying the bill \ndelays help to those that are suffering from the after-affects of \nnumerous hurricanes. Delaying the bill will delay much needed drought \nassistance.\n  Mr. President, I am here because the Military Construction \nappropriations bill, as well as Homeland Security appropriations bill, \nhas passed the House. Both of them have passed the House. I know we are \nnot supposed to talk about the vote over there, particularly about how \nmany people voted. But I think we can say consistent with the rules \nthat each one of these bills was passed unanimously with not one single \nopponent. Why? Because the Military Construction bill contains $2.8 \nbillion to the drought program and $11.6 billion for the disasters, \nparticularly those relating to the hurricanes in the Florida area.\n  This bill will affect all of the States that have farms that are \nsuffering from drought. It certainly helps the Florida area and \nAlabama--particularly in the path of those hurricanes.\n  But the reason I have come to the floor now to talk to the Senate is \nI was reliably informed this afternoon that FEMA runs out of money \ntonight.\n  I want to say that again. I hope Senators will listen. FEMA runs out \nof money tonight. There will be no more payments made in Florida or \nAlabama. I am told people down there are living in tents. The \ntemperature is rising. They are being given buckets of ice to try to \nkeep cool. They have patients being moved from medical facilities. They \nare in temporary quarters.\n  This is probably the worst series of storms in the history of this \ncountry.\n  On October 1, FEMA had $836 million. That included a $500 million \ncarryover from 2004, and they were allocated $336 million under the \ncontinuing resolution we passed that expires November 20.\n  As of tonight, that money is gone. This really is an emergency now.\n  We have been delayed for one reason or another as we tried to get \nthese bills passed. There were riders offered on the bill in both \nHouses. We tried to work those out in conference. I know there are some \npeople who are disturbed about some of the riders that weren't \nincluded. These were legislative riders that did not pertain to the \nbills themselves, and there are some that were accepted.\n  But we have to get this bill done and to the President as quickly as \npossible.\n  This covers everything you can think about in terms of the Homeland \nSecurity bill--Federal air marshals, air cargo inspections, port \nsecurity.\n  As I said, we have a continuing resolution in effect until November \n20. As far as the FEMA money, it is gone.\n  I think we have an absolute obligation to these people who are \nproviding the security for this country to see to it that they get \ntheir money on time.\n  We were unable to get these bills done by the end of the fiscal year, \nwhich was September 30, because we had no budget resolution.\n  We have been working against all sorts of impediments in the \nappropriations process this year.\n  We have a number of things in this bill that are absolutely \nnecessary.\n  We have funds for the Coast Guard, for instance. Many people don't \nrealize the Coast Guard has a presence in Iraq. They have port security \nunits and patrol boats. They have security forces near the oil rigs \nover there. They are part of our forces over there. They still also \nhave this enormous problem in the United States. They need to increase \nmoney.\n\n  The continuing resolution continues all of these agencies at the \nlevel of money approved by Congress in 2003 for the 2004 period. This \nis the first quarter of 2005.\n  The money is for cargo screening. That level of demand has increased. \nWe forego a tripling of cargo screening on passenger aircraft by virtue \nof the bill that was passed.\n  We have enormous demands now by the Transportation Security Agency to \nfill vacancies in airports. There will be longer lines at airports if \nwe don't get this money out to them.\n  The Department also has the Federal air marshals. I am told that they \nmay have to lay off up to 500 Federal air marshals because they are \ntraveling under that continuing resolution. Their moneys are allocated \non the basis of what we thought was necessary in the fall of 2003. This \nis money for 2005. It must start now.\n  Again, I don't understand why we can't vote tonight. The House took \nup these bills and passed them within 2 hours. Each one passed the \nHouse within 2 hours because they recognized the need for this money.\n  Now I am told we may not vote until Monday or Tuesday on these bills. \nI am sort of aggravated. These bills are necessary.\n  I would like to identify the people who are objecting to passage of \nthese bills tonight. I hope they come to the floor and defend \nthemselves.\n  I sat in the Chair and presided over the Senate this morning, and I \nheard the distinguished minority leader say we cannot leave until these \nbills pass. We cannot go into recess and go back for the election \nprocess until these bills are passed. That should be the bipartisan \nposition of this Senate.\n  Forget these minute details about antagonism because some person's \nego has been bruised because we have not done exactly what they want on \nthese bills. We all have to be bigger than that.\n  It is time to pass these bills. These delays on this bill affect \nnational security. There is no question that homeland security is the \nsecond line of defense now. Our first line of defense is protecting our \nperimeter. But we have national security as No. 1. We spent weeks on \nthe Homeland Security bill. Now we are refusing to provide the money \nwhich we came to total agreement on which they need for next year. It \nis being delayed. I don't understand that at all.\n  I particularly don't understand why any Member in the Senate is \nopposing these bills when it was unanimously approved. Not one voice \nwas raised against these bills in the other House. We represent the \nsame constituents. On what basis does anyone want to oppose these \nbills, either for the hurricane, military construction, or Homeland \nSecurity? I am standing ready. Anyone who wants to debate them, I will \nbe here all night. I want these bills passed. They have to pass. There \nis no reason why they should not pass.\n\n  I am pleased to explain any portion of these bills to any Member \ntonight, but I don't know why we can't come here and vote for these \nbills. Someone is objecting somewhere and I would like to find out who \nit is because I think the whole world--I hope someone is watching, \nanyway--will ask why. Why can't we do what the House did and approve \nthe bills after such hard work we put in? As I said, it has been \ntotally bipartisan. Not one word in the House from either party was \nraised against these bills.\n  I will be back.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I agree with the distinguished chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee. It is a catastrophic failure not to take \ncare of these problems. I salute the chairman for making the statement \nhe made and for the leadership he has provided in this Senate. We all \nknow what a feisty, wonderful man he is. I hope we can get this \nresolved. I hope whoever has these objections will identify himself or \nherself and why they are making the objections.\n  I listened to the statement of the Senator from Massachusetts this \nafternoon, and to hear him you would think we are living in the most \ncalamitous times in the history of the world, that our country is \nfalling apart, that we are not employing people, that people are \ngetting poorer, and nobody has a chance in our society anymore, all \nbecause George W. Bush became President of the United States. It is \namazing to me how many comments are made by people who are in the \nbusiness of politicizing these matters rather than talking sensibly \nabout them.\n  Think about it, we lost over a million jobs shortly after September \n11. Lost them. September 11 was the reason.\n\n[[Page S10956]]\n\nThat was no fault of President Bush. That was the fault of the people \nwho attacked our country. Over 1.9 million jobs have been created since \nAugust of 2003. We now have the lowest unemployment rate in the last 4 \nor 5 years, 5.4 percent. When I was chairman of the Labor Committee, if \nyou could get unemployment below 6 percent, if you got it to 5.6 \npercent, you had full employment. When you count those who cannot work, \nthose who don't need to work, and those who won't work, you basically \nhad full employment. 5.4 percent is incredibly low by historical \nstandards.\n  I might add that the Household Employment Survey shows 2.2 million \njobs have been created, many more jobs than shown in the Payroll \nSurvey. This is because the Household Survey counts the self-employed \nand the Payroll Survey does not. We have the highest rate of home \nownership in history, which has been developed during this \nadministration. I can go on and on. The fact of the matter is we can \nplay politics with about everything in this overheated political \ncampaign.\n  Since September 11, the employment rate peaked at 6.3 percent last \nyear and has come down to 5.4 percent. The current 5.4 percent rate is \nwell below the average rates of the 1970s, the 1980s, and the 1990s. \nSome have said the job growth has failed to keep up with population \ngrowth. That is simply not true. Since last June, total employment has \nincreased by 2.2 million. The labor force has increased by 949,000. \nUnemployment has fallen by 1.2 million people.\n  In addition, we hear all the time how people are not making a good \nliving. Let's be honest. In some respects we have priced ourselves out \nof the marketplace with some of the heavy-duty industries, and we know \nthere are many reasons why that happens, and that goods and services \nare being produced elsewhere at a lower cost, and this benefits the \nconsumers of America. The consumers of America then have more money and \nthey will be spending more so we can create other businesses that will \ncompete.\n\n  The fact of the matter is, I have listened to these complaints about \nthe labor overtime regulations that the Secretary of Labor worked on. I \nhappened to have chatted with her during that process and she was doing \nan absolutely wonderful job of trying to make sure we got more people \neligible to receive overtime pay than ever before. But to listen to \nsome on the other side, you would think the whole world was coming to \nan end and the fact is she has come up with very good regulations.\n  We could talk about these things all day, and I guess anyone can \ndistort any statistical analysis. There is a lot of distortion that \ngoes on in this Senate from time to time in these matters. Of course, \nwe are in a heated Presidential election campaign and I have to say I \nmake a certain allowance for that, but I hope the folks out there \nwatching make an allowance for that as well, because we have a lot of \nheated rhetoric in the Senate that sometimes does not make sense.\n  I intend to speak about three different things today and I ask \nunanimous consent my respective remarks be placed in the appropriate \ncontext.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Justice for All Act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I come to the Senate to discuss H.R. 5107, \nthe Justice For All Act that the Senate adopted this morning. After \ndays, months, and now years of hard-fought negotiations, we finally \nreached an agreement on one of the most significant bills that has come \nout of the 108th Congress.\n  Just days ago, the House passed H.R. 5107 by an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote of 393-14. I especially commend my friends and \ncolleagues, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Jim Sensenbrenner \nfrom Wisconsin and Congressman Bill Delahunt of Massachusetts, for \ntheir leadership on this important bill. Nor could we have accomplished \nthis matter without the cooperation and leadership of my friend from \nVermont, Senator Patrick Leahy. As we know, the Senate adopted this \nbill this morning and we are pleased to send it to the President for \nhis signature.\n  Our bill, the Justice for All Act, contains President Bush's DNA \ninitiative. It also contains Senator Leahy's Innocence Protection Act \nwhich has been modified by almost everyone on the committee, and \nSenators Kyl and Feinstein's victims' rights legislation. This is a \ngroundbreaking crime bill, one of the most important in history, that \nwill allow us to unleash the power of evidentiary DNA and help provide \nlaw enforcement the ability to find and punish the guilty, yet give us \nthe comfort of more certainty in criminal prosecution.\n  Passage of the bill is extremely important to people such as Debbie \nSmith and Kirk Bloodsworth after whom individual parts of the bill are \nnamed. March 3, 1989, Debbie Smith--who I know very well--was the \nvictim of a brutal rape in Williamsburg, Virginia. It took 6 long years \nto finally analyze Debbie Smith's rape kit. Debbie Smith's rapist was \nultimately caught because of this, but it took far too long to catch \nhim.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Justice, a woman is raped every 6 \nminutes in this country and many rapists commit this crime 8 to 10 \ntimes before they are caught, which means that at any given moment \nthere are literally millions of rape survivors waiting to hear that \ntheir attacker has been apprehended.\n  Debbie Smith waited 6 agonizing years for justice to be served. It \nwas not just waiting for justice to be served; it was agonizing because \nshe was never sure when she walked out of her house or even within her \nhouse whether this brutal rapist would return. It was something that \naffected her all of those years. Thankfully, through the use of DNA \nevidence, this awful person was apprehended and slammed in jail, where \nhe deserves to be.\n  Some women are not that fortunate. The Justice Department reports \nthere are approximately 150,000 to 500,000 rape kits nationwide that \nhave yet to be analyzed because law enforcement officials are short on \nboth the funds and the skilled personnel necessary to process these \nrape kits and match the evidence collected to existing DNA samples of \nknown criminals. Imagine how many rapists we would have caught by now \nhad those up to 500,000 rape kits been analyzed. By the way, some of \nthose are 20 years old. I have been fighting for this bill for years. \nIt is so difficult to get it through, but today is the day it has gone \nthrough the Senate and has passed the House.\n  This bill makes a giant leap in the rape kit backlog and specifies \nwhen and how DNA tests should and should not be used. The President has \noften indicated his commitment to unlocking the power of DNA to solve \nthese crimes. Today the Senate has joined the House in stepping up to \nfollow through with the President's plan.\n\n  It cannot be said any better than in Debbie Smith's own words:\n\n       Each one of these stalled cases represents women's lives. \n     Many women are paralyzed after an attack because their rapist \n     is still out there, and you never know if he's going to come \n     back.\n\n  Now, this bill will not take away the pain and anguish these victims \nhave endured. It can, however, allow for health care professionals, law \nenforcement, and other first responders to assist victims by using the \nevidentiary power of DNA to apprehend and prosecute those responsible \nfor these horrible crimes.\n  This bill was too important to be delayed any longer. As so many of \nmy colleagues, I am well aware of the incomparable power of DNA testing \nto solve crimes, particularly sexual assault. This fact is reflected in \nnewspaper headlines spread across the country each week. During the \nweek of August 16 alone, the media reported that DNA evidence \npinpointed a suspect in three rapes in Miami, FL, caused a man to be \ncharged in a 20-year-old Missouri rape case, and proved critical in \nconvicting a New York man accused of committing nine rapes over the \ncourse of a decade.\n  That is what DNA can do. If we had all these rape cases analyzed, we \nwould be catching these rapists right and left and we would be \nprotecting women all over this country from this type of violent, \ncriminal activity in many cases. So I want to stand here and thank \nDebbie Smith from the bottom of my heart for her constant efforts to \nhelp us pass this bill. I have known her for\n\n[[Page S10957]]\n\na long time. We have flown together. She has appeared at our hearings. \nShe is leading the fight throughout America, along with a number of \nother very courageous women. This has to be a very important day for \nher.\n  When this bill is finally signed into law by our President, who will \nsign it into law, it is going to be a big day for the Debbie Smiths of \nthis world and, I might add, every woman in this world who is the \npotential target of these vicious rapists.\n  Also contained in this bill are provisions that will give us \nassurance that those whom we arrest and convict are indeed those who \nhave committed the crime. Kirk Bloodsworth, a former marine with no \ncriminal background whatsoever, was arrested in 1984 for the brutal \nrape and murder of 9-year-old Dawn Hamilton on Maryland's Eastern \nShore. Kirk Bloodsworth maintained his innocence but was convicted and \nsentenced to death. After 9 years in prison, two of them on death row, \nKirk Bloodsworth, an innocent man, was exonerated by post-conviction \nDNA testing. Last year, prosecutors matched the DNA evidence in the \ncase to another man, who subsequently pleaded guilty to the crime, for \nwhich he was sentenced to death.\n  This is the power of DNA when it is used and analyzed properly. I \nwant to stand here and thank Kirk Bloodsworth from the bottom of my \nheart for his efforts to improve and pass this bill. The bill will help \nto protect unintentional victims of the criminal justice system.\n  I think we all owe a debt of gratitude to Kirk Bloodsworth. One \nreason I have stayed around here all day, although there are no more \nvotes, is to be able to stand on this floor and personally pay tribute \nto Debbie Smith and Kirk Bloodsworth. They deserve it. They have been \nwith us throughout this process, and I have nothing but respect for \nboth of them.\n  Moreover, this bill includes Senator Kyl's and Senator Feinstein's \ncritical Crime Victims Act that ensures victims rights are protected in \ncriminal prosecutions. This bill is truly justice for all.\n  It is an important bill, and they fought for this for years and \nyears, and we helped them to get it out of committee. I am so grateful \nit was matched with the DNA bill, and we now have these two bills \nbrought together in one bill that will do a great deal of good for our \nsociety.\n\n  Finally, let me say I am grateful for the hard work and determination \nof so many people to get such a vital bill passed.\n  I thank my cosponsors of this bill. First, let me thank my good \nfriend from Vermont, Senator Leahy, for his commitment and willingness \nto set aside politics in a very political year and work with me to get \nsuch a critical bill passed.\n  I also want to recognize and specifically thank Senator Biden, \nSenator Specter, Senator Feinstein, and Senator DeWine for their \ncalming voices of wisdom throughout the negotiations, our difficult \ncommittee markup, and in the final preparations to achieve a properly \nbalanced bill. Without their unwavering support and counsel, this bill \nwould not have occurred.\n  I also thank the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jim \nSensenbrenner, and Representative Delahunt for their dogged \ndetermination on the House side in leading the House in passing this \nbill through the House on two occasions by overwhelming majorities.\n  I have worked side by side with Chairman Sensenbrenner on many \noccasions. He is a true friend and he is a man of his word. I am \npleased to have had the opportunity to work closely with Congressman \nDelahunt on this measure, and I can tell you, he is a man of honor and \nwisdom. I have enjoyed working with him. I will look forward to working \nwith both of them again in the future.\n  I also want to make special mention that without the thorough \nconsideration of this bill by Senators Kyl, Sessions, and Cornyn, we \nwould not be here today. Nearly two dozen changes were addressed and \nimplemented at the insisting of these fine Senators, and this bill is a \nbetter bill because of it. And I have to admit, they have helped to \nimprove the bill.\n  At times the process through the committee was a bit tension filled, \nbut I commend Senators Kyl, Sessions, and Cornyn for working to improve \nand refine this legislation. Some have unfairly criticized their \nefforts, but that is only because these critics apparently do not \nunderstand the committee process. I commend these colleagues and all of \nmy colleagues for giving this bill the scrutiny it deserves.\n  Now, let me say that many have worked to make this bill a successful \neffort. We could not get much done around here if we did not have such \nan intelligent and dedicated staff. I want to thank those on my staff, \nincluding Reed O'Conner and Ted Lehman, for their commitment and \ndedication in getting this bill done. I especially want to single out \nBrett Tolman, a bright, young assistant U.S. attorney from Salt Lake \nCity who is on assignment to the Judiciary Committee. We are fortunate \nto have him, and he has made a tremendous difference on this bill. \nBrett took the initiative for undertaking a lot of the analysis and \nnegotiations that led to the final compromise language.\n  I am proud of him, and I think everybody else ought to be, too.\n  I want to thank Senator Leahy's chief counsel Bruce Cohen and his \nlead counsel on this issue, Julie Katzman. Their efforts helped guide \nand drive this effort throughout and are greatly appreciated. We are \nalso indebted to chief counsel Neil MacBride, Jon Meyer, and Louisa \nTerrell from Senator Biden's office. They continuously helped move the \nball forward.\n  I give special thanks to Rob Steinbuch, a senior counsel in Senator \nDeWine's Judiciary Committee office. Rob and Brett Tolman were key \nplayers on our side of the aisle in educating Members and staff about \nthis bill and proposing creative solutions to problems that surfaced.\n\n  I also thank Joe Matal, William Smith, and Chip Roy, who ably \nrepresented the views of, respectively, Senators Kyl, Sessions, and \nCornyn.\n  On the House side, Phil Kiko, chief counsel for Chairman \nSensenbrenner, Jay Apperson, Katy Crooks, and Christine Leonard were \ninstrumental in building the overwhelming support for this bill.\n  As well, I give special thanks to Matt McGhie and Bill Jensen from \nlegislative counsel. On this type of bill it is critical to get the \nlanguage exactly right, and they did so time and time again.\n  The list of contributors could go on and on because so many private \nand governmental organizations have also provided critical assistance.\n  Let me also say, while I had to get a little rough with the Justice \nDepartment--and I am still not over it--I am, nonetheless, grateful for \ntheir help in coming to compromises and getting this bill in acceptable \nform. I call upon Attorney General Ashcroft to urge the President to \nsign this good bill, and to do it quickly.\n  I thank the leadership, Majority Leader Frist and Senator McConnell, \nas well as Minority Leader Daschle and Senator Reid for giving us floor \ntime to get this done today.\n  Most of all, I am pleased to send to the President a bill that will \nmake such a difference in the lives of victims of crime, including \nthose wrongly accused or convicted of crimes across this country.\n  This bill passed 393 to 14 over in the House. We amended it in many \nways to make it a far better bill because of the work of all of these \npeople I have been chatting about. I have to say that it passed \nunanimously by the Senate today. This body sent that version back over \nto the House, and I am pleased to report that they took it up and \npassed it so that it may be sent to the President for his signature.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/09/senate-section/article/S10957-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10957-S10967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                FSC/ETI\n\n  Madam President, I rise in strong support of the conference report \nfor the American Jobs Creation Act. Before we leave, we have to pass \nthis bill to protect domestic manufacturers, strengthen our economy, \nbetter help our U.S.-based multinational firms compete globally, and \nhonor our trade obligations.\n  I congratulate the chairman and cochairman of the conference, \nCongressman Bill Thomas and Senator Chuck Grassley, for completing the \nbill this week.\n  Many thought the task would be difficult or impossible given the \nlarge differences in the two versions and the\n\n[[Page S10958]]\n\ntime constraints we in the conference faced. This could have taken many \nweeks--or even failed--yet they got it done.\n  The innovative conference process developed by the chairman and \ncochairman made success possible. Conferencing a large and diverse pair \nof tax bills in the usual fashion could have taken many weeks and led \nto a likely failure to finish this bill before sine die adjournment of \nthe 108th Congress. Again, I want to recognize the extraordinary \nachievement of this conference committee and thank its leaders and my \nfellow conferees for their hard and dedicated work.\n  Mr. President, this conference report represents what we hope will be \nthe culmination of a very lengthy and fascinating issue that had its \ngenesis decades ago but has festered into a growing problem over the \npast several years.\n  I will leave to others to go into detail about the long history of \nthe export subsidies in our tax law that gave rise to this conference \nreport, but the unusual nature of this bill and its difficulty in \npassing the Congress are reflections of the complexity of this issue.\n  The crux of the difficulty of the bill is that the rulings of the \nWorld Trade Organization on the trade-legality of our export tax \nsubsidies put the Congress in a very tough position. In essence, we \nfound ourselves needing to repeal these export subsidies, known as the \nForeign Sales Corporation (FSC) provision and its replacement regime \nknown as the Extraterritorial Income (ETI) exclusion.\n  By repealing these provisions, which we must do in order to honor our \ntrade obligations, we effectively raise taxes by almost $6 billion per \nyear on thousands of U.S. businesses that manufacture goods for export.\n  Leaving it at this, Mr. President, is simply unacceptable. Why should \nwe have to convert a provision designed to help U.S. manufacturers \ncompete in an ever-increasingly difficult global marketplace to a \nsituation where they suffer a competitive disadvantage?\n  Yet, this is exactly the problem the Congress faces now that it is \nforced to repeal the export tax benefits.\n  When confronted with a similar problem in 2000 after the WTO ruled \nthe FSC provision to be in violation of international trade rules, \nCongress passed the ETI in its place. With the ETI, we were able \nlargely to replicate the benefits of the FSC regime, so that exporting \ntaxpayers paid few if any extra taxes with the repeal of FSC. \nUnfortunately, the WTO subsequently ruled that the ETI provision also \nwas an illegal trade subsidy that also must be repealed.\n  So, the conundrum facing the Congress with this situation was to find \na way to enact other tax cut benefits for exporting manufacturers, to \noffset the increase from repealing ETI, without violating the WTO \nrules.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, this has proven impossible, so both the \nSenate and House bills attempted to find rough justice for business \ntaxpayers by finding other ways to deliver tax benefits besides basing \nthem on exports. Such attempts gave rise to the political and practical \ndifficulties of this bill, including the fact that it took many months \nof hard effort to reach the point we are today.\n  For example, my own bill to address the FSC/ETI problem was S. 1475, \nthe Promote Growth and Jobs in the USA Act, which I introduced in July \n2003. This bill would have delivered rough justice tax relief in two \nways.\n  First, it would simplify and rationalize the international tax rules \nthat currently harm the ability of U.S. firms to compete globally, and \nsecond, it would provide incentives for companies to increase their \nability to produce goods by acquiring new equipment and engaging in \nmore research and development.\n  Other FSC/ETI solution bills were also introduced. On the same day I \nintroduced S. 1475, Chairman Thomas introduced H.R. 2896, the American \nJobs Creation Act. The two bills were similar in many ways, and both \nincluded international tax reforms. The Thomas bill, however, included \na number of other provisions designed to help U.S. businesses create \njobs and better compete.\n  Another bill, introduced last year by Congressmen Crane, Rangel, and \nManzullo, offered a different direction still. This bill provided a \ndeduction equal to 10 percent of a company's production activities.\n  In the Senate, Senators Grassley and Baucus introduced a bill that \nincluded some of the best elements of all the other bills. Even though \nI preferred the solution set forth in my bill, I cosponsored the \nGrassley-Baucus bill because it represents a solid and reasonable \nsolution to the problem. This bill, as modified, became the legislation \nreported by the Finance Committee and passed by the Senate.\n  After a great deal of travail and adjustments, the House also passed \na FSC/ETI bill, and it was quite similar in many respects to the first \nThomas American Jobs Creation Act. These are the bills the conference \ncommittee had to combine into one.\n  Madam President, I know that you and your colleague, Congressman \nBurr, and others from North California and South Carolina and all over \nthe South have worked long and hard. Also, Senator McConnell, Senator \nBunning and others from Kentucky have long worked to try to resolve \nthese problems. I want to pay tribute to you folks for bringing this \nabout. You deserve a lot of credit. Let's hope we can pass this bill.\n  I admit it is not everything that some wanted it to be, but it is \ncertainly a step in the right direction, and it wouldn't have occurred \nexcept for the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, Mrs. Dole, \nCongressman Burr, and others who have carried this ball very \neffectively up through this point.\n  I hope that we do not filibuster this bill. I hope nobody will \nfilibuster this bill because it is a bill that just has to pass. If it \ndoes, much of the credit should go to the people I have just mentioned. \nThere are others as well who should be mentioned. I don't mean to leave \nthem out. But those in particular I know have been working assiduously \non this for many years.\n  The result, as we know, is a bill that is far from perfect. Its \nenactment will result in a net tax increase for some exporting \ncompanies that now use the ETI provision, and in a net tax cut for many \nother U.S. manufacturing firms that may have not taken advantage of the \nETI exclusion.\n  And while the bill includes many important other provisions, it \nleaves out some very important provisions that I advocated. For \nexample, I am personally very disappointed that the House conferees \nvoted against including my bill, the CLEAR ACT, in this conference \nreport. This bill, which has passed the Senate at least three times and \nalso has passed the House, would transform the auto industry by \ngranting strong tax incentives for consumers who buy alternative fueled \nand advance technology vehicles, such as hybrid electric cars and, \nultimately hydrogen cars.\n  From a broader point of view, most of my fellow Senate conferees and \nI would have liked to see the entire set of energy tax provisions from \nthe Senate-passed bill included in the conference report. I believe it \nwas a mistake to omit these important provisions.\n  I also very much regret that the House conferees refused to adopt my \namendment to bolster our research tax credit. While it is true that the \nresearch credit was extended for a short time in the most recently \npassed tax bill dealing with individual tax cuts, that legislation left \nout an important element contained in the Senate FSC/ETI bill designed \nto improve the incentives this provisions gives for companies to engage \nin R activities.\n  Nevertheless, the conference report before us is worthy of our \nsupport, as we must honor our obligations under the World Trade \nOrganization.\n  Of more immediate importance is the fact that the Europeans are \nlevying an increasing level of trade sanctions against certain of our \nproducts exported to the EU. This is currently 12 percent and is \ngrowing by one percentage point per month. It is definitely having a \nvery serious negative effect on certain U.S. industries and could \namount to more than $4 billion in total cost, unnecessary cost to our \ncountry if this bill is not passed.\n  Moreover, the trade sanctions are authorized to continue to increase \nuntil next March, when they will have reached 17 percent. After this, \nthe EU\n\n[[Page S10959]]\n\nmay authorize even more serious sanctions against us that would surely \nharm our economic growth.\n  If we do not succeed in passing this conference report before sine \ndie adjournment of the 108th Congress, we must start the process all \nover again next year.\n  Would this result in a better bill? Perhaps. But that is far from \ncertain. What is more likely is that the resolution to this issue would \nbe delayed for many more months, giving the trade sanctions more time \nto damage our economy and harm U.S. businesses.\n  Let me take a few minutes to discuss some of the specific provisions \nthat are in the conference report and why I we should enthusiastically \nsupport them and why I support them.\n  Overall, this conference report has a good balance to it.\n  In addition to the vital repeal of the ETI provision and the quite \nreasonable transition relief it provides for current ETI users, the \nbill offers significant provisions for both small businesses and large \nmultinational firms.\n  Mixed in is a generous portion of important tax relief for business \ninterests of all kinds.\n  Also included in the conference report is significant relief \nspecifically for small businesses.\n  Foremost in this category are the five sections that would simplify \nand reform the taxation of S corporations.\n  These are changes I have long fought for and sought with several of \nmy colleagues and I am gratified to see them included by the \nconference.\n  Other provisions important to the balance of this bill are those \ndesigned to simplify and improve the rules by which this Nation taxes \ninternational business transactions.\n  Quite simply, our outdated, international tax rules are appalling.\n  Whether large, medium or small, U.S. businesses that decide to expand \ntheir markets beyond the borders of the United States confront a set of \ntax rules that are mind-numbingly complex. Far worse, these rules often \nresult in double taxation and leave our companies on the downside of a \ntilted playing board when compared with competitors based in most other \nindustrialized nations.\n  The bill before us includes about two dozen provisions that will \nimprove the tax law for U.S. companies that have expanded their markets \noverseas.\n  As a senator who has long been interested in seeing this type of \nreform enacted--in fact I have introduced bills to do this since the \nmid-1990s--this is a particularly gratifying day.\n  Some of my colleagues have incorrectly concluded that improving our \nrules on international taxation will give an incentive to U.S. \ncompanies to move their jobs overseas. This is unfortunate, Mr. \nPresident. Cross-border investing is not only a necessity of our modern \nworld, it is usually beneficial to both nations. Most U.S. companies \nthat invest in expansion into markets in other nations do so to compete \neffectively with other suppliers in those markets and here at home.\n  A fact of life of our modern economy is that our U.S.-based business \nenterprises face competition from all parts of the globe. It is \nunrealistic to think that an American business can simply focus on \nmarkets here at home and thrive. Instead, most of today's businesses \nmust be mindful of both markets and material and labor supplies around \nthe world if they are to stay in business very long.\n  While no one likes to see U.S. jobs move overseas, we should be more \nconcerned about creating and maintaining in the U.S. the kind of \nenvironment that attracts businesses. Part of that environment is \nensuring that our tax system does not drive businesses offshore to \nother nations that tax them in a more favorable fashion. This bill \nmoves our tax system a big step in that direction, and I am pleased to \nsee these changes finally reach the point where they are about to \nbecome law.\n  Let me turn to the tobacco issues associated with this conference \nreport.\n  At the center of the tobacco buyout is the tobacco farmer. The \ntobacco price support and tobacco quota programs have helped to secure \na reasonable living for many family farmers.\n  At the same time, breaking the nicotine dependency of U.S. citizens \nand especially children requires us to address the dependency of \ntobacco growers on the tobacco industry and on the government programs.\n  It will not be an easy transition for many tobacco growers, and \nCongress is strongly on record as supporting measures to help these \nfamilies survive it.\n  This proposal does a good job of getting the Government out the \nfarming business while making temporary assistance available to farmers \nas they adjust to the free market. And, there is no cost to the \nGovernment.\n  As far as the provision requiring the Food and Drug Administration to \nregulate tobacco, let me say that I fully support measures to end \ntobacco use in the United States.\n  I can think of few public health dangers worse than tobacco, and this \nis especially true for young people.\n  I have heard from many concerned parents and health advocates in Utah \nwho point out the need to take action against the devastating health \nconsequences of tobacco use.\n  In many aspects, the DeWine-Kennedy language was written to achieve \nthat goal, and in that spirit I supported it in conference.\n  In fact, much of the bill is taken from a measure that I authored \nseveral years ago with Senator Dianne Feinstein.\n  That being said, I am concerned about some aspects of the way the \nbill was written, and especially the impact of this language on the \nresources of the FDA.\n  First, the Committee of jurisdiction, the HELP Committee, should have \nthe opportunity to consider this legislation--allowing the FDA to \nregulate tobacco--before we vote. Having been the Chairman of that \nCommittee for several years, I know full well the complexities of the \nFederal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Three hours of debate on the \nSenate floor was not enough time to consider legislation that made such \ndramatic changes to current law.\n  We also must be clear about the impact that such legislation would \nhave on the FDA. Does it have adequate resources to regulate tobacco \nand still keep up with its other, extremely important responsibilities? \nI question whether it does. If we are not willing to give them the \nresources, then it is easy to see why that part of the request by \nSenators DeWine, Kennedy, myself, and others should be delayed until \nthis matter is addressed.\n  While I recognize that user fees were included in the legislation, I \nam not convinced that those fees would have provided the FDA with \nsufficient resources to regulate tobacco. These concerns bear further \nexamination.\n  They need committee hearings. They need to be examined thoroughly.\n  Finally, I want to touch on some of the revenue offsets included in \nthe conference report.\n  I support the principle of keeping this revenue neutral, and I \ncongratulate the conferees for doing so.\n  This was a particular sticky problem with the House Members, so I \nespecially recognize their hard work in bowing to the Senate's demand \nthat this bill be fully offset. I am very pleased to see that several \nrevenue offset provisions that were in the Senate bill are not part of \nthe conference report.\n  One of these is the codification of the economic substance doctrine. \nI believe enactment of this provision would have led to a great deal of \nunnecessary conflicts between taxpayers and the Internal Revenue \nService and would have unfairly penalized companies for engaging in \nlegitimate tax planning techniques.\n  One provision that did not make it into the conference report raises \nrevenue in connection with the donation of used vehicles. This may \nappear to be a reasonable proviso, particularly in light of some of the \nalleged abuse surrounding the charitable donation of used vehicles. I \nam concerned about the impact of this change on charitable giving. A \nchilling effect on the donation of these used cars could leave many \nworthy charities short of vital funds needed to perform their valuable \nservices to needy citizens in Utah and elsewhere. I would keep a \nwatchful eye on the implementation of this change in the law to make \nsure it doesn't harm the charities. It may well be that we need to \nrevisit this area of the law in the future.\n  I had one of my finest constituents call me last night--it may have \nbeen\n\n[[Page S10960]]\n\nthe night before, things have been moving so fast here--she said it \nwould really hurt their kidney foundation partners, which have raised \nhundreds of thousands of dollars in donations of used vehicles. She \nrecognizes we have to do it right so that the Government is protected \nand our tax system is not abused, but I would hate to see her not have \nthese moneys coming in for that important foundation, and others as \nwell.\n  In conclusion, the conference report before us represents a good bill \nthat deserves our support. As I have indicated, the bill is far from \nperfect, but given the difficult political circumstances surrounding \nthis bill, it is remarkable that we were able to bring to the Senate \nfloor a product as good as it really is. I urge colleagues to support \nthe conference agreement.\n\n\n                  Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, finally, I have to respond to the \noutrageous charges made by colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nregarding the Medicare statement I delivered on the Senate floor \nyesterday. I was disturbed by several remarks--especially that seniors \nhave flatly rejected the Medicare prescription drug benefit. That may \nbe the hope of some people on the other side, but that is not reality.\n  How is that even possible when the drug benefit doesn't even go into \neffect until January 1, 2006? That is pure, unmitigated bunk. I am \noffended that this argument is even being made on the floor of the \nSenate by my colleagues because it is absolutely not true. It is being \nmade to scare our seniors. And that is wrong. How is that possible when \nmany Medicare beneficiaries are participating in the Medicare drug \ndiscount card and have seen savings in their drug costs up to 20 \npercent per drug? What is being said is just not true. I don't see that \nas an outright rejection. My colleagues need to be careful about their \ncharges, especially when they don't have facts to back them up.\n  I take issue with the assertion that our prescription drug law is \nonly a drug law in name. What do they mean by that? Let me remind the \nSenator from Illinois that because of this new Medicare prescription \ndrug law, 40 million Medicare beneficiaries will have drug coverage if \nthey want it. They will have the choice. The bill provides generous \nsubsidies to low-income Medicare beneficiaries, who today cannot afford \nto purchase drugs; today they don't have the help. They are talking \nlike this bill does nothing--the bill which spends $400 billion-plus to \nimprove Medicare for our seniors and the disabled.\n  Prior to enactment of the Medicare Modernization Act, these \nbeneficiaries had to make tough choices between buying prescription \ndrugs and putting gas in their cars or buying prescription drugs and \nputting food on the table or buying prescription drugs and paying their \nrent. Once a Medicare drug plan goes into effect on January 1, 2006, \nthose Medicare beneficiaries will no longer have to worry about this \nmatter that they have to worry about now. To scare our seniors into \nthinking these benefits are not going to be great for them--it is \nincomprehensible to me that anybody has the gall to make those kinds of \nclaims.\n  Here is another point that needs to be raised regarding this matter: \nIf there were any proposals that deserve to be recognized as offering a \ndrug benefit in name only, it is the two Democratic plans of 2 years \nago, which were supported by 50 and 45 Democrats respectively, \nincluding the Democrat leader and Senator Kerry, their candidate for \nPresident. My colleague, Senator Grassley, described these plans a few \ndays ago. Let me take a few minutes to recap.\n  The first Democratic plan had a drug benefit that lasted just 6 \nyears; that was the end of it. Talk about offering a drug benefit in \nname only. The second plan didn't even offer a benefit to the vast \nmajority of beneficiaries. Seventy percent of beneficiaries would not \nhave received any basic coverage, and they are coming on the floor and \nsaying this $400 billion-plus plan does nothing? Give me a break. A \nplan that shuts out the vast majority, 70 percent, of beneficiaries--\nhow can you call that a drug benefit? Those were their plans.\n  Guess what those 70 percent got. You are not going to believe this. \nThey got a 5-percent discount on their drugs in their plan. Once they \nspent $3,300 out of pocket, they could qualify for catastrophic \ncoverage. That was their plan. And they are criticizing this plan, \nwhich was bipartisan, overwhelmingly passed?\n  Some have taken issue with the Medicare reform bill, saying that the \n``benefit'' stops after an initial coverage amount. I remind my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle that their basic benefit \nwould have never even started for 70 percent of beneficiaries--for 70 \npercent. They would have been left out by their plan, and they are \ncriticizing this plan? Talk about a donut hole. These beneficiaries \ndidn't even get a donut.\n\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that 66 percent of \nbeneficiaries would not even meet the $3,300 threshold. Again, for \nthese folks, the only help they would get was a 5-percent discount. And \nthey are criticizing our drug discount card where they are getting an \naverage of 20 percent and in some cases even more?\n  I was also extremely disappointed by the arguments by the Senator \nfrom Illinois and the Senator from California against what some have \ntermed the ``non-interference'' provision. As I outlined, this \nprovision has been included in the most prominent Democrat initiatives, \nstarting with the Clinton Health Security Act a decade ago. Despite \nthat fact--and it was in their bills--here we are listening to \narguments against this bill. Apparently, what was good in a Democratic \nadministration is very bad in a Republican one. They ought to be \nshouting for joy that we are putting some of their provisions into this \nbill. The problem is, these were not their provisions; they were all of \nour provisions, those of us who worked in a bipartisan way.\n  What was good in a Democrat Senate is bad in a Republican Senate--\nduring an election year especially. It is almost as if my colleagues \nwere not listening to what I said the other day. The argument that \nthere is no authority for the Federal Government to bargain with \npharmaceutical companies is getting to be a tired, wornout, old \nargument. Again, I will repeat myself from yesterday. First, the \nDemocrat-sponsored bill from 2000, introduced by the Senator from South \nDakota and cosponsored by 33 Democrats, had a specific provision which \nstated the following:\n\n       In administering the prescription drug benefit program \n     established under this part, the secretary may not [this is \n     the Democrat language in their bill, which had almost every \n     Democrat on it] (1) require a particular formulary or \n     institute a price structure for benefits; (2) interfere in \n     any way with negotiations between private entities and drug \n     manufacturers or wholesalers; or (3) otherwise interfere with \n     the competitive nature of providing a prescription drug \n     benefit through private entities.\n\n  Again, this provision is from the bill introduced by Senator Daschle, \nwhich was cosponsored by 33 Democrats, including not only Senator \nKerry, their candidate for President, but also Senators Durbin and \nBoxer, who spoke against it on the floor yesterday. It takes time to do \nit correctly. CMS, the agency in charge of the Medicare program, needs \ntime to implement the MMA regulations, accept bids from plans that wish \nto participate in the Medicare advantage programs, and, most important, \nit takes time to educate Medicare beneficiaries about the options that \nwill be offered to them.\n\n  Let me remind all of my colleagues that even the Democrat proposals \nthat have been considered in the past did not have the Medicare \nprescription drug programs go into effect immediately. So that is just \na ludicrous charge.\n  In addition, I remind my colleagues that both the Democratic plans in \nconsideration in December of 2002 didn't go into effect until 2005. I \nsuspect that the authors of these plans recognized the same thing that \nwe did, that it takes time to get a new, comprehensive drug program up \nand running. That is why the drug plan will not be available until \nJanuary 1, 2006.\n  So, there is no subterfuge behind the 2006 date in the MMA. Moreover, \nat least the MMA offers immediate assistance through the drug card \nprogram. Their plans offered nothing until 2005, and then very little \nafter that. And cost us a bundle more. They were not even well thought \nout, in my opinion.\n  I would also like to respond to the comments of my colleague from \nCalifornia comments about the Veterans\n\n[[Page S10961]]\n\nAdministration system and the deficiencies which I described yesterday \nmorning. If my colleague from California is surprised at the \nRepublicans not using the VA model then my only guess is she is even \nmore surprised that her own party did not. No, they wanted to have \nprivate plans negotiate with drug companies, the same approach taken in \nthe MMA, the Medicare reform bill.\n  The VA system was not a model for any Medicare prescription drug \nplans considered on the Senate floor, advanced by either Democrats or \nRepublicans.\n  Finally, let me address the idea of importing cheap drugs from \nCanada. First, nobody has a greater desire than I do to make \nprescription drugs more affordable, particularly for our seniors and \nthe disabled who depend so heavily upon pharmaceuticals for their \nquality of life. I co-authored the 1984 bill, the Hatch-Waxman Act, \nwhich in essence created the modern generic drug industry, brought \ngeneric drugs to the marketplace to become the force for competition \nand affordability that they are today. It has been called the most \nimportant consumer legislation in the last century by some. It has \nsaved at least $10 billion every year since 1984. That law was written \nby a conservative Republican in the Senate, myself, and a liberal \nDemocrat in the House, Congressman Henry Waxman, because we were \nwilling to put differences aside, get together and do what was right.\n  With regard to drug importation, my colleagues seem to forget that \nthe MMA does include a provision to permit the importation of \nprescription drugs from Canada, once a program is in place that is \napproved and certified for, guess what, safety and cost by the \nSecretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  That sounds logical to me. We want those drugs to be safe and we want \nto know that we can afford to implement this program.\n  The bill also calls for the Secretary to establish a 13-member task \nforce that will study proposals to make reimportation safe and cost \neffective. HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson has indicated that the panel's \nrecommendations will be completed by the end of this year.\n  Up to 80 percent of imported drugs coming through our ports today, \nare knockoffs, out-of-date drugs or placebos.\n  Can you imagine what could happened if drugs tainted by terrorists \ncome into this country? Drugs filled with gradual poison, or even \ninstant poison? Our nation must be concerned about these things because \nthey impact the safety of our citizens.\n\n  We should not overlook the fact that the FDA has documented many \ncases of what appeared to be FDA approved imported drugs that were in \nfact contaminated or counterfeit, contained the wrong product or \nincorrect dose, or were accompanied by incorrect directions or had \noutlived their expiration date. These drugs would be at minimum \nineffective and could actually be harmful or even fatal.\n  The FDA is also concerned with the safety of allowing companies which \nare not licensed by States to practice pharmacy to sell prescription \ndrugs without any limitation on the amount or frequency of drug imports \npermitted for individuals. In addition, reimportation legislation as it \nis written would allow risky drugs that are currently available in the \nU.S. only under strict safety rules or controls, to be reimported in \nany amount or frequency to anyone, even those who are at high risk to \nbe seriously injured by the medication.\n  The FDA underscored these concerns in the Judiciary Committee's \nhearings on reimportation last July. The Agency stressed that opening \nour tightly regulated closed system of prescription drug distribution \nwill open the door counterfeit and otherwise adulterated and misbranded \ndrugs being widely distributed to unwitting American public. Mr. \nWilliam K. Hubbard, Associate Commissioner for Policy and Planning for \nthe FDA testified at this hearing and I would like to take this \nopportunity to read some of his testimony to my colleagues.\n  FDA remains concerns about the public health implications of \nunapproved prescription drugs from entities seeking to profit by \ngetting around U.S. legal standards for drug safety and effectiveness. \nMany drugs obtained from foreign sources that either purport to be or \nappear to be the same as U.S. approved prescription drugs are in fact \nof unknown quality. Consumers are exposed to a number of potential \nrisks when they purchase drugs from foreign sources or from sources \nthat are not operated by pharmacies properly licensed under State \npharmacy laws.\n  Patients are also at greater risk because there is no certainty what \nthey are getting when they purchase some of these drugs. Although some \npurchasers of drugs from foreign sources may receive genuine product, \nothers may unknowingly buy counterfeit copies that contain only inert \ningredients, legitimate drugs that have been outdated and have been \ndiverted to unscrupulous or dangerous sellers, subpotent or superpotent \nproducts that were improperly manufactured. Furthermore in the case of \nforeign based sources, if the consumer has an adverse drug reaction or \nany other problem, the consumer may have little or no recourse either \nbecause the operator of the pharmacy often is not known, or the \nphysical location of the seller is unknown, or beyond the consumer's \nreach.\n  FDA has only limited ability to take action against these foreign \noperators.\n  These safety concerns are real. I strongly believe if we truly care \nabout seniors and other patients who depend upon prescription drugs, we \nshould not expose them to what currently amounts to pharmaceutical \nRussian roulette.\n  The FDA is working with some of my colleague on legislation that \nwould give the FDA greater resources, limit the scope of imports, and \nprovide greater power to the FDA to police imports. In recent comments, \nformer Commissioner Mark McClellan, now head of CMS, has said these \nmeasures would give the agency the ability to assure the safety of \nprescription drugs imported from Canada.\n  In addition to these safety concerns, however, I am also concerned \nthat reimported drugs pose a threat to the innovation that Americans \nand the rest of the world have come to expect from our pharmaceutical \nindustry, the greatest industry in the world. Canada and other \ncountries with lower drug prices generally import superior American \nproducts, but impose price controls to keep those costs down.\n  It may cost as much as $1 billion to produce a new drug, test it, win \nFDA approval, educate doctors, and make the drug available to patients. \nNo pharmaceutical company can or would go through this immensely \nexpensive process without a chance to recover some of those costs, \nwhich will not be possible if we impose, in America, however \nincorrectly, Canada's style of price controls.\n  But, wait, it not only costs $1 billion to create one of these \ndrugs--6,000 experimentations that failed to finally arrive at a drug \nthat is efficacious. And, in most cases, about three-quarters of the \npatent life is also consumed by that process. So the companies, to \nrecoup that $1 billion and make a profit, they have maybe 5 years, in \nsome cases, maybe less, to recoup their profits. That is the reason why \ndrug prices are so high. These safety concerns are real and I strongly \nbelieve if we truly care about seniors and other patients who depend \nupon prescription drugs, we should not expose them to what currently \namounts to pharmaceutical Russian roulette.\n  I do not believe that sacrificing the safety and future supply of our \ndrugs by reimportation is the right answer to the high cost of \nprescription drugs.\n  I hope I have cleared up some of the misunderstandings that Medicare \nbeneficiaries have about the MNA law. Again, we gain nothing by \nspreading untruths about the Medicare bill. I have been discouraged \nwith some of the comments made by some of our colleagues who know \nbetter, or should know better. They need to review the bills that they \ncosponsored and wanted to pass on the Senate floor. In my opinion, \nthose bills did not do nearly as much for seniors as the MMA. Frankly, \nthose bills were more costly, and provided seniors with less benefits. \nThe MMA law passed with bipartisan support in both Houses. The only \nthing that results from charges which have been made on this floor, is \nconfusion of Medicare beneficiaries, the very people all of us are \ntrying to help. I think that is regrettable.\n\n[[Page S10962]]\n\n  It is astounding to me that some of our colleagues are scaring our \nseniors to death when we are spending $400-plus billion to provide them \nwith better Medicare coverage. The MMA helps the truly poor so they \ndon't have to worry about donut holes. In my opinion, the MMA is \nsomething all of us should support.\n  What gets me upset are some of the arguments being made on the floor \nthat are not only erroneous but, I think, are misleading. I believe \nmany are just being made for political purposes.\n  I think one Senator called my argument flimflam--yesterday. I defy \nanybody to refute the principles I have discussed here today and the \nremarks I have made here today. You can differ with them, you can \ndisagree with them, but I don't think you can disagree with the facts.\n  It is time for all of us to start helping seniors by helping them to \nunderstand this bill so they can benefit from it. Deep down, I think \none reason some oppose this bill so much is because it represents \nliberty and freedom in the case of the health savings accounts. HSAs \nwas one of the most hard-fought provisions in the entire bill by the \nother side. I believe the opponents of the bill do not think the \nAmerican people can save for their own health care. They don't trust \nthe American people to save for their own health care. They believe the \nGovernment is the last answer to everything. They believe without the \nFederal Government telling them how to live, what to do, and what they \ncan consume that they can't help themselves.\n  Can you imagine a young person who took advantage of that health \nsavings account? That young person would have to assume the burden of \npaying for all of these Federal programs in health care. If that young \nperson saved $1,000 a year tax free for his or her entire working life \nup to 56 or perhaps 70, because we are all living longer these days, \nthat young person would have hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not a \nmillion, to take care of his or her own health care.\n  That is the way it ought to be. Isn't that the American way? \nShouldn't we try to take care of ourselves first and then help others?\n  I believe the Federal Government should help those who cannot help \nthemselves. Where I draw the line is I don't believe that the Federal \nGovernment should help those who could help themselves but won't. I \nthink there is a difference between the two. But there is nobody more \ncompassionate than I in helping those who truly need the help.\n  I wanted to set the record straight. I am disappointed in some of the \nremarks which have been made on the floor against the MMA. Some of \nthose remarks have been overly excessive and I hope that type of \nrhetoric will be discontinued.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has 90 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I see my colleague from Alabama who \nhas been waiting patiently, as I have, throughout the day to speak. He \nonly wants to speak for 5 minutes. I yield 5 minutes of my time, and \nthen I will reserve my right to speak for the 85 minutes remaining.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana for \nher courtesy. I will contain my time to 5 minutes and ask that I be \nnotified at 4 minutes.\n  I wish to say while the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee is here that he deserves great credit for the Justice For All \nAct. I had serious objections to some of the provisions in that bill in \ncommittee and objected to it, and thought we would never see the bill \npass. I declared it at one point a bad bill. But Senator Hatch believed \nthere was a problem with DNA analysis in America, and so did I. He \nbelieved there was a problem that could be improved with death penalty \nrepresentation, and so did I. He worked with Senator Leahy and Chairman \nSensenbrenner and Congressman Delahunt in the House, and others, and \nwas able to deal with the problem in the legislation.\n  I am pleased we were able to see that bill cleared today. I think it \nis a bill that will be effective in dealing with the problems that we \nknow exist in two of those areas.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, I thank the \nSenator for his comments. I thank him for his energetic good work on \nthis bill. He and Senator Cornyn in particular helped to improve this \nbill, and we should all be proud of it.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator.\n  One of the problems we had was that the legislation restricted States \nfrom putting the DNA of those arrested into the system. We offered an \namendment in committee to fix that. That has been fixed now. States can \nput into the system DNA of people who have been arrested but not \nconvicted. In reality, history teaches us that many people kill more \nthan once. We watch those ``Cold Case File'' shows, and you see people \nare arrested and not convicted. Later on they are arrested when they \ncommit the second, third, or fourth murder. That is too often a \npattern, unfortunately.\n  The bill allows forensic science spending now for other analyses if \nthere is no DNA backlog. DNA represents 5 percent of the forensic \nscientific analysis done in these criminal cases. It is a critical and \nwonderful tool, but it is not the only tool to be used. We have a \nlittle more flexibility in the bill than we did before.\n  I was concerned--and I think others were--that the money that would \nbe spent for training people to try death penalty cases would be spent \nby a governmental entity that is responsible to the people, not being \ngiven directly to an unaccountable special interest group. They did \nthis in States around the country that have an ideological opposition \nto the death penalty. For some of them, that is their No. 1 goal. We \nhave had problems in the past when those organizations received money. \nThe Congress ended that in 1996. I think that was a good decision. We \nfixed that in this bill.\n\n  There are some marvelous lawyers who dedicate themselves to \nrepresentation of convicts or people charged with capital murder. I \nrespect them. I respect people who do not agree with the death penalty. \nI have concluded it is an appropriate penalty, but regardless, it is \nthe law of the majority of the States of this country, and good \nrepresentation is required. We ought to do it in the right way.\n  We made progress. Historically, judges appoint lawyers in criminal \ncases. That would have put the original language, put the training and \npayment and selection of attorneys, in an outside entity's hands. The \ncommission would be set up in the States that include judges, former \nprosecutors, not current prosecutors, and certainly defense lawyers to \nhelp select and train trial attorneys. It also says 75 percent of the \nmoney should be spent on training for the trial, which is the heart of \nthe process.\n  The appeal follows afterward, and we need fair, good trials, so we \nwill focus most of the money on getting a fair trial so the appeals are \nless important. They are less important when the trial is done right to \nbegin with than if it is messed up. It provides training for \nprosecutors because prosecutors sometimes also fail to handle the cases \ncorrectly, and good training can help them conduct a fairer trial with \nfewer problems.\n  This is a bill I can support. I was pleased to be able to do so. I \nthank Senator DeWine and others who helped make this bill possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak \nfor the next hour and a half, and, depending on whether other Senators \nwant to speak later in the night and what the agreements are, I may \nwant to speak even longer because the subject I want to speak about is \nextremely important to my constituents and to many constituents around \nthe country.\n  I spent a couple of hours in the Senate yesterday speaking about the \ntax bill, the $137 billion tax relief bill the Senate and House have \nbeen negotiating now for 2 years. Not just the last few months, not \njust this Congress, but for 2 years the Congress has been putting \ntogether a tax relief bill because we basically were forced to put a \nbill together because of a decision made by\n\n[[Page S10963]]\n\nthe World Trade Organization, of which we belong and encourage, that \nsaid part of our Tax Code was not in order.\n  I am not on the Finance Committee. The Presiding Officer and I serve \ntogether on the Appropriations Committee. I am not a member of the \nFinance Committee. The Finance Committee, 2 years ago, began to put a \nbill together to address that situation. It was about a $50 billion \nproblem. That is a lot of money.\n  What happens around here is every time we open the Tax Code, it is \nvery tempting for everyone else to try to get in the bill because if \nyou can get in the bill, you can get money out of the Treasury. You \ncould ask for additional tax relief. You could correct something that \nyou think was an injustice to your business, whether you are a big \nbusiness or a small business, an international business or a domestic \nbusiness. You could ask for all sorts of help.\n  What happened was this bill started out as a very specific $50 \nbillion fix for something that most everyone--not everyone but most \neveryone, including myself--thought we should fix. It has turned into a \n$137 billion tax relief bill. That is the truth. That is very \ntroublesome.\n  That is not even why I am speaking. There are things in this bill \nthat are good and bad, and Senators have had all sorts of ideas and \nexpressions of their opinion, including an eloquent speech about an \nimportant provision by the Presiding Officer for leaving out the \nregulations on tobacco, putting in the buyout provisions from the \nfarmers but leaving out the companion regulation that was in the bill \nwhen it left the Senate.\n  Other Senators have come to the Senate today to speak about different \nissues. I come to the Senate not saying those are not important. But \nthere is one issue in my mind and in the minds of many of my \nconstituents in Louisiana and around the country that transcends all of \nthese issues and which is in a total category by itself. It is an issue \nthat doesn't have anything to do with corporations or business; it just \nhas to do with fairness, justice, truth, loyalty, and honesty.\n  The truth is that in 2 years, putting this bill together that went \nfrom $50 billion to $75 billion to $100 billion to now $137 billion, we \nforgot one group of people. Just one group I think was forgotten. This \nis the bill, $137 billion--pages and pages of the bill. It is like two \nbig phone books. Two years we put a bill together. Almost every kind of \nbusiness one can think of is in this bill, from energy companies to \nchemical companies to farmers to hospitals, health insurance; good \ncompanies that deserve help--I am not saying they don't--and good tax \nprovisions. But the one group that is left out--if you read the bill \nfrom the beginning to the end, read it upside down, backward, in any \nlanguage, you will not find one group of people in the bill. I hate to \nsay who that group is because the people in America do not believe we \ncould do this. We left out our troops. We left out the men and women on \nthe front line.\n  This is my problem. They are so far away in Iraq on the front line \nthat we cannot see them or we will not see them or we do not want to \nhear them, maybe, because they are on the front line and they do not \nhave time to be at the Capitol lobbying for themselves, and so we just \nleft them out.\n  When the House Members or Senate Members come to the Senate and say \nthey cannot understand why we are not rushing through on this bill and \nwhy some Senators are holding it up, I will tell them why. This Senator \nthinks it is a shame, unconscionable, to work for 2 years and put a \n$137 billion bill together that helps everyone--and you could argue for \ngood, for bad--yet leave our troops out.\n  Some of us, including the Presiding Officer, Republicans and \nDemocrats--had put in the bill when it was in the Senate a very small \nbut important provision that only cost $2 billion of the $137 billion--\njust $2 billion for our troops. Our troops are taking 100 percent of \nthe risk. Our troops are bearing 100 percent of the sacrifice. We only \nasked for less than 2 percent, and we got nothing.\n  So this Senator is going to stay on this floor for as many hours as I \ncan to tell the truth about this, and perhaps these words will reach to \nsomewhere or people will be inspired or encouraged to take the \npolitical actions necessary to make sure these troops do not get left \nout next time or before we finish.\n  Let me read you some of the e-mails I am getting because we put this \nup on our Web page, and I have been doing interviews since I found out \nabout this Wednesday night, as many as I can. I am going to continue to \nspeak and debate and talk to anybody who wants to interview me about \nit.\n  I know some of these e-mails get a little political, but I think it \nis OK for me to read them here. But these are e-mails. I am happy to \nhave them in the Record. I am not going to read all the political ones. \nI am trying to pick a mix of them. But I would like to start with this \none to show the potential of this issue:\n\n       As a Texas Republican voter, you inspired me, and now I \n     will take a harder look at Democrats running for any office \n     because I'm a retired military service member. I have pretty \n     much believed the services were better represented by \n     Republicans, and I voted that way. You showed me that my \n     basic ideas may have been flawed, and I will now look \n     wholeheartedly into that. Thank you for such a beautiful \n     speech demanding that the military be represented in that \n     bill. You really moved me and may have switched my party \n     affiliation with that direct and memorable speech.\n\n  Mr. President, my office is being flooded with e-mails like this, but \nlet me read you another one from a Democrat:\n\n       Dear Mary, I'm writing to tell you about how proud I am of \n     work you did on the floor today. As I write, you continue to \n     articulate a logical and, for most of us, a compelling \n     argument as to why the National Guard and Reserve should be \n     treated as first class citizens rather than second class \n     citizens in the tax bill pending before the Senate. Well \n     done. Can I convince you to move to North Carolina?\n\n  This is not about me. I am reading these not because I want people to \nknow or because I want to brag about this issue. I want the Members of \nthis body, and particularly the House leadership, the House Republican \nleadership, that took this out of the bill, I want them to know, \nChairman Thomas, Speaker Hastert, and Congressman DeLay, how strongly \nAmericans of all parties feel about what was done to our men and women \nin the armed services.\n  Let me be just very clear. The Republican leadership in this body \nsupported this effort. I want to be very out front about that. The \nRepublican leadership in this body, along with the Democratic \nleadership, supported this provision. And it went over to the House. \nOnly in conference, at the direction of the Republican chairman, \nChairman Thomas, was it taken out.\n  Now let me say this: I am so tired of seeing our troops in the \npictures, in the photographs, riding with us in parades, waving the \nflag, taking the pictures, but when it comes time to put them in the \nbudget, to give them relief, to put them in the tax credits, they are \nnowhere to be found--only in political propaganda and pictures. And \nthis Senator and my constituents have had enough.\n  I want to talk about why this is important. This picture is up here \nbecause I want to demonstrate that one thing in the bill--and I am not \ntrying to pick on the ceiling fan importers. I am sure it is a very \nlegitimate request. But we have a tax provision to give help to those \ncompanies that import fans from China. Meanwhile, our troops do not get \nin the bill.\n  Now, if anybody needed a fan, our troops need one because it is hot \nin Iraq. It is about 105 degrees. If there were any way for me to get \nsome of these fans to them, I would put an amendment on the bill. But \nthe fans are in. The troops are out.\n  Now, another reason this is important is because the Members who are \non the Armed Services Committee and many Senators who have served in \nthe military understand this. I served on the Armed Services Committee \nfor a while. I was very proud to do it. And I plan, hopefully, one day \nto be on the Defense Subcommittee on Appropriations so I can continue \nto fight for them and to articulate some of these views.\n\n  But I am not sure the country understands how much we are relying on \nour Reserve forces. We have a total of about 1.6 million Active troops \nand we have 1.2 million Reserve troops. So it is about 60/40.\n  Now, in 1953, not that long ago, during the Berlin crisis, we only \ncalled up 148,000 Reserve troops. In the Cuban\n\n[[Page S10964]]\n\nmissile crisis, we called up approximately 14,000 Reserve troops. To \nfight in the Vietnam war, we only called up 37,000 Reserve troops. This \ncomes to a total of 200,000. So for almost 35 years, we only called up \n200,000 Reserve troops. So our Reserve was operating in a place where \nthe men and women could sign up, go do their weekend work, get a pretty \ndecent paycheck for that, get training, and serve their country.\n  These Guard and Reserve, some of them are retired Active military, \nbut many of them are policemen and firemen and women who want to serve \nand are happy to be that citizen soldier, that part-time soldier. Their \ngoals have not changed, but our country's needs have changed. We made \nthe decision in the 1990s to say, to save taxpayer money, to make our \nforces better and stronger, we are going to rely more on our Reserve \nand less on our Active Duty, and we cut our Active strength, therefore \nrelying more on our Guard and Reserve.\n  The only problem with that is we keep forgetting them. We send them \nto the front line, we deploy them year after year, and then we forget \nabout them. We are not sending them the pay they need, the benefits \nthey need, the equipment they need. I am wondering, what is going on?\n  In the Persian Gulf war we had to call up 238,000 Reserve troops. In \nHaiti, we called up 3,000 Reserve troops; in Bosnia, 29,000; Operation \nSouthern Watch, 2,000; Kosovo, 6,000; and the war in Iraq, 410,000 \nGuard and Reserve--currently about 5,000 of them are from my State of \nLouisiana.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, I went to Leesville, LA, the proud home of Fort \nPolk, where many of our troops train. It is a joint training base. I \nwas with my mayors and my Governor, and we saluted our troops. We \nprayed with our troops. We were with them. We sent them off. The 256th \nInfantry Brigade is getting deployed. This is affecting thousands of \nfamilies around Louisiana. This is not just happening in Louisiana. \nThis is happening in the State of the Senator from Ohio, in Chairman \nGrassley's State of Iowa, in Texas and California. Thousands of \nfamilies are being separated, husbands from wives, wives from husbands, \nfathers from children, to go fight on the front line.\n  So you can see the increase and the frequently that we have called \nthem up, so you would think that if we are calling them up more, we \nwould help them more. But we help them less. You would think that if we \nhave a tax bill going through, this is the group of people who should \nbe on the front page. But they are not on any page. They are not on the \nfront page. They are not in the middle. They are not on the last page. \nThey did not even write a note to say: Sorry we couldn't help you this \ntime. Maybe we can help you next time. Not even a PS.\n  I have been proud to support tax relief since I have been here for 8 \nyears. I haven't supported all the tax relief packages, but I believe \npeople deserve tax relief. I wish we could live in a world with no \ntaxes. As soon as we figure out how to do that, that would make \neverybody happy. I am not sure how to do it, but I am sure somebody \nwill think of an idea someday because we sure eliminate taxes right and \nleft for everybody.\n  We have been spending the last 4 years providing tax relief, $2.1 \ntrillion. This is direct tax relief, either special benefits, including \nmilitary families and the earned-income tax credit, ideas like their \ncombat pay or their severance pay would not be taxed. Tax benefits to \nour military basically amounted to $1.37 billion. Everybody else gets \n$2.1 trillion. But the guys and gals on the front line get $1.37 \nbillion.\n  Someone will say: Surely, Senator, some of the $2.1 trillion will go \nto the military families. And, yes, that will happen. Middle-class \nfamilies generally are in here, and our troops are also middle-class \nfamilies. The Republican side will disagree with this, but what the \nDemocratic side says is, since so much of this tax relief is targeted \nto families earning over $100- or $200,000, I would argue that very \nlittle of this money is going to get to military families. Why? Because \nmost of these families only make $50,000. The average is $30,000 in the \nactive lower ranks. Very few people in the military make over $150,000. \nSo who are we helping? Not the guys fighting the war. Not the guys \ntaking the bullets.\n  The reason I am particularly offended on behalf of the soldiers is \nthat we can afford to help them. If we didn't have the money, if we \njust couldn't afford it, then I would go to them and say: Look, you all \nknow more about sacrifice than anybody. It is in the code of the \nmilitary. Sacrifice, it is what they do; it is what they are. So \neverybody has to sacrifice. But the fact is, not everybody is \nsacrificing because everybody else is not sacrificing anything. They \nare getting extra. And only the military is being asked to sacrifice, \nnot just their life but their paychecks.\n  I guess what really is upsetting, as I learn more about this and as I \nread the materials that are sent out by our own Government, this is the \n``family readiness paradigm.'' It is www.defenselink.military, I think \nfrom the Pentagon. Secretary Rumsfeld is quoted and President George \nBush on this chart. I want to quote what the President said:\n\n       The National Guard and Reserve are a vital part of \n     America's national defense. [They] display values that are \n     central to our nation: character, courage, and sacrifice, \n     [and demonstrate] the highest form of citizenship. And while \n     you may not be full-time soldiers, you are full-time \n     patriots.\n\n  That is lovely. It is wonderful. Except these words are not backed up \nwith actions because actions would have put the patriots in the bill \nand said: You deserve a portion of this tax cut because the Guard and \nReserve that go to the front lines are taking a 41 percent pay cut, \naccording to the Government Accountability Office study.\n  And why is that? Because the Guard and Reserve are citizen soldiers. \nThey work in regular life as truck drivers and architects and doctors \nand nurses. They might make $60-, $70-, $100-, $150,000. But when they \nare activated and they go to the front line, they leave their civilian \npaycheck at home and they pick up their Army, Navy, or Marine paycheck. \nAnd it is only $30,000 or $35,000 or $40,000. Some of these families \nare taking a 50-percent pay cut.\n  So while they are on the front lines taking the bullets, their \nfamilies are back home. I have a letter from one of the families in \nLouisiana that said: Thank you, Senator, for fighting for us. We live \non a very modest and meager income. I have been pouring water in my \nchildren's cereal to make ends meet because the grocery bill is getting \npretty high.\n  I have to go home and tell that lady in Hammond that we couldn't find \n$1 in the bill to help her with her grocery bill. This is particularly \nupsetting to me.\n\n  The chart says ``Self-reliant families,'' I like that word ``self-\nreliant.'' I think it is important for us to be self-reliant, to be \nstrong, to not be overly dependent. I believe in self-sufficiency and \neconomic independence and pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. But \nwhy is it that we have to put a chart up for our Guard and Reserve \nasking them to be self-reliant, when this bill doesn't represent self-\nreliance? This bill represents companies and individuals who came to \nthe Government to ask for help and aid, not self-reliance.\n  But in the charts that we send out to these families as they wave \ntheir loved ones goodbye, we tell them: Forget about being in the bill. \nHere is your brochure that talks about self-reliance. And if you need \nhelp, call the outreach family readiness coordinator. Maybe we can help \nyou organize your finances because we know your situation is tough.\n  That is wonderful, except what they really would need from us is a \nwhole paycheck. I am not asking for a bonus for them. I am not asking \nfor any special tax break. Just make their paycheck whole. Just keep \ntheir paycheck whole. The way we did that in the Senate FSC-ETI bill \nwas by giving the employers in this country, the patriotic employers \nwho are basically subsidizing their salaries by saying: Harry is \nleaving us tomorrow. We can't let his family have to live on $30,000 \nless.\n  So here is a small business. I can just see them now getting together \nin the coffee room: Harry has to go. Can we make it? Can we help him? \nCan we keep his pay going because he is going to be gone for a year?\n  That small business digs deep. Harry goes to the front line. They \nkeep sending him a check--even though he is not at work for them, he is \nat work for us--\n\n[[Page S10965]]\n\nand keeping that paycheck whole for that family.\n  And all of us in the Senate thought that was the right thing to do. \nThese are patriotic businesses. Let's give them a tax credit, at least \nhalf, so those small businesses that are doing this could be rewarded. \nThey could be recognized, voluntarily. They don't have to pay their \nactive duty Guard and Reserve employees. But if they are doing it, they \nshould get a 50-percent tax credit.\n  So, in essence, our amendment was creating a partnership between all \nthe small businesses in America, patriotic businesses and large \ncorporations that are keeping the front line going.\n  But Chairman Thomas decided in his committee that this bill and the \nthings in it represented a higher priority than keeping the paychecks \nwhole for the men and women taking the bullets for us on the front \nline. I am still waiting to hear from Chairman Thomas about why he \nthought that or what it is that I have missed. I haven't heard a thing.\n  I would like to read the letter I sent to the President. I put it in \nthe Record yesterday. I will read the letter I sent to the President \nbecause I want to say again, as I said yesterday, I don't think the \nPresident of the United States knows about this. I think if he did, he \nwouldn't have let it happen. I want to read my letter again. I hope to \nget a response. I just sent it to him yesterday about 24 hours ago.\n\n       Mr. President:\n       I am writing to bring a grave injustice to your personal \n     attention. During the Senate consideration of the FSC/ETI \n     legislation, the Members of the Senate added a modest \n     provision to assist our troops. GAO studies have concluded \n     that 41 percent of our Guardsmen and Reservists called to \n     serve their country on the front line must take a pay cut to \n     do so. Fortunately, some companies around the country have \n     stepped up to the plate and taken the patriotic step to make \n     up the pay-gap of these brave men and women. The provisions \n     that we added in the Senate would have provided a tax credit \n     of up to 50 percent to cover the cost of these companies who \n     make up the difference. In doing so, we hoped both to \n     acknowledge the patriotism of the existing companies and at \n     the same time encourage more employers to take this step.\n       Mr. President, no doubt that you have traveled the country \n     and you have confronted the same stories I have from some of \n     the military families struggling to make ends meet. We have \n     had to ask an awful lot of our Guard and Reserve. They ask so \n     little from us. So trying to take this worry off the minds of \n     our men and women on the front lines seems to me to be the \n     least that we could do. So it is with deep embarrassment for \n     our Government that I must report that this very modest \n     release for our troops was stripped from the conference \n     report by Congressman Thomas and the leadership of the U.S. \n     House.\n       While I am certain that representatives of your \n     administration participated in this conference, I presume \n     that you did not have personal knowledge of this decision to \n     cut support for our military families. Regrettably, this \n     decision has placed all of us in a very difficult position. \n     While I endorse many aspects of this bill, I simply cannot \n     support a measure that places so many lesser priorities ahead \n     of our most important priority.\n\n  It goes on to say that I respectfully request that the President \nexert his significant influence to correct this at the earliest \npossible time. It could be by vetoing this bill and sending it back and \ntelling us in a veto order to fix it, which has been done before and \ncould be done. That is unlikely. It is very difficult to do, but I \nthink these are difficult times. Or the President and the House \nleadership could admit they made a mistake and promise, in writing or \nin other ways, to include it in the next bill through here. This letter \nwas signed by myself and Senator James Jeffords from Vermont.\n  Many other Senators signed a letter to the conference. For the \nrecord, I want to make sure that people understand that Senators \nMurray, Johnson, Cantwell, Corzine, Boxer, Kerry, Durbin, Dodd, Pryor, \nReid, Lincoln, Bond, Graham, Dayton, and many others signed onto a \nletter to the conference committee when this bill was being decided. It \nis addressed to Senators Grassley and Baucus, who are very supportive \nof this measure. It was also sent to Representative Bill Thomas and \nRepresentative Charles Rangel. I do know that Charles Rangel, the \nDemocratic ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, supported \nthis. It was a decision made by the House Republican leadership, and it \nwas a bad decision. It is a decision that needs to be changed at the \nearliest possible time.\n  Mr. President, one other thing that is very disturbing to me and \nparticularly hard or difficult to articulate is that I have met so many \nmen and women in uniform. I have met so many men and women in uniform, \nand they trust us to represent them and to do our best by them. When \nthey are on the front lines, they don't have time to have lobbyists \nhere.\n  They have many Members of this Senate who have put in additional \nbenefits--I see the chairman of the Appropriations Committee here, who \nhas worked very hard for our men and women in uniform--and we have put \nin time and time again help for them. So we have tried to respond in \nthe Senate. But they trust us to look out for them.\n  In this bill, when it left the Senate, this provision was in the \nbill. When it went to conference, it was taken out. Again, there are \nmany other items that were not included. I understand that. I am not \narguing that anything in this bill is not worth our attention, because \nsome Member felt strongly about it or it would not have been in the \nbill. I am not arguing about what is in the bill. I am arguing about \nthe one provision that I know about that was left out of the bill. It \nis not Senator Landrieu's provision; it is a provision for our Guard \nand Reserve, to keep their paychecks whole so they can save for their \nfuture, so they can send their children to college, so they can fight \nand keep their minds on the front line and not have to worry about the \nhomefront. I am wondering why they were taken out.\n  Again, I feel obligated and very motivated to try to spend some time \nin the last days, as we wind down the session, to speak about a grave \ninjustice. That injustice is that we have 1.2 million Guard and Reserve \nin our country, representing about 40 percent of our total force. They \nare fighting on the front line in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in places all \nover the globe. You can see on this chart that these are percentages of \nour Guard and Reserve that have been activated. Thirty-six percent of \nmy Guard and Reserve--I think I have close to 12,000 Guard and Reserve \nunits in Louisiana--are on the front lines. If you look at Washington \nState on the chart, it is 46 percent. Over here in Florida, it is 47 \npercent. You can see the States and the percentages of the Guard and \nReserve.\n  Every one of these percentages represents thousands and thousands of \nfamilies who are being called up to go to the front line. What could be \nmore central to our security than the troops going to the front line? \nWhy would this Congress, led by the House Republican leadership, spend \n2 years putting together a tax relief bill and leave them out so that \nthey have to take a pay cut while everybody else gets a bonus or they \ntake a pay cut and everybody else gets extra financial help or \neverybody else gets their tax bill lowered, but they have to pay the \nsame taxes, and they get not even a whole paycheck?\n  The Senator from Iowa came down earlier to the floor of the Senate \nand made a couple of comments about this conference. I just have to \nrespond, and I know he is not here, but it will be in the Record. He \nwill be here tomorrow, and we can talk face to face about this. I have \nthe utmost respect for the Senator from Iowa, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee. It has been very difficult for him to put this bill \ntogether, I know. The ranking member from Montana has been very helpful \nin putting this bill together.\n  I do want to take issue with something the Senator from Iowa said. He \nsaid it has been a long road to what I hope will be a final passage of \nthis legislation. American workers, especially those in the \nmanufacturing sector, put in the work necessary to make the U.S. the \nmost productive economy in the world. We Senators should employ the \nsame work ethic. We have to match our constituents' work productivity. \nWe cannot delay this matter any longer. We cannot leave the jobsite \nwithout finishing our work.\n  I understand we want to get this bill finished, but I think spending \nsome time talking about the soldiers on the front line, who were left \nout, is something that is important to do so we can either get this \nfixed before the end of the time for this bill to have to be considered \nor we can cause the focus to be such that it can be fixed in the next \ntax bill that passes this body.\n  He goes on to say that in his opinion it was a very open conference. \nNow, that may be his opinion, but from what\n\n[[Page S10966]]\n\nwe understand from Members who were there, basically the House \nRepublican leadership laid down their mark, and out of a $137 billion \nbill there was only $182 million worth of amendments that were changed \nfrom the Republican leadership written bill. So of $137 billion, only \n$182 million--only seven items of this entire bill, which could be on \none page--were added or changed from the House mark. So the House \nleadership wrote the bill and they left the troops out.\n  In the conference, the seven items, it could have been any seven, but \nit was rural carriers, letter carriers, were added at a cost of $33 \nmillion. The SUV loophole was closed. The National Health Service Corps \nloan repayment was put in that added $72 million to the cost; small \nissue bonds; electric cooperatives; marginal stripper wells; and \nwhatever the blue ribbon task force on tax reform was, it is no longer \nexisting because it was taken out.\n  So out of $137 billion, there were seven items, for a total of $182 \nmillion, that were changed.\n  When the argument is made that it was a very open process and the \nSenate put in some things and the House put in some things and it was \nall open and everybody talked and everybody negotiated, it is not true. \nWhat is true is for 2 years in many meetings, in many hearings, in many \nspeeches, over many hours, a bill was put together and time and time \nagain in those meetings and on this floor and in the committee, letters \nwere sent to the Republican House leadership, please do not forget the \ntroops. But when the final print was done, when the bill was printed \nfor distribution, they were left out.\n  I have stated until this issue is addressed, I am going to vote \nagainst this bill. I have not had one person in Louisiana call me and \nsay: Senator, how could you possibly vote against my tax relief that is \nin this bill? Because the people in Louisiana are very patriotic and \nthey do not think anyone should stand in the front of the line, except \nthe troops. Time and time again, the people of Louisiana show their \nrespect in real and significant ways to our troops. So while there are \ntax credits in here for the oil and gas industry and for shipbuilders \nand for fishermen, and many things that are important to my State--and \nI want them to know I support those industries--I also know and can say \nwith confidence there is not an industry or a business or a person in \nmy State that thinks they should be ahead of the Guard and the National \nReserve, not one.\n  I promise that if anyone from Louisiana calls me to tell me they do \nthink they should be ahead, I will be happy to admit I was wrong.\n  Our troops depend on us in many ways, and in the middle of a war when \nwe are fighting one, as we are, with a lot of rancor and different \nviews and different opinions, it is important when we can send our \nwords of support that our actions match those words and that in every \nway we can tell our troops, because it has been a difficult time, we \nare in an election year, there are different opinions about the way \nthis war is being prosecuted, but I would think at this time in \nparticular we would want to send, by our action, not our words, real \nsupport for our troops.\n  What could we send more than a paycheck? When we do not take the \nopportunity to put the paycheck in this tax bill--and maybe people will \ncome and say, Senator, we put all of the help for the Army and the Navy \nand the Reserve in the Defense bill,--let me say what will happen when \nwe leave them out of this tax bill: We end up having to argue in the \nDefense appropriations bill whether we want to spend money for their \nhelmets, their rifles, their covered Humvees or do we want to spend the \nmoney for their paychecks. Why are we making them choose between a \nhelmet and a paycheck?\n  That is what happens when we just focus on the Defense appropriations \nbill and divvy up the money. It is not fair to them. It is not right. \nIt is not what we should do. When we have a tax bill moving through \nthat could provide obviously $2 billion of the $137 billion we are \ngiving, we could have given them tax relief. If there was a health care \nbill coming through, which there has been, we could provide health care \nprovisions out of the general health care bill for our troops. Then in \nthe Defense bill, we do our best to allocate those moneys as fairly as \nwe can.\n  So that is why I am particularly upset, because I have been in those \ndiscussions on the Appropriations Committee and I know how tough it is. \nDo we give a 10-percent pay increase or do we invest in operations and \nmaintenance on the bases? There is never enough money to go around. For \nwhat our troops are doing for us and the times our country is in and \nthe challenges we face, we should not make them have to make those \nchoices when we obviously have other options.\n  Let me read a couple of other e-mails I have received from people who \nfeel strongly about this, because I think it is important.\n\n  I am a retired Army Reservist who was activated and deployed to the \nGulf during Desert Shield/Storm. Because the company where I had worked \nfor 16 years at the time was going through financial difficulties the \nbest they could do was to continue with my family health plan, and I \nreally appreciated that especially in their predicament.\n  Now, think about this. This is a guy going to the front line and he \nis especially appreciative that his company has decided, out of their \npatriotism and generosity, to keep his family receiving health care. \nThey are not making his paycheck whole and he is not even angry about \nit. That is how men and women in uniform are. They do not even want to \nask for help because they believe in self-reliance. They believe in \nsacrifice. But they also believe in fairness and honesty. It is not \nfair to leave them out of the bill. They deserve more. They deserve our \ntruthfulness, our honesty, our hard work and our fairness, and we let \nthem down.\n  He goes on to write:\n\n       Other reservists serving with me but who came from stronger \n     financial private or public work settings enjoyed all prior \n     pay and perks; most soldiers found themselves somewhere in \n     between those two positions.\n\n  So he is saying he went over there with very little. Some went over \nthere with the ability of their employers to keep their pay whole, but \nmost people fell in the middle, he says.\n\n       Your proposal about the Administration and Congress backing \n     up the rhetoric with real money would benefit employers, \n     employees and in the long run the services in their retention \n     efforts.\n\n  I want to talk about retention.\n  I don't know how many times the generals have to come before us to \nspeak about retention. I don't know how many times some of us on the \nArmed Services Committee have to come to this Chamber to say we are \nhaving a tough time recruiting for our armed services, not because we \ndon't have brave men and women, not because they don't want to serve, \nbut when the compensation and the pay packages get so out of line with \nwhat people can make in the civilian world, it puts a lot of pressure \non them. Believe me, I have talked with these soldiers. With tears in \ntheir eyes, sometimes, they tell me: Senator if it were up to me I \nwould go and you wouldn't have to pay me a thing. This isn't about me. \nBut I can't bear having to watch my wife take a second job or not be \nable to be home with our two children because I'm away. Please tell \nthem I am not asking for myself, I am asking for my spouse. I am asking \nfor my children.\n  I want to speak for them. Could we not just keep their paycheck \nwhole? A report last month let us know--I will supply it for the \nRecord--that the Guard and Reserve, for maybe the first time in a long \ntime, I don't know exactly the number of years, but for the first time \nin many years, fell short of its goal. It fell short by 5,000 in its \nrecruitment.\n  You might understand why. It is not because Americans are not \npatriotic. It is because of this issue. It is about pay. It is about \nbenefits. It is about whether our Government cares enough for the \nsoldier to take care of their family when they are away. The soldiers \nwould fight for nothing. They don't eat very well over there, and they \ndon't care about it. But they do care about their families and their \nchildren back home. We should care as much as they do. We can help by \nkeeping that paycheck whole, sending it home for our soldiers on the \nfront line. But we did not do that when we put this bill together.\n  As I said, I am sorry to have to report to the President that is the \ncase because I don't think he has any personal knowledge. Maybe he will \nhave\n\n[[Page S10967]]\n\ngotten the letter in the last 24 hours. He has been very busy. I know \nit is a very busy time. But I know somewhere in the White House they \nare reading that letter, and I am looking forward to them letting me \nknow what they think about it. Do they think it was a good idea? Do \nthey think we could fix it shortly in a different bill? Do they think \nwe could find $2 billion to keep those paychecks whole?\n  Here's another e-mail--\n\n       Let me start by saying that I do not reside in your State \n     but I still listened to you on C-SPAN and I loved it. Yes, \n     the very people who we depend on for our national security \n     cannot make ends meet. This is something many people do not \n     understand, because they have never been affiliated with the \n     military. Painful to note, billions of our tax dollars go to \n     help overseas, but not for our troops' loved ones. I, along \n     with the other girls, we get together for our weekly quilting \n     group. And we opened up other people's eyes about this \n     subject matter many months ago. I don't know that we can get \n     them to vote any differently, but it sure felt good to hear \n     you tell the truth.\n\n  I am not reading this for my own benefit. I am saying that there are \nmany people around the country--one of the girls, probably an older \nwoman, I would imagine--who quilts with a group of friends. They, \nevidently, talk about this. They know about military families. They are \nprobably part of a group somewhere in this community that collects cans \nof food and other helps for the families at home. There is a great \nsupport network in this country.\n  Why can't the Government be part of the support group? I don't \nunderstand it. The Government has more money than everybody put \ntogether, and we can't find a half a billion? $250 million? We can't \nfind a few thousand dollars in the tax bill? And we have Americans \nsitting around their kitchen tables collecting food for our troops on \nthe front line?\n  In one way it is a wonderful thought. In another way it is awful to \nthink about. I am happy Americans are supporting the troops. Our \nGovernment should do the same, and not just in the photographs, and not \njust in the pictures but in the budget.\n  I am going to have a lot more to say about this subject. Again, for \npeople watching, as I wrap up and put us into a quorum call for the \nnext little bit, I want to say again, the underlying bill is an \nimportant bill, and it needs to be passed. This Congress has worked on \nit for 2 years. There are many important provisions in this bill. But \nfor the life of me I cannot understand how we have 150,000 troops in \nIraq, why we left them out. About 40 percent of them are Reserve.\n  When they go to that front line they don't take a whole paycheck with \nthem. We could have helped make it whole, but we chose other \npriorities. I don't know a higher priority than supporting our troops. \nAgain, not just in the pictures, not just in the photographs, not just \nin the parades but in the budget, in our actions not just our words.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have received this letter from Tom \nRidge, who is the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                U.S. Department of\n\n\n                                            Homeland Security,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 9, 2004.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Earlier today the House of \n     Representatives overwhelmingly passed the FY 2005 Homeland \n     Security Appropriations Conference Report. I urge the Senate \n     to pass the final legislation expeditiously, so that DHS can \n     continue the important mission of securing the homeland.\n       While the Continuing Resolution currently enacted allows \n     DHS to continue its operations in support of the existing \n     security of our Homeland, we urgently need the additional \n     spending authority and new initiatives contained in the \n     Conference Report on the Department's FY 2005 Appropriation. \n     During this increased period of risk, DHS must continue to \n     improve capabilities in several critical areas including \n     enhancing law enforcement, strengthening our borders, and \n     improving transportation security, I remain concerned about \n     operating under a lengthy Continuing Resolution. For example, \n     under the Continuing Resolution, DHS would not have the \n     funding to maintain the current on-board strength of the \n     Federal Air Marshals; development and deployment work on the \n     legislatively required 2005 deadlines for US Visit will be \n     slowed; the Border Patrol will be unable to continue the \n     critical work to upgrade and update the surveillance \n     technology used on our land borders; and additional Detention \n     and Removal programs and bed space will not be provided. \n     Additionally, necessary program enhancements such as the \n     Container Security Initiative, Radiation Portal Monitors, \n     targeting systems, and critically needed aviation security \n     technology are also on hold. Finally, FEMA's Disaster Relief \n     Fund is in need of supplemental funding as soon as possible.\n       I appreciate the Senate's continued commitment and \n     diligence in passing these critical pieces of legislation. If \n     there is anything I or my staff can do to assist in \n     expediting this process, please contact me or Under Secretary \n     Janet Hale.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Tom Ridge,\n     Secretary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/09/senate-section/article/S10967-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10967-S10978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 2845\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I brought this to the Senate floor \nbecause, as I stated previously, I was informed that tonight the moneys \nfor distribution in the hurricane area that FEMA supports will expire. \nWe have to pass the MilCon bill and we have to pass the Homeland \nSecurity bill as rapidly as possible.\n  We do not have copies of the intelligence bill that was passed. All \nof us have had requests for it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the intelligence reform bill, S. 2845, \nbe printed as passed so we may distribute copies of that and so that \nthe conference committee can have copies of that bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I don't see anyone wanting to speak. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Ohio, Senator DeWine, be recognized for up to 12 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object, only for the purposes of \nhis statement, and then I would like to be recognized. Otherwise, I \nwill object.\n  Mr. REID. Otherwise what?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I am going to object. Only to be recognized for the \npurposes of reading a statement, after which the Senator from Louisiana \nbe recognized; otherwise, I will object.\n  Mr. REID. I will not agree to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this evening to thank----\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. We are in a quorum call.\n  Mr. REID. There was an objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We were out of a quorum call.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio has the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. We were in a quorum call.\n  Mr. REID. There was a request for the Senator from Ohio to be \nrecognized. The Senator from Louisiana asked that it be modified so she \nwould be recognized afterwards. I said I wouldn't agree to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. But the Senator then \nyielded the floor. The Senator from Ohio sought recognition and had \nbeen recognized.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  (The remarks of Mr. DeWINE are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto\n\n[[Page S10968]]\n\nspeak for 12 minutes and that immediately after I speak Senator \nLandrieu be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Justice For All Act\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, several hours ago, Senator Hatch came to \nthe floor to discuss the DNA bill that we have been able to pass. I \ncongratulate him for the fine work on that bill. A number of people \nhave worked on that bill.\n  I became interested in this issue a number of years ago. I have been \ninterested in the whole area of crime technology, frankly, going back \nto my work as county prosecuting attorney in Greene County, OH, many \nyears ago.\n  In those days, we did not have DNA. We did not have a lot of the \ntechnology we have today. I have been able to watch over the years, as \nI know the current occupant of the chair has, the great development of \ntechnology which has revolutionized what we can do today in law \nenforcement to solve crime. It has been one of the things I have worked \non since I have been in public office--first, my time in the State \nlegislature, then in the House of Representatives, and when I was \nLieutenant Governor of the State of Ohio, and now, in the last decade, \nin the Senate.\n  I specifically became interested in what turned out to be this bill \nwe have been talking about today, the DNA bill, several years ago when \nI met with the BCI back in Ohio, which is our State lab and State \nbureau, and went out there to find out some of the things that needed \nto be done. I had a long discussion with them in London, OH, about the \nreal problem we have in Ohio and the problem we have across this \ncountry.\n  It is a problem of what we call rape kits; where there is a rape \nvictim, the police go in, they take evidence from that victim, and then \nmany times, tragically, I have learned--I know my colleague who is in \nthe chair understands this--these rape kits are stored, they are never \nprocessed, and that information never gets into any central database. \nThere is a tremendous backlog of this across this country.\n  Because of this, to try to help clear up this backlog, I introduced \nS. 149, the Rape Kits and DNA Evidence Backlog Elimination Act of 2003. \nAbout the same time, roughly the same time, Senator Biden introduced a \nbill which had the same intent to deal with this problem. Chairman \nHatch asked me later on to combine my bill with his and those of other \nMembers to create the bill we have today. When he asked me to do that, \nI gladly agreed.\n  Today, we all proudly stand as cosponsors of this bipartisan \nlegislation. I know my colleague in the chair has worked on this \nlegislation. I think it is a piece of legislation that all Americans \ncan be proud of and that will help Americans be safer. The provisions \nof my original bill that are included in the legislation we passed \ntoday will protect innocent victims and will, in fact, put criminals \nbehind bars. It will do both.\n  This bill includes my language to authorize over $1 billion to \neliminate the backlog of over half a million rape kits that are sitting \non the shelves of evidence lockers in police stations across this \nNation.\n  Let me emphasize again that there are over half a million rape kits \nthat have not been tested and therefore have not been put into a \ncentral database. How many of these rape kits contain evidence that \nwould take a rapist off the streets? Well, we can't be sure, but we do \nknow statistically that approximately one in eight of all kits \ncurrently tested in Ohio do, in fact, result in a match in our DNA \ndatabase to a rapist. That is an unbelievable figure, one in eight will \nresult in this statistical match.\n  In fact, approximately the same number will link the rape to another \ncrime scene, giving our law enforcement officers one more piece of \ncritical evidence that may, in fact, lead to the arrest of a criminal \nand the prevention of future crimes.\n  If you add these two figures together, you can see that nearly one in \nfour of all rape kits tested will result in key evidence for law \nenforcement. That is a staggering statistic and demonstrates the power \nof modern technology when, in fact, it is used to fight crime.\n  This bill also includes my language that will expand the number of \ncriminals that we put in our Federal DNA database. Very simply, this \nlanguage will expand the current reporting requirement to include all \nFederal felons, not just a few specific felons as required under \ncurrent law. Of course, the more information that goes into the DNA \ndatabase, the more likely it becomes that we will match evidence from \nthe crime scene to the DNA profile of the criminal in the database.\n  Additionally, this language will permit States to cross-reference DNA \ninformation from people under State indictment with the current Federal \ndatabase. For example, if a criminal is arrested and indicted in New \nYork, and the New York law enforcement officers enter the DNA \ninformation in their State database, this law permits New York to share \nthis information with the Federal database so all participating States \ncan access the information.\n  This means that a police officer could link DNA evidence from a crime \nin Ohio to an arrestee in New York. Again, by realizing the full \npotential of available technology, we will identify more criminals, \nprevent more crimes, and protect more innocent victims.\n  Finally, this bill includes my language that will extend the period \nof time in which law enforcement officers can utilize DNA evidence to \nsolve crimes. Under current law, the statute of limitations for all \nFederal offenses starts when the crime is committed.\n  Under my language, if DNA evidence is found at the crime scene, the \nstatute of limitations for most crimes does not start to run until the \nDNA evidence is matched to a criminal in the database. This means that \ncriminals will not be able to escape justice merely because they were \nable to avoid capture for a specific period of time.\n  This bill also contains the Crime Victims Act for which I am an \noriginal cosponsor. This act provides victims with the right to be \nheard and considered during Federal criminal prosecutions.\n  As I know everyone here agrees, we owe it to rape victims, crime \nvictims in our society as a whole, to do all we can to apprehend \nviolent criminals. This bill takes a significant step in that \ndirection.\n  I thank Senator Hatch for his excellent leadership, being so \nsteadfast in doggedly pursuing the agreement necessary in the Senate to \npass this bill. Passage of this bill is a testament to his leadership \nas chairman of our committee. I also thank Senators Leahy, Biden, and \nFeinstein for working tirelessly to achieve this momentous outcome.\n  I thank Chairman Sensenbrenner, as well as Representative Delahunt in \nthe House for their outstanding leadership that resulted in a nearly \nunanimous vote of support by that body.\n  Our great Nation will be safer and our confidence in our standing \njudicial system will be reinforced as a result of this timely and much \nneeded legislation.\n  I would also like to thank the many staff who worked on this bill. \nSpecifically, I would like to recognize the Chief Counsels of the \nSenate and House Judiciary Committees for their commitment to get this \nbill done: Bruce Artim and Phil Kiko. I also thank Brett Tolman, who \ncrafted a key compromise in the bill that allowed the parties to come \ntogether; Katy Crooks, who worked tirelessly to better this bill; Jay \nApperson and Mark Agrast, who brought their outstanding wisdom to the \nprocess, Julie Katzman, Neil McBride, Jon Meyer, Christine Leonard, \nLouisa Terrell, Bruce Cohen, Tara Magner, David Brog, Ted Lehman and \nDavid Hantman for their strong knowledge of critical issues; and my \nexceptional legislative team that worked so very hard on this for me \nand the people of Ohio: Paul Palagyi, Peter Levitas, Robin Blackwell, \nAnn O'Donnell and my Crime Counsel Robert Steinbuch. And my former \nCrime Counsel Evelyn Fortier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hatch). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, under the previous order, I asked to be \nrecognized after the remarks of Senator DeWine. I really appreciate the \nleadership trying to work out our schedule. It has been a long couple \nof days. It is getting late into the night. I really appreciate \neverybody trying to work forward to getting some of these bills\n\n[[Page S10969]]\n\npassed. But as I said, one of the most important bills that we have \nremaining to pass is a $137 billion tax relief bill.\n  There are many good provisions in this bill. There are many \nindustries, large and small, in Louisiana that are going to be helped \nby it. I would have liked to have voted for the bill. There are energy \ntax breaks. There are shipping interests that are bolstered and \nsupported in here, which means a lot of jobs to Louisiana. I would have \nwanted to vote for this bill.\n  I am not going to be able to vote for the bill, and won't vote for \nthe bill unless we have some specific action on one provision--not the \nLandrieu provision, as some of the others have said, not an individual, \npersonal Landrieu provision, but the provision for the Guard and \nReserve, the men and women on the front line fighting for us whom every \nRepublican and every Democrat in this body voted to support. Everyone, \nall of the Senators, from both parties, by unanimous vote, voted to \nsend that provision over to the House to give modest tax relief to \nbusinesses, the small businesses and medium- and large-size businesses \nthat are keeping those paychecks going to the front line.\n  We thought it was a good idea to take $2 billion of the $137 billion \nto provide some tax relief for those employers so that the Guard and \nReserve that make up 40 percent of our armed services that are picking \nup more of the burden and are taking all the bullets on the front line, \nwhether it is in Iraq or Afghanistan or somewhere else, so their \npaychecks could be made whole.\n  I want people to understand. The Senate of the United States felt \nstrongly about that. But we sent the provision over. And when it got \nover to the House, it was summarily, unjustly, unconscionably cut out \nby the House Republican leadership. And it is a shame.\n  So over the course of the last few days, as we have tried to have \ndebates about this bill in the morning and the afternoon and into the \nevening, I have spoken about this issue. The reason this poster is up \nis because it is a visual of what is in the bill and what is out of the \nbill. Ceiling fans are in the bill. Ceiling fans are really important \nin Louisiana. I know they are to the Senator from Nevada because we are \nfrom States that are very hot. We like air-conditioning, and we like \nceiling fans. I am not picking on the ceiling fan industry. It is an \nimportant industry, and I am sure there is a good reason. I can't \narticulate what it is because it wasn't my provision. But someone could \nprobably give a good explanation as to why the ceiling fan industry is \ngetting a tax break.\n  But the Guard and Reserve, going to Iraq, taking the bullets, \nfighting on the front line, were left out of the bill, and ceiling fans \nare in the bill.\n  That is the truth. It is a shame. Many of us believe strongly that \nthis injustice needs to be corrected.\n  I see the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, has raised other issues that \nhe feels very strongly about that were either not addressed \nappropriately or properly in either this bill or several others. I want \nmy constituents to know, and I would like my colleagues to know, I do \nnot want to make these schedules difficult. I do not. I understand the \npressures that are on the Members of this body.\n  But I also understand the pressures that are on the families who have \ntheir father or mother or brother or sister or husband or wife on the \nfront line. I understand the pressures of these families. So do many \nother colleagues in this Chamber. If we can do something to help them, \nthen we should. Maybe we cannot get them in this bill. But I have had \nconversations with the good leadership on the Republican and Democratic \nside, who are working as we speak to find a way to help the Guard and \nReserve so they are not left out of this $137 billion tax bill with \nover 509 items. But they are not an item, they are not a line, they are \nnot a paragraph or diddly-squat in the bill. So we are talking about \nhow we could possibly get them included in some other bill that might \npass before we go home for the election.\n  I can promise you, in the elections that we are getting ready to \nhave, Members of Congress, Members of the Senate, the President, and \nthe challenger for the Presidency, our nominee, Senator Kerry--\neverybody is going to be taking pictures with the troops. I guess that \nis appropriate. But this Senator thinks that is enough of the pictures. \nCould we please put them in the budget?\n  I am not up for reelection this year, so this is not a campaign \nspeech. The people in Louisiana have been supporting our troops. Our \nGuard and Reserve are the best in the Nation. Maybe a Senator would \nargue, but we have awards to prove it. We win awards. We are about the \nbest--in the top 5 in the Nation. I know these men and women. They \ndon't ask for much. They don't ask to be on the front of every tax \nbreak and giveaway. They are willing to sacrifice. But for Heaven's \nsake, we are going to pass a tax bill and give everybody in America \n$137 billion and leave them out? I don't think that is right. I don't \nthink my colleagues think it is right or just.\n  I hope that sometime over the next 3 or 4 days that we are here--I \nknow it is Saturday night. I have two small children. I had to make \narrangements so I could be on the floor. I have a husband at home. I \nknow everybody is going to go to church tomorrow, and people were at \nsynagogue today and yesterday. I understand that. But I think we need \nto spend a little time talking about this issue. Why were they left \nout? How could we afford $137 billion and not afford a tax cut for \nthem? Was it too complicated to figure out?\n  There are a lot of complicated things in here. It would make people's \neyes twist if I explained how we were giving tax credits to foreign \ncorporations so they could close down here and go to the Bahamas and \nopen a post office box and get a tax check. There are more complicated \nthings in here than saying to businesses in America: Thank you for \nbeing patriotic and for voluntarily sending that paycheck to the front \nline, closing the gap between what the reservists make as part of the \nReserve and what they made for your company. We would like to honor \nthat and give you a tax credit. You can pick up 50 percent of the \nburden, and the Government can pick up the other half.\n  Evidently, this is too much for us to pick up. It is not too much for \nme to stand here. I know the hour is getting late. The Senator from \nIowa wants to speak. I just say again that I am going to get to the \nfloor over the course of the next few days and I will speak about this \nissue. I thank the leadership for working in a cooperative manner to \nallow that to happen because I am still hopeful that we can fix this \nbill. Maybe the President will veto the bill when he finds out it is \nnot in there. Maybe it could be fixed in a different way. Maybe another \nbill could be attached. I know if there is a way the leadership in this \nbody wants to fix this, they could. I think the men and women on the \nfront line deserve our best effort in that regard.\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Tobacco Regulation\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank a number of \npeople. I thank Senator DeWine for his dynamic and great leadership on \nthe issue of FDA regulation of tobacco products. He has been in the \nforefront of this fight for a long time. I thank him for his \nleadership, working again with Senator Kennedy on this issue and so \nmany others on both sides of the aisle to get that position established \nby the Senate, which we did, and that was that we would have a tobacco \nbuyout but also FDA regulation of tobacco, finally. We spoke on that, \nbut, of course, the House didn't go along, and we find ourselves now \nwith this great big tax bill of around 630 pages we have on our desk. \nGuess what. No FDA regulation of tobacco.\n  I thank Senator DeWine and I thank Senator Landrieu for her strong \nand dynamic leadership in being here on a Saturday night to continue to \nmake the point about what happened to our guardsmen and reservists in \nthe United States. It is unconscionable what the House and the \nPresident did on this issue. We ought to put the blame where it really \nlies; it is at the White House. That is where it lies. I might say the \nHouse, but they are just doing what the White House wants them to do. \nThey\n\n[[Page S10970]]\n\nare just a rubberstamp for the White House. It is the White House that \ncalled the shots on that one.\n  I thank Senator Landrieu for sticking up for our people in uniform, \nfor those all over the country who have been shortchanged by this so-\ncalled tax bill.\n  Mr. President, I want to take some time here to speak about tobacco \nand how unconscionable it is that this bill does not have FDA \nregulation of tobacco included. Over the last several days, we have \nheard a great deal about the dangers of smoking and the devastation \ncaused to millions of families every year. With the results of the \nconference report on Wednesday, I fear colleagues have not been \nlistening to the details of the public health crisis our Nation faces \nregarding tobacco and smoking.\n  Let me repeat them loudly and clearly so Members understand what they \nare opposing and why we so urgently need FDA regulation of tobacco.\n  One, smoking kills more than 450,000 Americans every year.\n  Over the last 10 years, smoking has claimed more than 4.4 million \nlives.\n  Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in this country.\n  Smoking causes heart disease, cancer, emphysema, and a host of other \nrelated illnesses.\n  Two-thousand kids start smoking every day, and, ultimately, one in \nthree will die of smoking-related causes.\n  Smoking-related medical expenditures have indirect costs resulting \nfrom lost work activity.\n  There are 250 chemicals in tobacco smoke that are toxic or cause \ncancer in humans.\n  Tobacco use accounts for at least 30 percent of all cancer deaths.\n  Smoking causes nearly 87 percent of all lung cancers, which is the \nleading cause of cancer deaths.\n  Last year, nearly 70,000 women died from lung cancer in the United \nStates. That is more deaths than from breast cancer and all \ngynecological cancers combined--70,000 women.\n  If these facts don't paint a stark picture of the urgency for FDA \nregulation of tobacco, I don't know what will. You know, when there is \nan outbreak of food poisoning in a local school, we move Heaven and \nEarth to find the source and take appropriate action to make sure our \nkids don't get sick again. But somehow, when it comes to protecting our \nkids from a known toxin--tobacco--we find our hands tied. Why? Well, it \nis because of big tobacco. There is too much at stake in terms of \nprofit loss for tobacco companies to allow this regulation to go \nthrough. They have been fighting it for years.\n  I introduced the first-ever comprehensive bipartisan FDA regulation \nwith, I might say, Senator Bob Graham and former Senator John Chafee of \nRhode Island.\n  That bill was introduced almost 6 years ago. I heard the same reasons \nthen that I do now on how unnecessary FDA regulation is. Quite frankly, \nour bill went much further and was much tougher than this one. Creating \na more sensible policy for tobacco has been a goal of mine for many \nyears. It was in 1977, in my second term in the House of \nRepresentatives, over 21 years ago, that I first introduced legislation \ncalling for repeal of the tax deductibility of tobacco advertising and \nmarketing.\n  Unfortunately, victories in the tobacco wars for consumers and for \nour kids have come few and far between. Tobacco wins every time.\n  With the mounting evidence we have today about the absolute dangers \nof smoking, it is paramount we pass a comprehensive plan that would \nonce and for all change how this Nation deals with tobacco and \ndramatically cut the number of our kids addicted to this deadly \nproduct.\n  That said, I am afraid the power of big tobacco has once again \nsuperseded the need to protect public health. The fact is we know now \nthat 90 percent of current smokers became hooked on tobacco as kids. \nThat should sound alarms that something needs to be done to stop this \nfrom happening, and to prevent senseless disease and death that is \nlinked with this addiction. This is a drug addiction. Tobacco is a \ndrug. It is addictive, just like methamphetamine, cocaine, and heroin. \nIt is addictive and it kills you.\n  For too long, kids have been getting an unfiltered message from the \ntobacco industry: Smoking is cool. Smoking is harmless. Smoking is \nglamorous. Smoking is for active young people and will make you look \nmore attractive.\n  Today, big tobacco companies spend more than $11.5 billion a year in \nadvertising and marketing their products. Children are exposed to \nmessages that are deliberately designed to attract a new generation to \nthe smoking habit. The motivations are clear: Anything to make more \nmoney for big tobacco.\n  Now we hear from tobacco companies all the time that, oh, no, their \nadvertising is to get people to shift brands, go from one brand to the \nother. Well, I will illustrate here very shortly that is not what they \nare up to.\n  Many think regulation is unwarranted after some of the restrictions \nthat were agreed to as part of the master settlement agreement a few \nyears ago. The good old MSA, the master settlement agreement. Yes, \nthere are billboard restrictions and a few things such as that, but now \nwe have much more sophisticated mechanisms.\n  Let me refresh some memories. Here is Joe Camel, a smooth character, \nJoe, flying his jet airplane with the afterburners going. He has a \nbeautiful young woman looking over her shoulder, looking at Joe Camel \nwith his Camel cigarette.\n  Who is this appealing to? Kids.\n  Now, there is another Joe Camel here. Here is Joe Camel, with Camel \nLights, cool Joe. He has his red convertible and black T-shirt and \nLevi's, and Joe is cool. Joe Camel is a neat guy.\n  Well, we forced big tobacco to get rid of Joe. They did. We do not \nsee Joe Camel any longer so we can take old Joe down. Joe Camel is \ngone. I want to refresh memories. I want to refresh memories, because \nthere was a time--and I will repeat this, there was a time--a study was \ndone that kids in America recognized Joe Camel more than \nthey recognized Mickey Mouse. It is true. But we got rid of Joe Camel.\n\n  One might ask, what now do you need? I will show my colleagues why we \nneed to have FDA regulation, because tobacco has gotten smart. They are \nnow spending more than ever on predatory marketing since the MSA was \nagreed to. Big tobacco is spending 60 percent more on marketing than \nthey were before the master settlement agreement.\n  Again, are they trying to get people to switch? Let us take a look. \nHere is Liquid Zoo. Now, I had a pack of those with me when we were in \nconference. I was one of the conferees arguing to keep the FDA \nregulation that we had in the Senate, and I had strawberry flavor. This \nwas Liquid Zoo, strawberry flavor. When you smell it, why, you would \nswear you were in a strawberry patch. It smelled wonderful. It smelled \nlike strawberries.\n  This is the tobacco. Liquid Zoo-flavored cigarettes are an exotic \nblend of strawberry-flavored tobaccos for a sweet, fresh taste and \naroma.\n  Do they really think they are trying to get someone to switch from \nMarlboros or Winstons or Camels to that? That is going right to our \nkids. That is what this is about.\n  Then we have Kool Rapper here. We have another one. Here is the Kool \nRapper. Here is a rapper. He is cool. He has his mike and he is \nspinning the disk or CD or whatever it is there, and everyone is \ndancing and that is called Kool Rapper.\n  Now, do my colleagues think they are trying to go after adults with \nthat? Do my colleagues think they are trying to go after 40 and 50-\nyear-old people to get them to switch from Marlboro or Winston or Camel \nto that? No. This is for kids. They are getting to young people. They \nare spending 60 percent more on marketing now than they did before the \nmaster settlement agreement, and we took away Joe Camel on billboards, \nbut now they are spending 60 percent more and this is where it is \ngoing.\n  Because what do they know? They know 90 percent of all tobacco \nsmokers today started when they were young. They get them hooked early.\n  I have another Kool Rapper here. This is just, again, special edition \npacks. Now, they do not any longer have the little coupons where you \ncan get gear and all that kind of stuff. That is gone, but now they \nhave special edition packs: Celebrate the sound track to the streets. \nIt does not take a genius to figure out who they are targeting with \nthat.\n\n[[Page S10971]]\n\n  So big tobacco has found tricks and dodges to circumvent the law, and \nthey have been very effective. From the birth of Joe Camel to the birth \nof Liquid Zoo and Kool Rapper, we have seen broken promises and bad \nfaith again and again from big tobacco.\n  Giving the FDA the power it needs to end these false messages is \nexactly what is needed to stop big tobacco's exploitation of our kids. \nThe only message our young kids should hear about tobacco is the truth: \nSmoking is a killer. It is a drug. It is addictive. It causes cancer. \nIt causes emphysema. It causes a lot of other illnesses. That message \nneeds to come through loudly and clearly. Since industry will not \nconvey that message, we need strong FDA regulation to make it happen.\n  Instead, what do we do here now with this big tax bill we have? We \nallow big tobacco to further confuse kids when it comes to the actual \nsafety of cigarettes.\n  This morning I got up and I had my Cheerios. I actually had a bowl of \nCheerios this morning. Now, the bowl of Cheerios I ate this morning had \nto go through a multistep process set up by the Food and Drug \nAdministration to earn its health claims that it is heart healthy and \nlowers cholesterol. It had to go through certain steps.\n  Somehow tobacco, a known health risk, does not have to go through any \nof those steps whatsoever. In fact, tobacco companies are free to add \nanything they want to their product without having to inform consumers \nor without any regard to the health effects of those additives.\n  For example, tobacco companies have added ammonia to their products. \nI do not know if my colleagues have ever smelled ammonia, but they get \nan idea of what it is like. They add ammonia to tobacco products on the \nground that it improves ``tobacco satisfaction.'' They add the ammonia \nin order to create a ``free base'' form of nicotine that creates the \nhighly addictive quick delivery form of nicotine to the brain. It goes \nfrom your lungs to your brain in 8 to 10 seconds when they add ammonia. \nWe know this. So tobacco companies add ammonia so that you get a bigger \nkick right away, in 8 to 10 seconds. Adding ammonia to cigarettes is \nanalogous to what crack cocaine was to cocaine--it just gives you a \nfaster high, it goes to your brain quicker. But guess what. The tobacco \ncompanies do not have to tell you that. They just tell you have a Kool \nWrapper there. They don't have to tell you anything else.\n\n  The industry claims that many of its ingredients are benign flavoring \nagents like strawberry that are on the FDA GRAS list. That stands for \nGenerally Recognized As Safe. The tobacco companies say we put these \ningredients in and they are benign; however, those ingredients such as \nchocolate, licorice, and other flavors are not safe when they are \ncombusted, and they often create toxic chemicals when they are inhaled \nby the smoker. So, yes, maybe licorice is safe to eat, but when you \ncombust it, then it creates toxics that you inhale. The industry will \nnot tell you that either.\n  No other industry in America is allowed to add ingredients to their \nproducts without first having them tested and approved by the Federal \nDrug Administration for safety. For example, Kraft Foods, a subsidiary \nof Altria Group along with Philip Morris, could not add ammonia to \nKraft macaroni and cheese on the grounds that it improves cheese \nsatisfaction for its customers. Why can't they add ammonia to macaroni \nand cheese? They can't add ammonia to macaroni and cheese because it is \nnot on the FDA list of products that are generally recognized as safe. \nThey can add ammonia to cigarettes; they can't add it to Kraft macaroni \nand cheese. The FDA has more authority to regulate macaroni and cheese \nthan it does cigarettes. Imagine that.\n  I have this to show what I mean by that. Here is something called \nOmni cigarettes. Here is what it reads:\n\n       Omni is the first premium cigarette created to \n     significantly reduce carcinogenic PAHs and nitrous amines, \n     which are the major causes of lung cancer in smoking.''\n\n  That is what they say.\n  Says who? The tobacco company says that. But we have no way of \nverifying that. They can make all the claims they want, like low tar, \nlight, less carcinogenic, but we the public have no way to verify that \nbecause the Federal Food and Drug Administration has no authority to \nregulate tobacco or to go in and tell us what is in there or to make \nthe tobacco companies verify what they say.\n  I have an Eclipse one here, too. Here is an Eclipse. This is \ninteresting:\n\n       The best choice for smokers who worry about their health is \n     to quit. Here is the next best choice. Are you ready for \n     Eclipse? Get the facts.\n       I have the support of my wife..if I'm going to smoke, she'd \n     prefer I smoke Eclipse.\n       A better way to smoke.\n\n  Talk about a warped message:\n\n       Omni, there is no better way to smoke.\n\n  A better way to smoke? There is a better way to get cancer. There is \na better way to get emphysema. This cigarette will give it to you \nfaster. They don't tell you that, but that is what is happening.\n  During debate in the conference committee, one of my colleagues on \nthe House side mentioned that the Founding Fathers would be shocked if \nthey knew that Congress was trying to regulate an industry that was in \npart responsible for the early prosperity of our country. It is more \nlikely that they are rolling over in their graves at the fact that we \nhave known for more than 30 years that tobacco kills and that we have \nnot done one thing about it. They didn't know it in the 1700s. They \ndidn't know, but we know now.\n\n  The Congress is now considering, one more time, giving immunity to \nbig tobacco and turning a blind eye to their responsibility to protect \nour kids and the public health. That is what is not in this tax bill. \nThere are tax breaks for all kinds of things. There are tax breaks in \nhere for gamblers who come from foreign countries to gamble here. \nImagine that, they need a tax break. There is a tax break in here for \npeople who import ceiling fans from China.\n  Lord only knows what else is in this tax bill. No one has really read \nit. No one knows what all these numbers and staff mean. There is a tax \nbreak here and a tax gimmick there; a tax break here and a tax gimmick \nthere.\n  When this bill was before the Senate, this Senate added a provision \nthat did two things. It allowed for a buyout of tobacco farmers' \nquotas--which I have been in favor of for years, by the way. Coupled \nwith that is FDA regulation of tobacco.\n  Again, as someone who sits on the Agriculture Committee and also on \nthe HELP Committee, I have been involved in both sides. I have espoused \nfor a long time that we have a tobacco buyout, that we buy out these \nquotas. Why should we do that? These quotas were put on 60 or 70 years \nago. They have been built into the price of the land. I can't go back \nand undo that. It is a fact of life. Many farmers in tobacco growing \nStates--some of them are small farmers. All they have is that quota. \nThey don't have anything else. The land is really not worth that much. \nSo it is like taking away their income base. So I have always said we \nneed to buy these quotas out and get rid of this tobacco program for \nonce and for all. On the HELP Committee side, I have also said, if we \nare going to do that, then we ought to have FDA jurisdiction over \ntobacco.\n  This debate went on and on for years, and final we agreed. I might \nsay that Philip Morris was one of those who agreed with us. I commend \nthem for that. So we got it through the Senate.\n  It goes to the House. Guess what the House did. The tobacco buyout \nthat we passed in the Senate, the money that is going to go to those \ntobacco farmers did not come from the taxpayers. It came from the \ntobacco companies. Of course, the tobacco companies will pass that on \nto tobacco smokers, so the smokers were going to pay for the buyout of \nthe quotas. That is as it should be. Why should the taxpayers pay for \nit? We agreed on that. Philip Morris agreed on that. We agreed that we \nwould have FDA jurisdiction.\n  Here is what the House did. They broke that agreement. First of all, \nthe House of Representatives, and I am sure with the approval of the \nBush White House because they wouldn't have done it unless the White \nHouse agreed, they made the buyout of the quotas paid for by the \ntaxpayers of the country. All of you who do not smoke, you are now \ngoing to pay to buy out those tobacco farmers. That is what was in the \nHouse bill, plus they took away the FDA jurisdiction over tobacco.\n\n[[Page S10972]]\n\n  In the final analysis, they put back in the companies paying for the \nbuyout, but they left out the FDA regulation of tobacco. So here we \nare. No FDA regulation. That is what is not in this FSC bill.\n  It was my understanding the purpose of this bill was to repeal an \nillegal export subsidy. Now it has morphed into a big special interest \ngiveaway that will help everyone from restaurant owners to makers of \nbows and arrows, tackle boxes, sonar fishfinders, NASCAR track owners, \nAlaskan whalers, foreign gamblers, as I mentioned, who win at U.S. \nhorse and dog tracks.\n  I want to repeat that.\n  In this bill, there are provisions to give tax breaks to foreign \ngamblers who win at U.S. horse and dog tracks. Those interests trump \nthe 2,000 kids hooked on smoking every day by the big tobacco \ncompanies. Imagine that.\n  What are our priorities around here? What is the priority of the \nWhite House? I am telling you it could never have happened unless the \nPresident signed off on it.\n  You go out there, Mr. President. You have some more days before the \nelection. Go out there and tell the American people how you pulled the \nrug from underneath FDA regulations of tobacco, how you sided with the \nbig tobacco companies to get our kids hooked on tobacco every day--\n2,000 every day. Go out and look those mothers and fathers in the eye \nand tell them your priority is the big tobacco companies and not their \nkids.\n  Yes. This would never have been done if the White House had not OK'd \ntaking FDA jurisdiction away. Shame on the White House.\n  We had the opportunity here to pass this legislation once and for \nall, and to stamp out youth smoking in this country and protect kids \nfrom joining the ranks of the 450,000 who die from smoking each year. \nThe tobacco industry has been engaged in a systematic campaign of \ndistortion and deceit to hook kids and hide the facts from the American \npeople for far too long.\n  I met a fifth grader, Ted Stanton, from Des Moines, IA, a few months \nago who reminded me how important regulation is. Ted won a statewide \nposter contest sponsored by the American Academy of Family Physicians \nfor his efforts to raise awareness about smoking. He is a fifth grader. \nWhat happened was Ted has had to watch his dad struggle with the habit \nof smoking for years. He drew a poster. His poster is an attempt to \nwarn kids about smoking.\n  Here is his poster and here is why he won the prize. ``Invest in your \nfuture.'' He has the date 2054. ``Pay to the order of big tobacco \ncompanies $73,000.'' That is $4 a pack every day times 50 years. In \nother words, you smoke a pack a day for 53 years and you will pay big \ntobacco companies $73,000.\n  I thought Ted Stanton, a fifth grader, really pointed it out. That is \nwhat you are doing when you start smoking. You are going to smoke for \n50 years, if you are a teenager, a pack a day, $73,000.\n  We do have some kids like Ted and others who realize they are being \ntargeted by big tobacco, but they are defenseless. What are we doing to \nhelp them? What we are doing is protecting big tobacco--the same guys \nwho conspired years ago to hide the truth about tobacco and instead \npushed their deadly products on our most valued treasure, our kids.\n  It is disgraceful that this body has not acted yet. It is disgraceful \nthat we are getting half of the deal we had worked on for years, the \ntobacco buyout of the quotas. Guess what happened. The way they worked \nthis tobacco quota buyout is you are going to buy out the quotas, but \nnow tobacco will be growing cheaper. Now the tobacco companies will be \nable to buy tobacco cheaper than they had before, making more money, \nhooking more kids, without FDA authority.\n  The reason I say that is because when we passed the bill in the \nSenate, we had a provision that provided for a licensing program that \nwould prohibit more and more people growing tobacco in this country. \nThe House took that out. So we got the worst of all possible worlds--no \nFDA regulation, a buyout of the quotas, more people will be able to \ngrow tobacco, and the tobacco companies will get it cheaper and make \nmore money to hook our kids. What a deal. Yet we can take care of \nforeign gamblers who come to bet on horses. But we can't take care of \nour kids. Shame on us.\n\n  (Mr. HATCH assumed the Chair.)\n  I know the hour is getting late. I see the occupant of the Chair, \nsomeone for whom I have great respect, the Senator from Utah.\n  I will state publicly that the senior Senator from Utah has also been \nin the forefront of the fight against tobacco. He always has been. I \ncompliment him for that. I know he feels as strongly about antismoking \nand stopping kids from smoking as I do, or as Senator DeWine does, or \nSenator Kennedy, or anybody else does. The Senator from Utah has been \nstalwart in his support for getting FDA regulation of tobacco. I thank \nhim for that. I encourage him to keep up his leadership on that because \nwe have not yet fired the last shot. We are going to be back.\n  I wish the President of the United States, using the bully pulpit of \nthe White House, had come out in an address to the Nation and said we \nneed FDA regulations for tobacco, we need to stop our kids from getting \nhooked, and call upon the House and the Senate and say he will not sign \nthis bill, he will veto this bill unless we protect our kids.\n  Think of what would have happened if the President of the United \nStates had said that. We would have a tax bill here, but we would have \nFDA regulation of tobacco in here. I am sorry the President missed a \ngolden opportunity and thus we have missed a golden opportunity. Thus, \ntomorrow and the day after, and next month, and next month, and next \nyear, thousands of kids every day might pick up a pack of Liquid Zoo, \nbecause it smells nice. It tastes like strawberries. They will say, \nThere is no harm in that, plus it makes me look glamorous. That is what \nall the ads say.\n  Think about it. That is what is going to happen. Shame on us.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I see the occupant of the chair, and I know he wants to \ngo home. But I said to the managers I can be interrupted when they are \nready to wrap up. I want the occupant to know I am not holding him \nhere.\n  I will talk about one other item that is not in this FSC bill that we \ngot stiffed on. We passed it four times in the Senate and twice in the \nHouse. I am talking about overturning the regulations that this \nadministration put out that will deny overtime rights to over 6 million \npeople.\n  Again, just last week, in a replay of what happened a year ago, the \nBush administration used the conference to kill my provision to stop \nthe Department of Labor's new rule on overtime pay that if allowed to \nstand will strip 6 million people of their right to time and a half \novertime.\n  The bill before the Senate today serves the simplest of purposes. \nThis tax bill has everything in it for everyone, but what is not in it \nis protection for the workers of America, protection for those who make \nover $23,660 a year. Actually, for some below because of little \ngimmicks that can be used to deny them their right to overtime.\n  Again, this is simply a matter of fairness. People believe if they \nput in more than 40 hours of work a week, they are giving up premium \ntime, time with their family. I had a woman who wrote me and said: \nLook, I go home from work and my second job starts. I go home, take \ncare of my kids, I get dinner ready, help them with their homework, and \nthen I have to do washing, and this and that. But my time with my \nfamily is my premium time. If I am asked to give up my premium time \nwith my family to work on my job, I ought to get premium pay.\n  What the Bush administration has done is said: No, sorry, we will ask \nyou to work overtime and we will not pay you one cent more.\n  Again, a little history. It has been sacrosanct since 1938, the Fair \nLabor Standards Act. If you work over 40 hours a week, you get time-\nand-a-half pay. It has been that way since 1938. We\n\n[[Page S10973]]\n\nhave modified it a little bit here, a little bit there, but every \nsingle time we have changed the Fair Labor Standards Act, we have \nenlarged the pool of people who get covered by time and a half. This is \nthe first time where up to 6 million people will lose their right to \novertime pay.\n  Now, some will say but they raised the base to $23,660. In other \nwords, anyone who earns under that is automatically eligible for \novertime. Quite frankly, most people working there are already eligible \nbecause they are not salaried, they are hourly workers. While that is \nfine, we should raise the base. The administration then went and took \naway overtime pay rights for anyone making over $23,660 a year. If you \nare making $23,661, you are in a separate category. Just barely over--\nwell, that is poverty wages--and you still are not eligible for time \nand a half overtime.\n  I also say every time since 1938 when we have changed the Fair Labor \nStandards Act, it has come to Congress. We go through the committees, \nthe committees have hearings, we bring in witnesses, they draft a bill, \nit is debated in the Senate, and it finally goes to the President. That \nis the way it ought to be. That is transparent; it is open; everyone \ngets their say. We can debate it and amend it. We, the elected \nrepresentatives of the people, get to debate and amend it--a strange \nconcept, I guess, to this administration.\n\n  What this administration did 1\\1/2\\ years ago, sort of in the stealth \nof night without having one public hearing, they promulgated these new \nrules on overtime.\n  Some might say: Well, they have had hearings since then. Yes, thanks \na lot, after the horse is out of the barn and they closed the door. \nFine. But that is not the way it should have been.\n  So now we have a situation where they finalize the rules on August \n23. We have never really debated or amended that in the Senate. I have \non four different occasions in the Senate offered amendments to \noverturn those rules, to go back to square one, to start over. Let's do \nit the right way. We have passed them here, but the administration says \nno every time.\n  I watched the debate last night, and I heard the President talking \nabout domestic policies and jobs and economic growth. And I thought, \nwait a minute, he even talked about overtime. He said people are \nworking overtime. I heard him say it last night. I thought, they are \nworking overtime, but what the administration wants to do is take away \ntheir overtime pay.\n  That is exactly what is happening. We have facts. We have the data. \nPeople are now being denied time and a half overtime for working over \n40 hours a week because they are being ``reclassified.'' Guess who is \ngetting hit first. Women. Why do I say that? Many women raise families, \nstart later in life, and start at lower income jobs. Many of these are \nsalaried positions. Because they are on a salary, they will be \nreclassified. As they get reclassified, they will be exempt from the \novertime laws. If overtime is free to the employer, it will be \noverused.\n  This chart shows a study by the Center for Women's Work at Rutgers \nUniversity. The chart shows those who are eligible for overtime, in the \ngreen, are protected; the red are not protected. Those protected by \novertime work are about 20 percent of workers working 40 hours a week. \nIf they are protected, chances are 20 percent of these people work over \n40 hours a week. If they are not protected by overtime, 44 percent of \nthese people work over 40 hours a week--twice as many. So now we will \ntake away this protection from this 20 percent. Then they will be \nworking overtime, and they will not get paid for it.\n  Right now, if they are covered by overtime protection, only 5 percent \nwork over 50 hours a week. If they are not covered by overtime, 15 \npercent, three times as many people not covered by overtime laws work \nover 50 hours a week.\n  That says it right there. If the employer does not have to pay you \ntime and a half, work them more, and they will not hire any new \nworkers.\n  It is interesting to note--the occupant of the chair will find this \ninteresting--in 1933, 5 years before the Fair Labor Standards Act was \nsigned into law, the Senate voted 53 to 30 to set a cap on the number \nof hours in a workweek. Was the cap 50 hours? Was it 40 hours? No, it \nwas 30 hours. Imagine in 1933, this Senate, in this Chamber, voted 53 \nto 30 to say that the workweek would be 30 hours. You could not pass 60 \nhours here now. Imagine that. In 1933, this Senate voted 53 to 30 to \nset a 30-hour workweek. Amazing. The compromise was reached 5 years \nlater at 40 hours a week, and that is what it has been ever since.\n\n  Again, we know what the intent of this proposed rule is. The intent \nof this proposed rule is to allow employers to work employees longer \nthan 40 hours a week and not have to pay them time and a half. And we \nhave a final rule on that, a final rule. These are going to be low- to \nmiddle-income workers. They are not organized. They do not have a \nstrong voice. So the administration feels they can run roughshod over \ntheir rights.\n  For the life of me, I cannot understand this. People work hard. Many \nfamilies are working two jobs where the husband and wife are both \nworking, trying to make ends meet, trying to save a little money to put \naway for the kid's college education, maybe to buy a better house, move \nup the ladder a little bit. For those who work overtime, 25 percent of \ntheir income comes from overtime.\n  I see the managers are here to wrap up. I will just conclude by \nsaying that, again, just as it is a shame and a shame on us that we do \nnot have FDA control of tobacco, shame on us also, and shame on this \nadministration, for taking away the overtime rights of 6 million people \nin this country.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I express my strong support for the \nconference report to accompany the American Jobs Creation Act. In order \nto protect our domestic manufacturers, strengthen our economy, better \nhelp U.S.-based multinational firms compete globally, and honor our \ntrade obligations, the Senate must pass this critically important and \noverdue legislation before recessing for the elections.\n  I wish to start by congratulating the chairman of the conference \ncommittee on this bill, Congressman Bill Thomas, and the cochairman, \nSenator Chuck Grassley, for their leadership and exceptional \ncooperation in finishing the conference on this bill in time to bring \nit to the House and Senate floor this week. Many thought completion of \nthis task would be difficult or impossible, given the large differences \nin the Senate and House versions and the time constraints the \nconference committee faced.\n  The innovative conference process developed by the chairman and \ncochairman made success possible. Conferencing a large and diverse pair \nof tax bills in the usual fashion could have taken many weeks and led \nto a likely failure to finish this bill before sine die adjournment of \nthe 108th Congress. Again, I recognize the extraordinary achievement of \nthis conference committee and thank its leaders and my fellow conferees \nfor their hard and dedicated work.\n  This conference report represents what we hope will be the \nculmination of a very lengthy and fascinating issue that had its \ngenesis decades ago but has festered into a growing problem over the \npast several years.\n  I will leave to others to go into detail about the long history of \nthe export subsidies in our tax law that gave rise to this conference \nreport, but the unusual nature of this bill and its difficulty in \npassing the Congress are reflections of the complexity of this issue.\n  The crux of the difficulty of the bill is that the rulings of the \nWorld Trade Organization on the trade-legality of our export tax \nsubsidies put the Congress in a very tough position. In essence, we \nfound ourselves needing to repeal these export subsidies, known as the \nForeign Sales Corporation, FSC, provision and its replacement regime \nknown as the Extraterritorial Income, ET, exclusion.\n  By repealing these provisions, which we must do in order to honor our \ntrade obligations, we effectively raise taxes by almost $6 billion per \nyear on thousands of U.S. businesses that manufacture goods for export.\n  Leaving it at this is simply unacceptable. Why should we have to \nconvert a provision designed to help U.S. manufacturers compete in an \never-increasingly difficult global marketplace to a\n\n[[Page S10974]]\n\nsituation where they suffer a competitive disadvantage?\n  Yet, this is exactly the problem the Congress faces now that it is \nforced to repeal the export tax benefits.\n  When confronted with a similar problem in 2000 after the WTO ruled \nthe FSC provision to be in violation of international trade rules, \nCongress passed the ETI in its place. With the ETI, we were able \nlargely to replicate the benefits of the FSC regime, so that exporting \ntaxpayers paid few if any extra taxes with the repeal of FSC. \nUnfortunately, the WTO subsequently ruled that the ETI provision also \nwas an illegal trade subsidy that also must be repealed.\n  So, the conundrum facing the Congress with this situation was to find \na way to enact other tax cut benefits for exporting manufacturers, to \noffset the increase from repealing ETI, without violating the WTO \nrules.\n  Unfortunately, this has proven impossible, so both the Senate and \nHouse bills attempted to find rough justice for business taxpayers by \nfinding other ways to deliver tax benefits besides basing them on \nexports. Such attempts gave rise to the political and practical \ndifficulties of this bill, including the fact that it took many months \nof hard effort to reach the point we are today.\n  For example, my own bill to address the FSC/ETI problem was S. 1475, \nthe Promote Growth and Jobs in the USA Act, which I introduced in July \n2003. This bill would have delivered rough justice tax relief in two \nways.\n  First, it would simplify and rationalize the international tax rules \nthat currently harm the ability of U.S. firms to compete globally, and \nsecond, it would provide incentives for companies to increase their \nability to produce goods by acquiring new equipment and engaging in \nmore research and development.\n  Other FSC/ETI solution bills were also introduced. On the same day I \nintroduced S. 1475, Chairman Thomas introduced H.R. 2896, the American \nJobs Creation Act. The two bills were similar in many ways, and both \nincluded international tax reforms. The Thomas bill, however, included \na number of other provisions designed to help U.S. businesses create \njobs and better compete.\n  Another bill, introduced last year by Congressmen Crane, Rangel, and \nManzullo, offered a different direction still. This bill provided a \ndeduction equal to 10 percent of a company's production activities.\n  In the Senate, Senators Grassley and Baucus introduced a bill that \nincluded some of the best elements of all the other bills. Even though \nI preferred the solution set forth in my bill, I cosponsored the \nGrassley-Baucus bill because it represents a solid and reasonable \nsolution to the problem. This bill, as modified, became the legislation \nreported by the Finance Committee and passed by the Senate.\n  After a great deal of travail and adjustments, the House also passed \na FSC/ETI bill, and it was quite similar in many respects to the first \nThomas American Jobs Creation Act. These are the bills the conference \ncommittee had to combine into one.\n  The result, as we all know, is a bill that is far from perfect. Its \nenactment will result in a net tax increase for some exporting \ncompanies that now use the ETI provision, and in a net tax cut for many \nother U.S. manufacturing firms that may have not taken advantage of the \nETI exclusion.\n  And while the bill includes many important other provisions, it \nleaves out some very important provisions that the Senate conferees \nagreed with me should be in there. Unfortunately, the House conferees \ndisagreed and they were omitted from the final product.\n  For example, I am personally very disappointed that the House \nconferees voted against including the CLEAR ACT in this conference \nreport. This bill, which has passed the Senate at least three times and \nalso has passed the House, would transform our auto industry by \ngranting strong tax incentives for consumers who buy alternative fueled \nand advance technology vehicles, such as hybrid electric cars.\n  Moreover, it would move us to a more responsible age of cleaner air \nand less fuel dependency on the Middle East by simultaneously breaking \ndown the three barriers that keep our nation from adopting the already-\nexisting technology to help us meet these goals--the higher cost of \nsuch vehicles, the higher cost of alternative fuel, and the lack of a \nrefueling infrastructure.\n  From a broader point of view, most of my fellow Senate conferees and \nI would have liked to see the entire set of energy tax provisions from \nthe Senate-passed bill included in the conference report. It was a \nmistake to omit these important provisions.\n  I also very much regret that the House conferees refused to adopt the \namendment I offered, accepted by the Senate conferees, which would have \nbolstered our research tax credit. While it is true that the research \ncredit was extended for a short time in the most recently passed tax \nbill dealing with individual tax cuts, that legislation left out an \nimportant element that was contained in the Senate FSC/ETI bill \ndesigned to improve the incentives this provision gives for companies \nto engage in R activities.\n  Nevertheless, the conference report is worthy of our support. As I \nmentioned, as a nation we must honor the obligations under the World \nTrade Organization. Of more immediate importance is the fact that the \nEuropeans are levying an increasing level of trade sanctions against \ncertain of our products exported to the E. U. This level is currently \nat 12 percent and is growing by one percentage point per month and is \ndefinitely having a very serious negative effect on certain U.S. \nindustries.\n  Moreover, the trade sanctions are authorized to continue to increase \nuntil next March, when they will have reached 17 percent. After this, \nthe E. U. may authorize even more serious sanctions against us that \nwould surely harm our economic growth.\n  As all of my colleagues well know, if we do not succeed in passing \nthis conference report before sine die adjournment of the 108th \nCongress, we must start the process all over again next year.\n  Will this result in a better bill?\n  Perhaps, but such an outcome is far from certain. What is more likely \nis that the resolution to this issue would be delayed for many more \nmonths, giving the trade sanctions more time to damage our economy and \nharm U.S. businesses.\n\n  Now, I take a few minutes to discuss some of the specific provisions \nthat did make it into the conference report and why I believe my \ncolleagues should enthusiastically support them.\n  First, let me express my satisfaction that this conference report has \na good balance to it. In addition to the vital repeal of the ETI \nprovision and the quite reasonable transition relief it provides for \ncurrent ETI users, the bill offers significant provisions for both \nsmall businesses and large multinational firms. Mixed in is a generous \nportion of important tax relief for business interests of all kinds.\n  Central among these relief provisions is the manufacturing deduction. \nThis provision is designed to lower the tax burden of any business \nentity that engages in production activities in the United States. I am \nhappy to see that the Senate provision allowing this deduction to be \ntaken by unincorporated businesses was retained in conference.\n  Also included in the conference report is a significant section of \nrelief designed specifically for small businesses. Foremost in this \ncategory are the five sections that would simplify and reform the \ntaxation of S corporations. These are changes I have long sought. Along \nwith my colleagues, Senators Breaux, Smith, and Lincoln, we have \nattempted to get these and other S corporation improvements passed for \nseveral years now. I am gratified to see them included in the \nconference report.\n  Other provisions that are very important to the balance of this bill \nare those designed to simplify and improve the rules by which this \nNation taxes international business transactions. Quite simply, the \ncurrent state of our international tax rules is appalling. This part of \nour Tax Code generally dates back to the early 1960s, and was designed \nfor a different world from the one in which we live now.\n  U.S. businesses, whether large, medium, or smaller, that decide to \nexpand their markets beyond the borders of the United States confront a \nset of tax rules that are not only mind-numbingly complex, but far \nworse result in double taxation and often leave them on the down side \nof a tilted playing board when compared with competitors based in most \nother industrialized nations.\n\n[[Page S10975]]\n\n  Our rules governing the foreign tax credit, for example, which are \ndesigned to eliminate the double taxation of income, often are \nineffective, some blatantly so. A provision added to the Internal \nRevenue Code in 1986 reduces the foreign tax credit by 10 percent to \nthe extent it reduces the alternative minimum tax. There is little or \nno justification for this double taxation that I can see, and this \nconference report repeals this unfair provision.\n  The bill includes about two dozen provisions that will help improve \nthe tax law for our companies that have expanded their markets \noverseas. I have long been interested in getting this type of reform \npassed by the Congress, having introduced bills to do this since the \nmid-1990s. It is gratifying to finally see this long overdue relief \ncome to pass.\n  Some of my colleagues have incorrectly concluded that improving our \nrules on international taxation will give an incentive to U.S. \ncompanies to move their jobs overseas. This is unfortunate. Cross-\nborder investing is not only a necessity of our modern world, it is \nusually beneficial to both nations. Most U.S. companies that invest in \nexpansion into markets in other nations do so to compete effectively \nwith other suppliers in those markets and here at home.\n  A fact of life of our modern economy is that our U.S.-based business \nenterprises face competition from all parts of the globe. It is \nunrealistic to think that an American business can simply focus on \nmarkets here at home and thrive. Instead, most of today's businesses \nmust be mindful of both markets and material and labor supplies around \nthe world if they are to stay in business very long.\n  While no one likes to see U.S. jobs move overseas, we should be more \nconcerned about creating and maintaining in the United States the kind \nof environment that attracts businesses. Part of that environment is \nensuring that our tax system does not drive businesses offshore to \nother nations that tax them in a more favorable fashion. This bill \nmoves our tax system a big step in that direction, and I am pleased to \nsee these changes finally reach the point where they are about to \nbecome law.\n  I now say a few words about the issues regarding tobacco associated \nwith this conference report. I have not forgotten that at the center of \nthe tobacco buyout is the tobacco farmer. I understand that the tobacco \nprice support and tobacco quota programs have helped to secure a \nreasonable living for many family farmers.\n  I have also come to the understanding that breaking the dependency of \nU.S. citizens and especially children on nicotine requires us to \naddress the dependency of tobacco growers on the tobacco industry and \non the government programs. It will not be an easy transition for many \ntobacco growers, and we need to help these families to survive it.\n\n  Contrary to the belief of some, the United States Department of \nAgriculture, USDA, does not provide a direct subsidy to tobacco \ngrowers. However, the USDA does maintain artificially high prices for \ntobacco leaf by managing the loan, or-price support, program for \ntobacco growers which serves to maintain artificially high prices for \ntobacco and cigarettes in this country.\n  The USDA also manages the tobacco quota system to keep down the \namount of tobacco grown each year. This, again, keeps the price of \ntobacco and cigarettes high. All direct and administrative costs for \nthese two programs are reimbursed to the USDA by tobacco farmers and \ntheir trade association. There is no net cost to the government as a \nresult of the tobacco program. In fact, smokers carry most of the \nburden of the tobacco program through higher costs for the tobacco \nproducts they purchase.\n  Shifting tobacco farming away from tight government management toward \nthe free market has risks for our farmers. This proposal does a good \njob of getting the government out the farming business while making \ntemporary assistance available to farmers as they adjust to the free \nmarket. And, it is at no cost to our government.\n  As far as the provision requiring the Food and Drug Administration to \nregulate tobacco, let me say that I fully support measures to end \ntobacco use in the United States.\n  I can think of few public health dangers worse than tobacco, and this \nis especially true for young people.\n  I have heard from many concerned parents and health advocates in Utah \nwho point out the need to stop the devastating health consequences of \ntobacco use.\n  In many aspects, the DeWine/Kennedy language was written to achieve \nthat goal, and in that spirit I supported it in conference. In fact, \nmuch of the bill is taken from a measure that I authored several years \nago with Senator Dianne Feinstein.\n  That being said, I am concerned about some aspects of the way the \nbill was written, and especially the impact of this language on the \nresources of the Food and Drug Administration.\n  First, the Committee of jurisdiction, the HELP Committee, should have \nthe opportunity to consider this legislation before it is brought to \nthe full Senate for a vote the next time. Having been the chairman of \nthat committee for several years, I know full well the complexities of \nthe Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Three hours of debate on the \nSenate floor was not enough time to consider legislation that made such \ndramatic changes to current law.\n  I also want to make sure that we in the Congress are clear about the \nimpact that such legislation would have on the Food and Drug \nAdministration and whether or not the FDA has adequate resources to \nregulate tobacco, and, in addition, keep up with its other, extremely \nimportant responsibilities, such as the approval of drugs, medical \ndevices, and protecting our food supply.\n  While I understand that user fees were included in the legislation, I \nam not convinced that those user fees would have provided the FDA with \nsufficient resources to regulate tobacco. I am someone who has fought \nto provide FDA with adequate resources and have led the fight on \nunifying the FDA campus. I do not want anything to jeopardize the \nprogress we have made in those areas so before we consider similar \nlegislation again. I believe it is imperative to work closely with the \nFDA to find out exactly how much money is necessary for the agency to \nregulate tobacco, and whether or not the agency is capable of \noverseeing the regulation of tobacco.\n  Again, let me make one thing perfectly clear--I believe that tobacco \nshould be regulated, however, it needs to be a well-thought-out \nprocess. Therefore, allowing the proper committees of jurisdiction to \nreview and consider the legislation and consultation with the FDA must \ntake place before similar legislation is voted upon by the full Senate \nand House of Representatives before we consider another measure.\n  Finally, I want to touch on some of the revenue offsets included in \nthe conference report. I want to make it clear that I support the \nprinciple of keeping this bill revenue neutral, and I congratulate the \nconferees for doing so. This was a particularly sticky problem with the \nHouse Members, so I especially recognize their hard work in bowing to \nthe Senate's demands that this bill be fully offset.\n  I am very pleased to see that several revenue offset provisions that \nwere in the Senate bill are not part of the conference report. One of \nthese is the codification of the economic substance doctrine. I believe \nenactment of this provision would have led to a great deal of \nunnecessary conflicts between taxpayers and the Internal Revenue \nService, and would have unfairly penalized companies for engaging in \nlegitimate tax planning techniques.\n  One provision that did make it into the conference report raises \nrevenue in connection with the donation of used vehicles. In essence, \nthe provision requires that taxpayers wait to take a deduction for the \ndonation of a used vehicle until the donee charity has sold the item in \nan auction. Then, the deduction is limited to the actual purchase \nprice.\n  While this may appear to be a reasonable requirement, particularly in \nlight of some of the alleged abuse surrounding the charitable donation \nof used vehicles, I am concerned that these changes will result in far \nfewer used vehicles being donated to charities. Some charities, such as \nthe National Kidney Foundation of Utah, rely heavily on such donation \nprograms for a great deal of their funding. A chilling\n\n[[Page S10976]]\n\neffect on the donation of these used cars could leave many worthy \ncharities short of vital funds needed to perform their invaluable \nservices to needy citizens in Utah and elsewhere.\n  I will keep a watchful eye over the implementation of this change in \nthe law, to make certain it does not harm the charities that have \nrelied on donated vehicles for funding. While I agree that we should \npreclude any real abuse of the law, I do not think we should create a \nburdensome new requirement that would discourage charitable giving. It \nmay well be that we need to revisit this area of the law in the future.\n  In conclusion, the conference report before us represents a good bill \nthat deserves our support.\n  As I have tried to indicate in these remarks, the bill is far from \nperfect. But given the very difficult political and other circumstances \nsurrounding the issues this bill addresses, it is remarkable we were \nable to bring to the Senate floor a product that is as good as it is. I \nurge my colleagues to support the conference agreement.\n\n\n                              section 422\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I would like to ask if the Chairman of the \nCommittee on Finance would entertain additional questions regarding the \nAmerican Jobs Creation Act of 2004.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would be glad to take questions from \nthe Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. I ask for additional clarification regarding the \nconferees' intent with respect to the rule in section 422 of the \nAmerican Jobs Creation Act of 2004 that disallows deductions for \nexpenses ``properly allocated and apportioned to the deductible \nportion.'' I would ask for clarification of the type of expenses that \nmay be ``properly allocated and apportioned''. Would it be reasonable \nto say that properly allocable and apportioned expenses would not \ninclude general and administrative costs not directly related to \ngenerating the income being repatriated and such indirect expenses as \nresearch and development costs, interest, state and local income taxes, \nsales and marketing costs, depreciation, and amortization.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, your understanding is correct. I would add that \ndirectly related expenses would include, but is not limited to, \nstewardship costs and directly related legal and accounting fees.\n  Mr. SMITH. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Under the conference report's \nprovision on the temporary dividends received deduction, the amount \nthat may be brought back to the United States may be determined by the \nreference to the ``applicable financial statement''. In general, this \nterm looks to the most recently certified financial statement filed on \nor before June 30, 2003. In the case of a taxpayer that subsequently \nre-filed or restated its pre-July 1, 2003 certified financial \nstatement, it is not clear how this would be determined. Is it the \nlegislative intent to lock in the earnings permanently reinvested \namount from the most recent pre-June 30, 2003 financial statement, \nwhich had been certified, regardless of any subsequent restatement?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The applicable financial statement is the most recent \nstatement that had been certified, and filed with the Securities and \nExchange Commission if required, on or before June 30, 2003. However, \nin the event of a subsequent restatement of a financial statement that \nhad been certified, and filed if required, on or before June 30, 2003, \nif the subsequent restatement contains a lower permanently reinvested \namount, then the lower amount shall apply.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the chairman for this clarification.\n\n\n                                  irs\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I read with great interest an exchange \nof letters in the House between my colleague from Pennsylvania, Mr. \nEnglish and the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, regarding \nregulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service under section 263(g) \nof the Internal Revenue Code in the context of the Conference Report on \nH.R. 4520.\n  The issue raised in their discussion relates to the IRS decision in \nregulations published on January 17, 2001, to expand its authority \nunder that section. Without at this point questioning the IRS \ninterpretation of the law, the colloquy notes that the IRS has in some \ncase imposed its new interpretation retroactively. The colloquy urges \nthe Department of Treasury to take the position that the new \ninterpretation should be applied only on a prospective basis.\n  I rise to agree with my friends in the House. Our practice in \nCongress is to give taxpayers notice when we intend to change the law \nin ways that could affect ongoing transactions that were undertaken in \nreliance on the law as it existed. Certainly Treasury can and should \nfollow the same rules.\n  I hope the Treasury Department will take note and act accordingly.\n\n\n                           business aircraft\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I want to thank the distinguished chairman of the \nCommittee on Finance, as well as the chairman of the Ways & Means \nCommittee, Mr. Thomas, and all the conferees on H.R. 4520, for \nretaining the provision allowing business aircraft purchased this year \nto qualify for bonus depreciation if the aircraft is delivered and \nplaced in service in 2005.\n  This provision is important to the hard-working Kansans who build \nthese aircraft. Provisions such as this will help to further bolster \nour rebounding economy with respect to expensive and complicated \nequipment like business aircraft. Without bonus depreciation, there is \na risk of a shortage of orders for delivery next year with a resulting \nimpact on employment.\n  It would have been better if this legislation had been enacted \nearlier this year, but, even now, this provision will allow \nmanufacturers several extra weeks to take orders for delivery by the \nend of 2005. That should help to ensure that there will be planes to \nbuild in 2005.\n  I ask the chairman a technical question on the effective date of this \nprovision.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator from Kansas for his kind words, and \nwould be happy to respond\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. The effective date of the placed-in-service-extension, \nsection 336 of the conference report, states that the amendments \n``shall take effect as if included in the amendments made by section \n101 of the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002.'' I believe \nthat this means only that, if a purchaser orders a plane for delivery \nin 2005, the limitations on the amount of the deposit, time for \nconstruction and purchase price must be met. It does not mean that \ntaxpayers who did not or will not take delivery and place the aircraft \nin service after December 31, 2004, would retroactively be subjected to \nthese limitations. The limitations apply only if a taxpayer wishes to \ntake advantage of the extended placed-in service period. Does the \nChairman agree with this interpretation?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator is correct. The new provision is not \nintended to apply to aircraft placed in service before January 1, 2005 \nand does not limit or deny bonus depreciation for aircraft or any other \nasset that would qualify under the general rules. I would refer the \nsenator to page 30 of the Conference Report. On that page, the \nconferees clearly state that this provision ``will modify the treatment \nonly of property placed in service during calendar year 2005,''\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask the chairman for a further clarification. \nSection 336 of the conference report includes amendment of clause (iv) \nof Internal Revenue Code section 168(k)(2)(A) to apply the additional \nyear to place an asset in service to assets described in subparagraphs \n(B) and (C). Subparagraph (B) of the Code applies to certain property \nhaving longer production periods. Section 336 of the bill adds \nsubparagraph (C). I would like to be sure that, by using the word \n``and'', the conferees did not intend that a business aircraft would \nhave to be described in both the existing subparagraph (B) and the new \nsubparagraph (C) in order to qualify for the additional year to place \nthe aircraft in service. As the chairman knows, the standards for \nqualification are substantially different under the two subparagraphs.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree that the drafting is not as clear as it might \nhave been. However, it is very clear from all the legislative history \nthat, by adding the new subparagraph, we intended to add a new class of \nproperty, business aircraft, to those assets which qualify for the \nadditional year to be placed in service. We did not intend\n\n[[Page S10977]]\n\nthat aircraft which qualify under subparagraph (C) must also qualify \nunder subparagraph (B).\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I would like to ask the chairman to address one final \npoint. As the chairman knows, an amendment added to the Senate bill \nduring floor debate temporarily reversed a Tax Court decision, affirmed \nby the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, concerning the limitation of \nbusiness deductions for personal entertainment use of a business \naircraft. This provision was drastically expanded and made permanent in \nthe conference report. I am very concerned that this provision will \nhave a substantial negative impact on the sales of new aircraft \nbecause, much of the business deduction for a new aircraft in its first \nfew years is depreciation. In the same bill that Congress extends the \nperiod to place an aircraft in service and still qualify for bonus \ndepreciation, Congress also reverses current law and limits \ndepreciation and other business deductions, even when an employee has \nincome imputed to him for any personal use of the aircraft.\n  I can understand that the facts of the tax court case that was \nintended to be reversed involved a high percentage of nonbusiness use. \nHowever, it would seem to me that some sort of de minimis amount of \npersonal travel treated as taxable compensation should be allowed \nwithout reducing otherwise applicable business deductions. I can also \nunderstand limiting deductions for incremental operating costs incurred \nfor a personal flight, but the aircraft depreciates whether it is in \nthe air or on the ground. I do not see the rationale for this \nextraordinary provision in the conference agreement far beyond the \nscope of the original Senate provision. The section which the \nconference report amends concerns entertainment facilities such as \nhunting and fishing lodges which have no other use than for business or \npersonal entertainment. An aircraft is purchased by a business because \nthey have a business need to be served. It is not the same thing as a \nhunting lodge. It is difficult for me to believe that, if a court \naddressed the specific question of whether a business aircraft were an \n``entertainment facility'' under present law, that it would rule \nagainst the taxpayer.\n  I hope that the chairman would be willing to consider a de minimis \nrule or other modification to limit the scope of this limitation in \nfuture tax legislation to allow occasional personal use without \nlimiting otherwise deductible business expense deductions relating to \nthe ownership and use of a business aircraft.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY: I appreciate the Senator's concerns and will keep them \nin mind in the future, although I would not anticipate repeal of the \nfull provision included in this conference report.\n\n\n                              section 422\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask if the chairman of the Committee on \nFinance would entertain additional questions regarding the American \nJobs Creation Act of 2004.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would be glad to take a question from \nthe Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I have a question about how to interpret \none of the rules contained in section 422 of the conference agreement \nfor the American Jobs Creation Act. Would the chairman please clarify \nwhat the rule that disallows deductions for expenses ``properly \nallocated and apportioned to the deductible portion'' of the dividend \nis intended to cover?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator from Oregon for his question. The \nrule and the statement of managers contain some ambiguity as to which \ndeductions are disallowed. The intent of the rule is to disallow only \ndeductions for expenses that relate directly to generating the dividend \nincome in question.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The tobacco buyout is very important to Kentucky, and \nit is also important that the provisions of the buyout included in the \nconference report are interpreted and implemented properly. The \nconference report provides financial assistance for producers in return \nfor the termination of tobacco marketing quotas and related price \nsupport. For kinds of tobacco other than fluecured and burely tobacco, \nthe payments to producers will reflect ``the basic tobacco farm acreage \nallotment for the 2002 marketing year established by the secretary for \nquota tobacco produced on the farm.''\n  My understanding is that for this calculation, the secretary will \ntake into account non-disaster transfer of allotments that were made \nfor the 2002 marketing year. As the Chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee, is that correct?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Yes. For producer payments, such transfers for these \ncrops will be taken into account as they are for the other tobaccos. \nThe payments will be based on the actual amount available on the farm \nafter those transfers.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Chairman of the Agriculture Committee for \nclarifying this point for me on this important aspect of the conference \nreport.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the FSC/ETI \nconference report. What the Republican Leadership did to this bill in \nconference is downright shameful.\n  In July, I supported an amendment Senators DeWine and Kennedy offered \nto this bill that combined a tobacco buyout with a provision giving the \nFood and Drug Administration regulatory authority over tobacco.\n  The Senate passed the FDA amendment by a vote of 78-15. That is a \nstrong show of support.\n  But something strange happened in conference. The FDA portion \ndisappeared. So in this conference report we have the buyout, but not \nFDA authority over tobacco products. That is unacceptable.\n  It is nothing more than a sweetheart deal for tobacco companies. They \nget cheaper tobacco and continue to avoid FDA regulation.\n  I have a long history of working on tobacco control. As a former \nsmoker, this is a personal issue to me. And the more I learn about that \nmenace the happier I am for myself and my loved ones.\n  I have worked hard in the Senate to protect Americans--especially \nchildren--from the deadly effects of cigarettes and other tobacco \nproducts.\n  In 1987, long before tobacco control became a mainstream issue, I \nworked with then Congressman Durbin to author the law banning smoking \non airplanes. That law brought about a seachange in our society's \nattitudes about smoking.\n  Once non-smokers could experience a smoke-free environment--in this \ninstance, the cabin of an airplane--they began to demand it.\n  I also wrote the law banning smoking in all federally-funded places \nthat serve children. And I have long supported FDA jurisdiction over \nthis deadly addiction.\n  I am deeply disappointed that the Republican leadership is putting \npolitics ahead of the health of our children by opposing FDA authority \nover tobacco.\n  Make no mistake: tobacco addiction is still a huge problem in \nAmerica. Tobacco continues to be the number one cause of preventable \ndeath and disease in our Nation. Each year, tobacco claims an estimated \n440,000 lives prematurely here in the United States.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, if current tobacco use \npatterns continue in the United States, over five million children \nalive today will die prematurely from a smoking-related disease. That \nis because nearly 4,000 young people try cigarettes for the first time \neach and every day--a statistic I find mind-boggling.\n  In addition to the terrible human costs, there are massive economic \ncosts to our Nation. It is estimated that direct medical expenditures \nattributed to smoking now total more than 75 billion dollars per year.\n  Despite all of this, the FDA has not been able to take actions to \nreduce tobacco's harm on society.\n  A pro-tobacco Congressman recently said:\n\n       Tobacco faces enough federal regulation.\n\n  But that is a joke. Cigarettes are essentially unregulated. When you \ngo in a grocery store, the only consumable product you can't find a \nlisting of the ingredients for is what's in cigarettes.\n  The Republican leadership is throwing away an historic opportunity to \ngive the FDA the legal authority it needs to protect the public's \nhealth.\n  Today, we have worthless health warnings on cigarettes, no control \nover what tobacco companies claim about the relative health effects of \ntheir products, no authority to curtail marketing tobacco to kids, and \nno ability\n\n[[Page S10978]]\n\nto order the industry to remove especially hazardous ingredients.\n  The bottom line is: FDA authority will protect kids and save lives.\n  The 1998 legal settlement between the States and the tobacco \ncompanies prohibited the companies from taking ``any action, directly \nor indirectly, to target youth . . . in the advertising, promotion or \nmarketing of tobacco products.''\n  But the tobacco companies are ignoring these promises.\n  Since the settlement, the tobacco companies have actually increased \ntheir marketing expenditures by 66 percent. According to the Federal \nTrade Commission, the tobacco industry spends more than $11.2 billion \nper year--over $30.7 million a day--marketing its deadly products just \nin the United States alone, often targeting youth.\n  For example, in 2002, Brown & Williamson unveiled a new marketing \npromotion for their Kool brand of cigarettes called Kool Mixx. This \nadvertising campaign was designed with one simple goal: target young \nAfrican-Americans and addict them to nicotine.\n  The ``Kool Mixx'' campaign included new cigarette packages with \nimages of young DJs and dancers:\n  It is an outrageous attempt to addict youth.\n  Brown & Williamson doesn't even bother to be subtle when it comes to \ntargeting African-American youth in this campaign.\n  The press release from Brown & Williamson announcing the campaign \ncontained almost comical sentences revealing their racial targeting.\n  This is what the company's press release said:\n\n       Kool understands the vibrant urban world of the \n     trendsetting, multicultural smoker.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Kool keeps it real and remains linked to the latest urban \n     trends.\n\n  This campaign to addict young African Americans to cigarettes doesn't \nstop at product packaging and slick ads. Kool is sponsoring a \nnationwide ``DJ Competition'' in cities such as New York, Atlanta, \nWashington, St. Louis, and Chicago.\n  It seems that ``Kool Mixx'' is the new ``Joe Camel'' for minority \nteenagers.\n  This overt racial targeting of youth shows that the tobacco industry \nhas not really changed its ways since its settlement with the State \nattorneys general.\n  The big tobacco companies have reverted back to the same atrocious \nbehavior we all saw before they promised they would become good \n``corporate citizens.''\n  Here is something even more outrageous difficult as that is to \nbelieve: one of the tobacco industry's new tactics is the introduction \nof candy-flavored cigarettes and other sweet-flavored tobacco products.\n  R.J. Reynolds--the same company that once marketed cigarettes to kids \nwith the infamous cartoon character, Joe Camel has launched a series of \nflavored cigarettes,\n  One flavor is a pineapple and coconut cigarette called ``Kauai \nKolada''; another is a citrus-flavored cigarette called ``Twista \nLime.''\n  These names sound more like bubble gum flavors than deadly \ncigarettes--which is the point.\n  These new marketing techniques aimed at kids are especially \ntroubling, given that over 550,000 children will become regular smokers \nthis year alone.\n  FDA regulation is critical for many reasons. One reason--as we see \nwith these candy-flavored cigarettes--is to keep kids away from these \ndeadly products. Another reason we need FDA regulation is to make sure \nthat preventable dangers in cigarettes are removed.\n  There are thousands of products for sale in America that people \nconsume, but tobacco products are the only ones--the only ones--which \ndon't have their ingredients disclosed.\n  That is amazing when you consider that cigarettes are by far the most \ndeadly product you can buy in a grocery store.\n  Right now, the FDA can regulate a box of macaroni and cheese, but not \na pack of cigarettes. If you wanted to know the ingredients of macaroni \nand cheese, they're listed on the package. But for cigarettes, there is \nno information whatsoever on the ingredients, toxins, chemicals, etc. \nIt makes no sense.\n  When a smoker lights a cigarette, the burning ingredients create \nother chemicals. Some of these are carcinogenic. But tobacco \nmanufacturers are not required by law to disclose the ingredients of \ntheir products to the public, including the toxic and cancer-causing \ningredients.\n  A Surgeon General's report in 1989 reported that cigarettes contain \n43 known carcinogens.\n  I wonder how many smokers realize that one of these chemicals is \narsenic. I bet most smokers don't know that.\n  It boils down to this: by stripping out the FDA regulatory authority \nover tobacco products, we are failing our children. We are putting \ntheir health in jeopardy.\n  This conference report provides billions of dollars to tobacco \nfarmers and boosts tobacco industry profits, but it does absolutely \nnothing nothing to reduce tobacco's terrible human and economic toll.\n  I don't know how any Member of this body who is truly concerned about \nchildren's health can, in good conscience, support this bill without \nthe FDA provision.\n  We had a deal; everyone knew it: the tobacco buyout in exchange for \nFDA regulation. The Republican leadership broke that deal.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this conference report until we give \nthe FDA the authority it needs to regulate tobacco as it does other \nproducts.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it has been a long day, and I thank those \nSenators who have been here, and especially the presiders who we have \nhad throughout the evening. We now have two appropriations conference \nreports at the desk ready for consideration. They are military \nconstruction appropriations and the homeland security appropriations, \nobviously two enormously important pieces of legislation, especially \ngiven the disaster relief package that is part of the military \nconstruction legislation.\n  It had been my hope to act on these as quickly as possible. I \nunderstand there are objections to these and that we will need to file \ncloture motions to bring these to a vote. I understand there is an \nissue relating to the military construction bill, but I am unaware of \nany issue with the appropriations bill relating to homeland security.\n  Homeland security clearly has important resources that address just \nwhat the title says; that is, the safety and security of the American \npeople. I believe the American people, indeed, deserve that we act on \nthis bill in a timely way and in an expeditious way, but it looks like \nwe are being stopped from doing so.\n  I will file the cloture motions on both of these measures, but I \nwould ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are \nobjecting to proceeding to please consider their objections overnight \nand allow us to proceed. I urge them, do not force a cloture vote on \nthe homeland security bill, which addresses the security and safety of \nthe American people. I ask that they consider allowing us to vitiate \nthis cloture and move forward tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/09/senate-section/article/S10978-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10978-S10979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2005--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Vandayburg\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this evening to say thank you to \nthe men and women serving in our Armed Forces. Too often, we don't take \nthe time to show our appreciation and tell them what their service \nmeans to us. They are there for us each day, dedicated to protecting \nall that we hold dear. They are there for us, making our world more \nsecure. They are there for us, making our world a better place--a safer \nplace. They are there for us, protecting our freedom.\n  That freedom, though, as we know so well, does not come without a \nprice. It does not come without sacrifice. As General Douglas MacArthur \nonce said:\n\n       The soldier, above all other men, is required to perform \n     the highest act of religious teaching--sacrifice. . . . The \n     soldier who is called upon to offer and to give his life for \n     his country is the noblest development of mankind.\n\n  This evening, I rise to honor a Mansfield, OH, serviceman who \nselflessly gave his life while saving those of his comrades. Army SP \nAllen Jeffrey Vandayburg--``A.J.'' to his family and friends--earned \nthe Bronze Star Medal with Valor for his final act of bravery--an act \nthat ultimately saved the lives of the men and women serving with him.\n  On April 9, 2004, in Barez , Iraq, A.J. and other members of the \nArmy's 1st Infantry Division--the ``Big Red One''--found themselves in \nthe middle of a fierce firefight with Iraqi insurgents. A.J. was \nmanning the gunner position of his Bradley fighting vehicle when his \nunit was fired upon. According to an official Army report, A.J. fought \nvaliantly, drawing enemy fire to himself. The report detailed the \nfollowing:\n\n       Vandayburg's unparalleled reflexes allowed him to destroy \n     an [enemy] who was attempting to fire a rocket propelled \n     grenade within 50 meters of his vehicle. Vandayburg had to \n     swivel the entire turret, acquire the target, and destroy the \n     enemy before the rocket-propelled grenade could be fired.\n\n  A.J. prevented that grenade from hitting his convoy. He saved many \nlives that day--an act that ultimately took his own life. His valiant \nefforts prompted the insurgents to focus their fire on his vehicle. \nA.J. was killed in the onslaught. He was just 20 years old.\n  A.J. was truly a great soldier--a courageous young man who put the \nsafety of others above his own. We will never be able to repay A.J. for \nwhat he has done, and we will never be able to honor him the way he \ntruly deserves. We can, however, remember this American hero as he \nwas--as a strong, independent young man who did a great deal of good in \nthis world.\n  In his all too brief 20 years, A.J. touched many lives. His mother, \nChantil, fondly recalls that ``everybody loved him.'' It was his smile; \nit was hard to stay mad at him.'' A.J.'s father, Allen, remembers that \nhe was the kind of kid who could walk into a room and just light it up.\n  A.J. loved his family very much. In the summers, A.J. always looked \nforward to their family vacation to Myrtle Beach, SC. A.J. loved kids. \nFamily friend, Kim Loveland, recalled that she would pay A.J. to watch \nher children, only to have him turn around and use the money to buy the \nkids candy.\n  A.J. went to Mansfield High School, where he played golf and \nbaseball. He was known as a ``good guy'' who had a lot of good friends. \nAfter graduation in 2001, A.J. enlisted in the Army. He would \neventually serve in Kosovo, Germany, Kuwait, and Iraq. Allen and \nChantil Vandayburg treasure the picture they have of their son with \nchildren in Kosovo. Allen likes to call A.J. ``a warrior who also had a \nsoft side.''\n  A.J. was a lot like his father. Allen is a 25-year veteran of the \nMansfield Police Department. A.J. learned from his dad the value of \npublic service and how to trust your comrades--lessons he would bring \nwith him overseas. A.J.'s parents knew that their son believed in what \nhe was doing in Iraq. A.J. e-mailed them as often as he could and would \ntell them not to worry--that he trusted his fellow soldiers and knew \nthey would look out for him. In his final battle, it was A.J. who paid \nthe ultimate sacrifice for his comrades and for Iraqis he did not know.\n  A friend of A.J.'s, Nathan Pival, who is serving in Afghanistan, \nposted the following message on a Web site honoring A.J.:\n\n       A.J.--I found out what happened to you my first week in \n     Afghanistan. To say the least, I felt like a piece of me \n     died, too. I mean, who would have thought that you and me \n     would end up in the Army after high school? I know you didn't \n     find out I was in the service until you tried to call my cell \n     when I was in Basic, but I want you to know that you were the \n     person that helped to convince me that the military would \n     help me out. It has helped me. . . . You are a hero, and you \n     did the right thing, and that is what matters. I believe in a \n     higher purpose, so I know I will see you again some day, but \n     I'm still pretty upset that I am going to have to wait so \n     long to tell my Army stories to my buddy who motivated me to \n     join. If it wasn't for you, I'd probably . . . be going \n     nowhere. I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you man. See you \n     again someday.\n\n  A.J.'s family found solace in the final act of devotion from one \nbrother to another. Though he described it as ``the hardest thing I've \never had to do,''\n\n[[Page S10980]]\n\nA.J.'s brother Chris, a Marine, crossed military branches to escort his \nbrother's body from Dover Air Force Base to their home in Mansfield.\n  Hundreds of people came to support the Vandayburg family at A.J.'s \nmemorial service. Hundreds more lined the funeral route. The outpouring \nof support was a truly moving display. At the memorial service, \nReverend David Root spoke to the standing-room-only crowd. He said:\n\n       [A.J.] was special and that is why you are all here. He \n     chose to take the tough road. He knew the risks. . . . He \n     changed the history of this country.\n\n  A.J. Vandayburg was indeed special. He will be remembered always for \nhis bravery, compassion, and sacrifice. He will be remembered as a \nhero.\n  I close my remarks with the heartfelt words of A.J.'s 11-year-old \nsister, Taylor. Her words speak volumes about A.J., her hero--and A.J., \nher big brother:\n\n       Bubby, you are my biggest hero, and I will always love you, \n     but that does not mean I am still not mad at you for leaving, \n     `cause I am. But, I will always and forever love you. I miss \n     you so much. You are loved and missed so much by me, Mom, \n     Dad, and Chris. . . . You are my hero and my bubby and I love \n     you so much. I am not saying goodbye because you are not \n     gone. You are still with me, and you are the biggest and \n     bravest soldier I know and I know God has a plan for you, but \n     I had one for you to be right here beside me. You still are. \n     I love you so much.\n\n                       Abuse of Foreign Detainees\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we near the end of this session, I am \ndisappointed to report that Congress seems content to let the issue of \nforeign prisoner abuse linger without effective congressional \noversight. Some have argued that continuing to investigate this matter \nwill drag it out, and have the effect of preventing us from putting the \nscandal behind us. I disagree. We have to uncover the full truth in \norder to ensure that such abuses are not repeated. I am sorry to report \nthat each week brings new allegations that reveal how much we still do \nnot know.\n  Last week, I spoke on this floor about a recent Los Angeles Times \narticle that raised troubling new allegations about the abuse of Afghan \ndetainees in Gardez, including the death of one detainee that was never \nreported up the chain of command. The article revealed what appears to \nbe a complete disregard for established Army procedure among certain \nunits in Afghanistan.\n  I sent a letter to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on October 1, \n2004, asking him several questions about the allegations raised in the \nnews article. I asked Secretary Rumsfeld to explain how the special \nforces base at Gardez was allegedly allowed to operate with no \nrecordkeeping requirements or standing operating procedures--an \nallegation that was corroborated by a U.S. Army investigator in \nAfghanistan. I asked whether any official policy allowed special forces \nunits to suspend normal recordkeeping requirements while operating in \nAfghanistan or Iraq. I asked if there is an official policy to allow \nspecial forces units to detain prisoners in local Afghan jails or other \nundisclosed facilities. I asked Secretary Rumsfeld for a prompt \nresponse and hope that he delivers one soon.\n  Even without the answers to these questions, we now know that senior \nofficials in the White House, the Justice Department, and the Pentagon \nset in motion a systematic effort to minimize, distort, and even ignore \nour international agreements on torture and the treatment of prisoners. \nI am dismayed to report that some Members of Congress are now \nattempting to make it much easier for the administration to circumvent \nour treaty obligations. The 9/11 Recommendations Implementation Act, \nH.R. 10, was recently introduced by the House Republican leadership. \nSections 3032 and 3033 of that bill would make it official U.S. policy \nto exclude certain non-citizens from the protection of the Convention \nAgainst Torture, a treaty to which the United States is a party. To \nenact such language after the abuses that took place at Abu Ghraib and \nother locations would further undermine the once distinguished \nreputation of the United States as a world leader on human rights.\n  Reports of the administration's support of these provisions are \nconflicting. Last week, Speaker Hastert's office claimed that the \nJustice Department ``wants and supports'' the provisions. The Justice \nDepartment declined to offer an official endorsement of sections 3032 \nand 3033, but claimed that it favored any ``provisions that will better \nsecure our borders and protect the American people from terrorists.'' \nIn an attempt to reconcile these statements, Senator Kennedy and I sent \nAttorney General Ashcroft a letter on October 1 urging him to repudiate \nthe Department's support for these sections. We were pleased to learn \nthis week that the White House went on record in opposition to the \nprovisions, but we still await a reply from the Attorney General \ndefinitively stating the position of the Department of Justice.\n  Next Friday, October 15, is the deadline imposed by a Federal judge \nfor the administration to turn over or identify all documents relating \nto the treatment of prisoners held by the United States at military \nbases and other detention facilities overseas. In his order, Judge \nHellerstein stated: ``No one is above the law: not the executive, not \nthe Congress, not the judiciary.'' I could not agree more. \nUnfortunately, this administration has continually ignored my requests \nfor these documents--I will not be surprised if it refuses to comply \nwith this court order. I would note that the original Freedom of \nInformation Act request for these documents was submitted in October \n2003, a year ago. Any embarrassment their release may cause now--less \nthan 3 weeks before the Presidential election--is due to the \nadministration's own stonewalling.\n  As the 108th Congress comes to a close, many questions about the \nprison abuse scandal will undoubtedly remain unanswered. Several \nPentagon investigations are now complete, but none of them paint a \ncomplete and unbiased assessment of the prisoner abuse scandal. This \nSenate, and in particular the Judiciary Committee and Governmental \nAffairs Committee, failed to fulfill its oversight responsibilities. I \nhave said many times there needs to be a thorough, independent \ninvestigation of the actions of those involved, from the people who \ncommitted abuses, to the officials who set these policies in motion. \nPerhaps in the new year, with a new Congress, the administration in \npower will be ready to seek the full truth about this scandal and begin \nthe process of restoring honor to our nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters to Secretary Rumsfeld and \nAttorney General Ashcroft, both dated October 1, 2004, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 2004.\n     Hon. Donald Rumsfeld,\n     Secretary of Defense,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Rumsfeld: As you know, I am deeply troubled \n     by the revelations of abuse of prisoners in U.S. custody \n     overseas. I have closely monitored the numerous ongoing and \n     completed investigations instigated by the Pentagon, but \n     remain skeptical that these investigations will uncover the \n     full truth. Each of these probes is limited in scope or \n     authority and, therefore, none will comprehensively \n     investigate the abuse of detainees. Each week brings new \n     allegations that reveal how much we still do not know.\n       I am particularly disturbed by a story published in the Los \n     Angeles Times on September 21, 2004. This article raises \n     troubling new allegations about the abuse of Afghan detainees \n     in Gardez, but also reveals what appears to be a complete \n     disregard for established Army procedure among certain units \n     in Afghanistan. According to the news report, based in part \n     on a report written by Afghan prosecutors for the Afghan \n     Attorney General, U.S. Army Special Forces arrested eight \n     Afghan soldiers in March 2003 at the request of the \n     provincial governor. The prosecutors' report and an internal \n     memorandum prepared by a United Nations delegation both \n     allege American mistreatment of the detainees including \n     repeated beatings, immersion in cold water, electric shocks, \n     being hung upside down, and having toenails torn off. One \n     detainee, Jamal Naseer, reportedly died as a result of the \n     torture. The U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command (CID) \n     recently opened a criminal probe into Naseer's death.\n       This incident is very troubling, but it points to a much \n     larger problem. CID received a tip about Naseer's death \n     earlier this year, but stated that it could not investigate \n     the matter due to a lack of information. Christopher Coffey, \n     an Army detective based at Bagram air base, told the L.A. \n     Times: ``We're trying to figure out who was running the base. \n     We don't know what unit was there. There are no records. The \n     reporting\n\n[[Page S10981]]\n\n     system is broke across the board. Units are transferred in \n     and out. There are no SOPs [standard operating procedures] . \n     . . and each unit acts differently.''\n       Apparently, because these units failed to follow Army \n     procedure, Naseer's death was never reported up the chain of \n     command. Yet, Lt. Gen. Mikolashek's report on detainee \n     operations inspection, released in July of this year, \n     conclusively stated that the team ``that visited Iraq and \n     Afghanistan discovered no incidents of abuse that had not \n     been reported through command channels; all incidents were \n     already under investigation.'' We now know that this \n     statement cannot be accurate. What we do not know is \n     whether and how many other deaths, let alone cases of \n     abuse, may have gone unreported.\n       I also have new questions about the Defense Department's \n     involvement in the ``ghost detainee'' matter. The Fay-Jones \n     report revealed that the ghost detainee problem in Iraq was \n     far more pervasive than the Defense Department had previously \n     acknowledged, but that report placed much of the blame on the \n     CIA. The L.A. Times story, however, accuses U.S. Special \n     Forces commanders in Afghanistan of using local jails to hide \n     prisoners off of the official roles.\n       In order to better understand the situation in Afghanistan, \n     and the role of the Department in monitoring the actions of \n     forces on the ground, I ask that you respond to the following \n     questions by October 8, 2004.\n       1. Please explain how the Special Forces base at Gardez was \n     allowed to operate with no recordkeeping requirements or \n     Standing Operating Procedures (SOPs).\n       2. Did any official policy allow Special Forces units to \n     suspend normal recordkeeping requirements or chain of command \n     reporting while operating in Afghanistan or Iraq?\n       3. Did any official policy allow Special Forces units to \n     detain prisoners in local Afghan jails, or in any other \n     undisclosed facilities?\n       4. Mr. Coffey's quote above suggests that an unknown number \n     of detention centers have operated or are now operating in \n     Afghanistan with total impunity. In light of the allegations \n     raised in the L.A. Times story, what actions is the Pentagon \n     taking to investigate the situation and resolve the problems?\n       5. In the absence of recordkeeping and SOPs, do you agree \n     that none of the ongoing or completed Pentagon investigations \n     can claim to have uncovered all allegations of abuse?\n       6. Are any other government entities, such as the CIA or \n     other intelligence agencies, involved in the operation of \n     these detention centers or in the treatment or interrogation \n     of prisoners? If so, please describe the agencies and their \n     role. If the answer to this or any other question contained \n     in this letter is classified, please submit your answer in \n     classified form and make it available to appropriately \n     cleared staff.\n       As stated above, I request that you answer these questions \n     by October 8, 2004. Thank you for your prompt attention to \n     this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 2004,\n     Hon. John D. Ashcroft,\n     Attorney General, Department of Justice,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Attorney General Ashcroft: We write to express our \n     deep concern about the report in yesterday's Washington Post \n     that the Department supports the ``rendition'' of detainees \n     to nations where they are likely to be tortured.\n       The United States is a party to the Convention Against \n     Torture, which provides that ``No State Party shall expel, \n     return or extradite a person to another State where there are \n     substantial grounds for believing he would be in danger of \n     being subjected to torture.'' Since 9/11, there have been \n     numerous reports that detainees in the custody of U.S. \n     military or intelligence officials have been transferred for \n     interrogation to governments known to torture prisoners. \n     According to such reports, detainees who refuse to cooperate \n     with U.S. interrogators have been ``rendered'' to foreign \n     intelligence services in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Morocco, \n     Syria, and other countries that practice torture. One report \n     stated that Deputy Attorney General Thompson approved the \n     rendition to Syria of a Canadian citizen, who was confined in \n     a small dark cell for a year and beaten on his palms, wrists, \n     and back with an electric cable. Syrian officials later \n     released him, telling reporters they found no link to Al \n     Qaeda.\n       Until now, Administration officials have denied any \n     involvement in this practice. At a Senate Armed Services \n     Committee hearing on May 11, Undersecretary of Defense for \n     Intelligence Stephen Cambone testified that ``to the best of \n     [his] knowledge'' the Administration was fully complying with \n     all legal requirements and that all reports of U.S. officials \n     engaging in the practice of rendition were false.\n       Yesterday's report, however, states that the Department is \n     urging House Republicans to include provisions in the 9/11 \n     intelligence reform legislation authorizing the practice of \n     renditions. Sections 3032 and 3033 of the bill, H.R. 10, \n     would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue new \n     regulations to exclude certain non-citizens from the \n     protection of the Convention Against Torture. The changes \n     would increase the burden of proof on any person being \n     deported or rendered to establish ``by clear and convincing \n     evidence that he or she would be tortured,'' and would deny \n     the jurisdiction of courts to review the new regulations or \n     claims brought under the Convention Against Torture by \n     aliens at ports of entry.\n       These changes would violate longstanding U.S. law and \n     policy, undermine basic humanitarian and human rights \n     standards, expose U.S. soldiers and citizens traveling abroad \n     to greater danger, and further weaken America's standing in \n     the world.\n       Yet the spokesman for House Speaker Hastert is quoted in \n     the report as saying that the Department ``really wants and \n     supports'' these provisions. Department spokesman Mark \n     Corallo was also quoted as saying, ``We can't comment on any \n     specific provision, but we support those provisions that will \n     better secure our borders and protect the American people \n     from terrorists.''\n       No Department official should express support, either \n     openly or behind the scenes, for provisions that so clearly \n     violate fundamental human rights. Torture defies our laws and \n     stains our ideals. The abuses at Abu Ghraib prison have been \n     a major setback in the war on terrorism. An essential part of \n     winning that war and protecting the country for the future is \n     respect for the ideals that America stands for at home and \n     throughout the world.\n       The Department has already undermined those ideals by \n     issuing legal memoranda attempting to weaken the definition \n     of torture and eliminate restraints imposed by U.S. laws and \n     international treaties on the conduct of Executive Branch \n     officials. We urge you to repudiate immediately and without \n     qualification the Department's support for sections 3032 and \n     3033 in the House legislation, and to put an immediate halt \n     to any Administration involvement in the illegal practice of \n     rendition.\n           Sincerely,\n     Edward M. Kennedy,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Patrick Leahy,\n       Ranking Member.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/09/senate-section/article/S10981-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10981-S10983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MEDICARE MODERNIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have to respond to the outrageous charges \nmade by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle regarding the \nMedicare statement I delivered yesterday.\n  I was disturbed by several remarks, especially that seniors have \nflatly rejected the Medicare prescription drug benefit. How is that \neven possible when the drug benefit doesn't even go into effect until \nJanuary 1, 2006?\n  How is that possible when many Medicare beneficiaries are \nparticipating in the Medicare Drug Discount Card and have seen savings \nin their drug costs up to 20 percent per drug? I do not see that as an \noutright rejection at all.\n  My colleagues need to be careful about their charges, especially when \nthey do not have the facts to back them up. I also take issue with my \ncolleague's assertion that our prescription drug law is only a drug law \nin name. What does he mean by that?\n  Let me remind the Senator from Illinois that because of this new \nMedicare prescription drug law, 40 million Medicare beneficiaries will \nhave drug coverage if they want it. The bill provides generous \nsubsidies to low-income Medicare beneficiaries who, today, cannot \nafford to purchase drugs.\n  Prior to enactment of the Medicare Modernization Act, these \nbeneficiaries had to make tough choices between buying their \nprescription drugs and putting gas in their cars. Or buying \nprescription drugs or putting food on the table. Or buying prescription \ndrugs or paying their rent. Once the Medicare prescription drug plan \ngoes into effect on January 1, 2006, those Medicare beneficiaries will \nno longer have to worry. And another point that needs to be raised \nregarding this matter--if there were any proposals that deserve to be \nrecognized as offering a drug benefit in name only, it's the two \nDemocratic plans of two years ago--plans supported by 50 and 45 \nDemocrats respectively, including the Democratic Leader and Senator \nKerry.\n  My colleague, Senator Grassley, described those plans a few days ago, \nbut let me take a few minutes to recap. The first Democratic plan had a \ndrug benefit that lasted just six years. Talk about offering a drug \nbenefit in name only.\n  The second plan didn't even offer a benefit to the vast majority of \nbeneficiaries. Seventy percent of beneficiaries would not have received \nany basic coverage. A plan that shuts out the vast majority of \nbeneficiaries--how can you call that a drug benefit? Guess what those \n70 percent got.\n\n[[Page S10982]]\n\n  You are not going to believe this--a five percent discount on their \ndrugs. Once they spent $3,300 out of pocket, they could qualify for \ncatastrophic coverage.\n  Some have taken issue with the MMA, saying that the ``benefit'' stops \nafter an initial coverage amount. I would like to remind my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle that their basic benefit would have \nnever even started for 70 percent of beneficiaries! Talk about a \ndoughnut hole; these beneficiaries didn't even get a doughnut!\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that 66 percent of \nbeneficiaries wouldn't meet the $3,330 threshold--again, for these \nfolks, the only help they would get was a five percent discount! A five \npercent discount!\n  I was also extremely disappointed by the arguments made by the \nSenator from Illinois and the Senator from California against what some \nhave termed the ``non-interference'' provision. As I outlined, this \nprovision has been included in the most prominent Democrat initiatives, \nstarting with the Clintons' Health Security Act over a decade ago. \nDespite that fact, here we are again listening to arguments against it. \nApparently, what was good in a Democratic administration is bad in a \nRepublican one.\n  And what was good in a Democratic Senate is bad in a Republican \nSenate during an election year. It is almost as if my colleagues were \nnot listening to what I said. The argument that there is no authority \nfor the federal government to bargain with the pharmaceutical companies \nis getting to be a tired argument. Again, let me repeat myself from \nyesterday.\n  First, the Democrat-sponsored bill from 2000, introduced by Senator \nTom Daschle and supported and cosponsored by 33 Senate Democrats, had a \nspecific provision which stated the following:\n\n       In administering the prescription drug benefit program \n     established under this part, the Secretary may not (1) \n     require a particular formulary or institute a price structure \n     for benefits; (2) interfere in any way with negotiations \n     between private entities and drug manufacturers, or \n     wholesalers; or (3) otherwise interfere with the competitive \n     nature of providing a prescription drug benefit through \n     private entities.\n\n  Again, this provision is from S. 2541, the Medicare Expansion for \nNeeded Drugs, a bill that was introduced by Senator Daschle and \ncosponsored by 33 Democrats, including not only Senator Kerry but also \nSenator Durbin and Senator Boxer who spoke against it on the floor \nyesterday.\n  Now, it is every Senator's right to change his or her mind, but you \nwould think we would hear some discussion about the basis for this \nflip-flop. Instead, there is much dialogue about the so-called ``evil'' \npharmaceutical companies, and virtually no admission that many \nDemocrats, many prominent Democrats, have been on record in favor of \nthe provision they now castigate.\n  And what is even more outrageous is the fact that they are the ones \nwho first came up with the concept.\n  When I hear my colleague from California talk about how the Medicare \ndrug law does not do much for seniors, let me just remind my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle that she is sadly mistaken.\n  On the contrary, the Medicare prescription law improves health care \ncoverage for Medicare beneficiaries by first, giving them the option to \nhave prescription drug coverage, something that they do not have today \nand something Medicare beneficiaries have wanted for close to 40 years!\n  In addition, the MMA provides beneficiaries new preventive health \nbenefits including a first-time, Welcome to Medicare Physical \nExamination, cardiovascular and diabetes screening and improved \npayments for mammography.\n  It also provided rural health care providers with increased \nreimbursement so they may continue to provide Medicare beneficiaries \nliving in rural areas with quality health care. I don't know about \nCalifornia or Illinois, but that is most welcome in Utah!\n  It also provides beneficiaries with a choice in coverage. Seniors \nwill be able to choose the drug benefit that best suits their needs, \nrather than be forced in a one-size fits all government plan which is \nwhat many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle support.\n  Another important provision in the bill helps all Americans by \noffering them Heath Savings Accounts, HSAs. HSAs are tax-advantaged \nsavings accounts which may be used to pay for medical benefits. The \ninclusion of these new accounts is a significant part of the Medicare \nlaw.\n  Allowing individuals to take charge of their own savings for future \nhealth care expenses is an important and necessary change in the \ndirection of our health care policy, and is one that I support \nstrongly.\n  Another point raised by my colleague from California is the doughnut \nhole. I think she called the doughnut hole a ``benefit shutdown.'' I \nagree that the MMA law is not perfect and, yes, this is an area I wish \nwe could have improved upon. But calling it a ``benefit shutdown'' is \nnot only wrong, it is deceptive.\n  The reason it is wrong to call the doughnut hole a ``benefit \nshutdown'' is that it would not affect the majority of seniors, and \nsince our first responsibility is to take care of the very poor \nbeneficiaries, that is entirely fitting. In fact, the Congressional \nBudget Office told us that only one-quarter of Medicare beneficiaries \nwill have spending that actually reaches the non-coverage window of the \ndoughnut hole.\n  Finally, let me remind my colleague from California that the Medicare \nprescription drug amendment the Democrats brought to the floor in 2002 \nsunsetted the Medicare prescription drug program. My good friend from \nIowa, Senator Grassley, the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee \nwas talking about this irony the other day on the floor.\n  Let me recap what Senator Grassley said.\n  When we were considering the Medicare Tripartisan bill on the Senate \nfloor on 2002, the first Graham-Kennedy Medicare proposal was not \npermanent. Let me read the language from their proposal:\n  ``No obligations shall be incurred, no amounts shall be appropriated \nand no amounts expended, for the expenses incurred for providing \ncoverage of outpatient drugs after December 31, 2010.''\n  Isn't that just remarkable? And they are calling the MMA a drug plan \nin name only? Who are they trying to kid?\n  The fact that the Graham-Kennedy proposal offered a drug benefit that \nended 6 years after it started is unbelievable. But they sunsetted the \nbenefit to hide the true cost of their proposal.\n  At the time, the Congressional Budget Office said it would cost over \n$100 billion each year to extend the Graham-Kennedy drug benefit past \nthe sunset--$100 billion a year without a plan to pay for this enormous \ncost!\n  And the argument made about the MMA not going into effect until after \nthe election is just more election year political jabber. That is a \nridiculous charge, one that does not even warrant a response. But I \nwill respond to it by saying that it takes time to put together a \nbenefit that will cover over 40 million Americans.\n  It takes time to do it correctly. The agency in charge of the \nMedicare program needs time to implement the MMA regulations, accept \nbids from plans that wish to participate in the Medicare Advantage \nprograms and, most important, it takes time to educate Medicare \nbeneficiaries about the options that will be offered to them.\n  And let me remind all of you that even the Democrat proposals that \nhave been considered in the past did not have the Medicare prescription \ndrug programs go into effect immediately, so that is just a ludicrous \ncharge.\n  In addition, I will remind my colleagues that both the Democratic \nplans under consideration in the summer of 2002 didn't go into effect \nuntil 2005 because they recognized the same thing we did--that it will \ntake some time to get a new program like this up and running.\n  And so, there's no subterfuge behind the 2006 date in the MMA. \nMoreover, at least the MMA offers immediate assistance through the drug \ncard program. Their plans offered nothing until 2005 and then very \nlittle after that!\n  I would also like to respond to my colleague from California's \ncomments about the Veterans Administration system and the deficiencies \nof which I described this yesterday morning. If she's surprised at the \nRepublicans for not using the VA model, then my only guess is that \nshe's even more surprised that her own party didn't.\n\n[[Page S10983]]\n\n  No--they wanted to have private plans negotiate with drug companies--\nthe same approach taken in the MMA. The VA system was not a model for \nany Medicare prescription drug plans considered on the Senate floor.\n  Finally, let me address the idea of importing cheap drugs from \nCanada.\n  First, nobody has a greater desire than I to make prescription drugs \nmore affordable, particularly for our seniors and the disabled, who \ndepend so heavily upon pharmaceuticals for their quality of life. I co-\nauthored the 1984 bill which, in essence, brought generic drugs to the \nmarketplace to become the force for competition and affordability that \nthey are today.\n  My colleagues seem to forget that the MMA does include a provision to \npermit the importation of prescription drugs from Canada once a program \nis in place that is approved and certified for safety and cost by the \nSecretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The law \nalso calls for the Secretary to establish a 13-member task force that \nwill study proposals to make re-importation safe and cost effective.\n\n  HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson has stated he is hopeful the panel's \nstudy will be completed by the end of this year. We shouldn't overlook \nthe fact that the FDA has documented many cases of what appeared to be \nFDA-approved imported drugs that in fact were contaminated or \ncounterfeit, contained the wrong product or incorrect dose, were \naccompanied by inadequate directions, or had outlived their expiration \ndate.\n  These drugs would be at a minimum ineffective, and could actually be \nharmful or fatal.\n  The FDA is also concerned with the safety of allowing companies which \nare not licensed by states to practice pharmacy to sell prescription \ndrugs without any limitation on the amount or frequency of drug imports \npermitted for individuals.\n  In addition, reimportation legislation as it is written would allow \nrisky drugs that are currently available in the U.S. only under strict \nsafety controls to reimported at any amount or frequency to anyone--\neven those who are at high risk to be seriously injured by the \nmedication.\n  The FDA underscored these concerns in the Judiciary Committee's \nhearing on drug importation last July. The agency stressed that opening \nour tightly regulated, closed system of prescription drug distribution \nwill open the door to counterfeit and otherwise adulterated or \nmisbranded drugs being widely distributed to an unwitting American \npublic.\n  Mr. William K. Hubbard, the Associate Commissioner for Policy and \nPlanning for the FDA testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on \nthis important matter. I would like to take this opportunity to read \nsome of his testimony to my colleagues:\n\n       FDA remains concerned about the public health implications \n     of unapproved prescription drugs from entities seeking to \n     profit by getting around U.S. legal standards for drug safety \n     and effectiveness. Many drugs obtained from foreign sources \n     that either purport to be or appear to be the same as U.S. \n     approved prescription drugs are, in fact, of unknown quality. \n     Consumers are exposed to a number of potential risks when \n     they purchase drugs from foreign sources or from sources that \n     are not operated by pharmacies properly licensed under state \n     pharmacy laws.\n       Patients also are at greater risk because there is no \n     certainty about what they are getting when they purchase some \n     of these drugs. Although some purchasers of drugs from \n     foreign sources may receive genuine product, others may \n     unknowingly buy counterfeit copies that contain only inert \n     ingredients, legitimate drugs that are outdated and have been \n     diverted to unscrupulous resellers, or dangerous sub-potent \n     or super-potent products that were improperly manufactured. \n     Furthermore, in the case of foreign-based sources, if a \n     consumer has an adverse drug reaction or any other problem, \n     the consumer may have little or no recourse either because \n     the operator of the pharmacy often is not known, or the \n     physical location of the seller is unknown or beyond the \n     consumer's reach. FDA has only limited ability to take action \n     against these foreign operators.\n\n  These safety concerns are real, and I strongly believe that if we \ntruly care about seniors and other patients who depend upon \nprescription drugs, we should not expose them to what currently amounts \nto pharmaceutical Russian roulette.\n  Now the FDA is working with some of my colleagues on legislation that \nwould give the FDA greater resources, limit the scope of imports, and \nprovide greater power to the FDA to police imports. In recent public \ncomments, former Commissioner Mark McClellan has said these measures \nwould give the agency the ability to assure the safety of prescription \ndrugs imported by Canada.\n  In addition to these safety concerns, however, I am also concerned \nthat reimported drugs pose a threat to the innovation Americans--and \nthe rest of the world--have come to expect from our pharmaceutical \nindustry. Canada and other countries with lower drug prices generally \nimport superior American products, but impose price controls to keep \ncosts down.\n  However, it can cost as much as $1 billion to produce a new drug, \ntest it, win FDA approval, educate doctors, and make the drug available \nto patients. No pharmaceutical company could go through this immensely \nexpensive process without a chance to recover some of its costs, which \nwill not be possible if we impose in America--however indirectly--\nCanadian-style price controls. I do not believe that sacrificing the \nsafety and future supply of our drugs by reimportation is the right \nanswer to the high cost of prescription drugs.\n  I hope that I have cleared up any misunderstandings that Medicare \nbeneficiaries have about the MMA law. Again, we gain nothing by \nspreading mistruths about the Medicare bill.\n  The only thing that results from those types of charges is confusion \nof Medicare beneficiaries--the very people who all of us are trying to \nhelp. And that is regrettable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/09/senate-section/article/S10983-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ANTISEMITISM\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I speak about antisemitisim, an ancient \npestilence that has torn at the fabric of society for too long. \nSpecifically, I have become concerned with the dissemination of \nantisemitic attitudes through political cartoons.\n  Last month, on the eve of Rosh Hashanah, I stood in this chamber \nalong with a bipartisan group of my colleagues to speak about the \ncancerous effect that antisemitism continues to have on humanity. As I \nstated then, it is of the highest priority for our Nation to stand up \nagainst this venomous invective and bigotry directed at the Jewish \npeople.\n  It is an unfortunate reality that some newspapers in the Arab world \nblatantly promote antisemitism. For my remarks, I had prepared several \nposters of cartoons that appeared in Arabic-language newspapers to \nillustrate to my colleagues their insidious nature, but in the end, I \nfound them too unsettling to display.\n  What I find disconcerting, however, is the fact that this sentiment \nis creeping into political cartoons both in Europe as well as here in \nthe United States. Newspapers across the country and the world have \npublished cartoons that have gone beyond reasonable differences of \nopinion and expanded into the realm of antisemitism.\n  For example, I have seen a cartoon of a man lying on the ground, \nbleeding and clutching a small Palestinian flag. Impaled in his back is \na large American flag with its stars arranged to form the Star of \nDavid. This graphic image, insinuating that an Israeli-controlled \nAmerica has killed the state of Palestine, is appalling.\n  In Italy, the Newspaper La Stampa ran a cartoon depicting an Israeli \ntank rumbling toward a baby Jesus, who is crying ``Surely they don't \nwant to kill me again?!'' This is not a criticism of policy or \nleadership. This is nothing other than an antisemitic attack thinly \nveiled as political parody.\n  In the Greek Newspaper Ethnos, a cartoon appeared showing two Israeli \nsoldiers stabbing captive Arabs. One of the Israeli soldiers is \ndepicted as saying to the other ``Don't feel guilty, brother. We were \nnot in Auschwitz and Dachau to suffer but to learn!'' How can that be \nconstrued as anything other than bigotry? This kind of hatred is simply \nunacceptable, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate, as well as \nleaders across the world, to make every effort to end this terrible \nplague of hatred.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/09/senate-section/article/S10983-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10983-S10984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RELATIONS WITH KYRGZSTAN\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I make special note of the visit to the \nUnited States by the distinguished\n\n[[Page S10984]]\n\nPresident of the Republic of Kyrgystan, Askar Akaev. President Akaev \nwas in the our country for the opening of the session of the United \nNations and also traveled to Utah to discuss the reforms taking place \nin his country and to talk about the efforts his nation is taking in \nthe war on terrorism. Today we face a global war against terror, a war \nwe cannot win alone. It is in that spirit that we should recognize and \nsupport democracies worldwide, particularly those burgeoning \ndemocracies for which freedom is a new concept. The Republic of \nKyrgyzstan, is just such an example.\n  A small country of 5 million in Central Asia, the Kyrgyz Republic has \nbeen one of the most progressive countries in the region, especially \namongst the countries which once made up the former Soviet Union. \nPlagued by an inflation rate of 88% in the year 1994, Kyrgyzstan under \nthe leadership of President Akaev was successful in carrying out a \nnumber of market reforms, which allowed it to lower that inflation rate \nto 15 percent in just three years.\n  President, Askar Akaev was first elected in October of 1990 and is \ninternationally recognized for his promotion of science, human rights \nand democracy world wide. He has received many International Awards, \nincluding the Grand Cross of the Order of Liberty and Unity from the \nAssociation for Unity Latin America in 1995, the Prize of Javaharlal \nNeru's International Foundation for Unity also in 1995, the Prize of \nCrans Montana World Forum in 1996 and the North American-Kyrgyz \nBusiness Councils International Leadership Award in 1997. More \nrecently, however, President Akaev's wife and first lady, Mairam Akaeva \nwas awarded an honorary doctorate by Utah Valley State College during a \ntrip to the United States late last month. She is also internationally \nknown for her efforts with women and children, spreading the value of \neducation, which is highly regarded in the Kyrgyz Republic, which \nenjoys a literacy rate of 98 percent.\n  I thank President Akaev's commitment to the war on terrorism and \nexpress our gratitude for providing a military base for our troops in \nhis country. There are a number of companies with operations in the \nregion that have helped supply our troops with what they need to \nprevail.\n  As we continue to search for allies in this critical region of the \nworld, it is important to commend those who are trying and slowly \nsucceeding with new found freedoms and economic opportunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/09/senate-section/article/S10984-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               BULLETPROOF VEST PARTNERSHIP GRANT PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that late last night the House \nof Representatives passed H.R. 2714 with the Leahy-Hatch amendment to \nreauthorize the highly successful Department of Justice Bulletproof \nVest Partnership Grant Program. I thank the Chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, for joining me on this amendment. \nThis bipartisan legislation now goes to the president for his signature \ninto law.\n  Our amendment contains the same legislative language as the Campbell-\nLeahy-Hatch Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2003, S. 764. The \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act passed the Senate by unanimous \nconsent on July 15, 2003, and has been awaiting consideration by the \nHouse of Representatives since then.\n  This measure marks the third time that I have had the privilege of \nteaming with my friend and colleague Senator Campbell to work on the \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program. We authored the Bulletproof \nVest Grant Partnership Act of 1998, which responded to the tragic Carl \nDrega shootout in 1997 on the Vermont-New Hampshire border, in which \ntwo State troopers who did not have bulletproof vests were killed. The \nfederal officers who responded to the scenes of the shooting spree were \nequipped with life-saving body armor, but the state and local law \nenforcement officers lacked protective vests because of the cost.\n  Two years later, we successfully passed the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Act of 2000, and now we will go 3-for-3 this time \naround. Senator Campbell brings to our effort invaluable experience in \nthis area and during his time in the Senate he has been a leader in the \narea of law enforcement. As a former deputy sheriff, he knows the \ndangers law enforcement officers face when out on patrol. I am pleased \nthat we have been joined in this effort by 12 other Senate cosponsors, \nincluding Senator Hatch.\n  Our bipartisan legislation will save the lives of law enforcement \nofficers across the country by providing more help to state and local \nlaw enforcement agencies to purchase body armor. Since its inception in \n1999, this highly successful Department of Justice program has provided \nlaw enforcement officers in 16,000 jurisdictions nationwide with nearly \n350,000 new bulletproof vests. In Vermont, 60 municipalities have been \nfortunate to receive funding for the purchase of 1,905 vests.\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2003 will further the \nsuccess of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program by re-\nauthorizing the program through fiscal year 2007. Our legislation would \ncontinue the Federal-State partnership by authorizing up to $50 million \nper year for matching grants to state and local law enforcement \nagencies and Indian tribes at the Department of Justice to buy body \narmor.\n  We know that body armor saves lives, but the cost has put these vests \nout of the reach of many of the officers who need them. This program \nmakes it more affordable for police departments of all sizes. Few \nthings mean more to me than when I meet Vermont police officers and \nthey tell me that the protective vests they wear were made possible \nbecause of this program. This is the least we should do for the \nofficers on the front lines who put themselves in danger for us every \nday. I want to make sure that every police officer who needs a \nbulletproof vest gets one.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/09/senate-section/article/S10984-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10984-S10985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING FAVORITE TEACHERS\n\n  Mr. DAYTON.

A bill to permanently increase the maximum annual \ncontribution allowed to be made to Coverdell education savings \naccounts; to the Committee on Finance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL:\n  S. 2972. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npermanently increase the maximum annual contribution allowed to be made \nto Coverdell education savings accounts, and to provide for a deduction \nfor contributions to education savings accounts; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about increasing \neducational opportunities by improving a tax-free way to save for \ncollege. A college education is invaluable in today's workforce, \nrequiring new skills and a post-secondary education to stay competitive \nin our global economy. That's why I am introducing two pieces of \nlegislation that will help make paying for college easier:\n  The Education Savings for Students Act and College Savings Act both \nexpand current Coverdell education savings accounts by permanently \nincreasing the annual contribution amount to $5,000.\n  The College Savings Act would allow families to deduct from income \nthe amount they contribute to their education savings account. The \nEducation Savings Act keeps the current conditions under Coverdells \nthat investment earnings grow tax-free and withdrawals from their \naccount are tax-exempt when their child goes to school, but permanently \nincreases the minimum annual contribution from $2,000 to $5,000.\n  Both bills provide a financial incentive to put away money for \ncollege where parents have the ability to save now through deductible \ncontributions or bank on projected savings through tax-deferred \nearnings and withdrawals.\n  It's incredible how fast kids grow. One day they're in kindergarten, \nand the next day they're packing up and leaving for college. What's \neven more incredible is that higher education costs grow just as fast \nas they do.\n  I understand that parents have a lot to worry about, especially when \ntheir children are young. But with rising college costs, parents must \nalso be concerned about how to pay for their child's college education. \nMounting tuition costs and prices for books and materials, plus room \nand board have made colleges and universities less affordable for most \nfamilies.\n  College is expensive. There are many parents whose children have \naimed to go to college, but soon discover they can't afford it because \nof rising costs.\n\n[[Page S10988]]\n\n  In 2002, the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education \nreported national trends which--if remain unaddressed--will have \nadverse consequences for expanding students' opportunities to pursue a \nhigher education and future career.\n  This report found that over the last two decades, the cost of \nattending two- and four-year public and private colleges have not only \ngrown more rapidly than inflation, but faster than family incomes, \nincreasing the share of family income that is needed to pay for tuition \nand other college expenses. From 1991 through 2001, tuition at four-\nyear public colleges and universities rose faster than family income in \n41 states, including my home State of Washington.\n  The Washington State Higher Education Coordinating Board reports \nthat, over the last ten years, tuition and fees have far outpaced \nfamily income, increasing 89 percent compared to 51 percent in per \ncapita personal income in my state. In comparison, the cost of most \nconsumer goods increased an average of 20 percent during the same time. \nAnd, per capita personal income in Washington increased 51 percent \nduring this period.\n  As a result, more students and families at all income levels are \nborrowing more money than ever before to pay for college. In 1981, \nloans accounted for 45 percent and grants for 52 percent of federal \nstudent financial aid. In 2000, loans represented 58 percent of Federal \nstudent financial aid, and grants represented 41 percent.\n  Unfortunately, the steepest increases in college and university \ntuition have been imposed during times of greatest economic hardship. \nJust in the past three years, our economy has experienced a loss of 1.8 \nmillion private sector jobs and 2.7 million manufacturing jobs. It is \nmy priority that we prepare our workers for the jobs of today and the \ncareers of the future. If we want to maintain our economic \ncompetitiveness, we need to make college more affordable. We must keep \nup with the demand for skilled workers across all sectors of the \neconomy.\n  In February, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that six of the \nten fastest-growing occupations in the U.S. economy require an \nassociate's degree or bachelor's degree, and that all ten of these \ncareers will require some type of skills training. By 2010, 40 percent \nof all job growth will require some form of post-secondary education.\n  Workers with a college degree make 75 percent more than those \nwithout. A college education pays tremendous dividends--not just to \nindividuals, but also to their entire communities. On average, a one-\nyear increase in a metropolitan area's educational level raises wages \nby three to five percent.\n  Affordability is key to expanding opportunities to go to college. \nLet's face it, we're not all going to pay for college by winning the \nlottery. Saving for college early and often will help lift the \npressures off of parents who are feeling the financial squeeze of \nincreased tuition and fees.\n  For these families, Coverdell Education Savings plans provide a \nneeded relief for the middle class. The purpose of education savings \nplans are to increase saving by increasing net returns. Today, parents \ncan put up to $2,000 a year into a Coverdell Education Savings account. \nThe actual contribution is not tax deductible, but all earnings in this \naccount are free from taxes when they are withdrawn to pay for school.\n  However, the current $2,000 annual limit on Coverdell contributions \nwill be repealed in 2010 unless Congress acts to extend it. If we don't \nextend the contribution level, the maximum contribution will drop to \n$500.\n  While the current tax benefit makes it easier to save for college, \nthe Education Savings Act would increase the annual contributions from \n$2,000 to $5,000 and making this change permanent ensures greater \nsavings for families. By increasing the amount parents can put aside \nfor their children's college savings, middle-income parents will be \nable to more easily save for their child's college education.\n  Say for example, parents start saving when their child turns eight \nyears old. If they put away just $100.00 a month--at an interest rate \nof savings of four percent--by the time their kid turns 18, their \naccount would have earned more than $12,400 in interest. Parents will \nsave over $3,100 in taxes when that child is old enough to go to \nschool.\n  In addition to projected savings, parents also have the option to \nsave now. The College Savings Act would offer families the ability to \ndeduct their contributions each year----\n  Both of these bills, the College Savings Act and the Education \nSavings Act are financial incentives for people to save by allowing \nfamilies to deduct the amount they contribute and take tax-free \nearnings when their child is ready to go to school, would further \nlessen the financial burden that parents bear by saving money early and \noften.\n  Permanently expanding the Coverdell maximum contribution from its \ncurrent threshold of $2,000 to $5,000 a year and allowing this \ncontribution to be tax deductible is a common-sense savings vehicle \nthat keeps future college costs from spinning out of control. \nIncreasing contribution caps will make school more affordable at a time \nwhen a college education and advanced job training is becoming more and \nmore important for economic success.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Schumer, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2973. A bill to clarify the applicability of State law to national \nbanks, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing and \nUrban Affairs.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nalong with Senators Boxer, Murray, Schumer, Lautenberg, and Leahy the \nPreservation of Federalism in Banking Act, to clarify the relationship \nbetween state consumer protection laws and national banks.\n  This legislation responds to a sweeping new rule issued by the Office \nof the Comptroller of the Currency, the agency that regulates national \nbanks. The OCC's new rule gives the agency unprecedented authority to \npre-empt State laws, thereby shielding national banks and their non-\nbank and State-chartered bank affiliates from many important consumer \nprotections. It also potentially limits the ability of States to \nenforce many related laws. The most important immediate consequence of \nthe OCC rule has been the preemption of State anti-predatory lending \nlaws.\n  I feel strongly about the need to address predatory lending, which \ncan trap people in endless cycles of debt and escalating fees. Many \nStates, such as my own state of New Jersey, have enacted tough laws to \ndeal with the problem. Unfortunately, the OCC's ruling substantially \nundermines these laws by regulatory fiat. That will leave many \nconsumers unprotected, and it shifts too many responsibilities to a \nsingle agency here in Washington that is not equipped to handle them. \nAfter all, according to its own website, the OCC ``does not have the \nmandate to engage in consumer advocacy''.\n  Although the OCC has a long and successful record of regulating for \nsafety and soundness, it has little experience dealing with abusive \nlocal practices, such as predatory lending. Believe it or not, the OCC \nactually is proposing to handle all consumer complaints through a \nsingle 22-person call center in Houston. This is totally unrealistic. \nEach year, State officials receive thousands of related complaints, \nwhich usually are very local in nature. These officials are at the \nforefront of the enforcement effort, identifying and combating new \npractices as they arise. The OCC's system simply could not fill this \nrole without major changes.\n  The OCC rule also raises concerns about regulatory charter \ncompetition, the viability of a broad range of state laws, and the \nability of consumers and state officials to seek remedies in court.\n  The OCC rule has provoked strong opposition from governors, attorneys \ngeneral, banking supervisors, and many consumer advocacy groups, not to \nmention the public. The OCC received over 2,600 letters in response to \nits rules, and more than 90 percent opposed them.\n  The Preservation of Federalism in Banking Act is a limited and \nreasonable response to the OCC rule. The bill will clarify the state \nconsumer protection laws with which banks and their\n\n[[Page S10989]]\n\naffiliates must comply. It also will protect financial institutions \nfrom overreaching state laws that seek to directly regulate the core \nactivities of national banks.\n  While the OCC has long had the statutory responsibility to regulate \nthe activities of national banks, it has never denied the ability of \nstates to protect their citizens. The OCC historically has used its \nauthority under the National Bank Act in a reasonable way to shield \nnational banks from state banking laws that intrude on the OCC's \ncongressionally-granted powers. While we should continue to support the \nappropriate use of the agency's authority, it is important that we \nimmediately intervene to reverse the OCC's regulatory overreach and \nprevent the agency from preempting all state consumer protection laws \nand state authority to enforce related laws.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2973\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on a \nsubstitute amendment I propose to make to S. 2485, the ``Veterans \nHealth Programs Improvements Act of 2004,'' as part of my request that \nthe bill, as so amended, be approved by the Senate. The underlying \nbill, S. 2485, was reported by the Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs on July 20, 2004, and is explained in detail in Senate Report \n108-358. My comments at this time are limited to explaining how the \nproposed substitute amendment, which reflects a bipartisan agreement \nbetween Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees on veterans' \nmedical benefits-related issues, differs from the provisions of S. \n2485, as reported.\n  The House has approved a number of bills--H.R. 1318, H.R. 4231, H.R. \n4248, H.R. 4317, H.R. 4608, H.R. 4768, and H.R. 4836--that overlap with \nprovisions drawn from various Senate bills that are contained in S. \n2485, as reported. The language of the substitute amendment, in some \ncases, fine tunes language to harmonize these overlapping provisions \nwithout significant or substantive modification. Further, the \nsubstitute amendment adds provisions that are drawn from House-approved \nbills that had not been considered by the Senate. Among those \nprovisions are measures which will assist the Department of Veterans \nAffairs--VA--and State veterans homes in procuring needed nursing \nservices; provisions which authorize VA major medical facility leases \nand grant programs to assist providers of services to homeless \nveterans; and measures requiring VA reports on historic properties and \nmedical waste management activities. Also included are VA facility \n``naming'' provisions which, in addition to a measure already approved \nby the Veterans' Committee, would name VA facilities in Amarillo, TX; \nPeoria, IL; Lufkin, TX; and Sunnyside, Queens, NY. All of these \nadditional provisions, and all clarifications and modifications to \nlanguage contained in the reported bill, are outlined in the \n``Explanatory Statement'' which I will append to this statement.\n  Each of the additions to S. 2485 that have resulted from negotiations \nwith our colleagues in the House are all useful and productive. The \nbill as it would be modified by the managers' amendment, then, merits \nthe Senate's approval.\n  I yield the floor and ask unanimous consent that the Explanatory \nStatement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              EXPLANATORY STATEMENT ON S. 2485, AS AMENDED\n\n        S. 2485, as amended, (hereinafter, the ``Compromise \n     Agreement'') reflects a negotiated agreement reached by the \n     House of Representatives and Senate Committees on Veterans' \n     Affairs concerning provisions from a number of bills \n     considered by the House and the Senate during the 108th \n     Congress. Legislative provisions contained in the compromise \n     were derived from: H.R. 1318, H.R. 4231, H.R. 4248, H.R. \n     4317, H.R. 4608, H.R. 4658, H.R. 4768, H.R. 4836, and S. \n     2485, as reported by the Senate Committee on Veterans' \n     Affairs on July 20, 2004 (hereinafter, ``S 2485, as \n     reported'').\n       The House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs have \n     prepared the following explanation of the Compromise \n     Agreement.

Funds in the Nursing Home Revolving Fund \n     may only be used for the construction, acquisition, or \n     alteration of nursing home facilities.\n     House Bill\n       Section 102 of the H.R. 4768 would amend chapter 81 of \n     title 38, United States Code, to add a new section 8118 to \n     provide the Secretary with new authority to transfer by sale, \n     exchange or lease unneeded real property currently in VA's \n     portfolio. It would establish a new ``Capital Asset Fund'' to \n     finance actions taken to facilitate the transferring of real \n     property, including demolition, environmental restoration, \n     maintenance and repair, and historic preservation and \n     administrative expenses. Section 102 would also establish \n     ``fair market value'' as the basis for property transfers. \n     Further, it would require the Secretary to include in each \n     year's budget submission to Congress a report of both the \n     uses of the Capital Asset Fund and descriptive information on \n     each completed, pending and planned property disposal. \n     Finally, Section 102 would repeal the Nursing Home Revolving \n     Fund in section 8116 of title 38, United States Code.\n       All of the authorities extended to the Secretary, as \n     outlined above, would be contingent upon the Secretary \n     certifying that VA facilities maintain long-term care \n     capacity as required by section 1710B(b) of title 38, United \n     States Code.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 101 of S. 2485, as reported, would authorize VA for \n     5 years to dispose of excess real property by sale, transfer \n     or exchange to a Federal agency, a State or political \n     subdivision of a State, or to any public or private entity. \n     Such transfers would not be subject to restrictions currently \n     in force. Further, the Committee bill would allow VA to \n     retain the proceeds generated by such disposals of property \n     in a new Capital Asset Fund rather than the Nursing Home \n     Revolving Fund. Funds in the new account could be used to \n     perform non-recurring maintenance, develop construction \n     proposals, or dispose of other VA property.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       The Compromise Agreement follows the House language except \n     that the contingencies upon which the House authorization \n     rested are no longer included. Instead, the Compromise \n     Agreement makes the transfer of funds from, and elimination \n     of, the Nursing Home Revolving Fund contingent on the \n     Secretary certifying that VA facilities maintain long-term \n     care capacity as required by section 1710B(b) of title 38, \n     United States Code. All other authorities would take effect \n     immediately.\n\n\n   SEC. 412--ANNUAL REPORT TO CONGRESS ON INVENTORY OF DEPARTMENT OF \n                   VETERANS AFFAIRS HISTORIC PROPERTY\n\n     CurrentLaw\n       No similar provision exists under current law.\n     House Bill\n       Section 103 of H.R. 4768 would require VA to establish a \n     national inventory of historic VA properties and would \n     require reports to Congress over several years on the status \n     of such properties.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       The Compromise Agreement follows the House language.\n\n\n SEC. 413--AUTHORITY TO ACQUIRE AND TRANSFER REAL PROPERTY FOR USE FOR \n                           HOMELESS VETERANS\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 8103 of title 38, United States Code, authorizes \n     the Secretary to acquire such land as is necessary for the \n     purpose of providing medical services.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contains no comparable provision.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       The Compromise Agreement permits the Secretary to acquire \n     land, in the District of Columbia, suitable for providing \n     services to homeless veterans if the Secretary has identified \n     a homeless assistance provider that is prepared to acquire \n     the property from the Secretary promptly following the \n     acquisition of the land by the Secretary.\n\n\nSEC. 414--LIMITATION ON IMPLEMENTATION OF MISSION CHANGES FOR SPECIFIED \n               VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION FACILITIES\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 401 of Public Law 108-193, the ``Veterans Health \n     Care Authorities Extension and Improvement Act of 2003,'' \n     requires VA to notify Congress of facility closings proposed \n     under the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services \n     initiative, and prohibits such closings from occurring until \n     the lapse of 60 days following the notification or 30 days of \n     continuous session of Congress, whichever is longer.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contains no comparable provision.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 104 of S. 2485, as reported, would prohibit the \n     Secretary from implementing a mission change for a medical \n     facility (other than a mission change prescribed by the \n     Secretary in his Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced \n     Services initiative Final Report) until 90 days after the \n     date on which the Secretary submits to the Committees on \n     Veterans' Affairs written notice of the mission change.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 414 of the Compromise Agreement prohibits the \n     Secretary from implementing a mission change until the lapse \n     of 60 days following notification or 30 days of continuous \n     session of Congress, whichever is longer, at VA Medical \n     Centers in the following locations: Boston, Massachusetts; \n     New York City, New York; Big Springs, Texas; Dublin, Georgia; \n     Montgomery, Alabama; Louisville, Kentucky; Muscogee \n     (including the outpatient clinic in Tulsa), Oklahoma; Poplar \n     Bluff, Missouri; Ft.

In making the \n     determination to enter into such an ``enhanced-use lease'', \n     VA may only consider the needs of the Veterans Health \n     Administration as outlined in business plans set forth by the \n     Under Secretary for Health.

Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will resume \nconsideration, in an unusual session on Sunday, of the FSC/ETI JOBS \nconference report. Under the previous order, we will vote at 1 p.m. on \ncloture of the FSC bill. I hope cloture is invoked and that we could \nthen reach an agreement for a time certain for passage.\n  In addition, moments ago I filed cloture on two appropriations \nmatters: Military Construction and Homeland Security. Both are very \nimportant bills. It was necessary to file cloture because of the \nobstruction that has played out over the last 2 days from the other \nside of the aisle. The votes will likely occur on Monday.\n  We have those three remaining issues prior to our adjournment. When \nwe complete action on the FSC/ETI bill and the two appropriations \nbills, then we will have concluded our work that was set out by the \nDemocratic leader and myself days ago; we will be finished.\n  It has been a tough several days, with a very unusual session today, \na full day on Saturday, with votes. Because of these cloture votes, \nwhich have certain time limits, we are really forced to come back \ntomorrow in order to complete our business. It looks like we will be \ngoing into the holiday on Monday as well, which is mutually agreed upon \nbetween both sides of the aisle in order to complete our business. The \nbills before us, such as Homeland Security, we need to get through this \nbody. A lot of people watching are wondering, why in the world can't \nthe Senate move more quickly? I hope we can do so.\n\n[[Page S11009]]\n\n  Right now, we will stay on course and we will enter tomorrow with the \nschedule that we have outlined, and I think we can make continued \nprogress and complete our work, hopefully, Monday morning. We will \ncontinue to consider other legislative or executive items that can be \ncleared as we go forward.\n  Again, I thank Members for their participation over the course of \nyesterday, today, and tomorrow. This is all vitally important work. \nThat is why we were here all day today and well into the evening \ntonight, and that is why we will be here tomorrow morning in this very \nunusual session.\n  I understand that the Chair has an announcement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/09/senate-section/article/S11009-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CORRECTING THE ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 5107\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
