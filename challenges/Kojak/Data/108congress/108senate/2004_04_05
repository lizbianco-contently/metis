Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business for Senators to make statements and to introduce \nlegislation. There will be no rollcall votes during\n\n[[Page S3624]]\n\ntoday's session, and tomorrow the Senate will resume debate on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 2207, the Pregnancy and Trauma Care Access \nPrevention Act of 2004. Last week I filed a cloture motion on that \nmotion to proceed, and that vote will occur at 2:15 on Wednesday. That \ncloture vote will be the first rollcall vote during this week.\n  I had hoped to reach agreement for us to begin this medical liability \nbill, but there was an objection from the other side of the aisle which \nhas made this cloture necessary. I know Chairman Gregg and others will \nwant to speak to the issue tomorrow, and I encourage all Members to \nlisten closely to the debate.\n  The whole issue of medical malpractice reform and medical liability \nhas reached crisis proportions in this country, as will be discussed \ntomorrow. You can't go to any community that is not affected by the \nunnecessary and frivolous lawsuits that have been filed, which results \nin a poor quality of care, with less access, with physicians moving \nfrom communities--in fact, some physicians leaving their specialty or \nleaving the practice of medicine altogether.\n  This week we will also try to finish the bill that has to do with \nmanufacturing and jobs and taxation, a bill called the JOBS bill or a \nbill that is known as the FSC/ETI legislation. This is a very important \nbill that is directed at putting in sync our trade policy with what is \nactually carried out today in trade.\n  We continue to have discussions on how to finish this legislation. \nUnfortunately, there are an inordinate number of amendments that keep \ncoming from the other side of the aisle. Given the importance of this \nbill and the timeliness of it, it is imperative we find a way to \ncomplete the measure as quickly as we possibly can without having to \nconsider an additional 30 or 40 amendments.\n  Today I will offer a second cloture motion so we can have a vote this \nweek to determine if Members are prepared to bring this bill to a \nconclusion.\n  The House passed the conference report to accompany the Pension \nFunding Equity Act. That conference report should be arriving today, \nand we must act on that conference report. I will be talking to the \nDemocratic leader about scheduling the pension bill this week. I \nunderstand there is a payment deadline on April 15 and, therefore, \nthere is urgency for us to act quickly and to act this week before we \nwill be on our recess next week. Again, there is a payment deadline of \nApril 15, and thus I want to act on this pension bill this week.\n  On yet another subject, the Commerce Committee is to file the \nlegislation which is known as the indecency legislation. The House has \nacted, and we would like to expedite consideration of this bill as soon \nas we possibly can.\n  Lastly, I remind everyone we have been working for some time on \nasbestos litigation. We will be bringing that bill to the floor after \nthe Easter recess. I hope Senators will allow us to proceed to that \nmeasure and debate the underlying bill, an important bill that \nrecognizes the asbestos litigation system is out of control today and \npeople who should be compensated are not receiving their just \ncompensation because of a lack of reform. It is an issue we have talked \na lot about, an issue that has been addressed in committee, and an \nissue we should address and will address in the Senate.\n  In a few moments I will be addressing issues surrounding health care \nsecurity for our seniors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/05/senate-section/article/S3624-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE OVER THE EASTER HOLIDAY\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 404) was agreed to, as \nfollows:\n\n                            H. Con. Res. 404\n\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That when the House adjourns on the legislative \n     day of Friday, April 2, 2004, it stand adjourned until 2 p.m. \n     on Tuesday, April 20, 2004, or until the time of any \n     reassembly pursuant to section 2 of this concurrent \n     resolution, whichever occurs first; and that when the Senate \n     recesses or adjourns on Wednesday, April 7, 2004, Thursday, \n     April 8, 2004, or Friday, April 9, 2004, on a motion offered \n     pursuant to this concurrent resolution by its Majority Leader \n     or his designee, it stand recessed or adjourned until noon on \n     Monday, April 19, 2004, or at such other time on that day as \n     may be specified by its Majority Leader or his designee in \n     the motion to recess or adjourn, or until the time of any \n     reassembly pursuant to section 2 of this concurrent \n     resolution, whichever occurs first.\n       Sec. 2.

Mr. President, last night, I called my mother-in-law in \nFort Worth, TX, just to get her perspective on Medicare and health care \nsecurity for seniors, and to ask her what she, a long way from \nWashington, DC, understood in terms of the important Medicare \nlegislation we passed on this floor in a bipartisan way--a Medicare \nbill that was signed by the President of the United States on December \n8, 4 months ago. We had a good conversation.\n  I asked a little bit in a personal way about her own experience with \nbuying prescription drugs. She, like most seniors who are having to buy \nprescription drugs on their own--because, remember, until December of \nthis past year, 4 months ago, prescription drugs were outside of \nMedicare. So many seniors are dependent on prescription drugs for a \nwhole range of illnesses, or to prevent illnesses, whether it is \narthritis, diabetes, heart disease, or cancer. Those prescription drugs \nhave been out of reach, or at least must be obtained outside of the \nMedicare system but indeed no longer.\n  It was clear to me that there is a lot of confusion by what people \nsee in the press, what people see on television, comments that are made \nby opponents to that legislation. So I want to take a few minutes to \ncomment on the importance of this legislation, but equally important, \non what this legislation is doing and can do and will do for \nindividuals with disabilities and seniors. I am speaking about 40 \nmillion people who will potentially be touched by this legislation we \npassed 4 months ago.\n  The first point. Already, seniors are benefiting. The legislation was \nsigned December 8, and already seniors are benefiting because of the \nnew bill and the reforms in that bill. Health care plans are getting an \nextra boost. As a result, seniors who are enrolled in Medicare health \nplans, Medicare private health plans, are already receiving better \nbenefits at lower, what we call out-of-pocket costs. Already, these \nseniors are receiving more benefits at lower out-of-pocket costs.\n  In fact, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services--when you \nhear CMMS, that means Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which \nis the Government organization, or entity, the center in charge of \nmanaging and administering Medicare. They report that 3.7 million \nseniors are already receiving increased benefits, just 4 months after \nsigning the bill, and 2 million have received lower cost sharing. That \nmeans when they actually have a benefit delivered, they pay less for \nthat benefit; 1.9 million have seen their premiums go down; and it is \nless than 4 months after the President signed the bill. That is, the \nmonthly premium seniors are paying has already gone down for 1.9 \nmillion seniors.\n  Let me share with you just one specific example. Aetna has eliminated \ncopayments for a whole broad range of preventive services. That \nincludes routine physical examinations. It is interesting; until this \nMedicare legislation, routine physical examinations were not part of \nMedicare. They eliminated copayments for routine physical exams; they \neliminated copayments for bone mass measurements; they eliminated \ncopayments for colorectal screening exams, prostate screening exams, \nmammograms, pelvic exams, and for routine hearing and vision exams for \nseniors enrolled in their Medicare Advantage plans.\n  Aetna has also slashed copayments for inpatient hospitalizations--\nthat is\n\n[[Page S3625]]\n\nwhen you are admitted to the hospital--by 50 percent. They added \ncoverage for generic drugs in every market and for brand-name drugs in \nmany of its larger markets.\n  In less than a month from now, seniors are going to also be able to \ntake advantage of a new Medicare-endorsed prescription drug discount \ncard. In less than 2 months, all Medicare beneficiaries, whether they \nare enrolled in private plans or whether they are enrolled in the \ntraditional Medicare Program, are going to be able to use these \ndiscount cards, endorsed by Medicare, in order to get a 10- to 25-\npercent discount off the cost of their prescription drugs. These cards, \nin 2 months, are going to be available. You will be able to take them \nin, and however you are getting prescription drugs today, you will be \nable to get an additional 10- to 25-percent discount.\n  There is even better news for those 8 million lower income seniors--\nthose who have the hardest time affording prescription drugs, or \nadditional costs of health care. They will be eligible for an \nadditional $600 in subsidies and assistance on top of the discount they \nare going to get, that 10- to 25-percent discount. That is, again, 8 \nmillion lower income seniors who will have the discount card, 10- to \n25-percent discount, but in addition will get $600 in value, subsidies, \nto purchase prescription drugs. That is $600 in assistance they didn't \nhave before the President signed that bill on December 8 of last year.\n  At the end of April, in about 3, 3\\1/2\\ weeks, all Medicare \nbeneficiaries will be receiving a letter from the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services, Tommy Thompson. In that letter, there will be a \nfour-page guide with information on this discount card.\n  When I talked to my mother-in-law last night, she said she faintly \nheard about this card but didn't have too much information on that. I \ntold her in a few weeks this information will come to you in a letter. \nRead that four-page guide. More detailed information will be available \nfrom the Department of Health and Human Services. It will placed on the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services Web site and, as most people \nare beginning to hear, you can call 1-800-medicare and obtain even \nfurther information. If you call that number, they will also send you a \n32-page booklet called Guide to Choosing a Medicare-Approved Drug \nDiscount Card.\n  I mention all this now because people say they don't know very much \nabout the card, but I point out that information will be made available \non a timely basis so you will be able to understand what these cards \nprovide, what they don't provide, and also what is the best card for \nyou to choose given what drugs you may be on.\n  In fact, the Health and Human Services Web site will contain a \nfantastic new analysis, or Web page, that is easy to use called Price \nCompare. It is a price-compare tool that will allow seniors to choose \nthe drug card that is best for them and their individual needs by \noffering a comparison of the cards available in that area for them. It \nwill be specific, where you can put on that Web page what drugs you are \non, and there will be a comparative analysis that is placed on the Web \nsite where you can say this card looks like it would benefit me better \nthan the other card, as well as a listing of all the cards available in \nyour area. This site will be live and up and running at the end of this \nmonth, on April 29. It will have information as to how individuals with \ntheir individual needs will be able to benefit. Actually, an individual \nor specific pharmacies in one's community will be listed as well. So I \nam looking forward to that site. It will be a fantastic new Web site.\n  Right now, seniors and their families can go to a Web site, if you \nwant to, www.medicare.gov. On the Web site you would look for a site \ncalled ``Prescription Drugs and Other Assistance Programs.'' There is a \nsection on that Web site. There you can enter your ZIP Code, where you \nlive, and you can enter your income and your current medications to \nfind out which cards will be available in your area.\n  This is a wonderful and easy way to get prepared once the final Web \nsite comes out, and those benefits are made available. Again, we will \nkeep you posted on when the benefits specifically become available. It \nis clear that seniors and individuals with disabilities need and \ndeserve relief from these high costs of prescription drugs.\n  Seniors need and deserve a Medicare Program that provides them with \nwhat they want, and that is health care security. In the event one \nneeds medicine to prevent a disease or illness, or when one is a senior \nor an individual with a disability and an illness strikes, they will \nhave access to appropriate treatment. When I say health care security, \nthat is what I mean.\n  Now that prescription drugs are brought into Medicare, we can say \nseniors will have affordable access with this legislation, much better \nthan in the past.\n  I do want to tell the seniors of America that the President of the \nUnited States has heard them in that it is difficult to receive and \npurchase these skyrocketing prescription drugs because of the cost. The \nleadership in Congress has responded with this bipartisan plan and, \nindeed, help is on the way, and more help will be on the way in the \ncoming weeks. That is the positive side.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to comment on the fact that \ndespite this landmark and new commitment--and, yes, it does mean more \nGovernment resources are directed at seniors who need those resources \nin terms of help obtaining prescription drugs--hardly a day goes by \nthat opponents to this legislation do not level a new attack or a new \naccusation or seek a new investigation trying to tear apart this \ntremendous accomplishment for our seniors and for our individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  I want to thank and commend Secretary Tommy Thompson for initiating \nan investigation that is being conducted by the inspector general of \nthe Department of Health and Human Services in response to some of \nthese accusations. I look forward to the inspector general's findings. \nIf a law has in any way been broken, or if information was \ninappropriately withheld from Congress, clearly appropriate actions \nought to and will be taken. However, the number of the attacks and the \nvehemence of the attacks coming from the other side, from those people \nwho opposed this landmark legislation for seniors, suggests there is a \nlot more at work and a lot more is going on than just wanting strong \ncongressional oversight or good government. Unfortunately, what we are \nseeing is an orchestrated scheme to discredit the progress that has \nbeen made to date to get prescription drugs to seniors in an affordable \nway; to dismantle the prescription drug coverage that for the first \ntime in history we have put into the Medicare system. The opponents to \nthe original legislation seem to want to dismantle that. It is \npolitical gamesmanship.\n  Part of it is driven by the success of passage of this wonderful \nlegislation. Part of it is the fact that it is a political year and we \nhave 7 months or so going into these elections, and people say this \nMedicare legislation, which is a success for the President of the \nUnited States and a success for this body, needs to be discredited in \nsome way, I would argue, for political purposes.\n  We know for a fact that attacking Medicare is in part an aspect of \nthe opponents' game plan for the elections. Why do I say that? Because \nwe can actually find it in writing in a memo written earlier this year \nto Democratic leaders. Party pollsters outlined a game plan for \ndiscrediting this landmark Medicare Modernization Act. The pollsters' \nadvice in the memo was unequivocal that Democrats were in danger of \nsurrendering the Medicare issue unless they were willing to totally \ndiscredit the legislation by defining it as, and I draw upon their \nwords, ``unacceptable.''\n\n  We are seeing results. This poll-driven political game is being \nfollowed. For some, voting against the legislation was not enough. They \nhave also tried to prevent seniors from learning about the new benefits \nto which they are entitled, some of which I just outlined. They have \nleveled charges intended to frighten seniors and to undermine the \nlegislation itself.\n  We simply will not let it happen. We cannot let it happen. I want \nseniors to know we will not turn back the clock on the progress we have \nmade, under the leadership of the President of the United States and \nthis body. We will make sure seniors and individuals with\n\n[[Page S3626]]\n\ndisabilities get these new benefits they need and deserve.\n  When this law is fully implemented, the bottom line is that seniors \nwill have better access to more affordable medicines and prescription \ndrugs they need.\n  There are several examples. Sixteen million lower income seniors--\nthere are 40 million seniors today and 16 million lower income seniors \nare going to be paying little or no monthly premium, and no more than \n$5 for each prescription. That is a huge benefit to those people who \nare most vulnerable to not being able to obtain prescription drugs.\n  If we look at the 40 million seniors today, there will be 10 million \nseniors who have no current prescription drug coverage who will get \nrelief from the high cost of prescription drugs by this legislation. \nAll 40 million seniors today, and the 80 million baby boomers who will \nbe coming through the system over the next 30 years, will have access \nto more preventive care because of this legislation. By that I mean \nsimple things such as cholesterol screenings that were not a part of \nMedicare but are a part of Medicare today.\n  I mentioned baseline physical examinations. For the first time in \nMedicare--and it is through those baseline physical examinations that \nthe diagnosis of hypertension or possibly diabetes is made. For the \nfirst time, these baseline physical examinations will be a part of \nMedicare. The purpose is to diagnose the potential for having a stroke \nby figuring out whether or not one has hypertension, or one is at a \nrisk for heart disease, diabetes, or cancer.\n  We talk about chronic care coordination and disease management. Those \nare terms that are misunderstood, but they are very important. As a \nphysician, it is important because with an aging population we see more \nchronic disease. As people live longer and we are able to treat acute \nand chronic disease such as heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or \nother debilitating arthritis, diabetes, or stroke, after one has had a \nstroke, it is very important. Couple that with diseases such as \nAlzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, how those chronic diseases are \nmanaged, especially when there is one, two, or three of the diseases \nwith overlapping care, it is absolutely critical.\n  Our system historically has not been set up very well. Especially in \nMedicare it has not been set up at all until recently, until this bill, \nto manage this complex overlap of diabetes with heart disease, with \narthritis, with Parkinson's disease. For the first time in this \nMedicare bill there is an appropriate system set up for disease \nmanagement and chronic disease coordination. Physicians will be able to \ncontinue treating Medicare patients because in the new law there was $7 \nbillion included to help safeguard medical services to seniors. Seniors \nin rural areas will benefit from the legislation's historic $25 billion \ninvestment in improving health care in rural America, to provide \nservices that may not be there today, to set up a system that will \nattract or keep nurses and physicians in rural areas, $25 billion \ninjected into the system to better accomplish taking care of and \nmanaging the care of seniors in rural America.\n  For the whole category of retirees today who get health coverage from \ntheir former employer, the cost of this bill will be more secure, \nthanks to the bill's $89 billion in increased Government assistance to \nretirees.\n  I mentioned last night that my conversation with my mother-in-law \nvery quickly came to the cost of a particular medicine she was taking \nand how, over the last three billing periods, I think she said, each \ntime the cost of that one medicine has gone up. Was it addressed in the \nMedicare bill?\n  As a first step, it was addressed. We still have a lot more to do. \nThis Medicare bill was never intended to solve all of the challenges we \nhave in Medicare today, but we did take a first step in controlling \nthose prescription drug costs.\n  Drug costs will be held more firmly in check for all Americans, not \njust seniors but for all Americans. That is because the Medicare bill \nhad a whole part which speeds the cheaper generic drugs that are just \nas good, with just as much what we call efficacy--they are equal in \nefficacy, but it speeds those generic drugs to market, and by market I \nmean consumers; by consumers I mean patients; by patients I mean people \nsuch as my relatives, my mother-in-law, seniors who are out there \ntoday. Also, the Medicare bill helps close many of those loopholes in \nour Nation's patent laws that prevented prescription drug price \ncompetition.\n  Again, it is a first step. It doesn't attempt to solve all of the \nprescription costs, the skyrocketing costs we see for prescription \ndrugs, but takes a very definite first step.\n  There is a lot of confusion about what health savings accounts are, \nbut when you look at the Medicare bill, for the first time we have \noffered a health savings account or medical savings account that an \nindividual can own. It does not apply just to seniors; it can start \nwith a 20-year-old or 25- or 30- or 35- or 40-year-old. But it is an \naccount that you yourself pay into, tax free. For health benefits that \nyou want to pay for, you take it out tax free. So it is a tax favored \nsavings account that you own and you can take with you through life. If \nyou pay into it when you are 25 years of age or 30 years of age or 35 \nyears of age, but say you have a high deductible insurance policy, and \nyou don't have any health expenses that year, the money that you put in \nor that your employer put in or somebody from your family put in, rolls \nover to the next year and grows. If you don't need it the next year, it \ngrows again. If you don't need it when you are 33, it grows again, or \n35 or 40 or 45. You take it. You draw down on it, but you take it with \nyou.\n  When you get to be a senior, you can use it to pay for some of those \ncopayments for a prescription drug or you can use it to pay for your \nlong-term care if you need long-term care.\n  It is a fantastic new entity that gives the individual real \nownership--control over health care decisionmaking, control over that \nhealth care dollar. It is called a health savings account. It will be \ncoming on line very soon. It was part of this Medicare bill signed by \nthe President 4 months ago.\n  In closing, this Medicare Modernization Act is helping millions of \nseniors in countless ways. Millions are being helped right now because \nof the passage of this bill. We are getting results. It is a major \nfirst step. I say it is a first step, a major first step, because, \nalthough it is a big bill, an important bill, a significant piece of \nlegislation, because clearly there are things we will have to do about \nthe cost of health care, affordability to our seniors, access to health \ncare, addressing the issues of the trust fund itself, addressing the \ndoubling of the number of seniors who will come into the system over \nthe next 30 years with a diminishing number of the workforce actually \npaying into the system. These are all issues we will have to address. \nBut this bill is a major first step that is to the benefit of every \nsenior listening to me today and those 78 million people who will be \nnew seniors over the next 30 years.\n\n  We worked hard on this in this body, the Senate. We worked with the \nHouse. We worked in a bipartisan way to provide these benefits to \nAmerica's seniors. We have worked hard to give seniors today the \ncoverage they need and to give them the Medicare coverage they deserve. \nWe simply cannot, we will not let election politics get in the way of \nhealth care for millions of America's seniors.\n  I will close and review again very quickly those benefits on the \nchart next to me that outline how important this particular bill is \nthat was not law on December 1 but on December 8 was signed by the \nPresident of the United States. Those benefits include a drug card with \n10-25 percent immediate prescription drug discounts and additional \nrelief for 8 million low-income seniors. That is now a reality. \nComprehensive prescription drug coverage for 16 million low-income \nseniors is now a reality. Protection against high--catastrophic \nprescription drug costs, something that all seniors fear, not knowing \nwhat might happen to them 5 years from now or 10 years from now. There \nare new preventive benefits, including that annual physical examination \nwhere, for the first time, when that blood pressure cuff may be put \naround your arm and the diagnosis of high blood pressure is made, for \nthe first time in the cost of the Medicare bill you can get help \ngetting a drug,\n\n[[Page S3627]]\n\nthrough Medicare, to prevent that hypertension causing a heart attack \nwhich otherwise would put you into the hospital--very expensive--or \ncause a stroke--very expensive. Now that can be preventative.\n  There is $7 billion in improved physician payments which physicians \ndeserve; $25 billion in rural health improvements in order that our \nrural communities will be able to access the appropriate health care \nthey need today; $26 billion in State Medicaid relief and affordable \nhealth care through tax deductible health savings accounts. All of it \nis a first step, a start.\n  I wish to comment this has been accomplished in a bipartisan way. We \nneed to continue working in a bipartisan way. I look forward to doing \nthat. I look forward to working with both sides of the aisle to the \nbenefit of America's seniors.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/05/senate-section/article/S3627-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, first, in terms of jobs and job training, \nthis morning the President of the United States unveiled a proposal to \ndouble the number of Americans who would receive job training \nassistance from the Federal Government. The initiative reflects the \nPresident's commitment to help people get the training they need, they \nrequire to find new jobs and better jobs. It builds upon an earlier \nproposal by the President of the United States announced in his State \nof the Union Message in January to help community colleges train an \nadditional 100,000 workers for industries that are creating jobs in \nthis country, to bring these job training programs to people who need \nthe education and the job training, and to use our community colleges, \nexpanding on the tremendous resource they provide today.\n  As we all know, our economy is changing and changing fast. It is \nbeing transformed in so many ways. That is a great source of strength \nand adaptability, that flexibility to changing times both here in this \ncountry and around the world. Yet, at the same time, as we increasingly \nrealize, this transformation, this adaptability, this flexibility in \nour economy--these changes in our economy--almost by definition result \nin a dislocation, a loss of jobs for some individual workers. That \nleaves us with a responsibility that we on the floor of the Senate must \naddress, and we have addressed in part, but we have not fully \naddressed.\n  We must make a strong commitment to effective--I underscore that word \n``effective''--job training programs that will help American workers \nadapt to that changing economy, to give them the tools they need to \nfill those new jobs that are being created.\n  The Department of Labor, as we all know by now, announced last Friday \nthat more than a half a million new jobs have thus far been created \nthis year. That is good news. It is great news. We need to keep working \nto ensure that more jobs are created, and that workers are being \ntrained to fill those new jobs that are being created. We need to \nrespond now as well as in the months ahead.\n  We hear about the Workforce Investment Act, the WIA. We hear about \nit, and we hear that it is being obstructed, that we have acted in the \nSenate, that the House has acted, but it cannot make it to conference. \nYes, this is one of a whole series of bills that we have worked on, \nthat we have passed, and then we have this obstruction in getting to \nconference. Although my colleagues know, others who are listening may \nnot: No matter how much work you do on the Senate floor, and the House \nfloor, and you pass things, until you get it to conference and work \nthrough it and bring it back to the floor, it does not become law of \nthe land. That is exactly where we are with this Workforce Investment \nAct.\n  People ask, what is the Workforce Investment Act? Right now, our \nFederal Government sends about $4 billion--actually, more than $4 \nbillion--a year to State governments and local governments through this \nWorkforce Investment Act. However, last year, only 200,000 people--\n200,000 workers--received job training through these programs.\n  President Bush, as he outlined today, has set a goal to double the \nnumber of workers receiving job training through Workforce Investment \nAct programs. So we have fewer than 200,000 workers, and that would \nmean doubling it to 400,000 workers a year. He set out--and \nappropriately, I believe, and as reflected in our underlying bill--he \nwants to do this by maximizing the Federal dollars that are sent, by \nmaximizing those Federal dollars directly to the workers themselves--\ngetting it right down to the workers themselves, No. 1, and, No. 2, \neliminating the bureaucracy, the overlap, the duplication, the overhead \ncost, where we know there are going to be additional savings. So we \nhave a problem, but it is a problem that we know can be fixed.\n  Right now, the Federal Government spends $23 billion a year on more \nthan 30 job training programs, spread across nine different Departments \nand agencies.\n  The result of that is a confusing patchwork of programs that result \nin overlapping, inefficiencies, confusion, and chaos. This overlap of \nall of these programs results in bureaucratic redtape. You put all that \ntogether, it means fewer of the dollars that are allocated, that are \nspent actually get down to that individual worker or person who is to \nreceive job training. I applaud the President for his focus on creating \njobs, on training workers for jobs today and the future, but we in the \nCongress have to step up as well.\n  The fact is the Workforce Investment Act has expired. It needs to be \nreauthorized. Mr. Enzi, the Senator from Wyoming, who is chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Employment Safety and Training of the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions, has done a tremendous job in \nworking with his colleagues in a bipartisan way to develop a bill. That \nbill has passed in the Senate. A companion bill has passed in the \nHouse. But because of objections from the other side of the aisle, we \nhave been unable to go to conference, to pull those two bills together \non this important JOBS legislation.\n  I do hope that the other side of the aisle will reconsider their \nobjections to go to conference so that we indeed can get important \nlegislation to the President and get workers back to work, get people \nback to work who may have lost their jobs with the appropriate \ntraining. That is our responsibility. The President has laid out the \nvision, laid out the agenda. We have written the legislation. We passed \nthe legislation. Now it is time to marry that legislation with the \nHouse in conference.\n  Thus I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to reconsider \nand\n\n[[Page S3628]]\n\nallow us to go to conference. It is in our workers' best interest. \nIndeed, it is in America's best interest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/05/senate-section/article/S3628-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ASBESTOS LITIGATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this is a matter I have referred to on \nseveral occasions in the last several weeks. In fact, I referred to it \nlast Friday; that matter being that we have an asbestos litigation \ncrisis that is brewing today. It is a crisis we in Congress have a \nresponsibility to fix. That is the assessment of the Supreme Court \nwhich on two occasions has in essence said the system is broken and \nCongress has the responsibility to fix it.\n  I rise to reiterate my goal to resolve this asbestos litigation \ncrisis and also to announce that we will file a revised bill later this \nweek so people and all of our colleagues will have the opportunity to \nlook at what is in the bill and study what is in the bill itself. We \nhave made tremendous progress toward enacting Chairman Hatch's Fairness \nin Asbestos Injury Resolution Act; we call it the FAIR Act. I, as \nmajority leader, have made all of this a personal priority in the sense \nthat I want the Senate to be able to address and resolve this issue.\n  Indeed, the magnitude of the asbestos litigation crisis is \nstaggering. The torrent of asbestos litigation has wreaked havoc on \nvictims, on American jobs, and indeed on our economy. The 600,000 \nclaims that have been filed have already cost $54 billion in \nsettlements and judgments and litigation costs. And even with the \nbillions already being spent, the asbestos tort system today has become \nnothing more than a litigation lottery. A few victims receive adequate \ncompensation, but far more suffer long delays for unpredictable and \nindeed inequitable awards if they receive anything at all. It is a \nsystem today with only one real consistent winner, and that is the \nplaintiffs' trial lawyers, who, I should add, by the way, are taking \nhome half of every dollar that is awarded to the victims.\n  The system is broken. We have the responsibility--in fact this body, \nthe Congress, has the obligation and the responsibility--to fix this \nbroken system.\n  As I mentioned, we will be introducing the revised bill later this \nweek and giving Members substantial time to review the changes we are \nproposing that came out of the committee. We have made real progress \ntoward closing the gaps that separated the insurers from the defendant \ncompanies, from organized labor. Chairman Hatch, the minority leader, \nSenators Leahy, Dodd, and Specter, and many others have invested \nheavily in reaching consensus on many of these issues.\n  I hope my colleagues will very carefully consider what is in this \nbill and engage in meaningful debate. Member after Member from both \nsides have voiced their agreement with that assessment by the Supreme \nCourt, that the system is broken and Congress has the responsibility to \nfix it. With the help of my colleagues I am confident we can fix it. As \nI have outlined many times in the Senate, we have a process whereby we \ncan consider that bill and bring it to the floor and indeed fix it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/05/senate-section/article/S3628-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I rise today with great sadness and \ntremendous gratitude to honor the life of a\n\n[[Page S3629]]\n\nbrave law enforcement officer from Mishawaka. Corporal Thomas Roberts \nwas only 43 years old when his life was taken from him in an instant. \nHe died during the predawn hours of December 13, 2003 in Mishawaka, \nwhile responding to a ``shots fired'' call. He was hit by the \nassailant's gunfire and died at the scene. As a 14-year veteran of the \nMishawaka Police Department, Tom was a respected police officer who \nprotected community members and fought for the values we all hold close \nto our hearts.\n  Tom Roberts was the second officer killed that night while dutifully \nserving his city. Today, I join Tom's family, friends, and the entire \nMichiana community in mourning Tom's death. While our pride in Tom \nshall certainly live on, so, too, will our sorrow.\n  After working for 10 years at Ladig, Inc., Tom attended the \nPlainfield Police Academy and joined the Mishawaka Police Department in \n1989. On or off the job, he treated everyone he met with respect and \ndignity. As a caring and concerned man, Tom always reached out to help \nothers in any way he could. His respected career is a testament to his \ncommitment to hard work and willingness to help others.\n  Tom graduated from Mishawaka High School where he was a member of the \nfootball team. Tom had a lifelong love of football and was an avid \nNotre Dame football fan. He especially enjoyed going to the games with \nhis family and friends and collecting sports memorabilia.\n  Tom leaves behind his loving fiancee, Debbie McGinnis; his daughters, \nLindsay, Holly, and Ashley; his son, Larry Peak; his mother, Francelia; \nbrothers, Larry and Gary; and his sisters, Ann Marie, Celia Dillon, \nPeggy Boyd, and Lisa.

Mr. President, I am proud to announce that the \nclass from Kahuku High School of Kahuku, HI, will represent the State \nof Hawaii at the national finals of We the People: The Citizen and the \nConstitution. These Hawaii students will join the more than 1,200 \nstudents from across the country that will visit Washington, DC, to \ntake part in the We the People national competition to be held during \nthe first week of May. These outstanding students, through their \nknowledge of the U.S. Constitution, won Hawaii's statewide competition \nand earned the chance to come to our Nation's Capital and compete at \nthe national level.\n  The We the People program is administered by the Center for Civic \nEducation and is an extensive educational program developed \nspecifically to educate young people about the U.S. Constitution and \nBill of Rights. The 3-day competition is modeled after hearings in the \nU.S. Congress and provides students with the opportunity to demonstrate \ntheir knowledge before a panel of adult judges while they evaluate, \ntake, and defend positions on relevant historical and contemporary \nissues. Their testimony is followed by questions designed to probe the \nstudents' depth of understanding and ability to apply their \nconstitutional knowledge.\n  I would like to recognize the following 25 Kahuku students that will \nbe representing the State of Hawaii: Samuel Braden, Chelsey Bunker, \nStacia Colton, Brian Craycroft, Tusi Esera, Lacey Golonka, Evelyn \nGriffin, Reis Harney, Celesta Hubner, Jeremy James, Natalie Kamauoha, \nJennifer Kamiya, Azura Iversen-Keahi, Tiffany Lee, Brook McArthur, \nDonna Ramos, Leilani Relator, Alicia Reidy, Aaron Rillamas, Jordan \nWilliams, Austin Spring, Ian Tapu, Alexandra Thompson, Rachel Tolleson, \nand Seini Unga. I would especially like to thank their teacher, Ms. \nSandra Cashman, for once again seizing this opportunity to empower and \neducate students about the significance of the American institutions of \nconstitutional democracy. I am confident that the students will step up \nto the challenges presented in this competition and they will give a \nstellar performance.\n  As one who formerly taught at Kahuku High School, I take a special \npride in these students' accomplishments. I know that it is because of \nschool and parental support, dedication, and commitment that these \nstudents were empowered and encouraged to excel in this arena. I wish \nthese students the best of luck at the We the People national finals \nand applaud their achievement. These students have no doubt made \neveryone in their school, their families, and their friends proud of \nwhat they have achieved. We should all be proud that they are learning \nand advocating the fundamental ideas that identify us as a people and \nbind us together as a nation. Let the students' enthusiasm and active \nparticipation in shaping their understanding of government serve as a \nmodel for all citizens to follow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/05/senate-section/article/S3629-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           HONORING THE LIFE OF TOWN MARSHAL RICHARD M. CLAPP\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and a \ndeep sense of gratitude to honor one of Indiana's finest, Richard Mark \nClapp, the New Richmond Town Marshal who lost his life in the line of \nduty on December 5, 2003.\n  Mark Clapp and his son, Aaron, were responding to a domestic dispute \nin New Richmond. Aaron, a county jail officer, waited in the patrol car \nas his father accompanied the suspect into the home. Once inside the \nhome, Mark Clapp became engaged in a struggle with the suspect and \nsuffered a fatal heart attack. He was 45 years old.\n  As Town Marshal, Mark Clapp devoted his life to selfless service for \nhis community. He served as the New Richmond Town Marshal for 22 years. \nHis desire to help people and defend what is right and just in our \nsociety was apparent to everyone in his passion for serving as Town \nMarshal. Mark never missed an opportunity to learn more about law \nenforcement and how to better protect his community.\n  Born on April 7, 1958, in Greencastle, Mark Clapp graduated from Mt. \nComfort High School and attended Vincennes University. On November 18, \n1978, he married Debbie Zentko. Mark and Debbie enjoyed 25 years of \nmarriage and were the proud parents of their only child. Mark is \nsurvived by his mother Patricia; his father, Joseph; his wife, Debbie; \nhis son, Aaron; and his two brothers.\n  Mark Clapp was a dedicated family man and public servant. He touched \nmany lives over the course of his career and will be remembered as a \nloving husband, father, and community leader.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Richard Mark Clapp in the \nofficial record of the United States Senate for his service to the \nState of Indiana and the community of New Richmond. His commitment to \nprotecting and serving the public will not soon be forgotten. As Mark \nis laid to rest, let us never forget the courage and sacrifice he laid \ndown on December 5, 2003.\n  When I think about the daily sacrifices and risks that our law \nenforcement officers take each day, and the unfortunate pain that comes \nwith the loss of our heroes, I hope families like Mark's can find \ncomfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow \nup death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all \nfaces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God \nbless the United States of America.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/05/senate-section/article/S3630-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3630]]\n       CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA-DULUTH BULLDOGS\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize and \ncongratulate head coach Scott Sandelin and the University of Minnesota-\nDuluth Men's ice hockey team for their appearance in the NCAA Frozen \nFour. The Bulldogs will be making their third NCAA Frozen Four \nappearance, having appeared in 1984 and 1985.\n  Since the Bulldogs will be leaving Minnesota early Tuesday morning, I \ntake note of their remarkable accomplishments prior to their departure.\n  In convincing fashion, the Bulldogs defeated Michigan State 5 to 0 \nand the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities 3 to 1 to earn their first \nFrozen Four bid since 1985. Against archrival Minnesota-Twin Cities, \nthe Bulldogs stuck to a solid game plan, scored timely goals, and \nreceived phenomenal goaltending from Isaac Reichmuth, who also should \nbe recognized for his stellar shut-out of Michigan State.\n  While absent 19 years from the Frozen Four, the Bulldogs appearance \nin this year's Frozen Four is no surprise. After finishing the season \n28-12-4, and placing second in the Western Collegiate Hockey \nAssociation, the Bulldogs earned the 2nd seed in the Midwest Regional \nof the NCAA tournament. They are led by Coach Scott Sandelin, who was \njust today announced as a finalist for the Spencer Penrose Award, the \naward for NCAA Division 1 coach of the year. Coach Sandelin has \nachieved tremendous praise in just four years at Minnesota-Duluth and \nis recognized in the hockey community as one of the most promising \nyoung coaches in college hockey.\n  On the ice, the Bulldogs have been led all year by Hobey Baker \nfinalist Junior Lessard, who currently leads the nation in goals and \nscoring. On the blue line, the Bulldogs are led by first team WCHA all-\nconference selection Beau Geisler, and as I mentioned before, Isaac \nRechmuch, himself a second team all conference selection, has been \nunbeatable in the pipes.\n  The Bulldog ice-hockey tradition runs deep. The program has placed \nover 34 of its student-athletes into the National Hockey League over \nthe past 35 years. Thanks to Bulldog legends such as Curt Giles, Pat \nBoutette, Brett Hull, Chris Marinucci, Derek Plante, and Shjon Podein, \nMinnesota-Duluth is one of the premier hockey schools in the nation and \na source of deep pride for Duluth and all of Minnesota.\n  These young men, 15 of whom are native Minnesotans, are continuing \nthis tradition of excellence and deserve the recognition and excitement \nthat is accompanying their trip to the Frozen Four next Thursday in \nBoston. Charter buses of Minnesotans have already been filled to make \nthe long trek to Beantown. Congratulations to the University of \nMinnesota-Duluth Bulldogs for what has been a stellar season and their \nongoing quest for the national championship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/05/senate-section/article/S3630-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII ATHLETES KIM WILLOUGHBY AND MICHAEL KUEBLER\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate two \nUniversity of Hawaii (UH) student athletes, Kim Willoughby and Michael \nKuebler, for their outstanding athletic achievements. Kim is an outside \nhitter for the UH Wahine Rainbow volleyball team and Michael is a guard \nfor the UH Men's basketball team. Both athletes are seniors and have \nhad highly decorated and successful careers while participating in the \nUH athletic program.\n  Fans are quick to recognize Kim's presence on the court as she is \nbest known for her powerful and precise play. During her first season \nwith the Wahine Rainbows, Kim earned the title of Western Athletic \nConference, WAC, cofreshman averaging 3.14 kills and 3.02 digs per \ngame. As a sophomore, Kim earned WAC player of the year, All-West \nregion team, American Volleyball Coaches Association, AVCA, and \nVolleyball Magazine All-American first team honors. That season Kim \nsurpassed conference and school records as she led the Nation with 850 \nkills and 7.20 kills per game. Kim captured the AVCA player of the week \ntitle twice and the WAC player of the week four times that same year. \nIn her junior year, Kim earned the WAC player of the year honor for a \nsecond time. In her last 2 years on the squad, Kim ranked second in the \nNation in kills per game and was again awarded the AVCA All-American \nfirst team titles. In 2003, Kim acquired AVCA's National player of the \nyear as well as was named to the College Sports Television All-American \nteam. Kim set the Wahine Rainbow record with 2,598 career kills, the \nsixth highest in the history of NCAA Division I women's volleyball.\n  As a transfer student from Clackamas Community College in Oregon, \nMichael joined the Rainbow Warriors and started the final 28 games of \nthe 2002-2003 season. Michael's impressive play earned him Academic \nAll-WAC newcomer team and All-Junior and Community College transfer \nteam honors. During his senior season, Michael was voted to the All-WAC \nfirst team and earlier in the year tied the team's record for \nconsecutive games with at least one three pointer. Michael not only led \nthe team in scoring, but he also led the conference with 91 three \npointers. This past March, the Rainbow Warriors concluded their season \nwith a 21-to-12 record and finished one game short of the National \nInvitation Tournament, NIT, ``final four.'' During that last NIT match \nagainst Michigan, Michael scored a team high of 19 points, earned a \ncareer high of 8 assists, and increased his UH single season 3-point \nrecord to 97. I am also impressed with his priorities of balancing an \nathletic career while also building a strong academic foundation. \nMichael's off court accomplishments include holding a 3.67 grade point \naverage as a business marketing major and being the first Rainbow \nWarrior to make the College Sports Information Director's Association \nAcademic All-American first team.\n  The sports fans of Hawaii and I have enjoyed watching Kim Willoughby \nand Michael Kuebler compete and develop as athletes. I thank them both \nfor their contributions to their respective sports and continuing the \ntradition of excellence long withstanding at the University of Hawaii \nat Manoa. As both of them bid the UH campus farewell this season, I \nwish the both of them the best in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/05/senate-section/article/S3630-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3630-S3631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING PATROLMAN BRYAN S. VERKLER\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with great sadness and \ntremendous gratitude to honor the life of a brave law enforcement \nofficer from Mishawaka. Patrolman Bryan Verkler was only 27 years old \nwhen his life was taken from him in an instant. He died during the \npredawn hours of December 13, 2003, in Mishawaka, while responding to a \n``shots fired'' call. After entering a home where an assailant was held \nup, Bryan was hit by the assailant's gunfire. He fought for his life, \nbut the surgeon's efforts were to no avail. Bryan was a respected \npolice officer who protected Hoosiers and served those in need. He \nfought for the values that we all hold close to our hearts.\n  Bryan Verkler was the second officer killed that December morning \nwhile dutifully serving his city. Today, I join Bryan's family, \nfriends, and the entire Michiana community in mourning his death. While \nour memories of Bryan shall certainly live on, so, too, will our \nsorrow.\n  Before joining the Mishawaka Police Department, Bryan served on the \nSt. Joseph County Police Department as a Special Deputy. He graduated \nfrom the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy in 1999. Recognized as a \n``gentle giant,'' he had a generous heart without a mean bone in his \nbody. Bryan loved to laugh and joke and was described as a laid-back \nman who was conscientious and caring. Yet as a police officer, he was \nbold and not afraid to fulfill the duties required by his job.\n  Bryan graduated from John Glenn High School where he was a shot-put \nand discus athlete. After high school he attended Purdue University and \nVincennes University, from which he graduated in 1996. While attending \nVincennes, Bryan earned recognition as an All-American athlete while \ncompeting in track and field.\n  Bryan leaves behind his wife of 7 months, Juli; his father, Randy, \nwho is a Walkerton Police Officer; his mother Carolyn; and his brother \nBrett, who is also a Walkerton Police Officer.\n  While Bryan's life on Earth has been cut short, his bravery and \nstrength of character shall live on as a powerful and consoling force. \nMay Bryan's life also serve as a clear reminder of the\n\n[[Page S3631]]\n\nrisks taken every day by law enforcement officers across the Nation who \nkeep our cities and towns safe.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Bryan S. Verkler in the \nofficial record of the United States Senate for his dedication to \npublic service and for his profound commitment to serve and protect. \nWhen I think about the daily sacrifices and risks that our law \nenforcement officers take each day, and the unfortunate pain that comes \nwith the loss of our heroes, I hope families like Bryan's can find \ncomfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow \nup death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all \nfaces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God \nbless the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/05/senate-section/article/S3631-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ALISA BARTON\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I take the opportunity to \nhonor Mrs. Alisa Barton of Hopkinsville, KY. Salvation Army welfare \ncoordinator, Alisa Barton, was honored nationwide with an Award of \nExcellence in Social Service at the National Social Services Conference \nin Pittsburgh on Tuesday, March 20th.\n   As former military child and wife, Mrs. Barton knows first hand the \nhardship Army families can experience, especially during times of \ndeployment. Mrs. Barton has continuously worked to help alleviate the \nneeds of families remaining at home while their loved ones serve this \ncountry in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n   She developed a program called Homefront War Relief, which has \nreceived national recognition for helping the families of deployed Fort \nCampbell Soldiers. The Homefront War Relief program, partnered with \nWal-Mart, allowed the Salvation Army to assist 743 military families \nresulting in the largest military assistance effort the Salvation Army \nof Hopkinsville has ever done. Throughout 2003, 5,000 military \npersonnel and their families received assistance in the form of comfort \nkits to deployed soldiers, food and clothing, holiday meals, and Bibles \nand inspirational books to troops.\n   Mrs. Barton is dedicated to helping those who come to the Salvation \nArmy in need. She began working with the Salvation Army by ringing \ndonation bells and describes her work as a labor of love spreading the \nChristian faith and helping people. I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring Mrs. Barton. She is a wonderful asset to Kentucky and an \ninspiration to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/05/senate-section/article/S3631-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING THE LIFE OF CAPTAIN JAMES E.

Baugh \nof Greencastle, who lost his life in the line of duty on January 2, \n2004.\n  Living a life of selfless public service, Captain Baugh held \npositions in both emergency medical services and law enforcement \nthroughout his distinguished career. A veteran who served our country \nin Vietnam in the U.S. Air Force from 1963 to 1966, Captain Baugh went \non to serve on the Greencastle Police Department before becoming a \ndeputy with the Putnam County Sheriff's Department in 1971. He had \npreviously served as Chief Deputy before becoming Putman County Sheriff \nin 1975. Captain Baugh held the honor of being the longest serving \ndeputy, devoting 32 years of service to the department.\n  Captain Baugh's dedication to law enforcement and commitment to \nPutnam County was exemplified by his lifelong efforts to improve his \nmarksmanship and educate fellow officers through his work at the \nIndiana Law Enforcement Academy. He was also an avid photographer, \nsportsman, gunsmith, and youth leader.\n  Captain James Baugh was a dedicated member of the Greencastle \nChristian Church. He is survived by his wife, Lauralee Perry Baugh; \nsons, Jason E. and Jerrod E. Baugh; daughter-in-law, Tara Baugh; \nsisters Eileen Bryant, Helen Hansel Poynter, Barbara Shepard and \nMildred Buttram; and a granddaughter, Gayle Evelyn Baugh.\n  The citizens of Putnam County and the State of Indiana were well-\nserved by Captain Baugh's life of noble service.

A bill to establish a coordinated national ocean exploration \nprogram within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce today the National \nOcean Exploration Program Act to expand exploration and knowledge of \nour Nation's oceans. This bill is cosponsored by Senators Hollings and \nInouye.\n  The National Ocean Exploration Program Act will create better \ncoordination of ocean exploration and research between the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Science \nFoundation, and other appropriate Federal agencies.\n  The purposes of the program are to expand ocean exploration to \ndiscover new marine substances that potentially have therapeutic \nbenefits; to study unique marine ecosystems, organisms, and the geology \nof the world's oceans; and to maximize ocean research effectiveness by \nintegrating multiple scientific disciplines in the ocean science \ncommunity.\n  There will be a focus on remote ocean research and exploration, in \nparticular, deep marine regions, specifically, hydrothermal vents \ncommunities and seamounts. More research on these areas, where \norganisms exist in highly toxic environments, may bring significant \nscientific and medical breakthroughs.\n\n[[Page S3633]]\n\n  Decades ago I helped Oscar Dyson, a great Alaska fisherman, secure a \nsmall grant to explore the North Pacific. With that grant, he \ndiscovered a significant number of species of marine life we now \nconsider to be central to the North Pacific. It is my hope the National \nOcean Exploration Program Act will provide this type of exploration and \ndiscovery to our Nation's oceans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/05/senate-section/article/S3633-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n      SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 331--DESIGNATING JUNE 2004 AS ``NATIONAL SAFETY \n                                MONTH''\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n                              S. Res. 331\n\n       Whereas the mission of the National Safety Council is to \n     educate and influence society to adopt safety, health, and \n     environmental policies, practices, and procedures that \n     prevent and mitigate human suffering and economic losses \n     arising from preventable causes;\n       Whereas the National Safety Council works to protect lives \n     and promote health with innovative programs;\n       Whereas the National Safety Council, founded in 1913, is \n     celebrating its 91st anniversary in 2004 as the premier \n     source of safety and health information, education, and \n     training in the United States;\n       Whereas the National Safety Council was congressionally \n     chartered in 1953, and is celebrating its 51st anniversary in \n     2004 as a congressionally chartered organization;\n       Whereas even with advancements in safety that create a \n     safer environment for the people of the United States, such \n     as new legislation and improvements in technology, the \n     unintentional-injury death toll is still unacceptable;\n       Whereas citizens deserve a solution to nationwide safety \n     and health threats;\n       Whereas such a solution requires the cooperation of all \n     levels of government, as well as the general public;\n       Whereas the summer season, traditionally a time of \n     increased unintentional-injury fatalities, is an appropriate \n     time to focus attention on both the problem and the solution; \n     and\n       Whereas the theme of ``National Safety Month'' for 2004 is \n     ``Crash-Free June'', a national initiative intended to reduce \n     motor vehicle crashes, which are the leading cause of injury \n     death in the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 2004 as ``National Safety Month''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe such \n     month with appropriate ceremonies and activities that promote \n     acknowledgment, gratitude, and respect for the advances of \n     the National Safety Council and its mission.\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nthat would designate June 2004 as National Safety Month.\n  National Safety Month is not just a tribute to our Nation's advances \nin health and safety and our never-ending efforts to protect lives. It \nrepresents a standard of excellence in safety to which we as a Nation \nmust continue to aspire. While our Nation has enjoyed great advances in \nsafety, we must continue to work to reduce the number of unintentional \nand preventable injuries and deaths. As summer is traditionally a time \nin which the number of unintentional deaths increases, it is \nappropriate to dedicate a month at the beginning of the season to the \nimprovement of safety and health in our country.\n  During National Safety Month, the National Safety Council will \nprovide tips, articles and information to raise awareness and promote \nsafe driving, home and community safety, general preparedness, and \nworkplace safety. This year, the National Safety Council will focus on \nreducing the number of motor vehicle crashes, which are the leading \ncause of injury death in the United States.\n  I would like to commend the National Safety Council for the \ncontributions that it has made to public safety. I am proud that the \nNational Safety Council is headquartered in my home State of Illinois. \nThe National Safety Council is celebrating its 91st anniversary as an \norganization this year, and its 51st anniversary as a federally \nchartered organization. Congress chartered the National Safety Council \nin 1953 to educate and influence society to adopt safety, health, and \nenvironmental policies, practices, and procedures that prevent and \nmitigate human suffering and economic loss arising from preventable \ncauses. The National Safety Council fulfills its mission through a \nnetwork of approximately 50 local and regional chapters that provide \nsafety and health programs and services to communities across the \nUnited States. The Council currently has 37,500 members.\n  I thank Senator Feinstein for joining me to introduce this resolution \nthat declares June 2004 National Safety Month and recognizes the \nNational Safety Council for its important work. During a time when \nhomeland security is foremost on the minds of Americans, this month \nwill continue to heighten public awareness of the ongoing quest to save \nand protect lives. I urge all of my colleagues join me in supporting \nthis resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/05/senate-section/article/S3633-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3011.

Mr. President, tomorrow, following morning business, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the Pregnancy and Trauma Care \nAccess Protection Act of 2004. There will be no rollcall votes \ntomorrow, but I do encourage all Members who wish to speak on this \nimportant legislation to come to the floor during tomorrow's session.\n  The next rollcall vote will occur on Wednesday at 2:15 p.m. The vote \nwill be on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the \nPregnancy and Trauma Care Access Protection Act.\n  As a reminder, a few moments ago I filed a cloture motion on the \nmotion to recommit the FSC/ETI JOBS bill. If cloture fails on the \nmotion to proceed to the Pregnancy and Trauma Care Access Protection \nAct, the cloture vote relative to the FSC/ETI JOBS bill will occur \nimmediately thereafter. Therefore, Senators should expect the \npossibility of two back-to-back rollcall votes on Wednesday at 2:15 \np.m.\n  In addition, the pension equity conference report is at the desk, \nhaving passed the House at the end of last week. I will be asking the \nDemocratic leader to allow us to schedule a vote on that conference \nreport this week prior to adjourning for the recess.\n  Finally, I add that the indecency legislation will be reported today \nby the Commerce Committee, and we will be looking for an opportunity to \nget that bill finished this week as well.\n  As my colleagues can tell, we have a very busy week, even though it \nis short. We are honoring Passover as we go into the Easter holidays. \nAgain, it is a short week, but we are in session today, tomorrow, and \nthe next day, and we will be voting on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/05/senate-section/article/S3730-4", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I want to take a little bit of time this \nafternoon to talk about the economy. We are all encouraged by the \nessentially positive job growth reported for the month of March. \nHowever, the same report noted that the overall rate of unemployment \nincreased in March. Strange. There are major questions surrounding the \nquality of the jobs that were added. For instance, there was no \nincrease whatsoever in manufacturing jobs. Indeed, for 43 consecutive \nmonths we have either lost manufacturing jobs or have seen zero job \ngrowth.\n  The good news on jobs appears to be largely concentrated in the \nservices sector--jobs that generally don't pay well and many with no \nbenefits. Meanwhile, long-term job losses have consequences.\n  On the 1st of April, 1.1 million jobless Americans lost their \nunemployment benefits. They expired because the President and the \nRepublicans in Congress are adamantly refusing any extension of \nunemployment benefits. In no other comparable period on record have \nthere been so many unemployed people who have exhausted their \nunemployment benefits literally overnight.\n  Think about it. Despite the scarcity of jobs, despite the fact the \nUnited States is currently in the longest period of secular job decline \nin our history, despite the fact that nearly 3 million private sector \njobs have been lost in the last 3 years, despite the fact that more \nthan 9 million Americans cannot find work, despite the fact that \nhundreds of thousands of discouraged workers have dropped out of the \nlabor market, despite all of these harsh realities, the President and \nhis allies have slammed the door on any extension of unemployment \nbenefits. I guess we can say: So much for compassionate conservatism.\n  In my State of Iowa, more than 8,000 people lost their unemployment \nbenefits in the first 3 months of this year. Nearly 9,000 more Iowans \nwill lose their benefits in the next 3 months if Congress doesn't act. \nThis is a cruel, unnecessary blow to these unfortunate people. It is a \nblow to Iowa's economy, because extending unemployment benefits would \nhave provided more than $100 million in economic stimulus in my State \nalone.\n  When it comes to economic stimulus, this administration is all for \neconomic stimulus when it involves tax breaks for people making more \nthan $200,000 a year, but it is adamantly opposed to economic stimulus \nwhen it involves people who have lost their jobs and have lost their \nunemployment benefits, or when it involves directly creating jobs.\n  What I mean by that is, the President now is threatening to veto the \nhighway bill and, for my State alone, the more modest House highway \nbill would cost 12,000 jobs compared to what we passed in the Senate. \nThe President is threatening even to veto that bill.\n  We are not talking just about statistics; we are talking about real \npeople here, people who are hurting. One of those is Larry O'Brien of \nCedar Falls, IA. He is 60 years old. He lost his job as a machinist \nwhen the Doerfer Engineering plant closed in October. He says he is not \noptimistic about his future when his unemployment runs out in 2 weeks. \nHe already says he is not optimistic at all about getting a job. He has \nbegun taking high blood pressure and stomach medicine every other day \ninstead of daily. When the medicine is gone, he is afraid he won't be \nable to get any more. He is worried he will have to take a low-paying \njob with no benefits just to make ends meet--at age 60.\n  Larry O'Brien and millions like him are hurting. They are in real \ndistress.\n\n[[Page S3731]]\n\nTheir plight is being ignored in Washington. It is being ignored by the \nvery people whose economic policies are largely responsible for their \nplight.\n  Let's be clear. Despite the uptick in jobs reported last Friday, \nAmerica has been stuck in a jobless recovery for several years now. It \nis not an accident. Since the Bush administration took office, nearly 3 \nmillion private sector jobs have been lost, including nearly 1 in every \n6 in manufacturing.\n  This administration presided over the largest job loss of any \nadministration since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Yet Mr. Bush \nand his Republican allies in Congress remain stubbornly committed to \npolicies that are making this problem worse. They continue to pursue a \nwhole range of policies that are retarding job creation, driving down \nwages, and threatening the economic security of the American people.\n  In January, the White House issued its annual economic report--signed \nby the President--explaining why we should be celebrating the \n``offshoring'' of U.S. jobs. The President's top economic adviser \nassured us of the outsourcing of high-end white-collar jobs to Asia is \n``a plus for the economy in the long run.''\n  The President's report praises the virtue of a level playing field \nfor goods and services, arguing that ``when a good or service is \nproduced more cheaply abroad, it makes more sense to import it than to \nmake or provide it domestically.'' But do we really want American \nworkers competing on a ``level playing field,'' head to head with \nfactory workers in China making 20 cents an hour or software engineers \nin India making $10,000 a year? Would this not precipitate a race to \nthe bottom with nations competing to slash salaries and benefits in \norder to ``win jobs''?\n  We are a free market economy. Corporations have the right to move \njobs overseas. However, it is wrong for the White House to be a \ncheerleader for this unfortunate trend, and it is wrong for our Tax \nCode to reward companies that outsource jobs. That is why Senator \nWyden, Senator Durbin, and I are sponsoring an amendment to eliminate \nthese tax subsidies.\n  Our amendment, which would go on the so-called FSC bill, would \neliminate the ability of companies to deduct, depreciate, or amortize \ncosts involved in shifting jobs overseas. This would include such costs \nas training of replacement workers, transporting property overseas, the \nsale of property in the United States that is closed, administrative \ncosts, and acquiring facilities overseas.\n  Our amendment would also eliminate the ability of companies to not \npay taxes on the profits from outsourced activity by keeping those \nfunds overseas that were generated by outsourced workers.\n  As I said, the Harkin-Wyden-Durbin amendment would not prohibit \ncompanies from outsourcing jobs--I do not think constitutionally we \ncould do that--but it would stop encouraging and rewarding them under \nthe Tax Code. This is the least we owe to America's workers.\n  Outsourcing is not the only thing hurting job creation and \nsuppressing wages. The Department of Labor is forging ahead with its \nradical rewrite of the rules governing who is eligible for time-and-a-\nhalf overtime pay. Up to 8 million American workers could be stripped \nof their right to overtime pay. American workers fear, rightfully so, \nthat under these new rules they would be obliged to work 45, 50, 55, 60 \nhours a week with zero additional compensation.\n  Moreover, these proposed new overtime rules are all but guaranteed to \nhurt job creation. It is just basic logic. If employers can more easily \ndeny overtime pay, they will push current employees to work longer \nhours without compensation. With 9 million Americans currently out of \nwork, why give employers yet another disincentive to hire new workers?\n  So let me review. This administration sees the outsourcing of jobs as \na plus. It is determined to eliminate the right to overtime pay for \nmillions of American workers. It refuses to extend unemployment \nbenefits for the long-term unemployed. There is one more thing. We saw \nlast week on the Senate floor that the President and his allies remain \nadamantly opposed to any increase in the minimum wage which has been \nfrozen at $5.15 for years. This is not a living wage. It is a poverty \nwage.\n  A minimum wage employee working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, \nearns $10,700 a year. That is $5,000 below the poverty line for a \nfamily of three.\n\n  It has been 7 years since we last voted to raise the minimum wage. We \nhave raised our salaries three or four times since then. So it is time \nwe raised it to a minimum of $7 an hour. Yet, once again, my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle are refusing to allow a vote on a key issue \nrelated to jobs. We debated the Boxer amendment to the Temporary \nAssistance to Needy Families bill, regarding minimum wage, but as with \nmy overtime amendment and as with the amendment to extend unemployment \nbenefits, we were denied the opportunity to have an up-or-down vote.\n  In fact, the Republicans on the other side would rather sacrifice the \nunderlying bills, the FSC and TANF bills, rather than allow a vote on \nthese issues so crucial to working Americans.\n  It seems the administration has one approach: tax cuts, mainly for \nthose who are wealthy. But something is missing. Most working Americans \nare not participating in this so-called recovery. The rich are getting \nricher. Tax cuts are working for the privileged few, but more and more \nAmericans live in fear of losing their jobs, their health benefits, and \ntheir retirement benefits.\n  The truth is, we cannot build a sustainable recovery by exporting \njobs, driving down wages, and making Americans work longer hours \nwithout compensation. Moreover, such a recovery is not desirable. A \ntrue recovery must include all Americans, and it can only be built on a \nfoundation of good jobs with good wages in America, not overseas. It \nmust be built on a minimum wage that is a living wage, not a poverty \nwage. It must be built on a foundation that preserves our time-honored \nright: time and a half pay for overtime over 40 hours a week.\n  So it is time for the Senate to get to work on the people's business. \nAs my friends on the other side of the aisle like to say, the majority \nleader determines what bills will come before the Senate, but according \nto the rules of the Senate and according to our longstanding tradition, \nit is Senators who decide what amendments are to be proposed to those \nbills. It is Senators, in open, free, and fair votes, who decide how \nthose bills are shaped on the Senate floor.\n  All I can say is, Senators on this side of the aisle have proposed \namendments in good faith that we believe are necessary for job creation \nand economic growth in America. On all three--the minimum wage, \nextending unemployment benefits, and the overtime issue--the Republican \nleadership on that side refuses to allow a straight up-or-down vote. \nThis is not just unfair to us on this side, this is unfair to America.\n  My friends on the other side seem desperate to change the subject. \nInstead of talking about jobs, they want to talk about guns, abortion, \nor gay marriage, whatever social wedge issue seems handy at the time. \nIn fact, they are so eager to change the subject, they are so eager to \nprevent votes on overtime, minimum wage, and extending unemployment \nbenefits, that it seems they are willing to sacrifice or at least \nsubstantially delay the underlying bills.\n  We need to get to work in the Senate. Our economy remains fragile and \nhesitant. We have millions of Larry O'Briens in this country who are \ndesperate, who need help, who want to go back to work. We need to \naddress outsourcing. We need to boost the minimum wage. We need to \nextend unemployment benefits and we need to assure working Americans \nthat they are not going to lose their right to time-and-a-half overtime \npay.\n  Strong, timely acts on these issues will give a much needed boost to \nthe economy, and it will ensure that Friday's generally positive \neconomic report was not just another one-time fluke.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there is no question that the \nterrorists are at war with us. Unfortunately, it is becoming apparent \nthat in Washington we are also at war with each other.\n\n[[Page S3732]]\n\n  Today, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, delivered \nan incendiary speech in Washington that deserves a strong rebuttal. We \nshould all remember that last September Senator Kennedy made news and \nraised eyebrows with an astonishing claim that the war in Iraq was \n``made up in Texas'' and that ``the whole thing was a fraud'' because \nit was going ``to be good politically'' for the President.\n  Of course, that suggestion was so absurd that the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts was roundly criticized for the recklessness of the \ncharge, as well he should have been. Today the Senator has mounted \nanother vicious attack on the President by leveling claims so \noutrageous, so completely outrageous I am not going to repeat them here \non the Senate floor, although they are being carried on television \nacross the world, presumably even in Baghdad where those who are \nfighting Americans in the street can view them.\n  I would simply say this to the Senator from Massachusetts, that the \nonly one responsible for the attack on America is al-Qaida. Further, I \nwould say we need to focus on routing out global terrorism by fighting \nthe terrorists and not each other. It is this Senator's opinion America \nwould be much better served if the Senator from Massachusetts would \nremember who the enemy is. The enemy is terrorism and the enemy is al-\nQaida.\n  But the political season is upon us and this will not be the last \nattack on President Bush. But while the debate over the election \nproceeds, I am hopeful the tone set by the Senator from Massachusetts \nwill not become the standard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I just heard the distinguished Senator \nfrom Iowa talk about the American economy. It seems to this Senator \nthat for some it doesn't matter what happens to the American economy; \nit is not good or it is not good enough. That seems to me to be playing \npolitics with the reality of the American economy.\n  Job growth in the first quarter of this year averaged more than \n170,000 per month. The Friday number was not an aberration. The \nincrease on Friday was 308,000 jobs for that quarter. That is not an \naberration. It is a continuation of month after month of growth, once \nwe got out of this recession.\n  Fiscal and monetary policy still matter. The tax cuts President Bush \npushed through Congress and the steadiness of the Federal Reserve Board \nhave been able to bring this economy to a true test. Truly, we have \nbeen involved in a war, a recession, and come out of it with the \nAmerican economy growing rapidly. With productivity gains continuing, \nwith corporate earnings improving, job growth should continue to \naccelerate.\n  Every time you have a set of good things happen to America, which we \nhave all been waiting to share with each other as Americans, it is \ninstantly politicized and spoken of by some as if the good things \ndidn't happen. It is like changing the subject because you don't like \nthe subject even if it is true, so you turn to the other subject and \nyou talk about something else.\n  I assume there will be a vote on those issues raised by the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa before this year is out. But I don't \nbelieve they have anything to do with whether America's economy grows, \nhow much it grows, or whether we have productivity increases. You know \nhistorically when you had productivity increases, it meant there was \nmore to be distributed. Generally it meant more people could be paid \nmore, that corporations could make more profit so they could grow and \nprosper. We have been having incredible productivity growth, the \nhighest and most sustained in our Nation's history, and we all knew \nsooner rather than later that would begin to respond in jobs. Everyone \nwho looked at the economy kept saying it is a matter of when. That \n``when'' happened in this last quarter. The ``how'' is very simple--a \nwell-managed set of policies by the Federal Government, especially \ndirected at small business.\n  If you look at the tax cuts, America's small businesses, millions of \nthem, were in the front lines receiving assistance so they could grow \nand invest and hire. I bet if we could look at these new jobs, we would \nfind it is the small businesses that were helped by the tax cuts that \nare finally getting around to hiring people.\n  Instead of realizing this is good for everyone, watch; today they on \nthe other side tried to find excuses as to why this is not good. I \nthink the facts are going to prevail. We have all been saying let the \neconomy recover, let jobs come back, and that is happening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/05/senate-section/article/S3732-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3732-S3733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE ENERGY BILL\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to change the subject for a \nminute. Today the United States-Canada Power System Outage Task Force \nreleased their final report on the causes of the August 14, 2003 \nblackouts and the ways to reduce the possibility of future blackouts. \nThe Chair remembers, it was not too long ago when they had this \nnortheastern blackout. The August 14 blackout was the worst blackout in \nNorth American history. It affected Ontario, Quebec, the States of \nMichigan, Ohio, New York, northern New Jersey, and parts of \nMassachusetts and Connecticut. Approximately 62,000 megawatts of \ncustomer load was lost, leaving close to 50 million people without \npower. Economic losses related to the blackout are estimated to range \nbetween $4 and $10 billion.\n  The principal recommendation of the task force is that Congress enact \nmandatory reliability rules like those included in S. 2095. Guess what \nthat is. That is the Energy bill. Everyone speaks as if it has \nprovisions in it that they like to tell the public about. The truth of \nthe matter is that bill is loaded with important provisions, matters of \npolicy for America's future, and one is it provides us, if and when it \nis signed, with a mandatory system to regulate the customer load and \nthe kinds of things that would prevent us from having another blackout.\n  Its principal recommendation was mandatory reliability rules, such as \nthe ones included in the Energy bill. Mandatory reliability rules are \nnot the only requirement necessary to prevent blackouts. These \nstandards by which our transmission grid should operate are the rules \nof the road, if you will, but we also need to upgrade our transmission \nsystem. The road itself, not just the rules of the road, needs to be \nimproved. To avoid future blackouts and provide our industry and \nconsumers with the reliable electricity they need, we need to invest in \ncritical transmission infrastructure; provide limited Federal siting \nauthority of transmission lines to ensure the transmission of national \ninterest lines, and avoid the most significant areas where we had \ngridlock; streamline the permitting of siting for transmission lines to \nassure adequate transmission, develop advanced transmission technology \nand open access to the grid through regional transmission \norganizations. We need all these parts of the Energy bill.\n  In addition, we need similarly important provisions relating to our \ngrowing dependence on natural gas: relicensing of hydroelectric plants, \nbuilding a new generation of clean coal-powered plants, ethanol, the \nAlaska natural gas pipeline and conservation, and obviously we need \nsome kind of tax incentive to start up again the nuclear powerplant \nbusiness in America.\n  The electricity reliability crisis was easy to see. Millions of \npeople lost power. We are facing a similarly troubling time. It is more \ndifficult to see the crisis because of our growing dependence upon \nimported oil and gas. By 2005, we will import 70 percent of our oil and \n30 percent of our natural gas.\n  As economies grow around the world, where current demand is growing \nat extraordinary rates, we will become less influential in setting \nworld prices and guaranteeing supply. We are literally slowly but \nsurely allowing our economy to fall under the control of oil and \nnatural gas exporting countries. We are worried about it now because of \ngas prices.\n  If we don't pass this Energy bill, we will worry about it more each \nyear, and we will become more dependent on more kinds of products and \nbe less capable of handling our own business in our own way.\n  From what I can see with the Chinese and the Indians out in the \nmarket, who want to buy up all the oil they can\n\n[[Page S3733]]\n\nfind, we had better come to our senses and pass an energy bill that \nwill do many things, the least of which will produce much more natural \ngas for America than we are producing today and maximize crude oil \nproduction over which we have control.\n  To this point, I have insisted, because aspects of such a broad \npolicy are so complicated and need to be considered together, that we \nmove on one comprehensive bill. However, last week I proposed to the \nRepublican leader and to others--and he has agreed--to attach the \nenergy tax bill provisions to the pending foreign sales corporation tax \nbill.\n  We need to get the energy package done. It renews the urgently needed \nwind production tax credit. This package for the first time also \nextends those credits to solar and geothermal. The tax package includes \nincentives for a natural gas pipeline. Without the incentives, there \nwill be no pipeline. It includes tax incentives for clean coal. Coal is \nour most abundant energy source. If we can make it burn cleaner, we \nwill have enough coal to keep the lights on halfway into the 31st \ncentury.\n  Once we get this package through, I will work with those who want to \nwork with me on S. 2095. We will make sure we get it through.\n  We have enough popular provisions in the authorizing package to power \nit through the Senate. We have ethanol, electricity reliability and \nloan guarantees relating to the pipeline, just to name a few.\n  In addition, the balance of the bill scores our minus $1.2 billion \nwhich actually results in increased revenue to the Treasury over 10 \nyears.\n  In conclusion, I strongly support the effort that our leader has made \ntoday. I think it will add considerable support to the foreign sales \ncorporation bill, because the tax bill, in addition to the items I have \njust told you, provides tax incentives for people to buy alternative \npowered cars. It provides tax credits for consumers to buy energy \nefficient appliances and houses; technology to reduce energy \nconsumption; new incentives to provide oil and gas from marginal--that \nis small--wells; expands the research and development tax credit for \nenergy-related research universities; and involves tax provisions \nnecessary to ensure that increased use of ethanol does not reduce the \nfunds available to the Highway Trust Fund.\n  When you add it up, we have now before the Senate an excellent tax \npackage. Each one helps the other, and both together assure their \npassage.\n  Then we have what is left: the authorizing parts of this bill. I have \nenumerated a few of them. I am certain that will become very much \nwanted once we get the tax package beyond us. Then we will proceed \nbecause the Senate will find that to delay the residual package any \nlonger is sheer folly.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/05/senate-section/article/S3733-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
