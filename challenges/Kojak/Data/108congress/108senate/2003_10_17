Following the early sequence of votes, the chairman \nwill be working on either clearing or scheduling for votes the other \npending amendments.\n  In addition, under the order there are a few other amendments that \nmay yet be offered. I ask those Senators who still intend to offer \namendments to share those amendments with both sides so they can be \nreviewed. This will be helpful and allow us to schedule any necessary \ndebate and votes in a timely way today.\n  The Senate will finish the bill today. We will remain in session \nuntil it is complete. A busy session is expected, and I ask for \nMembers' patience as we approach the final hours of this bill. I remind \nmy colleagues they should remain close to the Chamber throughout \ntoday's session to allow us to finish at the earliest hour.\n  During this morning's series of votes, all votes after the first will \nbe 10 minutes in length. We will be closing these votes quickly, and it \nis imperative that Members remain in or around the Senate Chamber to \navoid missing a vote.\n  Having said that, I believe we are ready to begin, and I thank \nMembers for their patience and cooperation during this busy morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/17/senate-section/article/S12769-6", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, there are now 2 \nminutes evenly divided prior to a vote on the Durbin amendment No. \n1837.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. This amendment would require Federal agencies to pay any \ndifference between military pay and civilian compensation for employees \nof the Federal Government who are called to active duty. We have \nconcerns about requiring all Federal agencies to absorb the cost of \nimplementing this program. The Congressional Budget Office estimates \nthe initial cost is $80 million this year.\n  We have not opposed this amendment. I offered to take it to \nconference. The authors have demanded a vote. I will not oppose the \nvote. I intend to work with the two authorization committees that have \njurisdiction over this matter, the Senate Armed Services and \nGovernmental Affairs Committees, to ensure this is the appropriate \npolicy to address the Guard and Reserve retention. I believe it will be \nmodified in conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Of the nearly 1.2 million members of the National Guard \nand Reserve, 120,000, or 10 percent, are Federal employees; 14,000 \nFederal employees are currently mobilized and serving on active duty. \nWe ask with this amendment that the Federal Government treat its \nemployees the way State after State after State has decided to treat \nthem. If they are activated, we will make up the difference in their \nlost pay, the difference between their pay as activated members of the \nmilitary and what they would have earned with the Federal Government.\n  We know we are asking the Guard and Reserve to accept greater and \nlonger responsibilities, with more hardship for their families. I would \nlike to make it clear with a record vote this morning that we want the \nFederal Government to serve as an example for governments across \nAmerica to stand behind the men and women in uniform, to make up their \ndifference in pay, stand by their families, as they risk their lives to \nserve our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to give this a strong, overwhelming vote so the \nconference will stand behind it and this will become the law of the \nland.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Have the yeas and nays been requested?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been requested.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I call to the attention of the Senate there will be a \nnormal time limit on this amendment. All amendments thereafter will be \nlimited to 10 minutes, with 2 minutes equally divided, 1 minute each \nbefore each amendment. I urge Senators to stay in the Chamber so we can \nmove on this bill as rapidly as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSarbanes be added as a cosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1854\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are now 2 \nminutes evenly divided on the Daschle amendment No. 1854.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment will cap future funds for \nreconstruction unless the President certifies that additional funds are \n``equal to or exceeded by'' an amount contributed by members of the \ninternational community. The President may waive the requirement if he \ndeems it in the interest of national security. But part of this money \nis money for reconstruction and development of Iraq. The amendment will \npotentially impact on the momentum for reconstruction which, as we have \nsaid, is critical to bringing our troops home as soon as possible. I \ndon't think you can have it both ways. I don't think you can support \nthe troops for military operations and oppose reconstruction efforts.\n  At the appropriate time I intend to move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the essence of this amendment is really \nvery simple. We have to demonstrate at some point that we are not \nalone, that we have help from the international community. We are going \nto have committed this year $166 billion in help for Iraq. That may be \nunprecedented. I don't know of another time in all of history when we \nhave committed that much money to one country in 1 year. What this \nsimply says is that from here on out, after that $166 billion is \ncommitted, the President needs to go to the international community and \nmake the case and ask for help. That is all it does. It says we have to \nget some additional help from the international community after we have \nexpended the $166 billion. But even if we don't get it, the President \ncan come back and certify that it is still in our national interest for \nus to dedicate more of American resources to this effort.\n  I hope our colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S12771]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have a 10-minute limit and that vote \nwent over again.\n  The next amendment is the Landrieu amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1859\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are now 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote on the Landrieu \namendment No. 1859.\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on October 14, an amendment offered by \nthe Senator from North Dakota was tabled by a vote of 57-39. This is a \nsimilar amendment.\n  This amendment states that no further funds will be committed for \nreconstruction beyond those in the underlying bill; all future \nreconstruction funds must come from revenues from Iraqi oil production.\n  They could not spend any State Department money. They could not spend \nany Defense Department money--no funds except from moneys secured \nthrough oil production.\n  This is another one of those amendments that will slow down the \nmomentum of reconstruction in Iraq and really is another amendment that \npossibly will delay the return of our troops.\n  I intend at the proper time to make a motion to table this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, with all due respect to the chairman, who is doing a \ngood job of leading us through this bill, I say emphatically this \namendment is in line with Security Council Resolution 1483, which was \ndrafted in large measure by this administration when we lifted the \nsanctions on Iraq. Resolution 1483 passed by the Security Council was a \nU.S.-led effort.\n  This resolution says we should use the oil reserves in Iraq for \nIraq's reconstruction. This resolution says we should ask Iraq to be a \npartner, not a begger. This resolution says we should not create a \nwelfare state in Iraq but we should create a strong and vibrant \ndemocracy.\n  Iraq, at conservative estimates, can generate $40 billion a year, and \nit could go up to $100 billion a year.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Landrieu \namendment. The amendment would require the President to direct the \nCoalition Provisional Authority in Iraq to establish, in consultation \nwith the Iraqi Governing Council or a successor entity in Iraq, an Iraq \nReconstruction Finance Authority. The authority would be required to \nobtain financing for the reconstruction of Iraq's infrastructure from \nthree sources: First, issuing securities or other financial \ninstruments; second, international loans; and third, collateralizing \nthis debt with revenue from future sales of Iraqi oil.\n  This amendment does not require a single dollar of Iraqi oil revenue \nto be paid to the United States to reimburse us for the substantial \ncosts we have already paid and will continue to pay to stabilize and \nrebuild Iraq. Instead, it establishes a body in Iraq that would be \ndesigned to use future oil receipts as collateral to fund Iraq's \nreconstruction after the $20 billion in this bill is expended. That is \na critical distinction and it is why I am supporting this amendment.\n  Because of the huge investments that will be required to increase \nIraqi oil output beyond pre-war levels of 2.5 to 3 million barrels per \nday, we should not expect that collateralizing future oil receipts will \nsignificantly impact the huge investments that we will continue to have \nto make even after we pass this bill. Iraqi oil is not the bonanza that \nit was advertised to be by some in the administration prior to the war.\n  I would have preferred to give the President the option to set up the \nIraq Reconstruction Authority rather than requiring him to as the \namendment does, and I would have preferred giving the authority the \noption to collateralize oil rather than requiring it to do so. However, \nI believe that the Senator from Louisiana has written her amendment in \nsuch a way that it meets my fundamental concern that we not be \nperceived as attempting to ``steal'' Iraqi oil.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chaffee). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Senator Levin, Senator Dorgan, and Senator Stabenow \noffer this amendment for the Senate's consideration.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays, and I ask that the Chair instruct the clerks to \ndeliver to the Chair this vote at the end of 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate prior to the vote on Boxer amendment No. 1843.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. This amendment, which we offered to accept, deals with \nreimbursement for the costs of services and food to military personnel \nwhile in the hospital. We offered to accept the amendment, but the \nSenator demands a vote. I have already accepted the amendment so I \nwould renew my request that we pass it by a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The amendment I have offered would continue the good work \nof Congressman Bill Young, Senator Stevens, and Senator Graham. It \nwould reimburse our troops, who are injured and in hospital, for the \nmeals they were charged for. What we have done previously, with the \nhelp of Senator Stevens, is prospectively say they will not be charged \nfor meals, but those who went into Afghanistan and Iraq are getting hit \nwith $200 and $300 bills. Maybe they lost a leg or an eye and when they \ncome out they go back to their job. One was a sheriff who got hit with \na $200 bill. This would completely remove that burden. I would ask that \nthere be a recorded vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays were previously ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1843.

Under the previous order, there are 2 minutes \nequally divided prior to the vote on the Durbin amendment.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is the morning's headline in the \nWashington Post: ``Global Fund Slows Aid.''\n  That is aid going to fight HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. There is \nnot enough money to fight the global epidemic which, like no other, \nthreatens this Nation and every nation on Earth.\n  Don't take my word for it. A quote from Secretary of State Colin \nPowell before the General Assembly just days ago:\n\n       AIDS is more devastating than any terrorist attack, any \n     conflict or any weapon of mass destruction.\n\n  We promised $3 billion in the authorization bill to fight global \nAIDS. We have failed to come up with that money. The President of the \nUnited States promised that he would pledge $15 billion over 5 years to \nfight global AIDS. We have failed to come up with the money. Over 70 \nMembers of the Senate voted, saying we will stand for $3 billion this \nyear even if it breaks the budget. And we failed to come up with the \nmoney. With this amendment, $879 million will move out of the \nreconstruction part of Iraq into the global AIDS fight. The House has \nalready cut $20.6 billion out of this bill. Certainly we can come up \nwith the $800 million needed to keep our word to the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senate has already defeated a similar \namendment by a vote of 71 to 24 on July 17. This amendment would cut \nfunding that will help bring our troops home from the region at the \nearliest possible date.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated October \n16, 2003, to Chairman Stevens from Joseph O'Neill, Deputy Coordinator \nand Chief Medical Officer, Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 16, 2003.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Stevens: It is my understanding that an \n     amendment regarding funding for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and \n     malaria may be offered today to the Fiscal Year 2004 \n     Supplemental Appropriations bill currently under \n     consideration on the Senate floor.\n       I want to reiterate the Administration's strong support for \n     the Fiscal Year 2004 budget request of $2 billion for all \n     international HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria activities, \n     including $200 million for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, \n     Tuberculosis and Malaria, as part of the President's larger \n     commitment to spend $15 billion over the next five years \n     through the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. I also want to \n     highlight that it is by careful design that the President's \n     Fiscal Year 2004 budget request is for $2 billion.\n       The cornerstone of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS \n     Relief is its focused approach to use $9 billion in new \n     funding over the next five years to bring comprehensive and \n     integrated HIV/AIDS prevention, care and large-scale \n     antiretroviral treatment to 14 countries in Africa and the \n     Caribbean. These countries are home to nearly 70 percent of \n     HIV-infected persons in Africa and the Caribbean and 50 \n     percent of the HIV-infected persons in the world. There are \n     considerable challenges inherent in meeting the bold goals \n     the President has set for these 14 countries which must be \n     addressed in the early years of implementation. We believe it \n     is important to ramp up spending on these countries in a \n     focused manner, increasing the amount spent each year to \n     efficiently and effectively create the necessary training, \n     technology, and infrastructure base needed to deliver \n     appropriate long-term medical treatment in a sustainable and \n     accountable way.\n       Similarly, the U.S. Government's support for the Global \n     Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is strong. \n     Currently, the United States is responsible for 40 percent of \n     all contributions made to the Global Fund. We have reached a \n     critical time in the Global Fund's development, and other \n     nations must join the United States in supporting the work of \n     the Global Fund.\n       For the reasons stated above, the Administration strongly \n     opposes any efforts to increase funding beyond the $2 billion \n     requested in the President's Fiscal Year 2004 budget. I \n     appreciate your support on this issue and look forward to the \n     continued strong bipartisan support of the Senate in ensuring \n     the success of this lifesaving initiative.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       Joseph F. O'Neill, MD, MPH,\n       Deputy Coordinator and Chief Medical Officer, Office of the \n     Global AIDS Coordinator.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senate should reject the amendment. I \nmove to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the \nmotion to table amendment No. 1879, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) is necessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 56, nays 43, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 394 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--56\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n\n[[Page S12773]]\n\n\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--43\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Lieberman\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask the Chair to lay before the Senate \nthe Corzine amendment No. 1882.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I could not hear.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on this \nmatter there be 20 minutes under the control of Senator Roberts, 5 \nminutes under the control of Senator Rockefeller, and 5--whatever time \nSenator Corzine requests.\n  Mr. REID. I ask Senator Corzine, how much time do you desire on your \namendment? You spoke last night.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I would presume 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. And 10 minutes for Senator Corzine, and there be a vote \nin relation to that amendment upon the expiration of that time, with no \namendments in order to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Let's have the Chair state the understanding of the time \nlimitation. Can the Chair state the time limitation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eighteen minutes for the Senator from Kansas, \nMr. Roberts--\n  Mr. STEVENS. No. That is 20 minutes, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes for the Senator from Kansas, \nMr. Roberts; 5 minutes for the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. \nRockefeller; and 10 minutes for the Senator from New Jersey.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. With no amendments in order. That is my unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Reserving the right to object, I could not hear.\n  Mr. REID. You have your 10 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is 20 minutes for Senator Roberts, 5 minutes for \nSenator Rockefeller--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And 10 minutes for the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Senator Rockefeller, 5 minutes. Twenty minutes for the \nSenator from Kansas. Ten minutes for the Senator from New Jersey. There \nare five Members sharing the 20 minutes.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I know we will have some Members who want to speak. I \nwonder, could we increase the 10-minute agreement to 15 on my side?\n  Mr. STEVENS. We have no objection. We can change the Corzine \nlimitation to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that following the \ndisposal of that, by vote, we would move to the Byrd-Durbin amendment \nNo. 1819. It is my understanding that Senator Byrd would speak no \nlonger than 20 minutes on that amendment. There would be no other \nlimitation of time. I ask my friend from Alaska if he would approve \nthat.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Reserving the right to object, did you say the Byrd \namendment?\n  Mr. REID. Byrd-Durbin amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Byrd-Durbin, I am sorry. I would like some time on that \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. The only limitation, Mr. President, on my unanimous consent \nrequest would be Senator Byrd speaking no longer than 20 minutes. Of \ncourse, there would be no amendments in order, and there would be a \nvote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The limitation applies only to Senator Byrd; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1882\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise to express my very strong \nopposition to the Corzine amendment, not in terms of intent but in \nterms of substance.\n  Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to a distinguished member of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, a new Member of the Senate who has had a \ngreat deal of experience serving as a valued member of the House \nIntelligence Committee, Senator Chambliss.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this \namendment. The amendment establishes bad policy. Let me tell you why.\n  I had the privilege of serving on the House Intelligence Committee \nfor 2 years. I had the privilege of serving under Chairman Porter Goss \nin the House. I served side by side with now ranking member Jane \nHarman. We did an outstanding job in the House Intelligence Committee \nof conducting oversight work of the intelligence community worldwide.\n  I have had the privilege of serving under the strong leadership of \nChairman Roberts and Vice Chairman Rockefeller in the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, and, once again, they have led a terrific \neffort from an oversight perspective of the intelligence community, \nwhether it is Iraq, whether it is North Korea, whether it is any other \nissue. They have done a great job in a bipartisan way.\n\n  I have to commend all members of the Senate Intelligence Committee. \nWe have asked the tough questions time and time again because that is \nour job. We are charged with the responsibility of conducting this \noversight.\n  Now to send this outside the Intelligence Committees establishes \nsimply bad policy and moves the intelligence community in the wrong \ndirection.\n  I was a member of the Joint Inquiry Committee that was established \nlast year between the House and Senate Intelligence Committees to look \nat 9/11. That Joint Inquiry Committee was unable to function properly \nbecause most of the real hard substantive issues are classified issues. \nNo joint committee can really do their work without having the \navailability of classified information.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee and the House Intelligence \nCommittee have the availability of that classified information at their \nfingertips. That is the way the system is designed to work. That is the \nway it should work. That is the way it is working. It is working \nproperly, and it is working in a very bipartisan way.\n  Whatever the intelligence failures were involved in Iraq will be \ndisclosed. Whatever the wrong things that were done will ultimately be \ndisclosed. But it has to be done within the right framework. And that \nright framework is within the Intelligence Committees of the House and \nthe Senate.\n  Again, I commend the strong, bipartisan leadership of Vice Chairman \nRockefeller and Chairman Roberts.\n\n[[Page S12774]]\n\nThey are leading us in the right way on this issue, and that is the way \nit needs to continue.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi, another valued member of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Lott.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nKansas, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, for yielding me \nthis time.\n  Mr. President, should we just go ahead and eliminate committees in \nCongress? Should we just go ahead and limit the House and the Senate? \nWe have a job to do. Are we going to turn everything over to so-called \nindependent commissions that drag their feet. It takes months to get \npeople appointed. They hire staff. What are we here for? Another \n``independent'' commission?\n  We have one underway right now, headed by former Governor Kean. It is \na very good, bipartisan group of capable men and women looking at the \nevents prior to 9/11 but also looking at the intelligence component of \nwhat happened there. So there is already one independent commission.\n  But I have never liked these commissions. I have been involved in \ncreating some of them. They are always an excuse to shove it off on \nsomebody else. It is as if we are trying to put hands over our eyes and \nsay, ``Oh, no, we can't do it'' or, ``Don't show me. Let's let somebody \nelse do the job.''\n  What do we have the Intelligence Committee for? Formerly I would get \nbriefings related to intelligence information, but I am a new member, \nactively sitting on the Intelligence Committee. I have faith in this \nbipartisan committee. It should be, and for the most part it is, a \nnonpartisan committee.\n  I have faith in Pat Roberts. He is not exactly a pushover on any \nissue, whether it is agriculture, defense, or intelligence. Jay \nRockefeller, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, is very \naggressive on this issue. We are doing our job. We are having hearings, \nlots of hearings. And we are going to get at the truth of the \nintelligence.\n  Do they have what they need? Were they giving us some bad analysis of \nthe intelligence?\n  We are in that process. We are doing our job. Let's let the \nIntelligence Committee do its job. We don't need another independent \ncommission. I trust this committee. The Senate should give us the \nchance to do the job. We should not have another commission out there \nspending money, hovering around and accomplishing very little.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, may I inquire of the Senator from New \nJersey if he would like to respond on his time or what his plans are? I \nhave several speakers. I did not want to dominate the discussion.\n  Mr. CORZINE. If the distinguished Senator from Kansas will recall, I \ngave a presentation last night of about 30 minutes on this subject. I \nwill be happy to respond to different elements. I thought I would hear \nwhat the arguments were and then make a response. If you would like to \nsee it all now, I would be more than happy to do some responding, but I \nwould like to hear the overall argument.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I understand. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the \ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, a valued member \nof the Intelligence Committee, the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished chairman. I say \nwith all due deference to our distinguished colleague from New Jersey \nthat on its face there is a very serious flaw. I am opposed to the \nprinciple of having a commission at this time examine the subject, but \non its face it reads:\n\n       There is established a National Commission on Development \n     and Use of Intelligence Related to Iraq.\n\n  Iraq is but one piece of a matrix of nations in that region of the \nworld. You cannot focus on just the narrow Iraq situation without Iran, \nwithout looking at the other areas of the world which are being \naffected by this spread of terrorism. I say to my good friend, his \nintentions may well have been the best, but personally I think it is \ninappropriate and ill-advised at this time to usurp in many respects \nthe responsibility of the Congress, certainly not in a way in which you \njust look at one small area of intelligence unrelated to the broad \npicture throughout that region.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, Senator Rockefeller, our distinguished \nvice chairman, has been granted 5 minutes. I think from a parliamentary \nstandpoint, however, it is my responsibility to yield to him at this \nparticular time. If that is not correct, I stand to be corrected by the \nPresiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia controls 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask the Senator from West Virginia if he may want to \nmake his remarks at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kansas.\n  I oppose this amendment. I oppose this amendment for a variety of \nreasons. I do not oppose this amendment because of the intent of trying \nto get to the bottom of all of the problems we face in the work we are \ndoing in the Intelligence Committee, on which I serve as vice chair. \nBut I oppose it because it would have the effect of undermining what we \nare doing, further diluting the focus on the issue of WMD prewar \nintelligence, all the rest of it.\n  I do not mean to imply by that that the investigation is moving at \nthe speed with which I would like to see it in the committee. Those \nissues are being addressed between the chairman and myself and members \non each side of the aisle trying to work in a bipartisan fashion. This \nis an investigation which not only has the comparison of prewar \nintelligence to what we more recently discovered or may be discovering, \nbut it also has the whole question of wherever the trail leads, which \nis a phrase the chairman of the committee has used.\n  There are other aspects of this, whether you use the word \ndissemination of intelligence; you collect it; you analyze it, and then \nit gets put over to the policy people. Then they use it in one way or \nanother. The use of that, whether there was any pressure brought to \nbear, all of those things are areas that we are in the process of \nexamining right now. It is a difficult subject.\n  There is already another commission on this subject, the Kean-\nHamilton Commission, but that is covering something of a different \narea. If another commission is set up, another group is set up to look \nat prewar WMD, postwar WMD, intelligence on all of that, it just simply \nduplicates what we are or will shortly be doing.\n  As the chairman knows and as my members know, if we do not reach the \ndepth and breadth of satisfaction of investigation on this, then we \nwill have to come back and reconsider all of this at another time. It \nis my judgment that because of talks and things going on now, dynamics \nwhich are internal and intense, we are making that kind of progress, \nand the threshold of making the kind of progress we have to make to \nreach a final conclusion and do a report is on the move.\n  This would be damaging to us. I don't say that as turf because one is \non this committee for 8 years and then one is off this committee. That \nis a whole other subject for another day. But we need to focus this. We \ndo not need to dilute it. I understand the purpose of the amendment of \nthe Senator from New Jersey. I do not happen to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. May I ask how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas has 12 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from West Virginia has 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining, \nand the Senator from New Jersey has 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If I might inquire of the Senator from New Jersey if he \nis ready to make a comment now or would he prefer to wait?\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I would still like to hear the full \ndevelopment\n\n[[Page S12775]]\n\nof the argument. I understand very clearly the comment that the \ncommittee is in the midst of its work. I appreciate and believe very \nstrongly in the distinguished Senators from Kansas and West Virginia \nabout this process. But to my knowledge, there have not been public \nhearings even on things that can be talked about in public. I am very \nclear in my amendment that the Congress underscores its commitment to \nand support for ongoing congressional views regarding the collection \nand analysis of intelligence related to Iraq.\n  This is not an attempt to usurp. It is trying to bring additional \nattention to a very difficult issue. As I said last night, there has \nbeen since the last time we debated this on the floor a long litany of \nweaknesses, questions about the development and use of intelligence.\n  It is in that vein that I will be speaking, as I did last night. I \nwould like to hear why it is so important only to do it in one vein \nwhen we certainly thought it was important to look at the intelligence \noperations failures.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If the Senator will yield, I would like to make a \nparliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is controlling the \nfloor right now.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. So the Senator is making a speech on my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CORZINE. If the Senator from Kansas will yield a couple of \nminutes to my side back.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I would like to reclaim my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas has 10 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I have two other requests for time: Senator Bond and \nSenator Stevens.\n  Let me simply say, when we first considered the Iraq commission \nproposal during debate on the Defense appropriations bill, the Senate \nvoted it down. I urge my colleagues to oppose it again today.\n  My opposition to this amendment is simple. I disagree with its \nunderlying principle that Congress somehow is incapable of thorough, \nindependent, and nonpartisan analysis of the prewar intelligence on \nIraq. As I address you today, the professional staff, 10 of them, of \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee are diligently conducting the very \nreview this amendment now seeks. Working together, as has been \nindicated by the distinguished vice chairman, Senator Rockefeller and I \nhave broadly framed the mandate for the committee's review. Our efforts \nhave focused on the following: The quantity and quality of U.S. \nintelligence concerning Iraqi WMD programs; Iraq's ties to terrorist \ngroups; the regime's human rights violations; and the effect of Saddam \nHussein on regional stability. Secondly, the objectivity, the \nreasonableness, the independence, and accuracy of the judgments of the \nintelligence community--whether those judgments were properly \ndisseminated to policymakers; and finally, whether inappropriate \npressure regarding politics was brought to bear on intelligence \nanalysts.\n\n  I can report to you that after interviewing many analysts--and I will \nnot get into specifics here--there has been no evidence of that as of \ntoday.\n  Those are the goals of the mission of the current inquiry of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, and they mirror exactly the nine \nfunctions called for in the independent commission as proposed by the \nSenator from New Jersey. This review is well underway; in my opinion, \nit is probably 85 to 90 percent done. It is being conducted in the \nunique nonpartisan atmosphere of the select committee. The work our \nstaff has done is worthy of the Senate's praise. Over 19 volumes of \nprewar intelligence, thousands of pages of text have been carefully \nreviewed.\n  As a matter of fact, I offer an opportunity to the distinguished \nSenator. I will play Bob Barker and say, come on down, come to room \n219, and I will be happy to show you the national intelligence \nestimate, our committee work, and the staff work. I think the Senator \nwould be very impressed with the work of our staff. Additional \ninformation has been sought and provided in a manner of cooperation by \nthe executive branch. Numerous interviews of the intelligence community \nand officials from the administration have also been conducted. Status \nreports have been provided on several occasions to committee members.\n  In addition to these efforts, committee members have been able to \nquestion several in the intelligence community and officials from the \nadministration at a series of closed hearings. The reason it is not \npublic is simple. At the top of every document, and regarding every \nsubject, it says ``top secret code word.'' That doesn't mean we will \nnot have public hearings or a public report. I have promised that and \nso has the vice chairman.\n  I have also invited all Members of this body who are interested in \nprewar Iraq intelligence to seek answers to their questions from the \ncommittee. I renew that invitation to Senator Corzine. Come on down; \ntake a look at our committee's work. Our staff can direct you to the \ninformation that will answer every question set forth in your \namendment. I remind the Senator that ours is not the only review of the \nintelligence community's performance. The able members of the House \nIntelligence Committee have conducted their review. The President's \nForeign Intelligence Advisory Board is examining the topic. The State \nDepartment and the CIA have carefully examined the Niger uranium issue. \nThis list doesn't include the efforts of the 9/11 Commission, the joint \ninquiry of the congressional intelligence committees, and the efforts \nof the other congressional committees. All told, over 40 Members of \nCongress, numerous professional staff, and countless career and \nnonpolitical employees of the executive branch will have looked into \nthis topic. We don't need another 12 members to duplicate that effort.\n  When we set out on this review, I promised to follow the facts \nwherever they might lead. I will do so. I remain committed to that \npromise. We will report our findings and, as necessary, we will \nrecommend any needed improvements. Most important, we will continue our \nefforts to ensure the intelligence community does provide the \npolicymakers with unbiased and actionable intelligence. As we approach \ncompletion of the committee's review, I ask Members not to prejudge our \nthorough, nonpartisan efforts.\n\n  At this time, would the Senator like to take his time?\n  How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I made a few opening remarks last night. \nI want to start by saying we are all looking for the same objective; \nthat is, to get to the bottom of understanding the development and the \nuse of intelligence that was the basis on which we entered into a \nconflict during which we have now lost 335 men, and literally thousands \nhave been injured. There is a reason to understand whether the \ndevelopment and use of that intelligence was appropriately handled.\n  The commission I am suggesting, as I read before, underscores its \ncommitment to the process the distinguished Senator from Kansas \noutlined. It is not to usurp; it is to make sure everyone will have the \nview that it is bipartisan, that it is independent of any kind of \npolitical process. It is to build upon what is going on in the \nintelligence committees, not to usurp it.\n  There is no intention to undermine the credibility of the individuals \nwho are involved in it. I will say that 10 people, as staff, working on \nand reviewing the intelligence that involves 250,000 troops, where \nthere has been untold loss of life, and the arguments that were made \npreceding, do not match the reality of what we are finding afterwards--\nwhether it is in regard to aluminum tubes and centrifuges, yellow cake \nfrom Niger, connections of al-Qaida and Iraq, claims about mobile \nlaboratories, missile technology, and now the Kay report which, at \nleast at this stage--and it is an interim report--has disputes about \nalmost all elements that were used as the basic topic. I think the \npublic has a reason to be concerned.\n  I have other issues when I look at how the 9/11 Commission has \nactually\n\n[[Page S12776]]\n\nbeen able to operate. I don't know whether the same kind of concerns \nare operating with regard to the Intelligence Committee. I know the 9/\n11 Commission chairman, who is a respected New Jersey former Governor, \na person of great esteem, a Republican, is saying there is difficulty \nin getting the information to be able to look at the events that led up \nto 9/11. As a matter of fact, subpoenas have had to be issued to get \nthe records of the FAA. It strikes me when you add the difficulty the \n9/11 Commission has had in getting the information--and we don't know \nwhat has gone on in the Intelligence Committee. You look at the fact \nthat senior administration officials have been willing to out a CIA \nagent, to discredit somebody who actually comes into the public to talk \nabout it. I think the public has a reason to want to have independence \nin making an assessment of whether the intelligence has been used \nproperly and the development and the use of it have been done properly. \nThat is where my interest is.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from Kansas and the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia want to get to the bottom of this just as \nmuch as this Senator does, as much as this body ought to want to; and \nthe people of America ought to have an understanding that we are not \ndeveloping intelligence for purposes of winning political arguments or \nwinning arguments on the floor of the Senate but to form what is the \nproper policy. To me, I think we ought to do everything possible to \nmake sure intelligence is properly developed. That is what I have been \ntrying to suggest. I did it earlier in July and I am doing it again.\n\n  I believe very strongly that this is an important issue. There are a \nwhole series of issues about which there are questions. There are very \nvisible examples of challenges to the facts by people who were either \nclose or near to the effort. I will go ahead and say it. On Wednesday \nnight, there was a follow-through by an individual who was in a senior \nposition in the State Department, and I will quote how he felt the \nintelligence was framed. ``Plenty of blame to go around,'' according to \nMr. Thielmann, who, by the way, was a senior officer in the State \nDepartment, a 25-year veteran in the Office of Strategic Proliferation \nand Military Affairs.\n  He said:\n\n       The main problem is senior administration officials have \n     what I call a ``faith-based approach to intelligence.'' They \n     knew what they wanted the intelligence to show. They were \n     really blind and deaf to any kind of countervailing \n     information the intelligence community would produce. I would \n     assign some blame to the intelligence community and most of \n     the blame to senior administration officials.\n\n  I just believe there are enough questions in the public's mind, and \nthey grow incrementally all the time, that it is time for us to have an \nindependent view of this matter. That in no way is undermining what is \ngoing on in the Intelligence Committee. It builds on it. That is the \npurpose. That is certainly where I come from. That is the argument I \nhave tried to make and I will continue to make.\n  Again, I have great respect for the leadership on the Intelligence \nCommittee. I am sure there is a good-faith willingness to try to get to \nthe bottom of this situation. I think this is very important.\n  We have other questions: North Korea, Iran, and the terrorist \nnetworks that exist across this globe. If we cannot trust our \nintelligence, then we are going to have a hard time making fundamental \ndecisions in this Chamber, and the American people are going to have a \nhard time judging whether we made the right decisions and whether we \nare working in their best interests.\n  I yield to my distinguished colleague from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I will be brief. I \nrise in support of the amendment. The bottom line is, in our post-9/11 \nworld, we have learned that intelligence is more important than ever. \nTo prevent terrorism, in essence, small groups of people who can do \nreal damage to us, depends on intelligence.\n  Maybe things are working fine, but maybe they are not. The amendment \nof my colleague from New Jersey casts no aspersion on the job the \nIntelligence Committee is doing. But it seems to me perfectly logical, \nin our post-9/11 world, to get as many voices with different \nperspectives as possible, especially early on because this war on \nterrorism is going to be with us for decades. It makes eminent sense.\n  I have never served on the Intelligence Committee, and I have no \ndoubt that the 10 staffers on that committee who were mentioned by my \nfriend from Kansas and praised by my friend from West Virginia are \nexcellent, but they have one perspective. They have been involved day \nto day in dealing with intelligence matters, and to have a new outside \ncommission take a look at these specific instances can only benefit the \nAmerican people.\n  Having some experience with this leak of the name of the CIA agent, I \nam utterly amazed at what is going on here and among some--not all, not \na majority but some--in the administration, there is an idea that we \nshould not get at the full truth; an idea that if someone tells you \nsomething you don't like, they are to be disparaged and, in the case of \nMs. Plame, hurt much worse than that.\n  The bottom line is very simple: If we are going to stay a great \npower--and I hope and pray we will--we need the truth. We need to know \nwhat is going right and we need to know what is going wrong. There is \nno greater time than now.\n\n  To say that a 10-staff-member group that has been thoroughly involved \nin intelligence matters cannot add much perspective is totally wrong, \nbut just as much, to say that a new commission of fresh blood with a \nnew look at the matter might come to some different conclusions than \nthat 10-member staff is equally totally wrong and hurts America.\n  This amendment of my colleague from New Jersey is not aimed to be \nnasty; it is not aimed to be political; it is not aimed to be partisan. \nIt is aimed to find different ways to get to the truth because we all \nknow in the wake of 9/11 that our intelligence was not what it should \nbe. It probably was good enough for a preterrorism world, but it is not \ngood enough for a terrorism world.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. It is not, again, \nto disparage what the committee is doing, but to say we should only \nhave one voice at a time when intelligence is so important, to me at \nleast makes no sense, and I hope my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle will support this very much needed amendment.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey controls 4\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the time used by the Senator from New \nJersey in answering the question of the Senator from Kansas was taken \nout of the time of the Senator from Kansas?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas yielded to the Senator \nfrom New Jersey for the purpose of a question.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I want some time. I ask unanimous consent that 4 minutes \nbe added to this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The assistant minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have no problem whatsoever if the majority \ngets 4 minutes, but why not add 4 minutes to this side also?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification of the \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I withdraw the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am delighted to yield 2 minutes to the \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am appalled by the statement of the \nSenator from New York. There is no distress in this country of the \nintelligence system. The distress is all political. We have had a \nproblem. There has been a leak. There have been leaks before. This \nPresident relied on the same intelligence that President Clinton did \nwhen he made the speech in 1998 saying: We are going to invade Iraq.\n  I don't know what is going on here that suddenly this becomes another \nsubject to send more people into harm's way to find out what went on in \nIraq.\n\n  Under amendments already adopted, we have two different inspectors \ngeneral, and we have the GAO going in on\n\n[[Page S12777]]\n\ntwo different amendments, and now we want to send another independent \ncommission into Iraq. What is going to happen when they get there? They \nare going to use all the people in uniform to protect them. Last night, \nfour more people were killed in Iraq.\n  What is going on here? I don't see any reason to bring the campaign \nof 2004 to this Chamber on this bill, but that is what is going on with \nwhat has just been said by the Senator from New York. I take great \noffense at that. We are investigating this matter. There is no question \nwe are investigating it. It is being investigated by the commission, it \nis being investigated by the Department of Justice, and it is being \ninvestigated by the CIA. To get into the political harangue I just \nheard is just absolutely nonsense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I yield 1 minute to my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, as aggravated as my colleague from Alaska \nis with me, I am with him. This is not intended to be political. I \nbelieve that our intelligence needs improvement. I think most \nAmericans--Democrat and Republican--believe that. And if every time we \nsay improve intelligence, look for different ways, people get accused \nof being political, that is the very point I am making.\n  Let's debate this on the merits. Let's not call people names because \nthey happen to disagree that our intelligence is doing a fine job. I \ndon't. It may have been doing a fine job in the cold war for a cold-war \nera, but the whole tectonic plates of foreign policy have changed. \nMaybe it works and maybe it doesn't.\n  I ask my colleague to go on the streets of any city in New York or \nany city in America, mine or his--in New York or Alaska--and ask the \naverage citizen do they think the intelligence is working fine. My \nguess is they will say it needs tuning up. That is all this Senator is \ntrying to do, without being political.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each side has approximately 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thought there was granted--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was no unanimous consent request for \nadditional time. That request was withdrawn.\n  Mr. CORZINE. The unanimous consent request was withdrawn, if I am not \nmistaken, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n2 minutes so I may conclude my remarks and also yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from Missouri for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I ask that be modified to allow 2 additional minutes to the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification? \nWithout objection, 2 additional minutes will be added to each side. The \nSenator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask for an additional 1 minute for the \ndistinguished vice chairman of the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection for an additional minute to \nbe added to the time controlled by the Senator from West Virginia?\n  Mr. CORZINE. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia now controls 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I would like to recognize the distinguished vice \nchairman, the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I tremendously regret the argument \nthat took place between the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from \nNew York, because that is exactly what we do not need around here. I \nthought the Senator from Alaska, as much as I respect him, should not \nbe trying to cast political aspersions, and then I thought the Senator \nfrom New York should not be saying we are not in any sense being \npolitical, we only want the truth, and talking about weapons of mass \ndestruction and the intelligence, because we all agree that the \nintelligence was wanting.\n  We all agree that it is very different from the cold war, but what is \nreally important that has to happen and something which only the \nIntelligence Committee can do, and which has to be in continuity with \nthe work we are doing now, is after we finish investigating what went \nwrong is to figure out what we are going to do to make it go right. \nThat is a whole other chapter. That is getting rid of the stovepipes \nand determining whether we want a director of national intelligence.\n  It is an entirely different relationship now between intelligence and \nwarfighting. Intelligence and warfighting used to be separate. They are \nnow integrated. Intelligence and policy used to be separate. They are \nnow integrated. That is what our committee is doing, but first we need \nto finish the investigation and then we get to that.\n  Our problem is we are doing so much investigating we cannot get to \nthat. It is very frustrating to me. We have not finished doing a lot of \nthe investigating that we need to do.\n  As the chairman has said, we will follow all trails to where they \nlead. There is a lot of work and it is very sensitive. It is not just a \nmatter of creating another commission to start all over again and to do \nwhat will probably be virtually the same work with something called a \nfresh idea. The people on the Intelligence Committee, on both sides, \nare smart. They are invigorated. They are determined. There is \ncontroversy in the committee, which is good. There is no single \napproach to it. There is a lot of discussion going on. That process \nmust continue and that is what the Intelligence Committee was created \nfor. We are becoming a new Intelligence Committee because we are in an \nentirely different world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. CORZINE. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 5 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to my distinguished \ncolleague from Illinois and a member of the Intelligence Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, I salute the chairman and the ranking member for the fine \nwork they do and for the fine staff we have. As the Senator from Kansas \nhas said, we have 10 people who are working hard in this committee. Put \nit in perspective: 10 excellent staffers, responsible for overseeing \nthe intelligence agencies of the Federal Government; 10 excellent \nstaffers who in addition to that are initiating an investigation of the \nintelligence that led up to Iraq. It is totally inadequate. We are \ntotally understaffed. That is why Senator Corzine's amendment is so \nimportant.\n  We have lost 335 American lives. Thousands have been wounded. We have \nput ourselves in a position in Iraq where we will be vulnerable for \nyears to come, and we want to ask the hard questions with the Corzine \ncommission. Was our intelligence right in leading us into this war? It \nis a difficult question and a painful question but it must be asked.\n  When Dr. Kay comes back emptyhanded, after more than 5 months of \ninspections, with hundreds of inspectors, with no evidence of weapons \nof mass destruction, it is a condemnation of one of two things: either \nour intelligence gathering or the use of that intelligence leading to \nthe war. As painful as it is, we have to face that reality.\n  The reality is this: Next to the failure of the United States to \nrecognize the collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of the cold war, \nthis could be the most colossal intelligence failure in our history. \nCan we face that reality? I think we can and we should, because \nintelligence is key to America's security. Intelligence is key to \nwinning the war on terrorism.\n  What Senator Corzine has said is turn this over to an independent, \nnonpartisan group to get the job done. I do\n\n[[Page S12778]]\n\nnot think that is a reflection on the Senate Intelligence Committee. \nThey are doing a fine job, and I am glad to be a part of it, but for \ngoodness' sake, do not be afraid to get to the truth. That is what the \nCorzine commission amendment is all about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I echo the words of my colleagues who \nsupport this amendment. I really do see it as a way of getting it out \nof politics, of taking it away from partisanship.\n  I could not agree more with the argument that something went wrong. \nWe can pretend it did not or we can face up to the fact that it did.\n  This is not just about the past. It is also about the present and the \nfuture. We face continuing threats. Those of us in this Chamber who \nhave that intelligence information given to us know that, and we have \nto be as vigilant and well prepared as we possibly can.\n  I do not ever want to have to face another constituent of mine and \nsay, well, we missed it, we did not get it right.\n  Yes, we do have to go forward with new plans. But how can we build a \nnew intelligence system, with all due respect to the chairman and the \nranking member, both of whom I hold in the highest regard, without \nhaving an honest and independent appraisal of what went wrong?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, the goal of this commission is not about \nblame. This is about trying to find out what went wrong and why we had \nthe kind of development and use of intelligence that is so patently \ninconsistent with the facts that seem to be coming out.\n  Most of us do not sit inside those quiet halls of the Intelligence \nCommittee. The public does not, but they are seeing fact after fact \nrefuted. They see CIA agents outed. They see people who were a part of \nthe intelligence community complaining. One of the ways to restore the \nconfidence in something that is absolutely necessary to be able to \ncarry out the war on terrorism, which we all believe in and want to \nsupport, is to have confidence in our intelligence community. It is not \nto undermine the Intelligence Committee.\n  This amendment underscores a commitment to support the ongoing \ncongressional reviews regarding the collection and analysis of data. It \nis not to undermine it. We all have tremendous faith in the chairman \nand the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, but this is to \nrestore the confidence of the American people, to restore the \nconfidence of all of us who have to use the information to draw the \nconclusions that are necessary as to whether we are going to put men \nand women in harm's way.\n  I could not agree more with the Senator from West Virginia. \nIntelligence and military operations now are absolutely intimately \nlinked. They are one in the same. If it is faith based, then we will \nreach the wrong conclusions. I hope the Senate will support my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas has 5 minutes \nremaining. All other time has expired.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Missouri, a valued member of the intelligence community.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, comments were made by the distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey saying that the intelligence was faith based. \nHe insinuated that intelligence had been changed somehow perhaps by the \nadministration.\n  Let me first point out that this intelligence has been acted upon by \nprevious administrations. I quote from President Clinton, 1998:\n\n       If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our \n     purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat \n     posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program.\n\n  Madeline Albright, Secretary of State, February 18, 1998:\n\n       Iraq is a long way from here, but what happens there \n     matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of \n     a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological \n     weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security \n     threat we face.\n\n  Sandy Berger, National Security Adviser, same day:\n\n       He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he \n     has 10 times since 1983.\n\n  Having said that, I think we all agree we need better intelligence. \nThat is why I made the same commitment that my colleagues, Democrat and \nRepublican, have made to serve on the Intelligence Committee and spend \nthe time, without our personal staff but in intelligence hearings, \ngoing through the testimony and looking at the documents, as is \nrequired of the Intelligence Committee.\n  It is frustrating for some of us on the Intelligence Committee to \nlisten to speeches by people who have not taken the time to read the \nclassified information, and be briefed, as all Senators are entitled \nto, after we have done the work. We listened to speeches that, \nunfortunately, reflected a lack of information about what is going on \nin Intelligence that is available. The insinuation has been made of \nimproper influence. The Intelligence Committee will and has examined \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I renew the invitation to my friend from \nNew Jersey to take a look at our committee's work. Our staff is not \nunderstaffed. I know some people like to have more staff. They have \nbeen working very hard. I can direct you to the information that will \nanswer every single one of the questions set forth in your amendment \nwhich reflects exactly the mission of our inquiry. All told, over 40 \nMembers of Congress, numerous professional staff, and countless career \nnonpolitical employees in the executive branch have looked into this \ntopic which you are suggesting we have another 12 Members do the same \nthing.\n  Washington has been overrun with independent blue ribbon commissions. \nThe intelligence community has been a frequent target of these \nactivities--Aspin, Brown, Hart, Rudman, and the Bremer Commission, the \n9/11 Commission, and the list goes on and on.\n  We have to consider the unseen effects caused by the constant, \nunrelenting reviews of the intelligence community. I do not discount \nthe importance of reexaminations of our past actions. We have had \noversight responsibility. If we don't know the mistakes of the past, we \nare bound to repeat them.\n  But following September 11, we asked intelligence analysts to \naggressively pursue all available leads: Please connect every possible \ndot, even when the connections may seem weak. We cannot continue to \ncastigate these analysts when they make reasoned judgments based on the \navailable information. This second-guessing erodes morale and it \ndiscourages the thoughtful analysis we need. These people have their \nlives on the line.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee. Regretfully, I must oppose this amendment. As a \nmember of the committee, I believe we have set upon a course which is \nthe soundest course in terms of getting at any flaws that may exist \namong the variety of intelligence agencies.\n  I think to establish another commission at this time is to very much \nundercut the oversight commitment and mandate of the Intelligence \nCommittee. I believe it would be a mistake to do so at this time. There \nmay be a time that would come where that might be the case, but I do \nnot believe now is the time. We have set upon a course. The chairman is \ncommitted to public hearings. We will be having those hearings. The \ninvestigations are taking place.\n  Regretfully, I must oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. Under the previous \norder,\n\n[[Page S12779]]\n\nthe question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska moves to table the \namendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. \n1882.

I call regular order with respect to amendment 1819, and I \nsend an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the second-degree \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself, Mr. \n     Durbin, Mr. Biden, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Dorgan, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. \n     Landrieu and Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1884 to amendment No. 1819.\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Con. Res. 95, the \n     concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2004, is \n     transmitted by the President to the Congress;\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, by now it has become evident to even the \nmost die-hard supporter of the President's goals for the reconstruction \nof Iraq that the $20.3 billion request presented to Congress contains \nscores of questionable projects and programs: $95 million for basic \ncosmetics at Iraq's airport; $19 million to build a wireless Internet \nsystem for the Iraq post office; $9 million to outfit Iraq with ZIP \nCodes; $54 million for a computer study for the Iraq Postal Service. \nThe list goes on and on and on.\n  In fact, the budget request for the reconstruction of Iraq is riddled \nwith frivolous, preposterous items. This is not just my conclusion. The \nRepublican-controlled House Appropriations Committee last week found a \ntotal of $1.655 billion in questionable and unnecessary expenditures \nburied deep within the President's $20.3 billion request for Iraq's \nreconstruction. As a result, the Republican-controlled House \nAppropriations Committee reallocated that money to other priorities. I \napplaud the actions of the House Appropriations Committee.\n\n  The amendment I am proposing, and which is cosponsored by Senators \nDurbin, Biden, Leahy, Dorgan, Mikulski, Landrieu, and Feinstein, would \nmirror the cuts made by the House Appropriations Committee and \nreallocate those funds to four areas of far more urgent priority: $600 \nmillion to secure and destroy conventional weapons in Iraq; $386 \nmillion to accelerate reconstruction activities in Afghanistan; $200 \nmillion for disaster relief for Liberia, of which $50 million is \nallocated from funds in the bill; and $519 million to repair critical \nmilitary and Coast Guard facilities in the United States damaged by \nHurricane Isabel.\n  The projects for which the President is seeking $1.655 billion in \nfunding have nothing to do with protecting American troops in Iraq, and \nthey have nothing to do with enhanced security in Iraq.\n  Why does the administration need to spend $2 million on 40 garbage \ntrucks, at $50,000 each? Why does the administration need $20 million \nfor a 4-week business course at $10,000 per student? Why does a country \nrich in oil reserves--the second largest in the world--need $900 \nmillion to import petroleum products?\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, if we purchased \nthose petroleum products at market prices, it would cost $704 million. \nI wonder who is profiting from this sweetheart deal at the U.S. \ntaxpayers' expense. And that is to say nothing about the billions of \ndollars being requested to upgrade the transportation, water, and \nenergy sectors of the Iraq economy to levels not seen in decades.\n  These are not funds to buy body armor for our troops or secure \nmunitions that may be used against them. We are talking about building \ndams in the middle of the desert. There is no need more urgent than the \nneed to protect U.S. troops in Iraq from the vicious guerrilla warfare \nthat has been overshadowing their operations and causing intolerable \ndeaths and injuries.\n  Almost 200 U.S. troops have been killed in Iraq since the President \ndeclared an end to major combat operations last May, more than half as \na result of guerrilla warfare. American soldiers have been the victims \nof assassinations, mortar attacks, rocket-propelled grenades, snipers, \nand road mines. These are all conventional weapons attacks.\n  Earlier, senior American officials estimated that as much as 650,000 \ntons of ammunition remained unguarded at thousands of sites used by the \nIraqi security forces. This week, the New York Times reported that \nmilitary officials now believe there may be as much as 1 million tons \nof leftover weapons and ammunition scattered throughout Iraq.\n  Even more troubling, the Times asserted that two recent suicide \nbombings in Baghdad and virtually every other attack on American \nsoldiers and Iraqis were carried out with weapons looted from Saddam \nHussein's arsenal.\n  GEN John Abizaid, commander of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, \ntold the Senate Appropriations Committee last month:\n\n       [T]here is more ammunition in Iraq than any place I've ever \n     been in my life, and it is all not securable . . . I wish I \n     could tell you that we had it all under control, but we \n     don't.\n\n  Mr. President, we know that scores of conventional weapons sites are \nnot secure. We know these sites are being looted. We know these weapons \ncould be and are being used against our troops. Yet the administration \nis asking us to believe that garbage trucks and parking garages are a \nhigher priority than securing these weapons sites.\n\n  The President's budget request includes only $300 million in a \ncatchall account that lumps munitions security in with critically \nneeded bulletproof vests and the rapid fielding of technological \nadvances. This is the same budget request that includes $697 million \nfor sewage improvements in Iraq, $150 million for the aforementioned \ngarbage trucks and landfill sites, $200 million for an America-Iraqi \nEnterprise Fund, and $110 million for something called Market Oriented \nSpecialized Training.\n  Where on Earth is the administration getting its priorities? The \nDefense Department needs significantly more than an unspecified web of \nan already underfunded account to accelerate the\n\n[[Page S12781]]\n\neffort to shut down Iraq's weapons dumps.\n  This amendment is an attempt to restore a measure of sensibility to \nthis bill. This amendment would delete $600 million from some of the \nmost egregious provisions included in the President's request, and \nwould reallocate those funds for the search and destruction of \nconventional weapons.\n  The amount of money that is being redirected to this crucial mission \nis not a random figure. It is equal to the amount of money the media \nhas reported was requested in this bill for the--so far--futile search \nfor weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and it is the sum U.S. \nauthorities say they could use to expedite the efforts to secure and \ndestroy loose conventional weapons in Iraq.\n  Without additional funding, and a stepped-up program, U.S. officials \nestimate it could take 18 years to disarm Iraq.\n  Mr. President, America's soldiers in Iraq cannot wait that long. We \nhave already spent substantial sums of money in Iraq in an effort to \nfind some scrap of evidence that Saddam Hussein possessed and was \npoised to use weapons of mass destruction.\n  In the first Iraq war supplemental last spring, Congress approved \n$300 million for that purpose. For some reason, the administration has \nclassified the current funding request for the Iraq survey team. It is \nunclear to me why this should be a classified figure. The creation of a \ngroup to locate weapons of mass destruction is not classified. Their \nmission to find weapons of mass destruction is not classified. The \nfunding request included in the first supplemental for Iraq was not \nclassified. It seems the only reason to classify that information now \nis to protect this administration from further embarrassment about how \nmuch it is spending to justify its largely discredited claims.\n  This administration made a momentous effort out of preparing our \ntroops for attack from weapons of mass destruction, and here we are \nlosing a life almost every day to common, generic, conventional weapons \nbeing dug out of piles without even a simple fence. So accelerating the \neffort to secure and destroy conventional weapons in Iraq is a matter \nof the highest priority.\n  Another priority in the war against terror is to speed the \nstabilization and reconstruction of Afghanistan. Contrary to assertions \nby Vice President Cheney that Iraq is the central front on the war on \nterror, Afghanistan, the Taliban, and most especially al-Qaida and \nOsama bin Laden represent the true heart of the war on terror. And \nthese demons are not to be found in Iraq. Their power base is in \nAfghanistan. We cannot afford to forget Afghanistan.\n  The President's budget request includes just $799 million for relief \nand reconstruction in Afghanistan. This is not enough. The situation in \nAfghanistan appears to be deteriorating as the Taliban shows signs of \nreconstituting itself. The House Appropriations Committee allocated an \nadditional $375 million to speed up the reconstruction efforts in \nAfghanistan. The Senate should do no less. So this amendment adds $386 \nmillion for Afghanistan.\n  We need to deal with the damage that Hurricane Isabel inflicted on \nU.S. military installations and Coast Guard facilities in the United \nStates. As sympathetic as I am to the need for garbage trucks and \nvocational training institutes and employment offices in Iraq, I am \neven more concerned about the devastation Hurricane Isabel brought to a \nnumber of our east coast military and Coast Guard facilities. The \noperational facilities and family housing units alike suffered severe \ndamage.\n  Unfortunately, the military cannot tap into homeowners insurance when \na storm sweeps through. The cost of repairing the damage caused by \nHurricane Isabel comes out of operating expenses or it comes at the \nexpense of other needed facility improvements.\n  We have many glaring needs in Iraq and elsewhere that the President's \nbudget request fails to meet. I believe we can be far more effective \nthan the President by redirecting a small portion of the funds \nrequested for dubious programs in Iraq to programs of obvious and \nimmediate priority.\n  I urge my colleagues to endorse the reduction made by the House \nAppropriations Committee and to redirect the $1.655 billion in funding \nto secure and destroy conventional weapons in Iraq, to accelerate the \nrelief and reconstruction activities in Afghanistan, to provide \nemergency relief to Liberia and Sudan, and to help the United States \nmilitary and Coast Guard recover from the devastation of Hurricane \nIsabel.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I \ndon't want to take too much time. The hour grows late and all of my \ncolleagues would like to finish up with this legislation.\n  Everybody knows there are two phases to the Iraqi conflict. One is \nthe military phase, which for all intents and purposes expired, \nfinished, and was completed some months ago. Now we face the most \ndifficult challenge; that is, the rebuilding and reconstruction of this \ncountry which was damaged not only in the conflict--and, by the way, \nsurprisingly little given the brevity of the conflict and the enormous \nsuccess our military enjoyed--but mostly because of the cruel and \ncriminal neglect of the infrastructure and on the people of Iraq \ninflicted by Saddam Hussein.\n  There were several mis-estimations concerning the conflict. But \nperhaps the greatest mis-estimation was our failure to understand the \ndegree of deterioration of the goods, fundamental services, and \ninfrastructure of Iraq.\n  We all know, whether we support or oppose our effort in Iraq, that a \nvital ingredient is the reconstruction. Without the people of Iraq \nbeing provided with the fundamental services they need to conduct a \nnormal life, sooner or later the people of Iraq will turn against us. \nThey will fall prey to the propaganda of our enemies who say the United \nStates invaded, will not help you rebuild your country, and wants to \ntake your oil--one of the unfortunate aspects of the vote last night.\n  I don't know if every single item the administration asked for is \nmost necessary. I had a chance to review most of these projects. More \nimportantly, the Appropriations Committee, in its deliberations and \nhearings, did also. We had hearings in the Armed Services Committee, of \nwhich I am a member. This was a subject raised.\n\n  I note in the amendment of the Senator from West Virginia that no \nfunds could be used to build maximum security prisons, as one example. \nI am sure the Senator from West Virginia knows that one of the most \nterrible aspects of the postcombat phase is the tragic deaths of young \nAmerican soldiers. What if we have no place to put these people we \ncapture who are killing American soldiers? If we agree to the amendment \nof the Senator from West Virginia, no maximum security prisons can be \nbuilt.\n  No communications network: One of the greatest difficulties for the \nIraqi police force--that we are trying to rebuild and actually build--\nis their ability to communicate with one another.\n  These are security projects: Traffic police buildings, fleet, and \nequipment. It seems to me that one of the fundamentals and first \npriorities would be to build a capable police force. That is Ambassador \nBremer's priority. That is an Iraqi ruling council priority. Yet we \ncouldn't spend any money if the amendment of the Senator from West \nVirginia were approved to help traffic police buildings, fleet, and \nequipment.\n  I will not go through every one of these items on which the Senator \nwould like to prohibit us from spending any money. Some of them are \nlegitimate questions. But we have hearings. That is why we have \ncongressional scrutiny. That is why there will be, when this bill is \npassed, a conference with the other body whose changes will be \nconsidered as well.\n  Again, legitimate debate will go on for years and years. Historians \nwill judge, of the 77 Senators who voted in favor of authorizing the \nPresident of the United States to go to Iraq and the 23 who voted \nagainst it, which ones were right. History will make that judgment. But \nthere is no one who believes that once we are there in Iraq that we \ndon't have an obligation, an absolute obligation, to do what we can to \nhelp them rebuild their country, which is a fundamental if we expect \ndemocracy to take root in a place in the world which has never known \nit.\n  I travel a fair amount. I believe it is part of my duties as a member \nof the Armed Services Committee. Frankly, I\n\n[[Page S12782]]\n\nenjoy it because I find it to be the most informative way for me to be \nable to understand our national security, our foreign policy, and many \nother issues.\n  I went to the city of Basra. I wish the Senator from West Virginia \ncould have been with me. Since 1991, Saddam Hussein allowed that city, \nthe second largest city in Iraq, to deteriorate to the point where it \nis a total disaster. It is a giant slum. Stagnant water is sitting \naround everywhere. There is filth, disease, the threat of cholera. I \nnotice that the Senator from West Virginia wants to remove a Basra \nwater pipeline and treatment plant.\n  I say to the Senator from West Virginia, if he doesn't want to travel \nthere, I would be glad to show him pictures of the absolute criticality \nof taking care of the sewage and waste that abound throughout that \ncity, if only from a humanitarian standpoint, to save the children who \nare dying every day there because of the lack of basic sanitation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I, too, have traveled to the region, as \nhas the Senator from Arizona. It was clear to me that there is a direct \ncorrelation between the efforts to repair the infrastructure in Iraq \nand, frankly, lowering what is in the minds of us every day: the danger \nto the individual men and women of the Armed Forces and the coalition \nforces. On every vote I cast in connection with this important measure, \nI have focused and faced that soldier patroling in Iraq and said: Does \nthis help him or her, or not?\n  I wonder how the Senator from Arizona feels about this amendment in \ncorrelation to the infrastructure and the reduction of the risk and \ndanger of those undertaking the military mission.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Virginia who I know made a trip \nto Iraq as well. Again, I am sure Ambassador Bremer will kill me, but I \nurge all of my colleagues. The Chair and I took a trip together. You \ncannot appreciate the degree of devastation to that country inflicted \nby Saddam Hussein--not by the U.S. military--until you see it. Yes, any \nstudent of history knows that democracy cannot take hold where there \nare no fundamental services that allow people to deal with issues other \nthan their own survival. And unless this democracy moves forward, then \nthe forces in opposition grow and the risk to American lives is \nobvious. Parts of Iraq are still up for grabs; we are still trying to \nwin the hearts and minds of the people in the Sunni triangle, and to \nsay we will not help them build their infrastructure, in my view, would \nbe a serious error.\n\n  As the Senator from Virginia said, it could increase the casualties \nand risks to the American men and women fighting there. I am sure that \nthat is not the intent of the Senator from West Virginia. So I hope we \ncan dispense with this amendment rapidly. I do believe that in the \nupcoming weeks and months we will be examining our programs and \nprogress. There are numerous amendments that require auditing by the \nGAO. They require reporting as to how money is expended. There are \nnumerous requirements included in this legislation, both in its \noriginal form and through amendments.\n  The Senator from Delaware and I have added an amendment, that was \naccepted, that requires GAO auditing of this money and how it is spent, \nregular reporting to the Congress. I believe this money will be as \nheavily scrutinized as any appropriation that the Congress has \nallocated in history, and that is justified because this is a huge \namount of money. So I hope we will understand that taking these items \nout of our aid to reconstruct the country of Iraq would be a serious \nmistake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me say at the outset that I am an \noriginal cosponsor of the Byrd amendment. I seldom have disagreements \nwith my friend from Arizona on these issues. But I argue that this is a \nplace where reasonable men and women can differ.\n  At the outset, I wish to be clear that I am going to support final \npassage of this bill. I announced that when the President announced his \ninitiative. I am sorely disappointed that the President failed to tell \nus how we were going to pay for this, other than adding to the debt of \nmy grandchildren, and we are approaching a debt of $600 billion. I \nthink that is a terrible abdication of responsibility. I do believe \nthat, notwithstanding the fact that I am not going to get what I want \nout of this legislation, we have no choice. To paraphrase President \nClinton: We went in; we broke it; we paid for it; we own it; we have to \nfix it.\n  Let's get to the reality. I voted to go in. It was the right vote, \nthe correct vote. I did not count on the incompetence of the \nadministration in handling the aftermath--their failure to anticipate \nwhat many of us on both sides of the aisle, most think tanks, and the \nState Department warned we would have to face. Nonetheless, that \ndoesn't absolve me of the responsibility for trying to make sure it \nworks.\n  What Senator Byrd and I and others are doing here is what is the \nCongress's responsibility: we are overseeing whether the money asked \nfor by a President is being spent in the most appropriate way. That is \nour job. I say to my friend from the State of Virginia, the chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee who asked my friend from Arizona the \nquestion about whether or not this amendment would enhance or diminish \nin the minds of the average soldier over there their security.\n\n  I can tell you, having been the first Senator to go over there, that \nit will enhance them. If you give them a choice of whether they agree \nwith Senator Byrd and me, that we should redirect the money from \ngarbage trucks to securing those stockpiles of weapons, I guarantee \nwhat they will say.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Sure.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I noticed the Senator was talking about how the money \nwould be spent in the amendment. It includes $200 million available for \nrelief in Liberia, and $50 million should be made available for Sudan. \nWhat in Sudan would this money go for, I wonder.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be happy to respond to all of that in my statement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. While you are at it, if I may continue my question, not \nto exceed $50 million to support the Government of Afghanistan. Of \ncourse, not surprisingly, there is specific money for Fort Monroe, VA.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am happy to respond.\n  Mr. McCAIN. My question is, Why is $50 million made available for \nSudan and $50 million to support the Government of Afghanistan, which \nwas not requested by the administration in any way, not scrutinized? \nCongratulations; hello, Sudan; here is $50 million.\n  I ask my colleague, if he is concerned about how some of the money is \nbeing spent, should he not justify how the amendment would like to have \nthat money spent?\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will allow me to continue my statement, I \nwill be delighted to. I was responding to the comment of the Senator \nfrom Virginia, at the outset of my statement, as to what he thought the \naverage soldier on the ground in Iraq would think of this amendment. My \nanswer to that is, I believe because of how the money is redirected to \nbe spent, that portion is redirected to be spent in Iraq, most \nsoldiers--if you walked up to them and told them Senator Byrd and \nSenator Biden had this idea that, instead of paying $35,000 per pickup \ntruck, we should pay $19,000; instead of building the following $499 \nmillion worth of prisons, build $199 million worth of prisons now; \ninstead of going out and spending thirty-some thousand dollars per unit \nof housing--we don't know who is going to live in it and how it is \ngoing to be paid for--would you rather have us do those things or go \nand secure those arms depots that are now not being secured because our \nadministration tells us they don't have the manpower or the money to do \nit?\n  The New York Times article that I have lays out in detail what we all \nknow. It says:\n\n       The compound--part factory, part warehouse, with several \n     reinforced bunkers sprinkled about the grounds--is rubble \n     now, demolished by American bombs. But missiles are \n     everywhere. There is a 30-foot missile with Russian markings, \n     still on its trolley, on a sidewalk. The propellant appears \n     to have been removed, but the nose cone is intact.\n       Two Exocet missiles--clearly labeled as such and stamped \n     ``Aerospatiale''--lie on the\n\n[[Page S12783]]\n\n     ground several hundred yards away. They seem to have been \nrendered largely useless by the bombing, but parts may be of some \nvalue.\n\n  The best-preserved missile, the 15-footer, appeared to be another \nExocet--\n\n  Et cetera, et cetera.\n  All I am saying is I believe it is totally legitimate for us to sit \nhere and do what we do on every appropriations bill--just as the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee does when the Pentagon says we \nwant to build a certain aircraft. You may come along and say we studied \nit, we know as much as you do about it, and we don't think you should \nbuild it.\n  The chairman and I have been here a long time. I have been here 31 \nyears, and he has been here longer than that. I know as much or more \nabout this than Bremer. I have more experience than he does. So I am \nnot going to sit here and, because Bremer--and he is a great guy--says, \nthis is what I think, say, yes, sir, Mr. Bremer, lord high counsel, you \nare right. I am not going to do that. I know as much as he knows.\n  I may be wrong. I used to tell the old joke about the Texan. I don't \nsay ``Texan'' now because people think I am talking about the \nPresident. The old joke used to be: I don't know much about art, but I \nknow what I like. Well, I may be wrong, but I know what I think.\n  I think in terms of priorities--and I am voting for this $87 billion, \nand I voted against raiding Iraqi oil, and I voted against many of the \namendments my Democratic colleagues have put forward. But the idea that \nour reallocating $1.7 billion out of a total of $21 billion is somehow \ngoing to ruin this--hey, if you want to go back and look at the record \nat who is more likely right in predicting what will happen in Iraq--\nBremer, the Defense Department, Cheney, or me--I will take that bet.\n  These guys have an incredibly lousy track record on judging what was \ngoing to take place after Saddam fell.\n  The only point I want to make is, we are not doing anything radical. \nWe are saying: Hey, look, don't pay 30-some thousand bucks a pickup \ntruck. Pay 19 like you do at home. Some of us think, and I am one of \nthem--clearly, no one speaks for the Senator from West Virginia ever, \nso I am not pretending to speak for him. He may not wish to associate \nhimself with the remark I am about to make. But the fact is, I think \nthere is some padding in this request. I think they padded this request \nbecause they don't want to come back to us again.\n  Remember, I said this on the Senate floor, and I hope I am proved to \nbe wrong--this is a dangerous thing to do, to make a prediction before \nall the world on the floor of the Senate--but the prediction I made and \nmany others made, not just me, 9 months ago was this was going to cost \nus billions of more dollars. Guess what. It is costing billions of more \ndollars.\n  I was not, nor was, I suspect, my friend from Arizona, surprised the \nPresident came along with an $87 billion request. Guess what, folks. He \nis going to have to come back again, even with international support. I \nthink part of this was padded. Pad a little bit more of another several \nbillion dollars so we get through the next election and don't have to \ncome back. They are going to have to come back, whether it is a \nDemocratic President or a Republican President.\n  We should level with the American people. This is not done. This is \nnowhere near done, and the $87 billion will not do it. Even if we don't \nput an extra penny in reconstruction from this moment on, it is still \ngoing to cost us 4 billion bucks a month to keep our troops there. So \nthey are going to come back for that. I don't hear anybody, I say to \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee, suggesting we are not \ngoing to have 100,000-plus troops there a year after this.\n  Look, all I am saying is, this is our responsibility. Senator Byrd \nand I and others have looked at this very closely. I had a bill that \nwas slightly different than Senator Byrd's. We have a slight \ndisagreement on what we would cut and wouldn't cut. It is called \ncompromise. I wouldn't have cut as much out of the prisons. I didn't do \nit that way, and I would have put more money in other places.\n  The bottom line is this: There are very serious problems that warrant \nour attention. Yesterday, the World Bank and the United Nations \nreleased their assessment of Iraqi needs. They anticipate the total \ncost of reconstruction through 2007 will be on the order of $56 \nbillion. That is $35 billion above what we are about to vote on.\n  From where is it going to come? Based on what we were told by \nAmbassador Bremer, if all goes well, Iraqi oil will generate--and I \nappreciate his candor--$5 billion to $6 billion a year above and beyond \nthe operating expenses through the year 2005. That still leaves you $20 \nbillion short.\n  I remember talking with the chairman of the Armed Services Committee \nwhen I came back from my trip. He is an incredible gentleman, I must \nsay, and straight as an arrow. He said: Joe, what did you think? Is \nthere enough oil there? I think he will remember this.\n  I said: Our folks over there said, Mr. Chairman, no; oil can't pay \nfor this, can't get it done.\n  Guess what. We all acknowledge oil can't get it done.\n  I have joined Senator Byrd, Senator Durbin and others, not because I \noppose the underlying request, but because I think it needs to be \nimproved--it seems that this request was not adequately vetted by the \nOffice of Management and Budget.\n  In addition to that, as my friend from Virginia remembers, we sat in \na leadership meeting with the three leading Iraqi members of the \ncouncil from Iraq. We asked them: Did anybody vet this with you? He \nwill remember, they said no.\n  We said: You want the $21 billion for reconstruction, but would you \ndo it this way?\n  They said no.\n  Then they said: If you let us do it, we could do it more cheaply. And \nthey said: You are wasting money.\n  That is what they said.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will not yield at this moment. I want to finish.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am not asking the Senator to yield the floor, but the \nother part, in fairness--\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. WARNER. I do add the fact that I was present and I recall being \nsomewhat concerned, I say to my distinguished colleague, but they had \nonly been in office several weeks. The head of the electricity board, a \nmagnificent woman, very well-skilled in technical matters, and the head \nof water and sewage, a gentleman--I was so impressed with them, but \nthey said: We have only been in office 2 or 3 weeks.\n  We ought to add that fact to the Senator's point. I am somewhat \nconcerned when you say Bremer padded. Do you have any evidence on this?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes, if my colleague will let me speak, I will be happy to \nshow you. I have not spoken once on this entire legislation since it \nhas been on the floor. The answer is yes, not padding in the sense they \nthink this is some nefarious scheme, but I can't fathom how you can \njustify spending $34,000 for a pickup truck. We are not talking \nHumvees. We are not talking armored personnel carriers. We are talking \nplain old Ford pickup trucks. Where the heck do you get that? That may \nnot be padding in the sense--and I am not suggesting there is some \nnefarious activity going on here. I am saying it is better for them to \nerr on the side of having this a higher number than a lower number now, \nand the reason is because they know they are going to have to come \nback. They know this is not going to get the job done.\n  As the predecessor to my friend John McCain--and I do consider him a \ngreat friend--his predecessor, Barry Goldwater, with whom I served, \nused to say: In your heart, you know I'm right, John. In your heart, \nyou know I'm right. This is not going to be enough. They are going to \nhave to come back again.\n  I can't understand some of the earmarks in this request. I don't deny \nthe good intentions, but as I said, and I know my colleagues are not \nsaying this, but for me not to have the right to question their \njudgment on what is right for Iraq would be a little like my saying the \nArmed Services Committee has no right to question the judgment of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff when they make a recommendation as to what they \nneed.\n\n  The point I am making here is, we are talking about essentially \nredistributing, reallocating, as we do on every\n\n[[Page S12784]]\n\nsingle bill, $1.655 billion of this money to other purposes. We are not \neven cutting it. We are not eliminating it. We are not building housing \nin Dubuque, which we should, or Wilmington--wherever. We are just \nsaying we don't think a portion of what you are asking for is \nappropriately allocated.\n  Let me tell you what we want to do. Among the items in our amendment, \nwe cut $100 million that is going to be used to build 3,258 housing \nunits. Do they need housing units in Iraq? Yes, they do. Should the \ninternational community go along with that and help rebuild the \nGovernment? Yes, they should. But this seems to be a disproportionately \nlarge sum relative to the small number of units that will be built.\n  It is also unclear for whom these units are being built and whether \nthe residents are going to be paying for housing when it is built. We \njust need some facts. It doesn't mean we are never going to come back \nand help people with housing. While we cut $100 million from, I think, \nthis dubious purpose--dubious in the sense that in terms of \npriorities--we have left intact $130 million for government buildings \nand other construction projects, as well as $240 million for roads and \nbridges.\n  We also cut $200 million from the American Iraqi Enterprise Fund. \nEnterprise funds can be very effective in places where there is no \nprior expertise or entrepreneurship. As we heard repeatedly in the \nForeign Relations Committee from witnesses of this administration for \nthe last year and a half, the Iraqis are very sophisticated folks. They \nneed capital; they don't need enterprise funds. They are good \nbusinessmen.\n  This is not like going into Liberia and trying to get a business \nclass educated. That is what we do with enterprise funds. This is an \nestablished, educated business class. Businessmen are not in short \nsupply in Iraq. The country has a strong business community, even if it \nwas squeezed under Saddam's rule. In fact, we might be able to learn a \nthing or two about Middle Eastern commerce by working with Iraqi \nbusinessmen, not to mention getting more value out of our assistance \nfund.\n  That was one of the things said by the Iraqis who came to see us from \nthe Iraqi Governing Council. They said: Let us get in on these \ncontracts. Let Iraqi businessmen build some of this stuff. We will \nemploy more Iraqis. We will do it more cheaply. We know the business.\n  Again, keep in mind what we are talking about here. Out of $21 \nbillion, we are talking about reallocating $1.655 billion of it. The \nsavings we think should be obtained by these and other cuts we apply to \ncritical programs in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Liberia.\n  Now I hope I can answer some of the questions my friend from Arizona \nraised. First, we have redirected $600 million in savings to the Army \nto accelerate securing and destruction of Iraqi's vast stockpiles of \nconventional weapons.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article entitled ``At Iraqi Depot, \nMissiles Galore And No Guards'' by Mr. Bonner and Mr. Fisher of the New \nYork Times October 17, 2003, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Oct. 17, 2003.]\n\n             At Iraqi Depot, Missiles Galore and No Guards\n\n                   (By Raymond Bonner and Ian Fisher)\n\n       Musayyib, Iraq, Oct. 16.--It weighs more than a thousand \n     pounds, so carting it away could present a few logistic \n     problems for the average looter. But the fact remains that \n     there is a very nice 15-foot-long missile, in mint condition, \n     there for the taking, at one of Saddam Hussein's defense \n     factories a few miles west of here.\n       The missile, along with a dozen ready-to-fire 107-\n     millimeter antitank rounds, just a few feet away, is part of \n     a problem that the American military has only begun to \n     grapple with: as much as one million tons of ammunition is \n     scattered around Iraq, much of it unguarded--like the \n     armaments here--simply because the United States does not \n     have the personnel to keep watch.\n       On Thursday in Baghdad, an American brigadier general, \n     Robert L. Davis, acknowledged the scope of the problem, \n     saying that there are 105 large ammunition dumps as well as \n     scores of smaller sites, not all of them guarded regularly. \n     But General Davis, who is overseeing the cleanup, sought to \n     give assurances that the Pentagon is working as fast as \n     possible.\n       In the past three weeks alone, he said, recently deployed \n     private civilian contractors have destroyed more than 2.5 \n     million pounds of ammunition, whereas American soldiers were \n     able to destroy only a million pounds in the last six months.\n       ``It's a very high priority,'' General Davis told \n     reporters.\n       But on Thursday, not a single soldier or guard was to be \n     seen at this compound in the desert 40 miles south of \n     Baghdad. A few Iraqis wandered about, and vehicles drove on \n     the roads in the compound; one man drove off on his three-\n     wheeled motorcycle with a bounty of long sections of pipe.\n       Evidently, American soldiers were here during the war. \n     Their graffiti attests to that--``Saddam Free Zone,'' ``Go \n     Team USA #1.'' Apparently, they left before thoroughly \n     searching the site, or perhaps they simply lacked the time or \n     expertise to clean it up.\n       The compound--part factory, part warehouse, with several \n     reinforced bunkers sprinkled about the grounds--is rubble \n     now, demolished by American bombs. But missiles are \n     everywhere. There is a 30-foot missile with Russian markings, \n     still on its trolley, on a sidewalk. The propellant appears \n     to have been removed, but the nose cone is intact.\n       Two Exocet missiles--clearly labeled as such and stamped \n     ``AEROSPATIALE''--lie on the ground several hundred yards \n     away. They seem to have been rendered largely useless by the \n     bombing, but parts may be of some value.\n       The best-preserved missile, the 15-footer, appeared to be \n     another Exocet, though because of the container's position \n     against the wall, only the cone could be seen. The writing \n     on the shipping tube, in French and English, was \n     inconclusive.\n       Outside in the rubble was a shoulder-fired SA-7, a Russian-\n     made surface-to-air missile, caked with dirt.\n       It is impossible to know how much has been looted from this \n     factory. In the desert about five miles away is the shell of \n     a truck. Bedouins said the truck had belonged to looters who \n     were captured several weeks ago by Americans.\n       The desert sand around where the truck was found is \n     littered with mounds of mortar and artillery shells. Most of \n     them appeared to have been defused, but a few live, small \n     rockets, as well as several hundred live large caliber \n     rounds, were found among the litter. It is not clear how the \n     munitions got here.\n       The issue of unguarded Iraqi ammunition dumps has taken on \n     greater urgency recently as the pace of bomb attacks against \n     American forces and other targets has increased. Military \n     officials say much of the explosives being used in the \n     attacks come from ammunition sites like this one, which had \n     once belonged to Mr. Hussein's army.\n       As if to underscore the threat, six rockets were fired on \n     Wednesday into the green zone in Baghdad, the heavily guarded \n     cocoon that protects senior American officials, including L. \n     Paul Bremer III, the top civilian administrator. No one was \n     hurt. It was the second such attack.\n       After American troops took over in Iraq, they were \n     confronted with an astonishing number of obvious weapons \n     caches: in schools and mosques, and in houses in \n     neighborhoods where the residents had apparently been moved \n     out before the war.\n       Sometimes those dumps exploded, killing and wounding people \n     and stoking Iraqis' anger against the Americans.\n       Soldiers are finding more dumps every day. General Davis \n     said that in one military zone in northern Iraq, commanders \n     first reported 730 weapons caches. More recently, the number \n     climbed to 1,089, though General Davis said all but 12 had \n     been destroyed.\n       General Davis said the military had not ignored the \n     problem. He said that the Pentagon had hired private \n     contractors, but that they had only been working about three \n     weeks and were still not here in full force.\n       ``I don't think we've been slow to recognize the problem,'' \n     he said. ``You can already see the difference in what we \n     could do in about a six-month period and what they can do in \n     a three-week period at partial mobilization.''\n       While he said the job of guarding the dumps was not under \n     his command, he said many of them were either protected by \n     American soldiers or at least patrolled regularly.\n       But he conceded that some were not. ``I don't know why we \n     could not guard them all,'' General Davis said.\n       Another military official said that 6,000 American soldiers \n     had been assigned to manning the dumps, but that more were \n     needed.\n       General Davis said $285 million had been allocated in the \n     next year to clean up the ammunition, a job that he said \n     would take several years.\n       Right now, there are 160 civilian contractors from four \n     private companies, with another 120 in Kuwait. In total there \n     will be 430 people dedicated to destroying the ammunition \n     when the operation is at full capacity in December, he said.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would ordinarily read it, but I know a lot of my friends \nwant to head home, and I do not want to hold them up very much longer \nin terms of keeping us late today.\n  No one doubts this is a critical issue, dealing with and securing \nthis stockpile of conventional weapons, which our military tells us on \nthe ground is\n\n[[Page S12785]]\n\nnow being used in more sophisticated ways by the old Fedayeen, by the \nthugs, by the old Iraqi Army, by the people attacking us. The need in \nthis area is enormous.\n  Consider these facts: The head of the central command, General \nAbizaid, testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee on \nSeptember 24:\n\n       There is more ammunition in Iraq than anyplace I've ever \n     been in my life.\n\n  Continuing:\n\n       And it is all not securable.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I wish I could tell you that we had it all under control \n     but we don't.\n\n  General Abizaid estimates Saddam Hussein amassed 650,000 tons of \nammunition. That is about a third of the entire United States military \nstockpile. Take all of the amassed ammunition the United States of \nAmerica has stockpiled, with our close to $400 billion military budget, \nand Saddam has amassed about a third that much, and 650,000 tons is \nsitting in Iraq right now.\n  Now, of that 650,000, only 70,000 to 80,000 tons have been secured by \nthe American military. Why? They do not have the manpower. CENTCOM has \nestimated it will take 5 years to destroy those weapons already \nconfiscated.\n  I say to my friends, as important as housing is, that is more \nimportant. General Abizaid, and these are his words, not mine. \nAccording to a front-page story in USA Today of September 30:\n\n       Coalition forces had uncovered 102 large caches of small \n     arms throughout Iraq and hundreds of more smaller caches. A \n     large cache is defined as requiring at least 10 tractor-\n     trailer loads to remove. Of the several hundred arms caches, \n     50 remain unguarded, monitored only by cameras. Easy access \n     to arms and explosives poses the most immediate threat to \n     coalition troops.\n\n  That is what I meant when I said to my friend from Virginia I believe \nhe asked the coalition troops what they are most worried about, if they \nare worried about whether Senator Byrd and I are cutting housing money \nand garbage trucks and adding it to getting these arms caches, or \nwhether they would rather have us build the housing and the garbage \ntrucks.\n  Experts estimate there are enough guns in these stockpiles to arm \neach and every one of Iraq's 25 million people. The same USA article \nsays: An AK-47 with ammo can be bought on the street, as we both know, \nhaving been there, for 10 bucks.\n  People are walking around after going to these caches and saying, I \nhave a little AK-47 with all the ammo, 10 bucks will get it for you.\n  A story last Wednesday in the New York Times:\n\n       U.S. can't locate missiles once held in arsenal of Iraq.\n\n  They related that coalition soldiers--that is basically American \nsoldiers, although there are brave Poles and brave Brits, but we are \nthe bulk of it--have been unable to locate possibly hundreds of \nshoulder-fired missiles, which as all of us who pay a lot of attention \nto what is going on in Iraq know is why the Baghdad Airport is not \nopen.\n\n  We are going to get all this commerce going in Iraq. We have the \nSecretary of Commerce over there saying invest in Iraq; it is a good \ndeal. The airport cannot even be open. Why? Because we cannot account \nfor--and this is not a criticism; it is an observation--shoulder-fired \nmissiles that have gone missing from these stockpiles.\n  In case someone thinks I am exaggerating, the coalition put the word \nout on the street, we will pay 500 bucks to anybody--it is like a gun \nretrieval program in Richmond or Wilmington--who brings in that \nshoulder-held missile and gives it back to us. Three hundred Iraqis \nhave walked up to coalition soldiers with a shoulder-held missile and \nsaid, here is a missile. Where is my 500 bucks?\n  These weapons can fetch as much as $5,000 on the black market. Do I \nneed to explain to anybody on this floor--I clearly do not--how porous \nthe Iraqi border is? Every day the administration is talking about \nIranians crossing the border, about al-Qaida, about terrorists. Here we \nare unable to account for hundreds of shoulder-held missiles that are \nselling for $5,000 on the black market.\n  Again, to make the point, do my colleagues think our soldiers would \nrather have us be able to confiscate those missiles and not let any \nmore get out or spend $30,000 for a pickup truck? Given Iraq's porous \nborders, this is a disaster.\n  Second, our amendment redirects $386 million of the $1.655 billion \nfrom what we believe to be nonemergency spending to Afghanistan in \nareas where every dollar counts. That is less money than I would like \nto see devoted to Afghanistan, but it is nearly a 50 percent increase \nin the funds the President requested.\n  We held a hearing yesterday with the administration in our Foreign \nRelations Committee. They are pointing out to us they do not have the \nmoney, I say to my friend from Arizona, to train up the ANA, the Afghan \nNational Army, because, as we both know, the President announced after \nhe came back from Tokyo the new Marshall plan for Afghanistan--not \nBiden's words, not McCain's words, not Warner's words, but Bush's \nwords. He announced the Marshall plan for Afghanistan, God love him. \nWell, guess what. The Marshall plan is the Marshall without the \ngeneral, because the money is not there.\n  So what is Karzai saying? We have this new plan to train up \nimmediately the ANA, the Afghan National Army. There is not enough \nmoney. So we say we are going to take $386 million of this and give it \nto spend in Afghanistan.\n  Now, why Afghanistan? Look, there are bookends around a little \ncountry called Iran, with 40 million people, which is seeking a nuclear \nweapon. It is now run by an oligarchy made up of ayatollahs who control \nthe military and all the security apparatus. You have a failed state on \nyour east and a failed state on your west. You have an incredibly \nemboldened Iran. Kiss goodbye modernity--the fancy word we like to use \nfor modernizing the Arab world. Kiss goodbye democracy.\n\n  We cannot afford to let Afghanistan fail.\n  So, just as in Iraq--and my friend from Arizona and I agree we need \nmore forces in Iraq, not fewer. I am getting my brains kicked in for \nthat and he is, too, but we are right. We have General Abizaid saying \nwe don't need more forces. Guess what. We can't secure these depots. \nCome on. If you can't secure the depots, why can't you secure them? \nBecause you don't have the forces.\n  Oh, I get it. Then you don't need the forces because you don't think \nthese 650,000 tons of ammunition matter. Is that what you are saying to \nme?\n  Mr. WARNER. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will not yield. I will not yield. I am almost finished, \nand you can have the floor, and I will be happy to discuss it in any \nway.\n  To keep the continuity of the point I am trying to make here, the \nsame thing exists in Afghanistan. They don't have the money to do what \nthis administration says it wants to do. So guess what. We are trying \nto help them. We are trying to help them. So we are reallocating $386 \nmillion of the $1.655 billion, out of $21 billion. We are reallocating \nit where we think--we may be wrong, but we have a right to think it--to \nallocate it where we think it is needed.\n  Where will it go in Afghanistan? Mr. President, $75 million of that \n$366 million will go to the Afghan National Army, which currently pays, \nI might add--do you know how much they pay? Let's everybody remember \nthis. I know we know it, but sometimes there are so many facts it is \neasy to forget.\n  We are trying to get an army in Afghanistan that is made up of \nTajiks, made up of Pashtun, made up of all the ethnic groups. That is \nwhat we are trying to do. You know, that is our objective. But right \nnow the war lords, who historically control them all and have armies \nbigger than the national army, are paying their armies that they have \nmade up--they are paying them a fair amount of money. They are also the \nbiggest opium traders, now, in the world.\n  Do you know what we are paying the Afghan Army, what Karzai gets to \npay them? It is $50 a month--$50 a month. We went back and looked, \nSenator Lugar and I. That is less money than we are paying the guy to \nclean the latrines in the army barracks where we are training them.\n  Look, I am not a businessman, as is often pointed out to me by my \nRepublican friends. But let me tell you, if I am trying to attract from \nthe warlord in Herat, Ismael Kahn, some of his\n\n[[Page S12786]]\n\nfolks to come and join the Afghan National Army, then it seems to me I \nhave to be able to compete in the marketplace for them. Fifty dollars?\n  So what do we do? We follow through. We follow through with what the \nadministration says it needs. We give them the money. We give them, of \nthis money, 75 million more dollars to train up an Afghan National \nArmy.\n  Again, why is that important? The reason that is important is, as \nlong as we do not have an Afghan National Army, we have to have \nAmerican forces there. I don't want American forces to stay there, \nwhich is the administration's rationale. I agree with the rationale, \njust as we are saying in Iraq, train up an indigenous force as quickly \nas you can.\n  What are we trying to do here? What we are trying to do here is meet \nthe objective stated. The objective stated is train up, as fast as you \ncan, an army. So we give them $75 million more. We take $50 million, I \nsay to my friend from Arizona--and there is accountability under the \nexisting legislation--for more police.\n  The one thing everybody says in Afghanistan, which I have also \nvisited, is that we don't have enough police, especially outside of \nKabul. The local Governors and mayors cannot control Kandahar, cannot \ncontrol all the various cities. We already have a program for police. \nWe say: We are going to give you $50 million more for that program.\n  We also increase schools.\n  You say: OK, Biden, now you get the fuzzy stuff, $55 million for \nschools. You just got done saying you don't want housing in Iraq, but \nyou take Iraqi housing money and use it for schools? Simple reason: The \nSaudis and the Wahabi extremists have built 7,000 madrasahs, 7,000 \nhate-spewing institutions in the country of Afghanistan.\n  President Karzai says: Help me.\n  My friend, the Presiding Officer, is a very well educated guy. He \nremembers why so many people in the Middle Ages sent their kids to \nmonasteries. It wasn't because they wanted them all to be priests. It \nwas because they had a roof over their heads, three square meals, and \nclothes on their back. They were ready to trade for that, in their \nview, to have them indoctrinated or otherwise. That is why the people \nare in madrasahs.\n  Karzai said--listen, I spent hours with him, as many of you have--I \nneed more schools. How can I get you to take your kid out of that \nmadrasah unless I have someplace to put him? Guess what; $20,000 will \nhire you a schoolteacher for a year and build you a rudimentary school \nin Afghanistan.\n  Then we take $38 million for public health and $15 million for road \nconstruction.\n  I will not go into any more detail. I apologize for taking this long, \nbut it is the first time I have spoken on this entire matter.\n  We heard testimony in the Foreign Relations Committee about one of \nthe major projects. I ask staff to correct me if I am wrong here, but I \nbelieve a road project from Herat to Kabul, being built by the \ninternational community with U.S. funds, is considered essential but \nthey don't have enough money to finish it. So guess what. We are \nhelping out. We think it is a higher priority to build that road than \nit is to reestablish the swamps now in Iraq.\n  This is all about, as my dad, who just died, used to say:\n\n       Joey, if everything is equally important to you, nothing is \n     important to you.\n\n  You have to prioritize. We are prioritizing based on what Senator \nByrd, who views Iraq very differently than do I, and I know is the best \nbang for the buck in United States interests.\n  It provides $41 million for more support for human rights, free \nelections, and the day-to-day functioning of the Karzai government.\n  Moreover, this amendment provides funds for priorities that are \ncompletely omitted from the Administration's request.\n  It provides $45 million for projects targeted to women and girls.\n  It gives $50 million for drought relief and other urgently-needed \nwater projects. It directs $25 million to help internally-displaced \npeople, most of whom had returned from squalid refugee camps abroad \nonly to find that their homes were scarcely less horrific.\n  Finally, our amendment also adds $200 million for Liberia.\n  The Administration made a glaring oversight by not including a \nrequest for Liberia funding in its request. Our amendment corrects that \ndeficiency.\n  There is a glimmer of hope for a lasting peace in Liberia after \nnearly 14 years of civil war. President Charles Taylor has been forced \nout of the country, and the UN has begun to deploy a 15,000 person \npeacekeeping force.\n  We're not part of that force, but we should be a part of the effort \nto help Liberia recover from over a decade of violence and misrule.\n  Over the course of the war, Liberia's development has taken a quantum \nleap backwards. There is no running water or electricity in the \ncapital.\n  The current generation of school-aged children in Liberia is less \nliterate than the preceding one.\n  Nearly one hundred thousand people have been forced out of their \nhomes and are living in make-shift camps.\n  Sickness and hunger have affected much of the population.\n  The State Department has estimated that $200 million in assistance \nwill be needed from the U.S. to assist Liberia over the next year. Our \namendment provides the State Department with the full amount that it \nsays will be needed.\n  I am about to conclude, believe it or not, folks. The fact is, we are \nnot eliminating this fund. We are not in any way fundamentally altering \nwhat this administration is asking.\n  We are saying that the Congress, based on priorities, sends the wrong \nmessage with $1.5 billion of the $20 billion. That is an oversight \nresponsibility of the Congress, whether it is Iraq, whether it is a \nmissile system, or whether it is a leave-no-child-behind proposal for \neducation.\n  I want to emphasize again that I intend to vote for this supplemental \nbill, notwithstanding the fact--because I have nothing left but a \nHobson's choice here--we are not paying for it the way we should. We \nare just sending it to the deficit column.\n  I believe we have a responsibility to scrutinize the bill before us, \ndecide on priorities, and to cut spending that is not the highest \npriority and direct those funds to efforts which we think have been \nshortchanged. That is precisely what our amendment does. It is \nprecisely what our Republican colleagues on the House Appropriations \nCommittee have done.\n  I will conclude by saying the reason I amended my legislation to \nconform with that of my friend from West Virginia precisely is because \nhe is a smarter parliamentarian and legislator than anybody here. He \nknows the chances of this becoming law are increased in direct \nproportion to the degree to which it matches with the House. What we \nhave done is take the House language, which I would like to modify in \nthe margins--and I expect maybe Senator Byrd would even like to modify \nin the margins. But as an old bad joke goes, it is close enough for \ngovernment work. What will happen is it gets us on the same page and \nwill not slow up, if this passes a conference, reporting out this \nentire bill and the money getting to where it needs to be.\n  I know no one, particularly the four leading Senators on this floor, \nincluding myself--the Senator from Alaska, the Senator from Virginia, \nthe Senator from West Virginia, the Senator in Arizona--I know them. I \nhave watched them for years and years. None of them believes we should \nbe a rubberstamp. I am not about to be a rubberstamp, nor are any of \nthem. This is our honest assessment of what we should do to make this \n$21 billion go further with greater priority, more rapidly, and enhance \nour chances at success in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Remember: The \nPresident's proposal covers both Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to be extremely brief.\n  We spent a long time on this amendment. There are other amendments \npending. I in no way criticize or take exception to the rights of the \nSenator from Delaware, nor the Senator from West Virginia. In fact, I \nwish more would exercise scrutiny in the work of the Appropriations \nCommittee. But I think we ought to know what this amendment is about. \nIt is taking $1.65 billion from the reconstruction of Iraq and putting \nit to work in Fort Monroe, VA, the Sudan, Liberia--places that\n\n[[Page S12787]]\n\nare worthy and deserving, perhaps. The purpose of this legislation is \nto provide money for the military and reconstruction of Iraq plus \nAfghanistan. Tough choices have to be made on other issues.\n  I share the concern of the Senator from Delaware about the situation \nin Afghanistan. But I don't share his open-ended desire to send money \njust to the Sudan, just to Liberia, and another open-ended $75 million \nfor foreign military financing programs.\n  I think we need to stick to what we have. It has already been \nexamined by the Appropriations Committee. It has been examined by all \nMembers. I hope the motion to table will be agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield and enter into a \ncolloquy and questions with the Senator from Delaware and to address my \ngood friend from Arizona.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be very brief.\n  Senator McCain raises an important point about the Sudan. Why are we \nall of a sudden sending money to the Sudan? The answer is that this \namendment does not send funds to Sudan. I know of no one other than \nSenator Howard Metzenbaum who scrutinizes legislation more precisely \nthan my friend from Arizona. The legislation which the committee \nreported out and which we are about to vote on--$21 billion--and which \nwe are debating right now contains an additional $150 million for new \ncomplex emergency funds in addition to the $100 million already in the \nbill. That is what is in the legislation. If this amendment passes \nthere will be an additional $150 million available for complex foreign \nemergencies and these funds shall be available for the Sudan. Notice I \ndidn't say these funds are for the Sudan--they are available to the \nSudan. The reference in the Byrd amendment will allow these funds to go \nto the Sudan.\n  That is what the administration said they are working on: to spend \npart of this complex emergency funding. They have already said as it \ncame out of the committee that they want to spend some of this $100 \nmillion--$250 million if our amendment passes--in the Sudan. We didn't \nmake this up out of whole cloth. We are giving them more money than \nthey are likely to want to spend on the Sudan. It is not like all a \nsudden we picked out Northern Ireland, and, by the way, why don't we \nhelp them, too. That is a generic point.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think the Sudan is important. I don't think it is as \nimportant right now, to be honest with you, as the projects the Senator \nfrom West Virginia cuts out: Iraqi national community network, maximum \nsecurity prisons, traffic police, water pipelines, treatment plants, on \nand on. These are cut out so we can send money to the Sudan.\n  We have taken a long time here. Our colleagues are getting restless \nin their offices all over the Capitol. I don't want to continue this. \nWe have a difference of opinion as to this amendment and to how the \nmoney should be spent. But to take money from Iraq and send it to Fort \nMonroe, VA, which is a worthy cause, is not appropriate for the way \nthis bill was designed.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on that one point, there is a compromise. \nIt is a good one. We essentially reprioritize and stand by those \npriorities.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could direct a question to my \ncolleague, first, I hope in the course of this debate we have not \nimpugned in any way the integrity of Ambassador Bremer.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Just his judgement; I mean that sincerely.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is an important addition the Senator just made \nbecause this is a man who uprooted himself from a difficult situation \nhere at home, volunteered to go over there, and, as the Senator knows, \nthose living conditions are not the best.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. WARNER. The point being, he is on the scene 14 hours a day. He is \nworking.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Agreed. Agreed.\n  Mr. WARNER. When the Senator says he has experience and he \nunderstands things, I defer to that. I have a great deal of experience, \nand he does, too. I admire him. He knows that. But my point is we \ncertainly have to have a degree of confidence in those who render their \nbest judgment on the various items.\n  The Senator raised the question, and I have a document here to refer \nto. If I could just pose a question, the Senator pointed out the \nseriousness of these vast ammunition depots. No matter how great Saddam \nHussein may have been with his military--from the debriefings, they \nhave no explanation why he put in every corner of Iraq these enormous \ncaches of ammunition. The Senator from Delaware brings out the \nnecessity to go in and eradicate those in various ways as quickly as \npossible so they do not fall into the hands of those who are acting \nagainst us.\n  The point I wish to make is, in the document and carefully buried in \nthe $67-plus billion for the Department of Defense is the specific item \nof $300 million for initiatives for battlefield cleanup. It is in \nthere. You don't have to take it out of other portions. That is in \naddition to $24 billion for the Department of the Army which they are \ngoing to expend for those purposes.\n  Has the Senator examined in detail to know that some of the items he \nis asking for, such as the cleanup of the battlefields, is already \nincluded?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have. I have looked in great detail. That \nis not just for ammunition dumps. That is across the board.\n  I also point out the military said there is no explanation for why \nSaddam would have these caches all over the country. I suggest we look \nto history. It is for the same reason Tito had the same kind of caches \nall over the former Yugoslavia. He trusted no one anywhere, and he \nwanted to be certain that if he was ever deposed or moved, he would \nhave access to a cache sufficient to keep him in the game. That is why \nit is done. Read history.\n\n  Lastly, we have looked at that. We do know there is money for \nbattlefield cleanup. This goes well beyond the depots. Assume that the \nSenator is right, that it is sufficient; it is not sufficient to do the \nwhole job.\n  Lastly, in response to my questioning, Paul Bremer is a fine man. I \nhave come back praising him. However, you are entitled to question a \nperson's judgment--I am not questioning his motive--just as the \nSecretary of Defense was entitled to question the judgment of General \nShinseki. He did not say he was not an honorable man. The day a U.S. \nSenator, particularly one with 30 years of experience, can not question \nthe judgment of an ambassador is the day we should close up this shop. \nHe may be right; I think he is wrong. I am just questioning his \njudgment.\n  I do not think these are the priorities. To state it another way, \n$19.5 billion of this we are not even talking about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there is some concern about the \nindividual items pledged. We are going to take care of the problem of \nsome of the allocations that have been listed in the report from Mr. \nBremer's office about how this money should be spent.\n  I ask unanimous consent Senator Bond be added as an original \ncosponsor to Cantwell amendment No. 1857.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of this amendment, which I \nstrongly support.\n  I will be brief. Senator Byrd has already described in detail what \nthe amendment does.\n  It has only been a few weeks since the White House sent us a bill for \n$87 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan. This amendment deals with the $21 \nbillion that the President wants for reconstruction activities in these \ncountries. Of that amount, only $799 million--less than \\1/20\\th--is \nfor reconstruction in Afghanistan, a country where the standard of \nliving for most people is reminiscent of the Middle Ages.\n  It is also a country whose former Taliban government harbored Osama \nbin Laden, and in doing so enabled al-Qaida to plan the attacks of \nSeptember 11. But for whatever reason, and despite the difficulties and \ndangers that our troops and our aid workers are facing in Afghanistan, \nthe White House has only asked for a tiny fraction of these \nsupplemental funds to be provided to Afghanistan.\n  I have looked at what the administration wants this $21 billion for. \nMuch of it makes sense. But there are expenses here unlike any I have \nseen before in a foreign aid bill.\n\n[[Page S12788]]\n\n  Let me be clear. We all want to help Iraq. But we also have a duty to \nprotect the taxpayers' money, and this request is extravagant.\n  Let's look at just a few examples. These are some of the amounts we \nare being asked to spend for these items, for Iraq, compared to how \nmuch it would cost if they were purchased right here in the United \nStates: $33,000 pickup trucks; $6,000 satellite telephones; $400 \nmillion to build two prisons; and, studies costing tens of millions of \ndollars.\n  What is going on here? Who is profiting from these unnecessary \nexpenses? We know who isn't--U.S. taxpayers.\n  We have never, in my 29 years here, given foreign aid on such a scale \nto a country that in a few years could be the second largest oil \nproducing nation in the world.\n  Help Iraq, yes. But $20 billion? All at once? Out the door, with no \nreal strings attached? And for things like this?\n  There are communities in our own country that don't have internet \naccess, whose citizens can't get free computer training, that need new \ngarbage trucks, or police cars, or prisons. The list goes on and on.\n  This amendment attempts to make the best use of the funds in this \nbill, by cutting $1.6 billion of the Iraq reconstruction funds and \nshifting them to other needs, including for urgent humanitarian needs \nin Afghanistan, Liberia and Sudan.\n  Frankly, I think we should cut more than $1.6 billion. From what I \nhave seen in the meager justification materials we got from OMB, there \nis a lot of money here that is going to be spent on consultants and for \nthings that the Iraqis could do themselves for a fraction of the cost.\n  But at least this amendment would get at some of the unnecessary \nthings, and use the funds for things that are necessary.\n  Senator Byrd has spoken about the use of $600 million to locate and \ndestroy ammunition caches in Iraq, that are the source of weapons being \nused to kill and maim our troops. It is beyond comprehension why the \nPentagon has not acted sooner to deal with this problem. This amendment \nwould finally address it.\n  But I want to speak briefly on the $386 million that would be \ntransferred to programs in Afghanistan, because I don't think there is \nanyone here who would not agree that we need to do more to prevent the \nsituation in Afghanistan from unraveling. My friend from Kentucky, the \nchairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, Senator McConnell, \njust returned from Afghanistan. I am sure he saw how urgent the needs \nare.\n  The Karzai government is fragile, at best. Warlords continue to rule \nvast areas of the country. Our troops are in a continuing fight with \nal-Qaida and remnants of the Taliban, who strike from their sanctuaries \nin Pakistan.\n  Many Afghans remain displaced, living in squalor. They have too \nlittle to eat, not enough fuel for the winter, and many tens of \nthousands remain homeless.\n  Women and girls continue to face great hardships. Girls schools are \nbeing destroyed. Health care remains a dream for millions of rural \nAfghans.\n  The crop of opium poppy is the largest in years.\n  The list of needs is long, but a little money can make a big \ndifference in Afghanistan if it is spent wisely--not for internet \naccess, but to build primary schools and irrigation systems.\n  The $386 million that would be transferred to Afghanistan in this \namendment mirrors what the House Appropriations Committee did last \nweek. Both Democrats and Republicans in the House agreed that these \nfunds were better spent in Afghanistan. For health clinics, to train \nand equip the army, for anti-drug programs, for irrigation, to support \nelections and governance.\n  The amendment also provides $45 million for programs that \nspecifically help women, and $25 million for Afghans who are internally \ndisplaced and need emergency aid.\n  This amendment would bring the total in this bill for reconstruction \nin Afghanistan, a country of 22 million impoverished people, a country \nthat could easily revert to a terrorist haven, to slightly over $1 \nbillion. That compares to $20 billion for Iraq, a country of 25 million \npeople with a standard of living that already far exceeds what most \nAfghans could dream of.\n  Let's inject a little common sense into this process. Both Iraq and \nAfghanistan need help. Both are security issues for the United States.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent when I yield the \nfloor that I be permitted to yield to Senator Byrd to finish his \nremarks. He has time remaining on his allocation; following his \nremarks, I be recognized for the purpose of making a motion to table \nthe Byrd amendment. I would like to have 2 minutes for my time before \nmaking that motion to table. I ask the two cloakrooms as a courtesy to \nSenators at lunch to send out word there will be a vote on a motion to \ntable within 15 minutes.\n  I further ask that the time on that vote not be 10 minutes because \npeople are out of the building and they have to return. I ask this \namendment not be a 10-minute vote, that it be a regular vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend to modify the request. I just received a \nmessage from the cloakroom that Senator Kennedy wishes to speak for 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to Senator Kennedy also \nbeing allowed to speak for 15 minutes?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have no problem with that. I just ask his time occur \nafter or before Senator Byrd's time but at his discretion.\n  Mr. REID. Maybe afterwards.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I leave that up to Senator Byrd, whether he wants to \nspeak before or after.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in response, I think everything has been \nsaid as far as I, personally, am concerned. I would say that a good bit \nhas been said about the funding for a prison. There are funds in the \nbill for 26 detention facilities. It will take years to build the new \nprison that is proposed by the President. I don't know how a prison \nthat will not be finished for years protects our troops today or \ntomorrow or a year from now. I find it hard to imagine that our troops \nwould be protected by projects such as this.\n  As far as I am concerned, I am ready to yield back time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection to the unanimous \nconsent request as modified?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. As I understand, there is an allocation of 15 minutes \nfor Senator Kennedy; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator from West \nVirginia still controls 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the previous order be amended to \nwithdraw the time of Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Senator Byrd still has time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7\\1/2\\ minutes, and the \nSenator from Alaska has been allocated 2 minutes prior to a motion to \ntable.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I merely point out, as the Washington Post editorial did \non Wednesday, rebuilding the electricity grid, fixing the water supply \nsystem, getting oil flowing, maintaining public safety is all central \nto the hopes for stability and a representative government that is the \nmeans of getting our troops back.\n  I have had conversations--as a matter of fact, I just could not \nanswer a call from Ambassador Bremer. I have great admiration for him. \nHe has said there is no doubt the funds will help contribute to the \npeace and stability of not only Iraq but the entire region being \nstabilized. To deny them will delay the return home of our U.S. troops.\n  I understand there is pending an underlying amendment and second-\ndegree amendment. I make a motion to table the underlying amendment \nwhich will take both amendments, if I am successful, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays on that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S12789]]\n\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL, I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nDomenici) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID, I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 47, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 396 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--51\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n       \n     Domenici\n     Lieberman\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request to \nmake that will terminate the consideration of this bill if the Senate \nwill listen.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the only remaining amendments in order \nbe the following: Senator Byrd, regarding flexibility of money, 10 \nminutes equally divided; Senator Byrd, National Guard deployment, 10 \nminutes equally divided; Senator Byrd, amendment No. 1819 as a \nsubstitute, 10 minutes equally divided; Senator Brownback, an amendment \non rescission of money, 20 minutes--15 minutes for him and 5 minutes \nfor the manager of the bill. Those will be the last votes.\n  We also have the Leahy amendment; the Dorgan amendment on oil; the \nBoxer-Schumer amendment on shoulder-fired missiles, as modified by the \ntwo managers; Senator Domenici wishes to speak for 5 minutes; and we \nhave a Bond amendment which we believe will be adopted and will not \nrequire a vote. We have at this time four votes.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that upon the disposition of the \nabove-listed amendments and any final debate, the bill be read a third \ntime and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill, with no \nintervening action or debate. I further ask unanimous consent that when \nthe Senate receives from the House H.R. 3289, the House companion, that \nall after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 1689, as \namended, be inserted in lieu thereof; that the bill then be read for a \nthird time and passed, with no intervening action or debate.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following passage of the bill, \nthe Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the \nHouse, and the Chair be authorized to appoint the full Committee on \nAppropriations as conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I do not intend to object. I want to \nclarify, based on the discussions we have been having with the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, the Dorgan-Wyden amendment \ninvolves a number of savings provisions. We are going to be working \nwith the chairman's staff and the staff of Senator Byrd. We think we \ncan find common ground on a provision that will save upward of $1 \nbillion. I withdraw my reservation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Leahy amendment, the Dorgan amendment, the Boxer \namendment, Domenici, and the Bond amendment will be worked out with the \nmanagers and accepted without a vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, to make sure we are clear \non this, on the Leahy amendment, am I correct, Mr. President, the yeas \nand nays have already been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, they have. The Senator from Vermont is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We would need, am I further correct, Mr. President, a \nfurther unanimous consent request to vitiate the yeas and nays on the \nLeahy amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thought this unanimous consent request says there are \nonly four votes left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Under the unanimous consent request propounded, there will still be a \nrequirement to vitiate the yeas and nays on the Leahy amendment.\n  Is there objection to the unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. BOND. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I was off the floor, and I am not sure \nwhether the chairman asked for a vote on the Bond-Mikulski amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have not.\n  Mr. BOND. We would like to have a vote on that amendment. This is an \nextremely important amendment providing veterans health care. It will \nbe vitally important. I would like to have a recorded vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have an objection to that. I have to withdraw the \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I renew my request, but I ask that all \nreferences to votes be deleted. We have no agreement on how many votes \nthere will be. We believe there will be four, maybe five, maybe six.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Senator Byrd is first in line.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1886\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1886.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for the involuntary deployment \n   overseas in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom of members of the \n National Guard and Reserves who have been involuntarily deployed for \n          more than six months during the preceding six years)\n\n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n       Sec. 316. No funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by this Act may be obligated or expended for the involuntary \n     deployment overseas in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom of \n     a member of the National Guard or Reserves if that member has \n     been involuntarily deployed for any period of six months or \n     more during the six-year period ending on the date the \n     involuntary deployment overseas would otherwise commence.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the National Guard has been stretched to the breaking \npoint. Not since the Korean war has the United States deployed so many \nmembers of the National Guard and the\n\n[[Page S12790]]\n\nReserves. Right now, more than 160,000 members of the National Guard \nand the Reserves are on active duty around the world, and more \nreservists are getting ready to ship out to Iraq.\n  Last month, the President activated 10,000 more guardsmen for service \nin Iraq and put an additional 5,000 troops on alert. More callups are \ndoubtlessly in the works. I have heard from many families anxious to \nknow when their deployed loved ones might return home. I expect that \nall Senators have received similar letters and telephone calls.\n  All of these families expressed a deep frustration with the open-\nended, unfocused deployment of Guard and Reserve units. While the \nNation's citizen soldiers are proud to serve their country overseas, \nthey also have obligations at home. These part-time soldiers are full-\ntime doctors, firemen, policemen, and a host of other roles which are \ncritical to the security of American communities. We must do better to \nbalance their commitments at home with their deployments overseas.\n  The amendment before the Senate will help to relieve the strain that \nis being placed on our citizen soldier. It would prohibit the \ninvoluntary deployment of a member of the National Guard or the \nReserves to support Operation Iraqi Freedom if that member has been \ndeployed for a period of more than 6 months in the previous 6 years.\n  This amendment would put an end to the back-to-back deployments that \nare causing the most strain on our reservists and their families.\n  The amendment is based in part upon the direction that Secretary \nRumsfeld issued on July 9, 2003, that members of the National Guard and \nReserves should not be subject to more than one long deployment every 6 \nyears. We are engaged in a long-term occupation mission under hostile \ncircumstances. There are better ways to get the troops we need for this \nmission than calling tens of thousands of Guard and Reserve troops away \nfrom their homes, away from their jobs, away from their communities for \n1 year at a time.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is 10 minutes equally divided. I yield our 5 \nminutes to Senator Bond, chairman of the National Guard caucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have addressed this matter before. I \nthink all of us are concerned about the time that has been taken up \nwith the National Guard and Reserve being deployed overseas. This, \nhowever, is what they signed up for. We are in a war on terrorism. The \nwar in Afghanistan and the war in Iraq are very important and critical \nelements in that war. We believe the Defense Department has to be more \nconcerned about the time the Guard and Reserve are deployed. There is \nno question it causes strain on the families and causes strain on \nemployment opportunities.\n  I have talked to members of the Reserves who have been stationed from \nmy State. They are concerned about the effect on employment. All of \nthese things, however, are what we need to deal with without taking a \nhatchet to the effectiveness and the utility of the Guard and the \nReserves. It is not hard to assume that if one looks at the provision \nthat no one who has been deployed in the past 6 years could be deployed \nin Operation Iraqi Freedom, that would probably have wiped out all of \nthe most experienced and most needed people in the Guard and Reserves.\n  Whatever we do, we do not want to take away from the important \nmissions the Guard and the Reserves play with this blanket prohibition \nacross the board that all of the Guard and Reserve who have gained \nexperience, perhaps serving in Afghanistan, perhaps serving earlier in \nIraq, perhaps serving in Bosnia or Kosovo, cannot be sent to Iraq. We \nhope that if this supplemental is passed, we will be bringing troops \nhome sooner rather than later, particularly if we give the full $87 \nbillion to the President. That will be undercut if this blanket \nprohibition goes through. I have heard previously from the leaders, the \nGuard caucus, the members of the Guard in August, and others, who do \nnot believe such a prohibition is worthwhile.\n  I yield to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I point out that Senator Byrd's amendment \nwould prohibit the obligation of funds to deploy to Operation Iraqi \nFreedom a member of the National Guard or Reserves if that member has \nbeen involuntarily deployed for any period of 6 months or more during \nthe 6-year period ending on the date the involuntary deployment \noverseas would otherwise commence.\n  As I understand it, that would mean these people could be deployed to \nPakistan, Afghanistan, or anyplace except to Iraq, where they are \nneeded most.\n  When the Senator has completed his time, I ask that I might be \nrecognized to make a motion to table the amendment.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining. The Senator from West Virginia has 2 minutes 13 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the remainder of our time to Senator Warner, but \nI ask at the end to be recognized to make a motion to table the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would simply say, briefly, the Secretary \nof Defense has issued policy guidance that covers members of the \nReserve and Guard, and that guidance says they should not be subject to \nmore than one long deployment every 6 years. That has enabled them to \ncontinue their civilian pursuits and their family lifestyles. Of \ncourse, that can be waived in times of national emergency, as it is \nright now. But to impose this management restriction on the President \nas Commander in Chief I think would severely begin to limit, for \nplanning and other purposes, the utility of the Guard and Reserve.\n  I remember serving under Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird when the \nconcept of the total force was evolving, and that is that men and women \nof the Guard are respected and treated with equal effectiveness as \nthose of the regular Active Forces. I think this would be a very \nserious step backward in what I believe has been an absolutely glorious \ncontribution by the National Guard and the Reserve Forces for some \nyears now in their deployments in the war on terrorism.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 2 minutes \n13 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we need to restore predictability in the \nlives of those who serve in the National Guard and the Reserves. This \namendment would stop the back-to-back deployments that are straining \nthe Guard and the Reserves to the breaking point. It adopts the \napproach suggested by none other than Secretary Rumsfeld. Our men and \nwomen in the National Guard and the Reserves need relief from their \nlong missions in Iraq. We should not look to other units of the Guard \nand Reserve for relief. We need more help, and it all boils down to \nthis point that we should have thought of long ago, that we need more \nhelp from the international community. It is the administration's fault \nthat that help has not been sought more diligently, more timely, and \nmore intensely.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized for a \nmotion.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move that the Senator's amendment be \ntabled. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask that this be the first vote in the stacked order \nwhen we agree to a time later and ask that we temporarily set aside \nthis amendment so we might take up the next amendment on the list.\n  Mr. REID. What was that, Mr. President?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I asked that the amendment be set aside temporarily \nafter the yeas and nays have been ordered so we may have a series of\n\n[[Page S12791]]\n\nstacked votes later on. There is another Byrd amendment, a third Byrd \namendment, and a Brownback amendment. We wish to consider all of those \nand have stacked votes after they are completed.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I have spoken to the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia. He desires to have a vote right now. The Senator has made a \nmotion to table.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Well, I did make a motion to table. I apologize to the \nSenator from West Virginia. I thought we had an understanding we would \ngo through these and have one series of votes that would be 10 minutes \napiece.\n  Mr. REID. That was not the agreement.\n  Mr. STEVENS. All right. The Senator is entitled to his vote, if there \nis an objection to putting it off.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to withdraw his motion \nto table?\n  Mr. STEVENS.

I ask unanimous consent there be 10 minutes on the \nDorgan-Wyden amendment, 4 minutes apiece for Senators Dorgan and Wyden, \nand 2 minutes for myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself and \n     Mr. Wyden, proposes an amendment numbered 1887.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To reduce unnecessary spending for reconstruction in Iraq)\n\n       On page 25, strike lines 7 through the colon on line 18, \n     and insert the following:\n       For necessary expenses for security, rehabilitation and \n     reconstruction in Iraq, $18,449,000,000, to remain available \n     until expended, to be allocated as follows: $3,243,000,000 \n     for security and law enforcement; $1,318,000,000 for justice, \n     public safety infrastructure, and civil society; \n     $5,560,000,000 for the electric sector; $1,900,000,000 for \n     oil infrastructure; $4,332,000,000 for water resources and \n     sanitation; $500,000,000 for transportation and \n     telecommunications; $370,000,000 for roads, bridges, and \n     construction; $793,000,000 for health care; $153,000,000 for \n     private sector development; and $280,000,000 for education, \n     refugees, human rights, democracy, and governance:\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, when this bill was considered by the House \nAppropriations Committee there were a number of reconstruction spending \nrequests for Iraq they decided to delete. For example, the House \nAppropriations Committee deleted $4 million for a telephone numbering \nsystem, $9 million for ZIP Codes and a postal architecture, $10 million \nto modernize the business practices of the Iraqi television and radio \nindustries, $312 million for unspecified transportation and \ncommunication projects, including cosmetic improvements at airports; \n$100 million to build 7 housing communities including roads, schools, \nmosques, markets, clinics; $200 million to establish an American-Iraqi \nEnterprise Fund; $90 million to open public information centers in \nIraq's 266 municipalities; a month-long catchup business training \ncourse at $10,000 per pupil, which is twice as much as the Harvard \nBusiness School would cost for an equivalent period; and $100 million \nto buy 2,000 garbage trucks.\n  The point is that there is a long list of specifics dealing with \nreconstruction in Iraq that are not urgent and are not, in fact, \nemergencies. The House Appropriations Committee deleted these. When \nthey deleted them, they indicated these were not emergencies and were \nnot urgent. As a result of that, Senator Wyden and I have put together \nan amendment that deletes the identical accounts from the \nreconstruction part of this bill as the House cut, which comes to \n$1.655 billion.\n  In addition, our amendment cuts $200 million from the amount the \nadministration is requesting to import fuel into Iraq, which the \nCongressional Research Service indicates may be in excess to what is \nactually needed.\n  I ask my colleague Senator Wyden if he could comment on that piece of \nthe legislation. In total, our amendment would reduce the \nreconstruction piece of this legislation by $1.855 billion from the \n$20.3 billion requested for Iraq reconstruction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, obviously $87 billion is an eye-popping sum \nof money, and taxpayers want the Congress to turn every penny over \ntwice. That is what Senator Dorgan and I have done. We've gone through \nevery number with a sharp pencil. This amendment, without in any way \nhampering the efforts to deal with the grave concerns in Iraq, could \nsave taxpayers $1.8 billion.\n  For example, in a report for Senator Bingaman and myself, the \nCongressional Research Service found $200 million could be saved in \nconnection with the purchase of petroleum products. They have indicated \nit would be significantly cheaper to buy gasoline in neighboring \ncountries such as Saudi Arabia and Turkey.\n  Without the Dorgan-Wyden amendment, in effect, the Senate would be \nsaying to the American taxpayers the Federal Government cannot get a \nbetter price per gallon for gas when buying a 30-day supply of gas for \na country the size of California than you and I could get at the gas \nstation just down the street from the Capitol.\n  So we believe this is an important amendment. I have worked on these \nissues with a number of colleagues, particularly Senator Collins. We \nare able to get competitive bidding now on all of the contracts. The \nDorgan-Wyden amendment complements this effort.\n  I particularly want to thank Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd for \nworking closely with us to be able to save at least $1.8 billion, at \nthe end of this debate, in a responsible fashion, in a fashion that \nwill not injure our troops, that will not injure the reconstruction \neffort.\n  This is a significant step forward for the Senate, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment, and thank again Senator Stevens \nfor working with us.\n\n[[Page S12792]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, is all time yielded back on the other \nside?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have agreed to take this to \nconference. The House has deleted approximately the same amount of \nmoney. I do not think it is precisely the same items covered but very \nclose. The allocations are close to what the House made. We want to do \nour best to work in conference. We accept the fact the Congress is \ngoing to reduce this bill, but I do want to make certain the urgent \nneeds particularly of oil production are met.\n  I know the Senator from Oregon and I may have a little disagreement \non that. I do not think he disagrees that all production means should \nbe really modernized sufficiently so we can be assured of that oil \nproduction. That oil production is essential to Iraq taking on their \nown future.\n  We will work in conference. Senator Dorgan will be in the conference, \nso we will keep them informed of what is going on. But we are going to \ntake this amendment and adopt it. As I said, it is quite similar to \nwhat the House has done, and we are going to work it out to the best of \nour ability, to use this money and prioritize it in a way that meets \nthe needs of those people who have the job to do in Iraq.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and ask for the adoption of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1887) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Now, Mr. President, Senator Byrd has an amendment No. \n1819, 10 minutes equally divided.\n  I ask the Senator, are you prepared to go forward now?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1888\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may I say to the distinguished manager of \nthe bill, Mr. Stevens, I wish to go forward with the amendment \nprotecting the powers of the Congress, striking broad new executive \nauthorities.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Which amendment is that?\n  Mr. BYRD. No. 1888.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Very well.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Wyden, Mr. \n     Jeffords, and Mr. Dayton, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1888.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To eliminate the flexibility given to the President to \n  reallocate all of the $20.3 billion Iraq Relief and Reconstruction \n                  Funds, without approval by Congress)\n\n       On page 27, line 9, strike ``Provided further, That the \n     President may reallocate funds provided under this heading:''\n       On page 27, line 21, strike ``used for such purpose'' and \n     insert ``shall be available only to the extent that the funds \n     are made available in a subsequent appropriations act''.\n       On page 12, line 11, strike, ``, and in addition such funds \n     as necessary, not to exceed $5,000,000,000, as approved by \n     the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, Subcommittees \n     on Defense'';\n       On page 15, strike Section 312;\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I offered this amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Wyden, Mr. \nJeffords, and Mr. Dayton.\n  On page 27 of the supplemental bill it reads:\n\n       Provided further, That the President may reallocate funds \n     provided under this heading.\n\n  Those 12 little words, disguised as legalese, mean the President can \nspend $20.3 billion for the reconstruction of Iraq in any manner in \nwhich he pleases. The fine print in the bill allows the President to \nspend $20.3 billion in Iraq as he pleases.\n  On page 27 I believe we find this language, beginning on line 9. This \nis page 27, line 9, of the bill:\n\n       Provided further, That the President may reallocate funds \n     provided under this heading.\n\n  The President may reallocate those funds regardless of what the rest \nof this bill may say under this heading. The President may reallocate \nthis.\n  Now, if we want to make the President a king, this is the place to \nstart. All those who believe in a monarchy in this country, support \nthis against my amendment. That is what it says. Read the fine print:\n\n       Provided further, That the President may reallocate funds \n     provided under this heading.\n\n  What is the heading? The heading is as follows: ``Iraq Relief and \nReconstruction Fund.'' So that is the heading. And in the very first \nline, it reads as follows:\n\n       For necessary expenses for security, rehabilitation and \n     reconstruction in Iraq, $20,304,000,000, to remain available \n     until expended, to be allocated as follows.\n\n  And then it goes right down the line, item after item after item \nafter item, and the dollar amounts. And then come over here to the fine \nprint. Now hear me. Look at the fine print:\n\n       Provided further, That the President may reallocate funds \n     provided under this heading.\n\n  Here is what it does. Here is what it does to the bill. It tears it \nup. The President can just reallocate it. The heck with the bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I say to the Senator from West Virginia, this is a very \nimportant item. We do this provision, we set out all these numbers--\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. We link the numbers with particular activities, and \nthen, when you go over and look at the next page, and look at the fine \nprint, you discover the President can reallocate the funds provided \nunder this heading.\n  This is giving the President $20,304,000,000 in effect to do as he \npleases, without reference to the money figures that are set out.\n  We may argue about how much should be appropriated and what it should \nbe appropriated for, but there ought not to be any argument it is the \nCongress that is to determine what the appropriations are to be and \nwhat the money is going to go for. To simply hand over $20 billion, and \nthen have a clause that enables the President to use it for any of \nthese purposes he chooses is to completely abdicate the congressional \nresponsibility and the power of the purse.\n  Mr. BYRD. It does. The Senator has stated the situation very well.\n  Our forefathers disdained even a gentle master. Now here we are, we \ncome along, and we pass this bill with these provisions, fulfilling the \ncontrol of the power of the purse by the Congress, and then we turn \naround and say: The President may reallocate these funds as he pleases.\n  Do we want to be like that? I am not ready to make a King George. It \nis President George Bush now. I am not ready to make him King George \nBush. If that is what you want to do, this is the place to start.\n  So I hope Members will vote for my amendment. Congress should retain \nits power of the purse. But always read the fine print. That is what \nthe fine print says.\n  Then the supplemental bill also gives the Secretary of Defense the \nauthority to transfer among accounts up to $5 billion of the $65.6 \nbillion in funds for the military.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well.\n  I hope the Senate will support my amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I agree with Senator Byrd that the more \nthat one reads the fine print of this legislation, the worse it gets. \nThe budget document submitted by the Coalition Provisional Authority, \nCPA, leaves one with the distinct impression that money will be spent \non specific items.\n  For example, $9 million will be spent on projects for ZIP Codes, $100 \nmillion will be spent on the witness protection program, $75 will be \nspent on irrigation pumps. And so on and so forth.\n\n[[Page S12793]]\n\n  But, after a little digging, one uncovers a provision on page 27 of \nthe supplemental appropriations bill that the Senate is now \nconsidering. This is a provision that the administration requested. It \nsays ``Provided further, That the President may reallocate funds \nprovided under this heading.''\n  What does this means? It means that you can take the CPA's 53 page \nbudget justification and throw it in the garbage can. Its just for show \nsaying how much money is appropriated for any item in this bill. What \nthe Senate is doing is giving the President all of the money for Iraq \nreconstruction, and saying ``do what ever you want with it.''\n  If you want to doubled the amount of money for pickup trucks and pay \n$66,000 a truck instead of $33,000 a truck, go ahead.\n  If you want to buy even more satellite phones, go ahead. If you want \nto spend more money on wireless internet, which many American \ncommunities don't have, go ahead. If you want to slash money for \nrefugees or police training, go ahead. If you want to spend every \ndollar to pay consultants, go ahead, because, Mr. President, it is up \nto you.\n  It is certainly true that the President can spend the money the way \nit is spelled out in the CPA's budget justification.\n  But, nothing, absolutely nothing, in this legislation requires the \nPresident to even come close to meeting the amounts that are justified \nto Congress.\n  This is not some inside-the-beltway, policy-wonk issue. This issue is \nabout the Constitution. This issue is about our duty as Senators.\n  The Constitution unequivocally gives the Congress the power of the \npurse.\n  And this provision all but hands over the power of the purse to the \nPresident with respect to Iraq reconstruction. It essentially says \n``you decide, because we won't''.\n  It sets a dangerous precedent. And, we all know that once we give \naway authority to the executive branch, it is almost impossible to get \nthat genie back in the bottle.\n  Moreover, this new authority is completely unnecessary.\n  We didn't include this provision in the previous Iraq supplemental.\n  The administration never complained that we did not give them enough \nflexibility before. Why should we do this now? Like last time, we can \neasily come up with an approach that gives the administration the \nflexibility it needs, but maintains important protections to ensure the \nmoney is accounted for.\n  This provision is not unlike the use of force resolution that we \npassed last fall. Congress has the sole responsibility to declare war.\n  Instead of having a vote on that, we passed a resolution that said, \n``Mr. President, you decide.''\n  Let's not go down that road again.\n  This is not some partisan issue. I would be saying the same thing if \na Democrat was in the White House.\n  This is about our responsibility. This is about watching out for the \ntaxpayers' money. This is about making sure the Senate does not become \na rubberstamp for blank checks.\n  We should not give this power to this administration or any other \nadministration. I urge my colleagues to support the Byrd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we had extended in the previous \nsupplemental similar discretion to the President. During the period of \ngreat change, such as the global war on terrorism, we have done that \nsince from September 11, 2001. This provision in our bill does not \neliminate or reduce congressional oversight. Every transfer of these \nfunds above the threshold must be--notice must be given in advance to \nthe Appropriations Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  We have done this in the past, and it is necessary for the future. We \nput up the money. They come to us and tell us how they are going to \nspend it. We approve it or modify it, but we have oversight, and we \ncontinue to have oversight.\n  The commander of the special operations command seeks and needs \nauthority to prevent new terrorist cells from forming. We have enormous \nneeds from the combatant commander who really has the key job in Iraq \nin fighting the war on terrorism that is now developing even more \nintensely in Iraq after the magnificent victory of our forces. We \nbelieve the authority is no different than what the Congress has \napproved in the past.\n  Madam President, has all time been yielded back?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The time of the Senator from \nWest Virginia has expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time. \nI move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. \n1888. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL, I announce that the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nAlexander), the Senator from Mississippi (Mr. Lott), and the Senator \nfrom New Mexico (Mr. Domenici) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from \nTennessee (Mr. Alexander) would vote ``yes.''\n  Mr. REID, I announce tha the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nand the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that there be 1 minute for Senator \nBoxer and 1 minute for Senator Schumer to explain the modification of \ntheir amendment, which we will accept. I have a statement to make with \nSenator Domenici on his amendment. Senator Brownback has his amendment. \nHe has agreed to limit his remarks to 8 minutes, and we have 5 minutes \nif we want to use them after that.\n  I remind the Senate, after these amendments are handled, there will \njust be one more vote. We then have to proceed to a vote on final \npassage. I understand there are some Senators who wish to make a \nstatement before final passage.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  The Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham, was going to speak. He has now \nindicated he will very briefly address the Senate and make his speech \nafter the passage of the bill--I assume passage. Senator Byrd is going \nto speak for up to 25 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Before passage?\n  Mr. REID. Before passage. We are still working with Senator Leahy on \nour side.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. After those speeches, there still will be a vote on \nfinal passage.\n\n\nAmendments Nos. 1807, As Further Modified, 1850, As Modified, and 1860, \n                          As Modified, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Without objection, the amendments are \nconsidered en bloc and agreed to en bloc.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                    amendment no. 1807, as modified\n\n (Purpose: An amendment, with offsets, to provide emergency assistance \n                       to the people of Liberia)\n\n       On page 29, line 17, strike ``$100,000,000, to remain \n     available until expended'' and insert ``$200,000,000, which \n     shall be made available for assistance for Liberia of which \n     $100,000,000 shall be derived by transfer from funds \n     appropriated under any other heading of this Chapter''\n       On page 29, line 18, after ``heading'' insert ``, shall \n     remain available until expended, and''\n\n(Purpose: To provide for an audit of funds appropriated under this Act \n       by the General Accounting Office, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 28, line 15, before the period, insert the \n     following: Provided further, That funds appropriated under \n     this heading shall be made available to the General \n     Accounting Office for an audit of all funds appropriated \n     under this Act, including tracking the expenditure of \n     appropriated funds, a comparison of the amounts appropriated \n     under this Act to the amount actually expended, and a \n     determination of whether the funds appropriated in this Act \n     are expended as intended by Congress.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1860, as Modified\n\n(Purpose: to provide up to $13,000,000 for conflict resolution, rule of \n                     law and democracy activities)\n\n       On page 28, line 15, insert before the period:\n       : Provided further, That of the funds appropriated under \n     this heading, up to $13,000,000 may be made available to \n     facilitate inter-ethnic and inter-religious dialogue, \n     conflict resolution activities, support rule of law programs, \n     and train Iraqi leaders in democratic principles.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let me take a very short time to summarize \nwhat amendment No. 1807 does. This is a very important amendment \noffered by myself and the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The Chafee-Leahy amendment is supported by the Archbishop of \nMonrovia. A man, who for years, stood up to the brutal regime of \nCharles Taylor.\n  It provides $200 million to address basic needs--food, water, \nshelter--of the people of Liberia. There is a humanitarian emergency in \nthat country, as 74% of Liberians lack access to safe drinking water, \n60 percent lack access to acceptable sanitation, and 75 percent live in \npoverty.\n  The administration's own number for Liberia is $200 million. In \ntestimony before the House, the top Africa official at the State \nDepartment said the U.S. needed $200 million to address this crisis.\n  The amendment is extremely flexible. It allows the administration to \nspend these funds virtually any way it wants, including humanitarian, \nreconstruction, long-term development, or security assistance.\n  The amendment is fully offset. It does not add a dime to the Iraq \nsupplemental.\n  Relief groups with operations in Liberia strongly support this \namendment. Catholic Relief Services, Amnesty International and a range \nof other NGOs strongly support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank the cosponsors of this amendment \nSenators Coleman, Biden, Lieberman, Dashle, Reid, Feingold, Reed, \nLautenberg, Landrieu, and Jeffords.\n  I especially want to thank the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee for working with me on this amendment. This amendment will be \nadopted, and I will not insist on a rollcall vote. This is a very \nimportant amendment and I am glad that the Senate has acted decisively \nto approve it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the managers of the bill for \naccepting my amendment, directing that $13 million of the relief and \nreconstruction funds in the bill may be used to facilitate inter-ethnic \nand inter-religious dialog, conflict resolution activities, support \nrule-of-law programs and train Iraqi leaders in democratic principles. \nIn my view, the United States Institute of Peace is uniquely qualified \nto undertake these activities.\n  We have been debating the President's request for $87 billion in \nsupplemental funds for Iraq and Afghanistan. At times, it has seemed \nthat we in the Senate agree on very little. But there is one goal that \nI believe every Senator strongly endorses: We all want to bring our \nAmerican troops home from Afghanistan and Iraq as soon as possible.\n  Without so much as batting an eye, we appropriate billions for war, \nbillions for weapons, and billions for post-war reconstruction. \nMeanwhile, it seems that we overlook one key activity--conflict \nresolution and peacemaking. Conflict resolution and peacemaking must be \naddressed specifically and not simply as a by-product or hoped for \noutcome of rebuilding roads and repairing infrastructure.\n  The U.S. Government has one agency that can help to reduce conflict, \nbuild democratic institutions, and even assist in the drafting of the \nnew Iraqi constitution--all prerequisites to bringing our troops home \nsooner rather than later. I am talking about the United States \nInstitute of Peace. This institute has a proven track record of \naccomplishing those prerequisites which I just mentioned.\n  I am going to take a few minutes to explain the origins of the United \nStates Institute of Peace because I am concerned that very few \nAmericans know about this institute and its remarkable work.\n  Throughout our long history, America has been proud of its strong, \nwell-led military. And this outstanding military leadership is no \naccident. It is possible because we maintain prestigious, world-class \nmilitary academies which train some of the best and brightest minds in \nAmerica in the art and science of war.\n  But Americans also have a long history as a peace-loving people. Time \nand again, we have brokered peace between warring nations, and we have \nintervened to head off potential conflicts. The Institute of Peace \ndraws on this proud tradition, and today makes a vital intellectual \ninvestment in the art and science of peacemaking.\n  Today's Institute of Peace is the fruit of a dream and vision that \ngoes back to our Nation's Founders. Benjamin Banneker, often called \n``the first black American man of science,'' and physician Benjamin \nRush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, noted and lamented \nthe Constitution's failure to establish a Department of Peace to \nbalance the Department of War. In their correspondence with Thomas \nJefferson in 1792, Banneker and Rush envisioned a ``Peace Office'' \nwhich would be on an equal footing with the Department of War and would \nbe charged with promoting and preserving perpetual peace in the United \nStates.\n  George Washington also supported the establishment of a Peace Office. \nAnd his support was not just casual. He believed that such an office \nshould be an essential pillar of the new Nation. When he died in \n1799, Washington's last will and testament bequeathed in perpetuity 50 \nacres in Potomac County to be used ``toward the endowment of a \nuniversity--under the auspices of the general Government.'' This \nbequest was intended to make possible the proper ``Peace \nEstablishment'' that President Washington had written about as early as \n1783.\n\n  More recently, in a 1980 report by the Matsunaga Commission strongly \nrecommended the establishment of the United States Academy of Peace. In \nthe course of more than 70 meetings and hearings all across the United \nStates, Senator Matsunaga of Hawaii and other Senators surveyed the \nfull range of threats to world peace, and explored ways to counter \nthose threats.\n  After much thoughtful debate a compromise was reached and the United \nStates Institute of Peace Act was passed and signed into law by \nPresident Ronald Reagan in 1984. A board was installed and the \nInstitute's first meeting was held in February 1986. Since that time, \nthe Institute has done remarkable work in such disparate nations as \nAfghanistan and Korea, Bosnia and the Philippines.\n  Today, at the direction of Congress, the Institute actively pursues \nsix interrelated activities:\n  Expanding society's knowledge about the changing nature and conduct \nof international relations and the management of international \nconflict;\n  Supporting policymakers in the legislative and executive branches;\n  Facilitating the resolution of international disputes;\n\n[[Page S12795]]\n\n  Training international affairs professionals from the United States \nand abroad in conflict prevention, management, and resolution \ntechniques;\n  Strengthening the education of emerging generations of young people \nin the United States and in foreign zones of conflict;\n  Increasing public understanding about the nature of international \nconflicts, as well as approaches to their prevention, management, and \nresolution.\n  I also want to stress that in accord with the agency's enabling \nlegislation, the Institute of Peace does not advocate specific \npolicies, nor does it take policy positions.\n  In recent years, the Institute has pursued several special \ninitiatives that I believe are particularly noteworthy and germane to \nour debate on the Iraq supplemental bill.\n  I especially want to highlight the Institute's work in Bosnia. After \nthe Dayton Accords of 1995, the Institute activated the Bosnian Inter-\nreligious Council, which now provides a model for reconciliation among \nBosnia's Muslim, Catholic, Serb and Jewish communities. The Institute \nworked on the ground in both Bosnia and Washington addressing \ncontentious issues such as rule of law, peace agreements, political \nrestructuring, and the role of religion in conflict.\n  I would also cite the Institute's Special Initiative on the Muslim \nWorld, which addresses a broad range of political, social, cultural, \nand religious issues--many of which are acutely relevant in the wake of \nthe September 11 terrorist attacks.\n  At the same time, the Institute's Religion and Peacemaking Initiative \nis doing excellent work enhancing the capacity of faith communities to \nbe forces for peace.\n  In another example of the Institute's work with a Muslim community, \nin May 2003 the administration asked the Institute of Peace to play a \nfacilitating role in peace talks between the government of the Republic \nof the Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. A team from \nthe Institute visited the Philippines in August. And in meetings I \nconducted just 2 days ago, I learned that significant progress is being \nmade.\n  In Afghanistan the institute, through its role of law program, has \nparticipated in efforts to reconstruct the judicial system. USIP was \nthe originator of the concept to establish a judicial commission. The \ninstitute is also working on the integration of new judicial system \nwith traditional Afghani legal practice.\n  The Institute stands alone among U.S. agencies in these efforts to \nwork with the international Muslim community. Based on the Institute's \nbrilliant work in other Muslim countries, I believe that it can play an \nespecially constructive role in Iraq. In particular, it will take a \nlead role in building up Iraq's civil society, and in nurturing Iraq's \nfledgling democratic institutions.\n  With adequate funding, the Institute wants to go to Iraq to \nfacilitate inter-ethnic and inter-religious dialogue among community, \npolitical and civic-society leaders. One of the biggest threats to our \nreconstruction effort in Iraq is the possibility that full-fledged \nfighting could break out between religious and ethnic communities. The \nInstitute can play a vital role in preventing this. The Institute also \nwill work to establish the rule of law by supporting the constitution-\nwriting process and designing a framework for bringing to justice \nleaders of the former dictatorial regime. So, exactly as envisioned by \nour Nation's founders, the United States Institute of Peace is playing \na vital role in restoring and strengthening peace around the world--and \nnow, in particular, in Iraq. As I said, this is the key to bringing our \ntroops home soon, with their mission truly accomplished.\n  I am pleased that we have allocated $13 million for conflict \nresolution and peacemaking in Iraq. In order to adequately fund the \nInstitute's work in Iraq the Institute needs only one hundredth of one \npercent of the President's total request. Surely this is not too high a \nprice to pay for ``making peace.''\n  Time and again in recent years--including in Iraq--our Nation has \nshown that it is brilliant at winning wars. But time and again, we have \nhad difficulty winning the peace. As we continue to increase funding \nfor the Department of Defense by tens of billions of dollars each year, \nwe must also be generous in our support and funding for this all-\nimportant agency, the United States Institute of Peace.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, through the Chair to the Senator from \nAlaska, Senator Schumer does not wish any time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Very well.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that that be stricken.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does Senator Boxer wish her time?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, she does.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield to Senator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1845, As Modified\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank Senator Stevens for helping me \non this amendment, and I thank Senator Cochran as well.\n  Senator Schumer and I have been very concerned about the threat of \nshoulder-fired missiles to American commercial aircraft. What we have \nfound out is that there are a number of planes--about 900 planes--that \nare also used in the civil reserve air fleet, meaning that many times \nour military will ask a commercial company, such as United Airlines or \nUSAir, to make planes available for our armed services personnel. We \nsimply say in this amendment that when countermeasures are placed on \ncommercial aircraft, the first priority will be those planes.\n  To conclude, all we are saying in this amendment is when we do start \nto make sure that our commercial aircraft are protected from shoulder-\nfired missiles and we place those defenses on those commercial \naircraft, the first priority will be the civil air reserve fleet \nbecause, again, that entails protecting our men and women in uniform.\n  I again thank everyone. Madam President, is this going into the \nmanagers' package, I ask Senator Stevens, or do we need a separate vote \non it?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I send to the desk amendment No. 1845, \nas modified, the one Senator Boxer just described, and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, Mr. \n     Schumer, and Mr. Lautenberg, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1845, as modified.\n\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) In May 2002, the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued \n     a warning to law enforcement personnel to be alert to the \n     potential use of shoulder-fired missiles against U.S. \n     aircraft;\n       (2) In May 2002, al-Qaeda was suspected of firing a \n     shoulder-fired missile at U.S. military aircraft near Prince \n     Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia;\n       (3) In November 2002, an Israeli commercial jetliner was \n     fired upon by a shoulder-fired missile shortly after take-off \n     in Mombasa, Kenya;\n       (4) In August 2003, a weapons smuggler was arrested after \n     agreeing to sell a Russian SA-18 to an undercover FBI agent \n     posing as a Muslim extremist;\n       (5) During recent operations in Iraq, U.S. commercial \n     airlines--as part of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF)--flew \n     nearly 2,000 flights carrying U.S. troops and supplies into \n     Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and \n     Bahrain;\n       (6) No U.S. commercial airliners are currently equipped \n     with defenses against shoulder-fired missiles.\n       (b) Prioritization.--\n       When counter measures against the threat of shoulder-fired \n     missiles are deployed, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in \n     conjunction with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary \n     of Transportation, shall make it a priority to equip the \n     aircraft enrolled in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, what is the modification? I thought we \nhad agreed on this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is the one the Senator sent to us.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is the same one. Absolutely. I just ask that we do \nthis by voice vote and get this done.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is what we seek to do.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, during the recent operations in Iraq, and \nas recently as this June, U.S. commercial airliners, such as Delta and \nU.S. Airways, flew nearly 2,000 flights carrying\n\n[[Page S12796]]\n\nU.S. troops and supplies into Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab \nEmirates, Qatar, and Bahrain.\n  Unlike U.S. military transport aircraft, such as the C-17, none of \nthese commercial jets were equipped with defenses against shoulder-\nfired missiles.\n  Yet these aircraft, known as the civil reserve air fleet, CRAF, are \ncontractually obligated to support Department of Defense airlift \nrequirements during times of emergency, when the need of airlift \nexceeds the capability of military aircraft. Civil reserve air fleet \ncarriers must make aircraft available for the start of assigned \nmissions within 24 hours after callup when stages I or II are activated \nand within 48 hours when stage III is activated.\n  These constitute our most vulnerable aircraft. They land in areas \nthat are highly volatile, where we know terrorists groups operate, \nwhere we know they have shoulder-fired missiles, and where they have \nattempted to use them.\n  The bottom line is, it is only a matter of time before terrorist \nsucceed in bringing down a commercial airplane with a shoulder-fired \nmissile. We cannot afford for our luck to run out.\n  The administration has presented a plan that would fail to equip any \naircraft until fiscal year 2006, at the earliest. We need to move \nfaster. Thousands of these weapons are in the hands of terrorists all \naround the world and are easily available on the black market.\n  The Federal Bureau of Investigation has issued a warning to law \nenforcement personnel to be alert to the potential use of shoulder-\nfired missiles against U.S. aircraft given al-Qaida's demonstrated \nobjective to target the U.S. airline industry, its access to U.S. and \nRussian made systems and its targeting of U.S.-led military forces in \nSaudi Arabia. In August 2003, a weapons smuggler was arrested after \nagreeing to sell a Russian SA-18 to an undercover FBI agent posing as a \nMuslim extremist. At least 19 missiles have been launched against \ncoalition aircraft since the end of major combat operations in Iraq. In \nNovember 2002, an Israeli jetliner was fired upon seconds after takeoff \nin Mombasa, Kenya; al-Qaida is suspected. And, in May 2002, al-Qaida \nwas suspected of firing a shoulder-fired missile at U.S. military \naircraft near Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia.\n  That is why I am pleased that the Senate has accepted my amendment to \nensure that when countermeasures are placed on commercial aircraft, the \ncivil reserve air fleet receives first priority. This is a commonsense \namendment that will protect our flying public and our military \npersonnel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1845), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nFeinstein and Crapo be added as original cosponsors to amendment No. \n1864.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1864, As Modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I send amendment No. 1864, offered by \nSenator Domenici and others, to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Domenici, \n     for himself, Mr. Bond, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Crapo, and Mr. \n     Alexander, proposes an amendment numbered 1864, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require reports on the United States strategy for relief \n                  and reconstruction efforts in Iraq)\n\n       Insert where appropriate in the bill:\n       Sec.  . (a) Initial Report on Relief and Reconstruction.--\n     Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the President shall submit to Congress a report on the \n     United States strategy for activities related to post-\n     conflict security, humanitarian assistance, governance, and \n     reconstruction to be undertaken as a result of Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom. The report shall include information on the \n     following:\n       (1) The distribution of duties and responsibilities \n     regarding such activities among the agencies of the United \n     States Government, including the Department of State, the \n     United States Agency for International Development, and the \n     Department of Defense.\n       (2) A plan describing the roles and responsibilities of \n     foreign governments and international organizations, \n     including the United Nations, in carrying out such \n     activities.\n       (3) A strategy for coordinating such activities among the \n     United States Government, foreign governments, and \n     international organizations, including the United Nations.\n       (4) A strategy for distributing the responsibility for \n     paying costs associated with reconstruction activities in \n     Iraq among the United States Government, foreign governments, \n     and international organizations, including the United \n     Nations, and for actions to be taken by the President to \n     secure increased international participation in peacekeeping \n     and security efforts in Iraq.\n       (5) A comprehensive strategy for completing the \n     reconstruction of Iraq, estimated timelines for the \n     completion of significant reconstruction milestones, and \n     estimates for Iraqi oil production.\n       (b) Subsequent Reports on Relief and Reconstruction.--(1) \n     Not later than 60 days after the submittal of the report \n     required by subsection (a), and every 60 days thereafter \n     until all funds provided by this title are expended, the \n     President shall submit to Congress a report that includes \n     information as follows:\n       (A) A list of all activities undertaken related to \n     reconstruction in Iraq, and a corresponding list of the funds \n     obligated in connection with such activities, during the \n     preceding 60 days.\n       (B) A list of the significant activities related to \n     reconstruction in Iraq that the President anticipates \n     initiating during the ensuing 60-day period, including--\n       (i) the estimated cost of carrying out the proposed \n     activities; and\n       (ii) the source of the funds that will be used to pay such \n     costs.\n       (C) Updated strategies, objectives, and timelines if \n     significant changes are proposed regarding matters included \n     in the report required under subsection (a), or in any \n     previous report under this subsection.\n       (2) Each report under this subsection shall include \n     information on the following:\n       (A) The expenditures for, and progress made toward, the \n     restoration of basic services in Iraq such as water, \n     electricity, sewer, oil infrastructure, a national police \n     force, an Iraqi army, and judicial systems.\n       (B) The significant goals intended to be achieved by such \n     expenditures.\n       (C) The progress made toward securing increased \n     international participation in peacekeeping efforts and in \n     the economic and political reconstruction of Iraq.\n       (D) The progress made toward securing Iraqi borders.\n       (E) The progress made toward securing self-government for \n     the Iraqi people and the establishment of a democratically \n     elected government.\n       (F) The progress made in securing and eliminating munitions \n     caches, unexploded ordinance, and excess military equipment \n     in Iraq.\n       (G) The measures taken to protect United States troops \n     serving in Iraq.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment requires reporting on the \nreconstruction of Iraq. This amendment ensures congressional oversight \nfor the $20.3 billion portion of the supplemental bill designated for \nthe reconstruction of Iraq.\n  As I look at what is going on in Iraq, I see tremendous progress and \ngood that is taking place. Unfortunately, the media have not seen fit \nto report on these good things and the fact that our men and women \nthere are making life better for the Iraqi people.\n  But my amendment puts in place a way to measure that progress so as \nto clearly show the American people what we are doing. It requires that \nthe plan for reconstruction is regularly reported so Americans can \nplainly see that Iraq is moving toward independence and toward a day \nwhen our troops will come home.\n  I have been fortunate enough to talk to people in Iraq with firsthand \nknowledge of the situation on the ground. Based on my conversations \nwith these individuals, it seems to me there are a few critical \nelements that must be met in order to achieve the kinds of things we \nwant.\n  For example--we need to get the electricity working. We also need to \nget the water running. We need to get the oil pumping, and the police \ntrained. I believe improving these services is the key to a new civil \nsociety in Iraq, and I think Mr. Bremer is working very hard to make \nthem happen.\n  My amendment gives clarity for measuring the progress that is being \nmade in these areas because it calls for the reporting of specific \ntimelines and objectives relating to that progress.\n  In a word, this amendment ensures accountability--accountability \nthrough reporting requirements. And I would submit that these are \nsubstantially detailed reporting requirements and that they are fair \nrequirements.\n\n[[Page S12797]]\n\n  For example, my amendment contains provisions such as submission of a \n``master plan'' for reconstruction efforts within 60 days of enactment. \nAlso, it requires submission of subsequent reports every 60 days \nthereafter detailing how funds have been expended and how they will be \nexpended.\n  Furthermore, these reporting requirements cover many specific issues, \nsuch as a description of expenditures and the progress made in \nrestoring basic services such as water, electricity, sewer and oil \ninfrastructure; a description of the goals to be achieved by these \nexpenditures; a description of the roles of foreign governments and \ninternational organizations in the Iraq reconstruction efforts; and a \ndescription of the progress made toward securing Iraqi democracy.\n  This is a very fair amendment because it respects the Constitution by \ngiving the executive branch primacy in the area of foreign affairs \npolicymaking, while at the same time giving Congress appropriate \noversight of the funds used for implementing that policy. I also think \nthis is a very important amendment because it satisfies the concerns of \nmany Senators--especially in the area of submitting a clear plan that \nhas guideposts for measuring progress.\n  It is my hope that Senators will support this amendment that will \nensure funds are spent wisely and in a way that will hasten the day \nwhen our troops will come home.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for consideration of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is considered \nand agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1864), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1825\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I yield 3 minutes each to Senator Bond \nand Senator Mikulski concerning amendment No. 1825.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Missouri \nis recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of this \namendment on behalf of my colleague, Senator Mikulski, and a number of \nother colleagues. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Specter be added \nas a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. This amendment provides $1.3 billion in emergency funding \nfor VA medical care to address the medical care needs of returning \nservice members from Iraq and Afghanistan. I believe the $1.3 billion \nin emergency funding meets the criteria under section 502 of the budget \nresolution. This is consistent with the final figures approved in the \nbudget adopted. This meets the figures included in the original budget. \nUnfortunately, the Office of Management and Budget sent us a budget \nthat achieved these goals by increasing fees on veterans, and neither \nbody has shown any enthusiasm for that.\n  Under section 502, an expenditure may be designated an emergency if \nit meets five criteria: One, necessary, essential, or vital; two, \nsudden, quickly coming into being, and not building up over time; \nthree, an urgent, pressing, and compelling need requiring immediate \naction; four, unforeseen, unpredictable, and unanticipated; and five, \nnot permanent, temporary in nature. It is clear that this amendment \nmeets the five criteria due to the compelling, vital, and essential \nneeds of veterans who seek medical care services from the VA.\n  As I trust all of our colleagues know, the VA cannot currently keep \nup with the demand of the current veteran population. Tens of thousands \nof veterans have been told to wait at least 6 months. Even more \ndistressing is the fact that many of them have to wait up to 2 years to \nsee a doctor. That is unacceptable. If the VA cannot help those who are \nin the system, how will they help the veterans returning from \nAfghanistan and Iraq?\n  In the legislation before us today, we provided the funds that I \nthink are vitally needed to the Department of Defense to fight these \nwars and reconstruction funds to ensure that the peace is secure and we \nbring our troops home. I strongly support these funds, but I believe we \nmust ensure that when our troops do return home, the Government will be \nthere to treat their medical care needs. If we are willing to provide \nemergency funding to fight wars, we must be willing to provide \nemergency funding to meet the medical care needs to treat injuries and \nwounds suffered from the war.\n  In other words, we would have to ensure there is a continuum of care \nfor our service members from basic training to deployment to discharge.\n  Let me illustrate the urgent and pressing needs for these emergency \nfunds. According to a recent VA analysis, 15,813 service members who \nserved in Operation Iraqi Freedom have separated from military duty as \nof September 22, 2003. Among these service members, almost 2,000, or \n12.4 percent, had sought VA health care during 2003. I point out that \nthese numbers do not include those military men and women who are \nreturning from Afghanistan and other parts of the world fighting the \nwar on terrorism.\n  Every day in the news we hear the unfortunate and sad news of \nAmerican soldiers killed in Iraq, but as illustrated by the VA's \nanalysis and scores of news reports, there are thousands of service \nmembers who were fortunate to live but who were wounded in combat.\n  As reported in the October 1, 2003, edition of the USA Today: ``At \nleast seven times as many men and women have been wounded in battle'' \nas those killed in battle. As these wounded service members are \ndischarged from the military and confront new and challenging hardships \nin piecing together a new life, most of them will depend on the VA to \nmeet their needs.\n  According to the VA, some of our returning servicemen and women are \ncurrently being served through VA/DoD sharing agreements and others, \nsuch as Pvt Jessica Lynch, are being discharged and turning to VA for \nspecialized services, services that only the VA can provide not found \nin the private sector. This level of demand for VA services has not \nbeen foreseen or anticipated.\n  Further, we know that the overall demand for VA medical care is not \ngoing to lessen. We have already seen the VA medical care system being \noverwhelmed by the staggering increase in demand for its medical \nservices. Since 1996, the VA has seen a 54 percent in growth or 2 \nmillion patients in total users of the medical care system. Further, \nthe VA projects that its enrollments to grow by another 2 million \npatients from a current level of 7 million to 9 million in 2009.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to support these emergency funds. In a \ntime of war with thousands of injured troops returning from battle, it \nis clearly an emergency to include these funds. It is our moral \nresponsibility to ensure that we provide adequate resources to the VA \nto meet the vital medical needs of our veterans. If these emergency \nfunds are not included in this bill, the VA will have enormous \ndifficulties in treating veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan \ndue to the current backlog of veterans waiting for medical care. \nWithout these funds, those waiting veterans will wait longer for \nmedical care and the VA will be forced to deny medical care to another \n585,000 veterans. I cannot accept these outcomes. This is medical care \nthey have earned through risk of life and all too often at the cost of \ntheir limbs and their long-term health.\n  I ask my colleagues to think about our service members who have \nalready returned from service, about our service members who are \ncurrently serving, and about those who want to serve. If we do not \nprovide these funds, what kind of message does this send to those \ncurrently fighting overseas and those who will be sent overseas? I hope \nmy colleagues agree with me that we want to tell these men and women \nthat we will not turn our backs on them and that we will keep our \npromises to them. I urge your support on the Bond-Mikulski amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry to interrupt the Senator from Maryland. I ask \nconsent that the Senator from Vermont be recognized to speak for 1 \nminute following the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S12798]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Maryland is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise as an enthusiastic advocate of \nthe Bond-Mikulski VA medical care amendment. I ask unanimous consent \nthat Senator Debbie Stabenow be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, along with Senator Bond, I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment. It provides $1.3 billion for \nveterans medical care. It is necessary for three reasons: One, it will \ndeal with the growing long lines in which some of our veterans have to \nwait in order to see a doctor or a specialist. Second, it rejects the \nconcept of having to pay a membership fee to get veterans medical care \nif they are a category 7 or a category 8. Third, it also rejects the \nballooning copayments that were suggested by the administration.\n  First, in the administration's budget, the request was to charge \nveterans $250 a year to be able to pay their dues. Well, Senator Bond \nand I believe the veterans did pay their dues. They paid them at Iwo \nJima, Pork Chop Hill, the Mekong Delta, and now the burning sands of \nthe Iraqi desert. We are working on a bipartisan basis to reject these \nnew co-fees and these new toll charges. We need this amendment to \nensure that the VA can care for returning service members.\n  Under the legislation that was passed by this Congress, the law \nrequires the VA to provide 2 years of medical care for returning \nservice members. You bet we ought to do that. But if we are going to \npass the legislation, we should not only put it in the Federal law \nbooks, we have to put it in the Federal checkbook, and that is what \nBond-Mikulski does.\n  The VA has already treated 2,000 returning soldiers from the war, but \nthis VA system, with its wonderful doctors and nurses, is strained to \nthe limit. There are now many who are waiting for care. There are many \nwho ought to get care. They should not have to pay membership fees. \nAdopt Bond-Mikulski and keep the promises made to America's veterans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I believe that most Americans are very \naware of the human cost of the Iraq war and the significant toll it has \ntaken on the lives and health of many American military personnel. We \nall have anguished over the casualties and rejoiced in the moments of \nrelief, such as the rescue of Jessica Lynch. Americans, regardless of \ntheir views on the war, hung on every bit of news of her recovery, and \nwatched with fascination as she spoke her few but powerful words upon \nreturning home to West Virginia. We just assumed that the cost of her \nhealth care and rehabilitation would be covered by the U.S. Government. \nAfter all, that is only fair.\n  The system that is responsible for caring for wounded service members \nafter they are discharged is over-burdened and under-funded. The \nVeterans Administration health care system has been shortchanged for \nyears, with health care budgets falling well short of inflation. While \nthe Bush administration proposed a slight increase in funding this \nyear, it is still not enough to keep up with inflation. Vietnam \nVeterans of America has estimated that at expected appropriations \nlevels for this coming fiscal year, the VA health care system is $52 \nmillion short of the amount needed to implement existing VA programs \nand to keep pace with inflation since 1997. Every VA hospital has been \nforced to do more with less, to continuously reduce costs, year after \nyear, and to limit services to veterans. Long waiting lines have \ndeveloped at many VA centers, sometimes keeping veterans waiting as \nmuch as a year for an initial appointment. Due to inadequate funding, \nSecretary Principi, a strong advocate for veterans, has been forced to \ndeny an entire category of veterans treatment at VA hospitals.\n  I compliment my colleagues, Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski, for \ntheir efforts to address this funding shortfall. As the chair and \nranking member of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over \nappropriations for the Veterans Administration, they are well aware of \nthe urgency of the VA's needs. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of their \namendment to add $1.3 billion to this legislation specifically for VA \nhealth care. In drafting the VA's appropriations bill for the coming \nfiscal year, they identified this funding as urgently needed by the VA, \nand it is imperative that this funding be provided in this bill.\n  Our top priority must be caring for the men and women who answered \nthe President's call and stepped into harm's way. They must be taken \ncare of. If the Federal Government has any obligation to its people, is \nnot its first obligation to care for the wounds of its soldiers?\n  Every day we hear of more Americans injured in Iraq. I cringe for \nthem and for their families. It is a great burden that most of them \nwill carry all their lives. I also fear that in the years to come, we \nwill learn that the harsh conditions in Iraq today have in more subtle \nways damaged the health of our troops stationed there. The burden of \nstudying these problems and caring for these soldiers will fall on the \nVA health care system.\n  I, for one, cannot stand by while the VA is starved for resources. \nThis is the time to act. I urge all my colleagues to support the Bond-\nMikulski amendment to add $1.3 billion to care for America's veterans.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Madam President, as ranking member on the \nCommittee on Veterans Affairs, I rise to lend my support to the Bond-\nMikulski amendment for an additional $1.3 billion for VA health care. I \nthink it is abundantly clear to everyone in the chamber that the VA \nhealth care system is in dire need of additional and significant \nresources.\n  The administration has extolled the proposed VA budget as a historic \nincrease, when in reality this type of increase is beyond what anyone \ncould expect in the current economic climate. It has been touted as an \nincrease of 7 to 11 percent over last year's budget, depending on who \nis speaking.\n  When you look at the budget proposed by the administration, a \ndifferent story comes to light. Once the new copayments and fees are \nstripped away, the theoretical management efficiencies discounted for \nwhat they really are, and the accounting tricks are identified, we are \nleft with an appropriation that barely keeps pace with inflation.\n  As we shape VA's budget for the next year, we must move beyond \nhopeful rhetoric and quack accounting to take an honest assessment of \nthe needs of veterans.\n  We all know--and many of us have mentioned--that more than 100,000 \nveterans must wait more than 6 months to see VA physicians. While VA's \ncommitted professionals are struggling to handle the increased patient \nload, they are doing it without a corresponding increase in resources. \nThis must be rectified.\n  When we debated and voted on the first war supplemental bill in \nApril, I secured additional health dollars for VA to care for \nservicemembers returning from the Gulf. This money was simply a start, \nsince VA will continue to see troops coming home and seeking health \ncare in the coming years. If we can afford to send tens of billions of \ndollars overseas to support the troops while in conflict, how can we \npossibly not fully fund their care when they return home?\n  Veterans groups know that the VA health care system is in crisis--and \nso do both the House and Senate. Congress passed a $3.1 billion \nincrease in the budget resolution, meeting the mark for VA health care \ndetermined by experts in the veterans community. Yet, it has proven \ndifficult to secure these funds for VA.\n  It is important to note that there is still a $300 million deficit in \nveterans health spending for next year. While the Bond-Mikulski \namendment ensures that a large portion of the money will be there for \nveterans without the subjective emergency spending designation, it is \njust a first step. We need to finish the job and make sure that health \ncare is fully funded for our veterans.\n  I am proud to lend my name to this amendment. Indeed, my good friend \nJay Rockefeller and I were planning on offering a similar one to the VA \nspending bill. I urge all my colleagues\n\n[[Page S12799]]\n\nto support this amendment--we owe our servicemembers and veterans \nnothing less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, is amendment No. 1825 before the Senate \nnow?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We have held this until last because of the budget \nproblem involved. This takes $1.3 billion from the amount that has \nalready been allocated to the VA/HUD Subcommittee that causes \nconsiderable consternation as to what we are going to do with it in the \nfuture. We all admit that is the problem. We all know there is a severe \nproblem for veterans to deal with medical care, and we look forward to \nworking with the Senators from Missouri and Maryland to work out this \nproblem.\n  To the best of my knowledge, we now have one remaining amendment to \nbe debated, and that is the amendment of Senator Brownback.\n  I ask that amendment 1825 be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1825.\n  The amendment (No. 1825) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Could we make the inquiry as to who intends to speak \nafter the Brownback amendment so Members might know how long it will be \nbefore the vote on final passage?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, through you to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alaska, Senator Byrd wishes to speak for not to exceed 25 minutes. \nSenator Graham, as I indicated, will make a very brief statement, a \nmatter of a couple of minutes, and then give his full statement after \npassage of the bill.\n  Senator Leahy, we will talk to him to find out what is his desire.\n  Senator Dayton desires to speak after the vote.\n  At this stage, I ask unanimous consent Senator Byrd be recognized for \nnot to exceed 25 minutes. We will work on the others.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We have no objection to that, but I do not want to \nindicate--we have not had any requests yet from this side. We will have \nto determine that. But it will mean a vote on final passage will start \nsometime after 4 o'clock.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1885, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 1885, as \nmodified, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1885, as modified.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To reduce the amount appropriated for reconstruction in Iraq \nby $600,000,000 and to increase the amount available to the Iraqi Civil \n Defense Corps by $50,000,000, the amount available for Afghanistan by \n          $400,000,000, and the amount available for Liberia)\n\n       On page 38, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following \n     new sections:\n       Sec. 2313. (a) The total amount appropriated in chapter 2 \n     of this title under the subheading ``Iraq Relief and \n     Reconstruction Fund'' under the heading ``OTHER BILATERAL \n     ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO THE PRESIDENT'', is \n     hereby reduced by $600,000,000.\n       (b) Of the total amount appropriated in chapter 2 of this \n     title under the subheading referred to in subsection (a), \n     $5,186,000,000 shall be available for security, including \n     public safety requirements, national security, and justice, \n     of which not less than $126,000,000, shall be available for \n     the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps.\n       Sec. 2314. None of the funds appropriated by this Act may \n     be used to fund the following:\n       (1) Solid waste management in Iraq.\n       (2) WiFi capabilities for IPTC in Iraq.\n       (3) Housing in Iraq.\n       (4) Market-oriented specialized training for Iraqis.\n       (5) Catch-up business training for Iraqis.\n       (6) Development or construction of the Abu Gharaib \n     Memorial, or any similar memorial.\n       (7) The Athletes Committee in Iraq, including any \n     conference or memorial that addresses atrocities committed \n     against Iraqi athletes.\n       Sec. 2315. Not more than $450,000,000 of the funds \n     appropriated by this Act may be used to fund petroleum \n     product imports.\n       On page 28, beginning on line 18, strike ``$422,000,000'' \n     and all that follows through ``Provided,'' on line 20 and \n     insert ``$822,000,000, to remain available until September \n     30, 2005, for accelerated assistance for Afghanistan, of \n     which not less than $60,000,000 shall be available for \n     disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration; $50,000,000 \n     shall be available for a venture capital fund to promote \n     development of the private sector; $150,000,000 shall be \n     available for accelerated funding for the National Army of \n     Afghanistan; $60,000,000 shall be available for the \n     Government of Afghanistan to provide security and minimal \n     services, collect revenue, and pay salaries for military and \n     civilian officials; $15,000,000 shall be available for power \n     generation projects; $35,000,000 shall be made available for \n     additional activities that are specifically targeted to \n     advancing the social, economic, and political rights and \n     opportunities of women; $25,000,000 shall be made available \n     for emergency food, fuel, clothing and shelter materials for \n     Afghans who are internally displaced; and $5,000,000 shall be \n     available for natural resources assessments: Provided,''.\n       On page 29, line 17, strike ``$100,000,000'' and all that \n     follows through ``Provided'' beginning on line 17, and insert \n     ``$250,000,000, to remain available until expended, of which \n     not less than $200,000,000 shall be made available for \n     humanitarian relief and reconstruction activities in Liberia: \n     Provided, That funds appropriated under this heading shall be \n     made available for Sudan: Provided further,''.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, this is a very simple, \nstraightforward amendment. It does some of what the House has done. I \nwill explain this briefly because I think most of the people are \nknowledgeable of these particular issues.\n  What we do with this particular amendment is rescind $600 million \nfrom nonsecurity accounts--none of the security money, all nonsecurity \ngrant funding--that is not immediately necessary for reconstruction. It \nprohibits projects such as memorials, athletic committees, solid waste \nremoval, catchup business training, telephone/postal company, housing. \nIt would limit some of the petroleum product imports. That is where we \ntake the funds from.\n  The resulting savings would be reallocated to a couple of areas--\nenhancing security efforts in Iraq, where we would put $50 million \nabove the President's request for the Iraq civil defense corps. It \nwould, too, bolster funding for reconstruction of Afghanistan. There we \nput $400 million into Afghanistan. We take the funds there and \nreallocate them into Afghanistan, into a series of areas that are high \npriority.\n  I think it is important to remember we invaded and fought to remove \nterrorists in Afghanistan. Afghanistan is somewhat the forgotten child. \nWe have not put nearly the resources forward that resource-poor country \nneeds. This is in line with some of the thinking and the actions the \nHouse took.\n  We also put a portion of resources into the United States Emergency \nFund For Complex Foreign Crises, increasing this account to $250 \nmillion--80 percent of which, or $200 million, will go to Liberia, \nearmarked for humanitarian relief and reconstruction in Liberia. I \nthink colleagues are well familiar with what is taking place in that \ncountry.\n  So we have taken $600 million from nonsecurity accounts, key areas a \nlot of people identified as areas that may be useful to fund but not \nhigh priorities, not things into which we need to put these emergency \nfunds, and shifted them into Afghanistan, Liberia, and $50 million to \nincrease the civil defense in Iraq. This is what is going to help us \nbring our troops home faster, the faster we stand up an Iraqi military \nand paramilitary force.\n  It is pretty straightforward. This is a Brownback-Leahy amendment. It \nis a bipartisan amendment a number of my colleagues are supporting. I \nask for favorable consideration.\n  I do ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  The Senator has asked for the yeas and nays. Is there a sufficient \nsecond?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S12800]]\n\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, $600 million from Iraqi reconstruction \nfunds? The Senate has just acted along with the House to cut \napproximately $1.6 billion. This amendment also prohibits funds \nappropriated in this act from being used for solid waste management, \nhousing, and other items.\n  Some of the solid waste management involves contaminated materials, \nmaterials with unexpended ordnance, all sorts of hazards. We have \nalready reduced this amount, as I said, by $1.6 billion. Any further \nreduction, as far as I am concerned, would further weaken the \nassistance we are trying to give the Iraqi people in order to bring our \npeople home.\n\n  I move to table this amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table can only be made after the \nsponsor's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I yield a minute to my colleague from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I urge this amendment be adopted. I \nthink Senator Brownback has been very careful in what he has taken out \nof the measure. It does mirror pretty much what the House did. The \nlion's share of the $20 billion is going to be there. But I think \nCongress has the right to prioritize, and I think these are better \npriorities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Do I have any time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 4 minutes 20 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I merely point out we voted now on this \nsubject, further reductions, reconciliation moneys, six times today. We \nhave finally agreed to reduce by $1.6 billion, as much as the House \nhas. I think this would be a further redundant reduction and I urge the \nmotion to table.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Has the Senator yielded the remainder of his time?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Senator Leahy is a cosponsor. I wanted to offer a \nminute. I just saw Senator Leahy step inside.\n  I do have one other comment I would like to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I think these are very carefully \ncrafted areas we are going at. We have looked through this bill. I have \nworked in this region for some period of time. So I think it is \nimportant we consider higher priorities and we really think about what \nwe are doing in shifting some of these resources. It is important to \ntake from lower priority areas in Iraq which a lot of people \nidentified, and put in higher priority areas.\n  With that, I yield a minute to my colleague from Vermont, who is a \ncosponsor of this particular amendment, if he seeks recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I will not add to what the Senator from \nKansas has said other than to say I do support this amendment. I think \nit shows the priorities that have to be met by the United States, \npriorities we sometimes overlook.\n  I commend the Senator for his support of this. I hope the Senate will \npass it overwhelmingly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, has the vote started?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table has not yet been formally \nmade.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if I could direct this question to the \nSenator from Alaska, does the Senator wish to table or just an up-or-\ndown vote?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I was willing to agree to go ahead with the Senator's \nspeech, if he wishes to do that.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Senator from Alaska has been gracious \nenough to allow the Senator from West Virginia to proceed. Under the \nprevious order, he is to be recognized to speak up to 25 minutes on \nthis bill. I ask that time begin now.\n  Mr. STEVENS. So there is no misunderstanding, I make the motion to \ntable this amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask that be set aside so the Senator may speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, and I also thank the \ndistinguished Democratic whip for their courtesies.\n  Madam President, in 1837, Danish author Hans Christian Andersen wrote \na wonderful fairytale which he titled ``The Emperor's New Clothes.'' It \nmay be the very first example of the power of political correctness. It \nis the story of a ruler of a distant land who was so enamored of his \nappearance and his clothing that he had a different suit for every hour \nof the day.\n  One day two rogues arrived in town, claiming to be gifted weavers. \nThey convinced the emperor that they could weave the most wonderful \ncloth, which had a magical property. The clothes were only visible to \nthose who were completely pure in heart and spirit.\n  The emperor was impressed and ordered the weavers to begin work \nimmediately. The rogues, who had a deep understanding of human nature, \nbegan to feign work on empty looms.\n  Minister after minister went to view the new clothes and all came \nback exhorting the beauty of the cloth on the looms even though none of \nthem could see a thing.\n  Finally a grand procession was planned for the emperor to display his \nnew finery. The emperor went to view his clothes and was shocked to see \nabsolutely nothing, but he pretended to admire the fabulous cloth, \ninspect the clothes with awe, and, after disrobing, go through the \nmotions of carefully putting on a suit of the new garments.\n  Under a royal canopy the emperor appeared to the admiring throng of \nhis people--all of whom cheered and clapped because they all knew the \nrogue weavers' tale and did not want to be seen as less than pure of \nheart.\n  But, the bubble burst when an innocent child loudly exclaimed, for \nthe whole kingdom to hear, that the emperor had nothing on at all. He \nhad no clothes.\n  That tale seems to me very like the way this Nation was led to war.\n  We were told that we were threatened by weapons of mass destruction \nin Iraq, but they have not been seen.\n  We were told that throngs of Iraqis would welcome our troops as \nliberators. They have not been seen as liberators but as occupiers.\n  We were told that the throngs of Iraqis would welcome our troops with \nflowers, but no throngs or flowers appeared.\n  We were led to believe that Saddam Hussein was connected to the \nattack on the twin towers and the Pentagon, but no evidence to that \neffect has ever been produced.\n  We were told in 16 words that Saddam Hussein tried to buy ``yellow \ncake'' from Africa for production of nuclear weapons, but the story has \nturned into empty air.\n  We were frightened with visions of mushroom clouds, but they turned \nout to be only vapors of the mind.\n  We were told that major combat was over but 101--as of October 17--\nAmericans have died in combat since that proclamation from the deck of \nan aircraft carrier by our very own emperor in his new clothes.\n  Our emperor says that we are not occupiers, yet we show no \ninclination to relinquish the country of Iraq to its people.\n  Those who have dared to expose the nakedness of the administration's \npolicies in Iraq have been subjected to\n\n[[Page S12801]]\n\nscorn. Those who have noticed the elephant in the room--that is, the \nfact that this war was based on falsehoods--have had our patriotism \nquestioned. Those who have spoken aloud the thought shared by hundreds \nof thousands of military families across this country, that our troops \nshould return quickly and safely from the dangers half a world away, \nhave been accused of cowardice. We have then seen the untruths, the \ndissembling, the fabrication, the misleading inferences surrounding \nthis rush to war in Iraq wrapped quickly in the flag.\n  The right to ask questions, debate, and dissent is under attack. The \ndrums of war are beaten ever louder in an attempt to drown out those \nwho speak of our predicament in stark terms.\n  Even in the Senate, our history and tradition of being the world's \ngreatest deliberative body is being snubbed. This huge spending bill--\n$87 billion--has been rushed through this Chamber in just 1 month. \nThere were just three open hearings by the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee on $87 billion--$87 for every minute since Jesus Christ was \nborn--$87 billion without a single outside witness called to challenge \nthe administration's line.\n  Ambassador Bremer went so far as to refuse to return to the \nAppropriations Committee to answer additional questions because, and I \nquote: ``I don't have time. I'm completely booked, and I have to get \nback to Baghdad to my duties.''\n  Despite this callous stiff-arm of the Senate and its duties to ask \nquestions in order to represent the American people, few dared to voice \ntheir opposition to rushing this bill through these halls of Congress. \nPerhaps they were intimidated by the false claims that our troops are \nin immediate need of more funds.\n  But the time has come for the sheep-like political corrections which \nhas cowed Members of this Senate to come to an end.\n  The emperor has no clothes. This entire adventure in Iraq has been \nbased on propaganda and manipulation. Eighty-seven billion dollars is \ntoo much to pay for the continuation of a war based on falsehoods.\n  Taking the nation to war based on misleading rhetoric and hyped \nintelligence is a travesty and a tragedy. It is the most cynical of all \ncynical acts. It is dangerous to manipulate the truth. It is dangerous \nbecause once having lied, it is difficult to ever be believed again. \nHaving misled the American people and stampeded them to war, this \nadministration must now attempt to sustain a policy predicated on \nfalsehoods. The President asks for billions from those same citizens \nwho knew that they were misled about the need to go to war. We \nmisinformed and insulted our friends and allies and now this \nadministration is having more than a little trouble getting help from \nthe international community. It is perilous to mislead.\n  The single-minded obsession of this administration to now make sense \nof the chaos in Iraq, and the continuing propaganda which emanates from \nthe White House painting Iraq as the geographical center of terrorism \nis distracting our attention from Afghanistan and the 60 other \ncountries in the world where terrorists hide. It is sapping resources \nwhich could be used to make us safer from terrorists on our own shores. \nThe body armor for our own citizens still has many, many chinks. Have \nwe forgotten that the most horrific terror attacks in history occurred \nright here at home? Yet, this administration turns back money for \nhomeland security, while the President pours billions into security for \nIraq. I am powerless to understand or explain such a policy.\n  I have tried mightily to improve this bill. I twice tried to separate \nthe reconstruction money in this bill, so that those dollars could be \nconsidered separately from the military spending. I offered an \namendment to force the administration to craft a plan to get other \nnations to assist the troops and formulate a plan to get the U.N. in, \nand the U.S. out, of Iraq. Twice I tried to rid the bill of expansive, \nflexible authorities that turn this $87 billion into a blank check. The \nAmerican people should understand we provide more foreign aid for Iraq \nin this bill, $20.3 billion, than we provide for the rest of the world.\n\n  I attempted to remove from this bill billions of dollars in wasteful \nprograms and divert those funds to better use, but at every turn my \nefforts were thwarted by the vapid argument that we must all support \nthe requests of the Commander in Chief.\n  I cannot stand by and continue to watch our grandchildren and their \nchildren become increasingly burdened by the billions of dollars that \nfly out of the Treasury for a war and a policy based largely on \npropaganda, hype, and prevarication. We are borrowing $87 billion to \nfinance this adventure in Iraq. The President is asking this Senator to \npay for this war with increased debt, a debt that will have to be paid \nby our children and by those same troops who are currently fighting \nthis war.\n  I cannot support outlandish tax cuts that plunge our country into \npotentially disastrous debt while our troops are fighting and dying--\nfour more died within the last 24 hours--in a war that the White House \nchose to begin.\n  I cannot support the continuation of a policy that unwisely ties down \n150,000 American troops for the foreseeable future with no end in \nsight.\n  I cannot support a President who refuses to authorize the reasonable \nchange in course that would bring traditional allies to our side in \nIraq.\n  I cannot support the politics of zeal and ``might makes right'' that \ncreated the new American arrogance and unilateralism that passes for \nforeign policy in this administration.\n  I cannot support this foolish manifestation of the dangerous and \ndestabilizing doctrine of preemption that changes the image of America \ninto that of a reckless bully.\n  The emperor has no clothes and our former allies around the world \nwere the first to loudly observe it. I shall vote against this bill \nbecause I cannot support a policy based on prevarication. I cannot \nsupport doling out 87 billion additional of our hard-earned tax dollars \nwhen I have so many doubts about the wisdom of its use.\n  I began my remarks with a fairytale. I shall close my remarks with a \nhorror story in the form of a quote from the book ``Nuremberg \nDiaries,'' written by G.M. Gilbert, in which the author interviews \nHerman Gehrig:\n\n       We got around to the subject of war again and I said that, \n     contrary to his attitude, I did not think that the common \n     people are very thankful for leaders who bring them war and \n     destruction.\n       . . . But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who \n     determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag \n     the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist \n     dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.\n       There is one difference. . . . In a democracy the people \n     have some say in the matter through their elected \n     representatives, and in the United States only Congress can \n     declare wars.\n       Oh, that is all well and good, but voice or no voice, the \n     people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. \n     That is easy. All you have to do is tell them that they are \n     being attacked and denounce the pacifists for a lack of \n     patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the \n     same way in any country.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator's speech demonstrates the \ngreatness of our country in terms of freedom of speech. I could not be \nmore proud to stand where I am standing today to support our President \nand to support our people in uniform and those who are part of this \nauthority trying to restore freedom and democracy in Iraq.\n  Sometimes I wonder how I ended up here. I have no real background \nthat ever gave me thought I would ever be here. But when I hear \nspeeches like that, I know why I am here. I believe in this President. \nI believe in this military.\n  I voted for this intervention. The Senator from West Virginia did \nnot. I am urging the Senate to support this bill, $66 billion for our \nmen and women in uniform and $20.3 billion--they have taken $1.6 \nbillion out--but nearly $20 billion for the operation to try to assure \nthere is a new government in Iraq, Iraq committed to freedom and \ncommitted to work with the United States in trying to bring peace to \nthat region.\n  If there is a volatile part of the world, it is the Middle East. We \nhave been involved in strife there longer than I can remember. I \nremember when President Eisenhower sent troops into\n\n[[Page S12802]]\n\nLebanon. This has been a thorn in our side as long as I have been \ninvolved in government. That is over 50 years.\n  Again, the Senator is entitled to his point of view. I saw those \nintelligence reports. I believe there were weapons of mass destruction \nbeing thought of and being prepared in Iraq. I believe they had \nchemical weapons. I believe they were trying to buy uranium and sought \na new weapons program as they did before the Iraqis destroyed that \nfirst program with their famous raid on Iran which was 15 years ago. I \ndon't understand people who say this was a falsehood. Think of the \nyoung men and women in Iraq. They are watching this program. They get \nit on C-PAN. They get it on the Internet. Think of what they are \nthinking when a Senator says they are over there because of a \nfalsehood, because the President of the United States lied. I don't \nbelieve he lied. I believe he told the truth.\n  I believe he is now on an important mission around the world. I have \nnever heard a President criticized so much when he was overseas as this \nPresident has been criticized. He is on a mission to China. He is on a \nmission to many places in the Pacific. I believe the Senate should vote \ntoday in support of this bill.\n  Those who vote against this bill will be voting against supporting \nour men and women in the field. They are still in harm's way. That is \none point on which I agree. There are too many people still being \nkilled in Iraq, but they are being killed because there is too much \nconfusion over there. There is not the ability to bring about the \ncontrol we should have. We need a civilian force from the Iraqis. We \nneed to stand up a new army for the Iraqis as we are trying to do in \nAfghanistan. This is an important move of the United States, a move to \nestablish freedom in the Middle East.\n  We are dependent upon oil now. I wonder how many know that within 10 \nyears we will be dependent upon Qatar for liquefied natural gas. They \nhave 1,000 times the amount of natural gas we have in our State of \nAlaska, and we have half the natural gas in the United States. That \nregion of the world will be important to the United States for 50 to \n100 years from now. Our future depends upon having people there who \nunderstand freedom, who seek freedom, who seek stability through \ngovernmental control and are willing to make agreements and keep them \nand not willing to build up armaments such as Saddam Hussein did. He \nwas a threat not only to that part of the world, he was a threat to the \nwhole world. I said I believed he was a new Hitler, and he would have \nbeen a new Hitler.\n  I urge the Senate to vote for this bill, to vote for it and vote to \nsupport the men and women in uniform who have fought the war we asked \nthem to fight.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 8\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. May I say to the distinguished Senator from Alaska that he \nholds no monopoly on the support for the troops. I was supporting \nAmerican troops before the Senator from Alaska ever came to Washington. \nI have been supporting the American troops for over 50 years.\n  And let the Record not stand with the Senator's words, if I \ninterpreted them correctly, that those who vote against this bill are \nvoting against the troops. I defy that statement. I defy that \nstatement, and I hurl it back into the teeth of the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  I support the troops. I would say that every Senator here, regardless \nof how he or she votes, supports the troops. So do not throw that old \ncanard over here, over this way.\n  I am sorry that the Senator from Alaska takes that view. I thought \neach of us could have our own viewpoint here without being charged with \nnot supporting the troops. I regret the Senator from Alaska takes this \nview.\n  I am sure that there are a lot of the American people out there--\nmillions of them--for whom I speak and for whom those who vote against \nthis bill today speak who do not believe that this war was justified, \nwho do not believe in the doctrine of preemption, who do not believe \nthat there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. They have not been \nfound yet.\n  So, Mr. President, I close by congratulating those Senators who have \nthe courage to speak their will, to stand up for their own consciences, \nand who speak for those soldiers, men and women, who are in Iraq today \nwho did not ask to go there but who feel that those of us who speak our \nwill speak for them and who do not support the doctrine of preemption.\n  Fie on that doctrine of preemption! Fie on it! Here we have an \nAmerica that has invaded another country that did not invade our \ncountry, that did not attack us. That is a dangerous doctrine. Those \nwho vote against this bill are voting against that doctrine. So do not \nbe ashamed of it.\n  I close with the words written on a statue to Benjamin Hill that \nstands in Atlanta, GA:\n\n       Who saves his country, saves himself, saves all things, and \n     all things saved do bless him! Who lets his country die, lets \n     all things die, dies himself ignobly, and all things dying \n     curse him!\n\n  Vote to save your country, I say to my colleagues. Vote to save your \ncountry. I was not brought here by any Commander in Chief. No Commander \nin Chief brought me here, and no Commander in Chief is going to send me \nhome.\n  My first and last stand by which I live and by which I hope to die is \nthis Constitution of the United States. It says I have a right, and the \nmen and women of this Chamber have a duty, to speak the people's will.\n  There are millions of people out there, millions of men and women, \nthere are many men and women in Iraq who believe that we who vote \nagainst this bill today speak for them. I am not ashamed to do it. I am \nproud to do it.\n  Yes, I voted against sending American troops into Iraq. Yes, I am one \nof the 23. And if I had it to do over again, I would vote the same way \nagain--10 times, 10 times 100 against this doctrine, this doctrine of \npreemptive strikes.\n  Fie on that doctrine! Fie on it!\n  Now, if the Senator from Alaska wishes to talk further, I will be \nglad to hear him.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, at the conclusion of \nSenator Byrd's time, a vote was to take place on the motion to table \nthe Brownback amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there is still my minute and a half left \nof time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Alaska has \nexpired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, is there 2 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thought I had a minute and a half left \non Brownback.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has no time remaining.\n  The Senator from West Virginia has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. Does the Senator wish for me to yield him 2 minutes?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1885, As Modified\n\n  Mr. President, I want to speak on the Brownback amendment. It will be \nthe last signal that we send before final passage.\n  My colleagues should know that it diverts $450 million out of Iraq \ninto what are largely unspecified projects. It ignores the fact that \nthe reconstruction of Iraq is as vital as is the defense of Iraq and \nthe military portion of it.\n  Basically, the sponsor of the amendment has decided what is necessary \nand what is not necessary to be allocated to Iraq, whether it be \nhousing or other programs that have been deemed necessary by the \nadministration, and decided that $450 million would go to Afghanistan \nand to Liberia.\n  So the fact is, this is another micromanagement amendment, point No. \n1. No. 2, it ignores the fact that the reconstruction of Iraq is \nequally as vital as the military side of it.\n  There are some provisions that I do not particularly agree with, but \nthe fact is, these have been scrutinized, and I believe it would be a \nterrible mistake to divert this money from the\n\n[[Page S12803]]\n\nprojects for which they are intended. The Appropriations Committee had \nhearings and discussion with the administration and with Ambassador \nBremer.\n  This amendment is not very much different from the Byrd-Biden \namendment which the Senate decided not to accept some time ago.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the part of my colleagues on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on the \namendment.\n  The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request. I ask \nunanimous consent that there be no speeches prior to the final passage \nvote, except for a 2-minute speech by the Senator from Florida, Mr. \nGraham. All other speeches would come after final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table Brownback \namendment No. 1885, as modified. The yeas and nays have been ordered. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nAlexander) and the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Craig) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from \nTennessee (Mr. Alexander) would vote ``yes''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 55, nays 43, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 399 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--55\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--43\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Brownback\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hutchison\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Sununu\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Alexander\n     Craig\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Florida has 2 minutes. After that 2 \nminutes, there will be a vote on final passage. After the vote, there \nwill be some speeches concerning the bill. This next vote will be the \nfinal vote on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nFlorida will be recognized for 2 minutes.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, just for the information of our colleagues, \non Monday we will have a vote in the afternoon around 5 or 5:30. I am \ndiscussing with the Democratic leader what we will be doing on Monday. \nWe initially talked about bringing forward Healthy Forests, but I think \nwe will not be doing that at this juncture. We will have an \nannouncement later about that.\n  I know a lot of people will be leaving after the vote, so for their \ninformation, we will be having one vote I know for sure on Monday \naround 5 or 5:30. We will pin that down later tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have conferred with the distinguished \nchairman from Alaska and he has no objection. I hope no one else does. \nI ask unanimous consent that Senator Leahy be the first speaker after \nthe final vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, it is my intention to vote no on final passage of this \nlegislation. I am deeply concerned about the implications of this $87 \nbillion expenditure on domestic fiscal issues, such as the enormous \naddition this will make to an already enormous deficit this fiscal year \nand the effect this will have on pursuit of important priorities within \nthe United States of America.\n  My fundamental reason for voting against this is that I think we have \ntwo choices: We can either continue to go it alone in Iraq, or we can \nseriously internationalize this occupation and reconstruction. By \nseriously, I mean something beyond the words of the U.N. resolution \nthat was passed yesterday and the reality of troops on the ground and \ndollars in the Treasury for reconstruction.\n  I believe this $87 billion blank check appropriation removes whatever \nincentive this administration may have had to negotiate seriously a \nburden sharing and a decisionmaking sharing with those countries which \nhave the capability of providing real support in Iraq.\n  Because I believe the effect of the $87 billion appropriations will \nbe to make our troops less secure, more exposed to danger without any \nexit strategy, I will vote no.\n  At an appropriate time after this vote, I am going to ask recognition \nto give a fuller statement of my position.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on the \nengrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n\n\n                        afghan women's programs\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask the Chairman, as you know, late last night a very \nimportant amendment regarding funding for Afghan women's programs \npreviously authorized by the Afghanistan Freedom Act of 2002 was \naccepted in the House version of this bill. The amendment was \nintroduced by Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney of New York.\n  I know you share my concerns about the treatment of women in \nAfghanistan. And as we discussed earlier today, I have agreed not to \noffer my amendment, which was similar to the one accepted in the House \nbill, with the understanding that you will support this issue in \nconference.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am aware of the House amendment. I appreciate your \ninterests in this area and will work with my colleagues in conference \nto support funding for women's programs in Afghanistan.\n  Mr. BYRD. I would like to echo Chairman Stevens' remarks and thank \nthe Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, for bringing this issue \nbefore the Senate.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chairman and Senator Byrd.\n\n\n                      usna hurricane isabel damage\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I have introduced an amendment to \nprovide for recovery of the United States Naval Academy from damage \ncaused by Hurricane Isabel. I appreciate Senators Cochran, Sarbanes, \nand McCain cosponsoring this amendment. The four of us serve on the \nU.S. Naval Academy's Board of Visitors. We share a commitment to this \noutstanding institution to educate and develop America's future \nmilitary leaders.\n  On September 18, Hurricane Isabel struck the eastern seaboard. It was \none of the worst storms in the last 100 years. Isabel left some \nMarylanders homeless and most Marylanders without electricity. From \nBowley's Quarters to Shadyside, the storm surge caused by Isabel \nflooded homes and businesses. I appreciate the help that FEMA has \nprovided to so many of my constituents in their time of need.\n  The U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD was one of the places most \ndevastated by Hurricane Isabel. Over 8 feet of water surged through \nBancroft Hall, where the midshipmen live, as well as the kitchens and \ndining hall where they eat. Classroom and laboratory facilities were \nflooded, leaving them unusable.\n\n[[Page S12804]]\n\n  I went to Annapolis to see the damage with the new Naval Academy \nSuperintendent, ADM Rod Rempt. Bancroft Hall still had several feet of \nstanding water. A few midshipmen were boating across the yard. Boats \nand debris littered the fields. Labs were under water. The chiller and \nelectrical systems were flooded. Mold and rot was beginning to set in, \ndespite great efforts to contain the damage.\n  The U.S. Naval Academy was not shut down by a storm. Classes are \nbeing held on a barge tied up on the Severn River. But we must get the \nNaval Academy repaired and restored. As the Senior Senator from \nVirginia has pointed out, the military can't turn to FEMA, they have to \nturn to Congress.\n  I joined with Senator Warner and others in offering an amendment \nwhich provides $500 million to address storm damage to military and \nNASA facilities. I believe that amendment covers what I intended with \nmy amendment. The Warner amendment was accepted last night. The funds \nshould be sufficient to provide the Navy Operations and Maintenance and \nMilitary Construction funding needed to make the Naval Academy whole. I \nwould appreciate the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, and the former Secretary of the Navy, confirming that that \nwas his intent in offering his amendment. But first I would yield to \none of the Naval Academy's distinguished alumni, the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I share Senator Mikulski's commitment to \nthe U.S. Naval Academy, and I greatly appreciate her outstanding \nleadership in addressing all matters that concern the health and \nwelfare of midshipmen, especially in this matter of the serious damage \nwhich occurred at the Academy. I join her in seeking assurances from \nthe Appropriations Committee and the Department of Defense that the \nfunding provided by Chairman Warner's Amendment will include funding to \nfully meet the needs of the Naval Academy to recover from Hurricane \nIsabel. Admiral Rempt, the Superintendent of the Naval Academy, and \nMullen, the Vice Chief of Naval Operations, are still determining the \nextent of the damage and its total costs caused by the hurricane. \nAccording to ADMs Rempt and Mullen, there may be additional resources \nthat may be required to relocate the Chiller Plant which provides \ncritical heating and air conditioning and was seriously damaged by the \nfloods from Hurricane Isabel. I thank Senator Mikulski for her \nleadership in this matter.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Mikulski for joining with \nme in offering the amendment to address the damage done by Hurricane \nIsabel to military facilities, and for her help in getting that \namendment adopted. I can assure you that I intend the needs of the U.S. \nNaval Academy and all other military facilities damaged by the storm to \nbe fully met from the funds provided by that amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The House also provides funding in its bill to address \nHurricane Isabel's damage to military facilities. I would appreciate \nassurances that the conferees will work to ensure that the needs of the \nU.S. Naval Academy will be funded as this supplemental bill goes to \nconference.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am fully in agreement with the Senator from Maryland on \nthis issue. I look forward to working in conference so that the needs \nof the U.S. Naval Academy to recover from Hurricane Isabel are fully \nfunded.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the emergency \nsupplemental spending bill before us that will give our troops the \nresources they need to do their jobs; hold the President more \naccountable for his postwar plan; and help the Iraqi people get back on \ntheir feet.\n  I believe that the Iraqi people very much deserve U.S. assistance \ngetting their country back on its feet. It is for this reason that I am \nsupporting funding in this supplemental appropriations bill for Iraqi \nreconstruction.\n  However, I am very concerned that the administration does not have a \nclear, comprehensive and convincing plan to do this.\n  It is for this reason that I have strongly opposed providing the Bush \nadministration with a blank check in the expenditure of funds in this \nsupplemental.\n  Instead, this supplemental bill includes a broad set of reports and \noversight mechanisms, including:\n  A permanent inspector general charged with overseeing the Coalition \nProvisional Authority on its operations and financial transactions.\n  Audits for the use of reconstruction funds, including how they are \nsolicited, bid and granted.\n  A monthly report from the Coalition Provisional Authority on its \nprogress in the stated goal of replacing U.S. troops with multinational \nforces and Iraqi security personnel.\n  A report on the administration's utilization of National Guard and \nReserves, and the impact that this has on our country's homeland \nsecurity.\n  A requirement for the President to submit to Congress its projected \ncosts for Iraqi operations through 2008 and any changes to these \nprojections.\n  Quarterly reports to Congress on the status of the hunt for weapons \nof mass destruction.\n  These are important mechanisms that demonstrate clearly that this \nfunding does not come without strings attached. On the contrary, these \nmechanisms will hold the administration accountable for developing a \nstrategy and ensure transparency in supporting Iraqi reconstruction.\n  We also need to be clear that the U.S. cannot do this alone. I \nbelieve the U.S. must take the leadership role to ensure that Iraq \nbenefits from the legitimacy, cooperation and money that only a broad \ncoalition can guarantee.\n  That is why I supported a provision in this bill that requires the \nPresident to report to Congress on his efforts to increase \ninternational donations and to assess how the U.S. can best leverage \nU.S. taxpayer dollars for international support and international debt \nforgiveness.\n  The administration has had some successes in gaining international \nsupport, notably yesterday's United Nations Security Council \nresolution, which was a unanimous statement supporting multilateral \nefforts to stabilize, reconstruct and support Iraq's transition towards \na sovereign democracy.\n  Also, the administration has taken an important step in engaging \nforeign countries to commit troops, including the recent agreement from \nTurkey. The administration has also shown progress in soliciting \nfinancial contributions, including the $1.5 billion Japanese \ncommitment.\n  However, this is really just a start. Foreign troops and foreign \ncontributions remain terribly lower than where they need to be.\n  The administration needs to be committed to broadening its coalition \nof support and making the Iraqi reconstruction a global challenge met \nby the international community.\n  I believe that it is also very important that the administration \nspeaks with a solid, unified voice regarding its efforts and strategy \nin Iraq.\n  It seems that every day we hear a different plan, a different \nprojection, a different statement on needs and demands from one of \nseveral agencies and ``spokespeople'' that claim to speak for the \nadministration.\n  The American people need and deserve accountability and clarity--not \nonly on the challenges that we face, but on the solutions that we are \nseeking to execute.\n  This clarity is particularly important for the central questions of \nhow long reconstruction will take, what the U.S. role will be, and, \nperhaps most importantly, how long our troops will remain in harm's \nway.\n  The uniformed men and women of our armed forces have served their \ncountry well. Their military efforts have demonstrated historic \nsuccess, and they continue to sacrifice for our country on a daily \nbasis in securing and stabilizing Iraq.\n  Washington State is proud to be the home of thousands of troops, \nsailors and airmen that have served in Iraq and Afghanistan from home \nbases from such places as Fort Lewis, Fairchild Air Force Base, and \nEverett Naval Station.\n  These men and women are meeting the call of duty superbly and we must \nprovide them with the equipment and support that they deserve.\n  We also owe a particular debt of gratitude for our National Guard and \nReserve units, which have been mobilized in historic numbers and for \nsustained lengths of time--leaving their jobs\n\n[[Page S12805]]\n\nand families to serve their countries. In fact, in my state, the 81st \nArmored Brigade--almost 4,000 citizen-soldiers--were alerted for a \npossible deployment to Iraq.\n  Given this important sacrifice made by reservists, I am particularly \npleased that this supplemental package includes my bipartisan fair \ndeployment amendment.\n  Like many guard and reservists--including the National Guard \nAssociation, the Reserve Officers Association, and the National \nMilitary Families Association--I was disturbed last month by the \nadministration's sudden change in deployment policy.\n  My amendment addresses the change by requiring that deployment times \nfor guard and reserves begin as soon as they are activated, we ensure \nthat every day of service counts.\n  I have long said that we need to be consistent in how we calculate \nthe deployment times for our Guard and Reserve personnel and this will \ndo this by starting the clock ticking when their boots are out of the \nhouse.\n  In addition, this includes resources for health care for reservists \nand their families, as well as critical funding for our veterans.\n  First, I was a proud co-sponsor of an amendment that will extend \nTRICARE coverage to reservists and their families who are not currently \ncovered by health insurance, and provide assistance to those reservists \nwho are called up to duty so that they do not have to cancel their \nexisting health care coverages.\n  Second, I also proudly cosponsored a Bond-Mikulski amendment that \nwill provide $1.3 billion in funding for veterans health care. This \namendment means that Washington State will receive approximately $30 \nmillion in new VA health care funding, providing care to approximately \n6,000 veterans who would not receive it.\n  This has been an important, productive and historic debate for the \nfuture of Iraq, the Middle East region and, most importantly, in \nshaping America's role in the world.\n  This ultimate bill ensures that Congress will retain a major role in \noverseeing the way this money is spent and I remain committed to \nensuring that we give our troops the tools they need to do their jobs; \nget the international support that we need; and making sure that our \nmission in Iraq is completed quickly and that our troops can come home.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President. I rise today to address the historic \nlegislation before the Senate. I refer to S. 1689, the Emergency \nSupplemental Appropriations for Iraq and Afghanistan Security and \nReconstruction Act, 2004.\n  Let me begin with what seems to be the reaction of most Americans. I \nam captivated by the sheer sum of the bill--$87 billion.\n  Once beyond the initial sticker shock, I began to look at the content \nof this package. I was sent to the Senate by Arkansans in part to watch \nover the Federal budget so I wanted to know what Americans were getting \nfor their hard-earned $87 billion--$87 billion that will propel our \nNation even further into debt.\n  I want to go on record commending the work of my colleagues on the \nAppropriations Committee. They did the best that they could given the \ncircumstances. I think that I am a fair-minded American but this $87 \nbillion request was dumped in Congress's lap by the President on \nSeptember 17, 2003.\n  Today is October 17 only 4 weeks since we have received this package. \nIt takes most people longer to do their taxes than we have had to \nfigure out an $87 billion package. And while we have heard testimony \nfrom the top brass in the Defense Department, we have not from any \noutside witnesses with views that might differ from the administration. \nFor instance, would it not make sense to hear from the Iraqi Governing \nCouncil regarding this bill?\n  Regardless, here we are, and I have made every effort to fairly \nexamine this package. This is what I have found.\n  The $87 billion package is broken down into two titles--National \nSecurity and International Affairs.\n  Title I, the National Security section of the bill, provides $66.5 \nbillion to carry out the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. The committee \nreport accompanying S. 1689 says that these funds are for increased \noperational tempo, military personnel costs, military construction, \nprocurement of equipment, increased maintenance and military health \ncare support.\n  Title II, the International Affairs section of the bill, provides $21 \nbillion to help secure the transition to democracy in both Iraq and \nAfghanistan. The committee states that these funds are for enhanced \nsecurity and reconstruction activities including border enforcement, \nbuilding a national police service in Iraq, standing up a new Iraqi \narmy and continued building of the Afghan National Army, reconstituted \njudicial systems, rehabilitation of Iraq's oil infrastructure, and \nprovision of basic electricity, water and sewer services and other \ncritical reconstruction needs in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Let me tell you that once into the details, there is much in this \nbill that is straightforward and I wholeheartedly support.\n  For example, under the National Security section, this bill contains \n$1.2 billion for enhanced Special Pays including Family Separation \nAllowance, Imminent Danger Pay, and Hostile Duty Pay. The Senate \nAppropriations Committee should be commended for their decision to \nsupport the continuation of the Family Separation Allowance and the \nImminent Danger Pay at the levels authorized for all of fiscal year \n2004, rather than the Defense Department's request.\n  Title I contains other essential funding for personnel, operation and \nmaintenance, procurement, the Defense Health Program, and military \nconstruction that one would expect to support our obligations to the \nuniform services totaling around $62-$63 billion.\n  I support this funding. It is responsible. It is necessary and part \nof our obligation to our troops.\n  The National Security section further provides funding for the Iraq \nFreedom Fund, the Overseas Humanitarian account, the Disaster and Civic \nAid account, drug interdiction and counterdrug activities, and the \nintelligence community management account. While I wish we had greater \ndetails about these programs, I will put my trust in this \nadministration who believes that these funds are needed to support the \nmissions in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  However, I can only extend so much good faith and trust--which brings \nus to Title II of the bill. Title II or the International Affairs \nsection of the supplemental is intended to help secure the transition \nto democracy in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Its price tag is $21 \nbillion.\n  Some of this reconstruction request makes sense to me, such as the \n$35 million to establish a U.S. diplomatic presence in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and the $90 million for emergencies in the Diplomatic and \nConsular Service which includes reward funds to be paid for information \nleading to the capture or whereabouts of Osama bin Laden and Saddam \nHussein. It is expensive, but we have to back the work that our troops \nhave done and keep our commitment to the Iraqi people.\n  But overall I, along with many Arkansans, struggle to embrace the \nadministration's obtuse and costly approach to reconstruction in Iraq.\n  I have followed the progress of the war in Iraq keenly. I have \nattended the administration's war briefings faithfully. I have gone to \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee hearings consistently. I have had \nthe benefit of firsthand accounts from Secretary Rumsfeld, Ambassador \nBremer, and General John Abizaid, to name a few.\n  Yet I was not prepared for the strategy, or lack thereof, of \nrebuilding Iraq.\n  I was never told that the American people would be footing the entire \nbill for Iraqi reconstruction. Therefore, I understand the reaction of \nmany Americans. I understand that they have questions and concerns. So \ndo I, and they are reasonable questions:\n  We must ask: One, what reconstruction efforts should the U.S. be \nsolely responsible for and what should the Iraqis pay for? Two, what \ndoes Iraq need, and what does Iraq need right now?\n  There are many reconstruction items that this administration is \nasking for that should be scrutinized so we can properly determine \nwhether they are truly needed to stabilize Iraq. I fully understand \nthat Iraq has needs, but Arkansas has needs, too.\n  The Senate has just had an important debate on this bill and I have \nused\n\n[[Page S12806]]\n\nthis time to be open to fresh ideas. There have been a few good \nalternatives to consider and I have supported several alternatives. One \nsuch measure was Senator Byrd's amendment that would have split U.S. \ntroop funding from the Iraqi reconstruction proposal and given Congress \nan opportunity to sort through some of the administration's more \nquestionable funding requests.\n  I want to hold this administration accountable but I do not wish to \nhold our troops hostage. By separating this money, we can ensure our \ntroops get the support they need while making sure we are spending \ntaxpayers' money in a wise and effective manner.\n  I also supported Senator Dorgan's amendment that would have used \nIraqi oil revenues to offset the U.S. direct grant payments. \nUnfortunately, both amendments failed.\n  I came to Washington to protect the best interests of my constituents \nand all Americans. In spite of the rhetoric that many Americans hear \nevery day about the partisan nature of Capitol Hill, last night a vote \nwas held on the Senate floor that demonstrates that my friends on both \nsides of the aisle take their commitments very seriously.\n  In the spirit in which this Nation was founded, last night the Senate \nadopted, with my support, a bipartisan agreement on Iraqi \nreconstruction. I am proud to support this bipartisan agreement \nsponsored by Senators Bayh, Ben Nelson, Ensign, Graham and Chambliss, \nto name a few.\n  Under the bipartisan agreement, the proposed $20 billion grant to \nrebuild Iraq will be divided into two parts: One, a $10.2 billion grant \nfor security efforts in Iraq; and, two, a $10 billion loan.\n  Importantly, the $10 billion loan will be converted into a grant if \n90 percent of Iraq's preliberation debts are forgiven. I am told that \nIraq may have the largest oil reserve in the world, but is currently \ncaptive to more than $100 billion in foreign pre-war debt owed to \ncountries such as Saudi Arabia, France and Russia. Even if the United \nStates were to provide the $10 billion up front as a grant, Iraq will \nhave a very difficult time recovering economically from the burden of \nthe $100 billion debt. This amendment encourages the international \ncommunity to forgive the debt incurred by Saddam Hussein by leveraging \nour negotiations for debt relief with the incentive that the United \nStates will provide a $10 billion reconstruction grant--above the $10 \nbillion already provided for in the supplemental--if the international \ncommunity forgives 90 percent of its bilateral debt.\n  I support this proposal. It would help the Iraqi people and it would \nprovide a long-term solution to rebuilding Iraq. More importantly, it \nhelps the United States to move forward on our own important domestic \nspending, as the Iraqi debt issue will hopefully be resolved. I hope \nthat the administration will join in supporting this bipartisan plan.\n  Wars must be paid for and I intend to honor our commitments. I will \nsupport the amended version of the $87 billion Iraq supplemental bill. \nIt supports our troops and it starts to address a long-term solution \nfor the economic viability of Iraq. I believe that this amended request \noffers a better solution than what was originally offered by \nadministration. It is a small, but positive step toward meeting our \nobligations in Iraq while protecting the American taxpayer.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, as we continue discussion on the \nsupplemental spending request to support military operations and \nreconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan, I would like to take a few \nminutes to again express my strong support for the funding included in \nthis bill.\n  I believe these resources are essential to our efforts to secure a \nstable future for the people of Iraq. This funding is also crucial to \nAmerican soldiers serving on the ground in Iraq, providing necessary \nresources to help them finish the job, and to bring them back home as \nquickly as possible.\n  This is true not only of the military portion of the request, \ntotaling approximately $66 billion, but also the $20.3 billion in \nfunding for reconstruction in Iraq.\n  Some of my colleagues believe this funding for reconstruction should \nbe in the form of a loan. While I understand their rationale, after \ncarefully considering the situation and listening to the points raised \nby Ambassador Bremer and our colleagues, I have concluded this funding \nmust be in the form of a grant. It is important for several reasons.\n  First, if we tell the American people we are going to loan this money \nand that it is going to be paid back somewhere down the road, many of \nthem will be very cynical about whether or not we will get the money \nback. There is no Iraqi government to agree to repay a loan. I think we \nought to level with them and say, this initial grant is a grant. If we \nare asked to look at additional funding down the road, then that is a \ndifferent story. However, there is very little chance that Iraq would \nbe able to pay back this money in the near future.\n  Next, as we look to increase contributions from the international \ncommunity, I think this funding must be in the form of a grant and not \na loan. This is particularly important as we approach the Donors' \nConference in Madrid next week. We must do all that we can to make this \na shared responsibility, and if we make U.S. funds for infrastructure \nprojects contingent upon a loan, I do not think our friends and allies \nwould be willing to come to the table and support additional money for \nIraq.\n  This is also crucial as we call on those countries that did business \nwith Saddam Hussein to eliminate the debt owed to them by the former \nIraqi dictator. I would suggest to those who have made loans to the \nformer regime in Iraq that they step up quickly and waive those loans. \nThis will go a long way in helping a new, democratic Iraq move forward.\n  I am pleased that the Senate accepted an amendment that I introduced \non October 2, 2003, which requires the President to report to Congress \nwithin four months regarding steps taken to increase financial \ncommitments from the international community. The amendment also \nrequires a detailed list of countries that have contributed funds, as \nwell as information on those countries that have eliminated debt owed \nto them by the former Iraqi regime.\n  Further, as we encourage other countries to eliminate their debt, we \nshould not saddle Iraq with any more loans. Countries that chose to do \nbusiness with Saddam should, as I said, eliminate that debt as a way to \nshare in the task of rebuilding a democratic Iraq.\n  Iraq's debt is already mountainous, totaling nearly $200 billion in \ndebts and reparations. As Ambassador Bremer has pointed out, Iraq can \nhardly service its existing debt, let alone take on more. As a matter \nof fact, as one member of the Iraqi Governing Council has said, in his \nopinion, those loans are morally repugnant to the Iraqi people because \nthey were made to a dictator who killed thousands of their brothers and \nsisters and who made them live under a 35-year reign of terror.\n  Finally, providing assistance to Iraq at this time in the form of a \ngrant is the right thing to do.\n  As I remarked on the floor of the Senate on October 1, 2003, we now \nhave the chance of a lifetime to create a new paradigm of democracy in \nthe Middle East, and to do for this part of the world what we did for \nGermany and Japan in the aftermath of World War II.\n  As we consider this question, it is appropriate that we look to the \nlessons of history. We should look to the peace that prevailed in \nEurope following World War II under the Marshall plan, when our \nassistance was given as a grant, as contrasted with the events that \ntook place following the signing of the Treaty of Versailles.\n  Ambassador Bremer said it well in testimony before the Senate a few \nweeks ago. He observed that after World War I, the allied forces \n``celebrated their victory, mourned their dead and demanded the money \nthey were owed.''\n  He said, ``We know the results of that policy. Extremism, bred in a \nswamp of despair, bankruptcy and unpayable debts, gave the world \nFascism in Italy and Nazism in Germany.''\n  Today we find ourselves with another historic opportunity to promote \na new era of peace, stability and democracy in Iraq and in the Middle \nEast. By extending support to help Iraq in the form of a grant, our \nactions will demonstrate better than any rhetoric could\n\n[[Page S12807]]\n\nthat we are genuinely interested in supporting humane reconstruction in \nIraq, as we did following World War II.\n  We must remember that our war on terrorism began after 9/11. Two \nyears ago, after it happened, I said, ``Our actions must be ongoing and \nrelentless, and dedicated to excising the cancer of terrorism wherever \nit raises its ugly head. We owe it to the victims and their families, \nespecially their children and grandchildren, to make sure this never \nhappens again. Most of all, we owe it to the American people and the \nworld community to bring an end to terrorism everywhere and forever.''\n  There are millions of young people under the age of 20 in the Middle \nEast and we want them chanting, ``Freedom and Democracy!'' not Jihad \nagainst the rest of the world.\n  This funding is critical as we continue that effort.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, as debate about the supplemental \nappropriation for military operations and reconstruction in Iraq and \nAfghanistan comes to a close, I would like to ensure that our focus \nremains on the welfare of our Nation's troops.\n  That is why I would like to speak on behalf of the men and women who \nare serving in our Nation's Armed Forces--those currently on active \nduty as well as in the National Guard and Reserves--who are serving \ntoday in Iraq, Afghanistan, and across the globe.\n  Since the President declared an end to major combat operations in \nIraq 5\\1/2\\ months ago, 195 American troops have died in action, and \nover 1,900 have been wounded.\n  Even if combat in Iraq is being waged at a lesser level than it was 6 \nmonths ago, it is still agonizingly clear that, in many parts of Iraq, \nour troops remain in danger.\n  The imminent and ever-present danger of guerilla attacks is one of \nthe most severe threats that our soldiers in the field are facing.\n  Many U.S. troops have expressed concern that they are not adequately \ntrained for the specialized demands of peacekeeping and policing that \nthe reconstruction effort requires. Despite the fact that many of these \nsoldiers are burdened with jobs and responsibilities outside their area \nof expertise, they have shown themselves to be resourceful and \nresilient in taking hold of their assignments.\n  But, alarmingly, the dangers and difficulties that our troops face go \nfar beyond the threat posed by attacks from insurgents and guerillas.\n  There are additional threats to their safety and security that we \ncannot neglect. I have grown increasingly concerned about the \nconditions under which many of our troops are being forced to serve in \nthe Middle East.\n  Currently, the difficult conditions posed by a desert deployment--\nincluding brutal temperatures of 120 degrees or even higher in the \nsummer months, along with high winds and sandstorms--are compounded by \nshortages of quality water and food.\n  While the military has emphasized to these troops the need to drink \nplenty of fluids and to eat properly, we have seen reports that \nmilitary field hospitals in Iraq are contending with cases of \ndehydration and heat exhaustion on a fairly regular basis.\n  Given the nature of the desert climate, are our soldiers adequately \nsupplied? It has become quite clear that they are not.\n  Troops are limited to a ration of two 1-liter bottles of water per \nday, according to numerous reports we have heard from the field.\n  I know of at least one mother in Arkansas who has routinely shipped \ncases of bottled water to her son who is serving in Iraq. I hear \nfrequently from spouses or mothers who are forced to ship food, water, \nor other needed supplies to their loved ones in the field, at their own \nexpense.\n  In many respects, the food supply situation is also a cause for \nconcern.\n  One news report from this summer detailed the dismay of American \ntroops who, while surviving on MRE rations, learned that Italian troops \nserving alongside them were being fed freshly cooked pasta.\n  These shortages of quality water and food are causing troop morale to \nflag.\n  On top of that, many soldiers are growing concerned, confused, and \nfrustrated by the length of their deployments--particularly members of \nthe National Guard and Reserves who are now bumping up against what \nshould be the end of their deployment time.\n  Many of these soldiers have already served longer than they had been \nled to believe, causing great stress and hardship for them and for \ntheir families.\n  Adding to the uncertainty and frustration, news reports from earlier \nthis summer indicated that the Bush administration was exploring a \ncost-cutting proposal to reduce the pay of reservists and guardsmen.\n  The administration quickly back-pedaled from this plan in the face of \nan outcry from the public, but the pay-cut proposal was the next in a \nseries of indignities and insults to the thousands of brave men and \nwomen who left their jobs and families for what they were led to \nbelieve would be a short stay in the Middle East.\n  On the front page of yesterday's Washington Post is a story about the \ndissatisfaction of our troops in the field, based upon an informal \nsurvey of soldiers conducted by the Stars and Stripes newspaper. \nAccording to the survey, half of the troops questioned rated their unit \nmorale as ``low'' or ``very low.'' Forty percent, according to the \nsurvey, believe that the jobs they are doing have ``little or nothing \nto do'' with what they have been trained to do.\n  Right now, Arkansas reservists in the 39th Infantry Brigade have been \ncalled up for rotation into Iraq beginning early next year. Nearly \n3,500 Arkansas soldiers are being activated, which is the largest \ndeployment of troops from our State in Arkansas history. As a Senator \nand as an Arkansan, I want to know that these troops are going to \nreceive the supplies that they need to do the job, and the pay that \nthey deserve for their service.\n  When this President ran for office 3 years ago, one of his central \npromises was that he would make the needs of the uniformed military a \nparamount concern.\n  But the record of this administration in supporting our troops and \ntheir families suggests otherwise.\n  Now the President comes to Congress seeking an additional $87 billion \nto sustain our engagement in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  While this legislation was being crafted, I asked that the President \nuse his leadership to place a higher priority on the well-being and \nquality of life of American troops serving in these war-torn nations.\n  The President has expressed his great pride in our troops, and I \nshare that pride. I ask that he now match that pride with a commitment \nto these troops and their families.\n  First, the President and the Pentagon need to review the allocation \nof rations, water, and supplies to our troops to ensure that they can \nmaintain their strength and health, as well as a modicum of comfort, in \nan extremely harsh desert environment.\n  Third, the President should instruct military commanders to develop \ngreater certainty with regard to the length of combat assignments, so \nthat troops and their families can plan for their futures.\n  Finally, the President should continue working to build an \ninternational coalition of countries to share in the burden of post-war \nIraq.\n  American troops have paid with their lives and American taxpayers are \npaying for the reconstruction at rates that are greatly \ndisproportionate to the rest of the free world.\n  The model of international forces working together for security and \nreconstruction has worked before. In fact, this model is working right \nnow in places like Afghanistan, where troops from Germany and Holland, \namong other countries, are working alongside United States troops to \nbring security and peace to that nation.\n  Although Afghanistan still faces a number of security challenges and \nwe still face a long commitment to the Afghan people, there is no doubt \nthat the country is much better off now than it was at this time 3 \nyears ago. This progress is a direct result of the multinational force \nworking to secure and reconstruct Afghanistan today.\n  We should continue to seek a similar force structure for the \nstabilization and reconstruction of Iraq. The United Nations Security \nCouncil resolution that was passed today is one step in the right \ndirection. Even if we don't yet have concrete commitments of troops or \nfunding, it does help bring our allies to the table. It does give us an \nopportunity to begin the process of healing\n\n[[Page S12808]]\n\nthe rifts in the global community and perhaps to ensure a more peaceful \nfuture. I urge the President to continue working to secure the support \nof our allies and the United Nations.\n  At this point, it is clear that there is a great deal of work to be \ndone in Iraq, and that our commitment of troops in the Middle East is \ngoing to last for several more years at the least.\n  This latest request for billions of dollars to support operations and \nreconstruction in Iraq is the clearest suggestion from the \nadministration that our commitment is only going to grow more intense \nin the coming months and years.\n  It is important to recognize that these decisions are not made in a \nvacuum. We have a responsibility to ask how these funds are being \nspent. We have a right to know what further resources will be needed \nbeyond this supplemental appropriation. And we have an obligation to \nask what effects this spending will have on our domestic priorities and \nthe needs of our constituents.\n  I have heard repeatedly from my constituents in Arkansas, who are \ndeeply concerned about this funding and how it is being spent. In \nArkansas, we have a tremendous need for water projects, for education \nfunding, for health care, for infrastructure, and for all the \nnecessities that federal investment can bring. My constituents ask, how \ncan we afford $87 billion for Iraq when we're repeatedly told that \nthere is no money for projects at home? Where is this money going to \ncome from? How is it going to be spent?\n  Further, I support providing a substantial portion of the funding in \nthis legislation designated for reconstruction projects in the form of \na loan. I do not believe my children and possibly my grandchildren \nshould be required to pay for this effort without at least some help \nfrom the Iraqi people. I was pleased the Senate approved an amendment \nwith my support that converts $10 billion of the reconstruction funding \ncontained in the bill into a loan.\n  I also believe that to be successful in the long run, the Iraqi \npeople and the global community must have a vested interest in this \nreconstruction effort.\n  When constituents from Arkansas come to ask me for help with projects \nin their communities, I have to tell them in most cases that I can't \nhelp them with funding to construct buildings, but I can help secure \nmoney for equipment, training and programming.\n  The rationale behind this Federal policy is that projects are much \nmore likely to succeed if the participants have a vested interest. I \nthink the same policy holds true for Iraq.\n  I am voting in favor of this supplemental appropriations bill, \nbecause I believe it is important that we support our troops and it is \nimportant that we assist the people of Iraq with rebuilding their \ncountry so that our men and women in uniform can finish the job and \nreturn home to their loved ones as soon as possible.\n  Even though we have made some significant improvements in this bill \nduring consideration in the Senate, I do have some reservations. I \nremain concerned that we are spending too much money on reconstruction \nprojects of dubious value, and too little on ensuring the safety and \nsecurity of our troops. And I am deeply, deeply concerned of the effect \nof this additional spending on our burgeoning deficit--a burden that \nour children and grandchildren are going to have to bear.\n  In the weeks and months to come, I expect the administration to make \na better effort to improve communications with Congress on the progress \nwe are making in Iraq. I expect the administration to keep Congress \nbetter informed about progress in Iraq, and to present a clear plan for \nthe future--how this money is being spent, how it is to be paid for, \nand what the results of this spending will be. I have supported \nlegislation that promotes greater disclosure from the administration, \nand encourage the President to cooperate with Congress in good faith.\n  President Bush and members of his administration have told us \nrepeatedly that this funding is needed in order to ensure that Iraq is \nstabilized and secured, and to ensure that we can bring down troop \nlevels and casualty levels. I, along with the people of Arkansas, \nintend to hold them accountable for those goals.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, after giving this matter considerable \nthought, I have decided to vote for this emergency supplemental. I do \nso with great reluctance, and I wanted to take a few moments to explain \nhow I came to this decision.\n  Let me begin by saying that I voted in October 2002 against the \nresolution to give the President broad authority to go to war in Iraq. \nAt the time, I believed the administration had failed to make the case \nthat Iraq posed an imminent threat; had failed to develop a meaningful \ninternational coalition with whom to share the burdens and costs of \nwar; had failed to prioritize the more serious risks of global \nterrorists, North Korea and Iran; had failed to develop a plan for \nreconstruction once the war was over, and had failed to be straight \nwith the American people about why we were going to war in the first \nplace.\n  Looking back at my decision, I am more convinced than ever that it \nwas correct. It has become increasingly clear that numerous \nadministration claims about the Iraqi threat were either exaggerated or \nsimply wrong. With little international support, America has been left \nto fight the war and rebuild Iraq largely on our own. America is \nshouldering 90 percent of the costs, providing 90 percent of the \ntroops, and tragically bearing 95 percent of the casualties on the \nground. In that context, the administration still has not put forward a \nmeaningful, long-term plan to rebuild Iraq and move toward its self-\ngovernance. And, after all this time, the Bush administration still has \nnot developed a consistent position about the rationale for this war. \nIn fact, each passing day leads me to be more certain that the \ndevelopment and use of intelligence pre-conflict has been misused for \npolitical justification, not informed policy formulation. This is why I \ncontinue to call for an independent, bipartisan commission to \ninvestigate the development and use of intelligence related to Iraq.\n  Having said all that, the decision to go to war has long since \npassed. And the question before the Senate today is how to move forward \nfrom here.\n  Needless to say, all of us are glad that Saddam Hussein, a tyrannical \ndictator, is out of power. However, notwithstanding Saddam's departure, \nIraq is now a country with very serious problems. Violence against \nAmerican soldiers, and crime generally, plagues the country. Iraq's \neconomy is struggling. Many Iraqis have lost jobs and are having a hard \ntime making ends meet. And we have made very little progress in \nshifting power from American forces to Iraqis themselves.\n  While I opposed this war, I also am convinced that we cannot and must \nnot just walk away from Iraq at this point. Having invaded the country \nand created a situation with such problems, we have a responsibility to \nhelp address them. Even more fundamentally, helping Iraq get back on \nits feet is very much in the interests of the United States itself.\n  A strong, democratic Iraq could well help stabilize the entire Middle \nEast region, even if this rationale is often overstated. By contrast, \nan unstable Iraq would not only destabilize the region, but is likely \nto further become a breeding ground for terrorists. Our own national \nsecurity could be put at risk as a result, as it was by a festering \nAfghanistan.\n  So, I do think we need to address the problems facing Iraq in a \nmeaningful way. And that, inevitably, is going to cost money. I voted \nfor the first supplemental appropriations bill, which provided almost \n$80 billion for the effort. And I recognize that we are going to have \nto provide much more in future years.\n  At the same time, we in the Congress have a responsibility to do it \nright. And I have had serious concerns about the approach recommended \nby the administration.\n  Let me be clear: I fully support the funding requested for our \nmilitary. But, as I see it, the administration's request for \nreconstruction funding was problematic in many ways.\n  First, the administration asked for a huge amount of money, but \nfailed to identify a single penny in savings to offset that cost. Every \ndollar requested was a dollar to be added to the debt that our \nchildren, and their children, will be forced to bear long into the \nfuture. That, in my view, is fiscally irresponsible. And that is why I \nwas\n\n[[Page S12809]]\n\npleased to join Senator Biden in cosponsoring an amendment to fully \noffset the bill's cost by merely scaling back a portion of the large \nnew tax breaks for those with taxable incomes well over $300,000. \nUnfortunately, our amendment was defeated. So this bill now will be \nfinanced entirely by new debt. That is troubling to me.\n\n  I also am concerned about the sheer size of the administration's \nrequest. There is no need to appropriate $87 billion today. Funds \nalready appropriated are sufficient to get us through the end of this \nyear, and perhaps well beyond that. And we could sustain operations \nwell into next year at a cost far below $87 billion. In my view, \nCongress would be wiser to keep the Iraq operation on a short leash, to \nhelp ensure greater accountability.\n  Along the same lines, I remain very concerned about the widespread \nreports of abuses in the management of the reconstruction effort. Huge \ncontracts have been awarded to companies with close ties to \nadministration officials, often without any bidding, and there already \nhave been major cost overruns. Halliburton is the most notorious \nexample. But there are others. I was pleased to cosponsor an amendment \nwith Senator Lautenberg in an effort to address some of these abuses, \nand I am pleased that another amendment, proposed by Senator Collins, \nshould help block future no-bid contracts. It is important that this \ntype of protection be included in the final conference report.\n  Another concern I have had about the administration's $87 billion \nrequest is that it has not been matched by an effective or coherent \noutreach to bring other countries into the reconstruction process. So \nfar, America has borne the overwhelming share of the costs of Iraq \noperations, and there is little evidence that this will change in the \nforeseeable future. While I was pleased that the U.N. approved a \nresolution yesterday that seemed to signal at least some outreach to \nthe international community and some reciprocal accommodation, many of \nour allies who voted for the resolution, including France, Germany, and \nRussia, said that because the resolution did not go far enough, they \nwill not provide any additional resources beyond those already pledged. \nAs a result, American soldiers, and American taxpayers, will continue \nto bear a grossly disproportionate share of the operation's ongoing \ncosts. That needs to change.\n  I believe it would be especially appropriate to ask the Iraqi people \nthemselves to help share in the immediate costs of reconstruction, \ngiven that Iraq has vast oil reserves that, in the long term, will \nproduce a huge stream of--revenue conservatively estimated $30- to $40 \nbillion per year. As I see it, Iraq should securitize those revenues--\nborrowing today, using future oil production as collateral. That \nsecuritization would help relieve the huge burden that the President is \nimposing on American taxpayers.\n  Unfortunately, the administration has been unyielding in its \ndetermination to simply hand out $20 billion in grants to Iraq, with no \nstrings attached. As I see it, that is not a responsible way to manage \nthe people's money. Nor is it an effective way to build long-term \npublic support for the effort in Iraq. That is why I supported the \nBayh amendment, which would turn half of the President's requested \ngrants into loans that could be forgiven only if most of our allies \nagree to forgive debts incurred by the regime of Saddam Hussein.\n\n  Another concern of mine about the administration's request is that it \nfailed to include sufficient mechanisms to ensure that reconstruction \nmoney is well spent, and well accounted for. The request asks Congress \nto give the executive branch largely unfettered discretion to shift \nfunding approved by Congress for virtually any other purpose related to \nIraq. That is why I was pleased to support amendments by Senator Byrd \nto eliminate these broad grants of authority, and to improve reporting \nrequirements. I also supported the proposal to establish an inspector \ngeneral to review related spending. These accountability measures must \nremain in the final conference report.\n  Yet better reporting and monitoring of spending in Iraq still does \nnot address the more fundamental need for the administration to develop \na long-term plan for operations in Iraq. Some will argue that the \nadministration recently did submit a document to the Congress. But that \ndocument contains few details about the number of troops that will be \nneeded, the cost of operations beyond this year, or the process by \nwhich power eventually will be shifted from the Coalition Provisional \nAuthority to Iraqis. In my view, it is premature, at best, to \nappropriate such a massive amount of money until the administration \nproduces a real long-term plan, and until that plan is subject to full \npublic debate.\n  Having said that, I was pleased that the Senate did approve an \namendment I drafted that will require the President to report every 90 \ndays to the Congress about the long-term costs of Iraq operations, \nincluding military operations and reconstruction. This requirement \nwould force the administration to think beyond the short-term. And it \nwould give Congress the ability to plan long term. I hope the provision \nwill be retained in the final version of the legislation.\n  Today I have detailed many of the problems associated with the \nadministration's request for Iraq. Some of those problems have been \naddressed on the floor through the amendment process, and I am proud to \nhave been part of those efforts. Yet serious shortcomings remain, and \nthe bill before us remains substantially flawed.\n  At the end of the day, however, I have reluctantly concluded that \nthis flawed bill, for all its problems, is better than nothing. There \nis no getting around the fact that our troops are in Iraq, and they \nmust be supported. Similarly, we have to accept that, even if we \nshouldn't have begun this conflict, it is now our Nation's \nresponsibility, and it is in our Nation's interest, to ensure that Iraq \nis rebuilt and emerges as a modern democratic state in the context of \nits own culture. We simply can't walk away from Iraq. And it is \nimperative that we demonstrate to the Iraqi people, and the \ninternational community, that Americans across the political spectrum \nare committed to this cause, and will fully support the Iraqi people as \nthey move toward a free Iraq.\n  Reluctantly, after balancing these many considerations, I will cast \nmy vote ``aye.''\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago when the Appropriations \nCommittee marked up this $87 billion supplemental spending request from \nthe President, we spent an entire day attempting to improve one of the \nlargest supplemental requests in our history. Most of the amendments \nvoted on that day were defeated on party-line votes, but the issues \nraised remain unresolved and continue to engage this body and the \nAmerican people. We voted to send this request to the floor without \nprejudice, and it is no surprise that there has been tremendous \ninterest in continuing to debate the substance of the funding proposed \nfor Iraq, and the timing for disbursing that funding. The interest in \nthis bill reflects the broader concerns that persist about the \ndirection of our policy in Iraq.\n  We need to take as much time as necessary to review the \nadministration's plans to rebuild Iraq. By way of comparison, when \nCongress approved the Marshall plan, it spent 11 days debating an \nauthorization bill submitted by the Truman administration before \nappropriating any funds. The time, planning, and extensive oversight \nthat went into the Marshall plan helped ensure its success. Given the \nmiscalculations that have occurred during our time in Iraq, it behooves \nus to be cautious and put in place mechanisms to ensure the most \nvigorous oversight of the reconstruction of Iraq.\n  If we approve this supplemental--and I believe we will--every \nprovision that we have added to this measure to increase accountability \nand to hold the administration to benchmarks and timetables must be \nretained in conference. I voted to support Senator Byrd's amendment to \nadd reporting requirements for the Coalition Provisional Authority and \nto mandate GAO audits of Iraqi reconstruction activities and numerous \nother amendments were adopted by voice vote that strengthen our ability \nto oversee the disbursement of these funds. We could have done even \nmore to guarantee the success of the ambitious nation building proposed \nby the administration if we had adopted the Leahy-Daschle amendment to \ntransfer reconstruction authority from the Pentagon to the\n\n[[Page S12810]]\n\nDepartment of State. It makes sense that those with the most expertise \nin this area be in charge of Iraq's reconstruction. The \nadministration's indecision about how to manage the reconstruction \nsuggests that we have not heard the last on this matter.\n  Americans' sense of unease about United States policy in Iraq is \ncompounded by the sheer size of this supplemental. I have heard from \ncountless constituents who are concerned that we are spending vast \nresources in Iraq when we have so many pressing needs here at home. I \nshare their sense of irony that we are sending money to Iraq to build \nroads and schools, to construct housing and health facilities, and to \nspur economic development, when these same needs go unmet in our own \nStates. That is why I would have voted to support the Stabenow \namendment to spend $5 billion on veterans' health care, school \nconstruction, health care and transportation needs here in the United \nStates. Addressing these vital needs would have helped create as many \nas 95,000 jobs at a time when the numbers of unemployed who have given \nup and stopped looking for work at all is climbing.\n  In this time of economic uncertainty, I have joined many of my \ncolleagues in questioning why we have not been more responsible in \npaying for military operations and reconstruction costs in Iraq now, \ninstead of burdening future generations with the staggering cost of \nthis operation. That is why I voted for the Biden amendment that asked \nthe wealthiest 1 percent of this Nation's taxpayers to give up a small \nportion of their future tax breaks to fully offset the $87 billion cost \nof the supplemental before us. And that is why I would have voted for \nthe Dorgan amendment to require that Iraqi oil revenues be used as \ncollateral to pay for the reconstruction in Iraq, an amendment I \nsupported in the Appropriations Committee. Iraq is not a poor nation it \nhas the second largest oil reserves in the world--and it is only a \nmatter of time before the oil will begin flowing again. How can we \nworry about burdening the Iraqis with debt when our own debt looms so \nlarge? I hope that when Congress completes action on this bill, the \nBayh amendment is a part of the final version and we will have found a \nway to have the Iraqis help pay for the cost of reconstruction.\n  We also need to do much more to gain the support of the international \ncommunity in this endeavor. The U.N. Security Council vote on Thursday \nwas an important step in that direction but the resolution itself \nglossed over important differences with our allies. After the vote, \nrepresentatives from Russia, France, and Germany made clear that they \ndo not plan to lend further support issuing a joint statement saying, \n``The conditions are not created for us to envisage any military \ncommitment and no further financial contributions beyond our present \nengagement.''\n  I have always believed that before we commit troops abroad, we must \ndo so with international support and involvement. As I said when I cast \nmy vote to authorize the President to use force against Iraq, I did so \nwith the belief that ``moving to disarm Saddam Hussein--in concert with \nthe international community--was the President's great goal.'' And last \nyear, before we voted, the President vowed to seek the support of the \ninternational community on Iraq. Working with the support of the \ninternational community made sense when we waged war against Iraq in \n1991, and it would have made sense last year.\n  I wish the President had taken the time to build a broader \ninternational consensus before we went into Iraq. The price of going it \nalone is being paid in many ways. We have damaged our relations with \nsome of our oldest allies. Our attitude in Iraq, coupled with this \nadministration's approach to other international efforts has done real \ndamage to our image in the world. While reasonable people can disagree \nabout whether the treaties, protocols, and conventions the United \nStates has opted out of over the last few years were good or bad for \nour national security, the fact remains that our friends around the \nworld were surprised, and in some cases snubbed by our actions. At the \ntime we may have thought the cost of leaving them behind was small but \nthe bill has now arrived--and the first installment is $87 billion.\n  Even the ``coalition of the willing'' has come with a price. While \nthe United Kingdom has stuck by us admirably, many of the other \ncountries that the administration points to as cooperating with us in \nIraq are being compensated for their efforts. A Washington Post article \nthis summer pointed out that the international division headed by \nPoland will face roughly $240 million in expenses, $200 million of \nthose will be paid by the United States. The supplemental before us \ncontains some $900 million for Pakistan--to pay them to police part of \ntheir own border.\n\n  Last year, the Congress and the Nation heard all about the advantages \nof unilateralism. We heard that only weak countries that could not \ncontrol their own destinies had to wait for the approval of the United \nNations or the international community. But now we are learning the \nlimits of our own strength. We hear stories about how our military is \nstretched thin and we are asking more and more of our Reserve Forces. \nThe United States military strategy was to be ready for two nearly \nsimultaneous major military conflicts, but now it appears that our \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan are pushing the military to the \nlimit. I believe our Armed Forces are up to the job that lies before \nthem, but we did not have to ask this much of them. Better coordination \nwith our allies earlier this year, or even now, could do a lot to ease \nthe burden on our men and women in uniform.\n  While there has been a great deal of discussion regarding the \nreconstruction dollars included in this bill, no one has disputed that \nthe military funding is crucial to the support of our troops in Iraq. \nOur men and women in uniform need the $67 billion included in this \npackage to replace damaged equipment and stores of spare parts. They \nneed it to buy necessities like body armor and improve security around \nfacilities. They need it so they can move out of tents and into air \nconditioned barracks. Some of my colleagues may have opposed the war \nfrom the beginning, and others may now be doubting the value of this \nmilitary adventure, but we all agree that the troops who are over there \nnow need the best that we can give them to accomplish their mission \nquickly and safely. In that spirit, I supported the Dodd amendment that \nwould have taken $322 million from Iraqi prison building and witness \nprotection funds on the reconstruction side of this bill and would have \nused those funds to pay for sorely needed personnel equipment for our \ntroops.\n  I wish we could have considered the reconstruction funding \nseparately. Much of that funding is far less urgent than the military \nspending in this bill. That is why I supported the Byrd amendment that \nwould have separated the reconstruction funds from the $67 billion in \ndefense funds. If we had approved that amendment, we surely would have \napproved the military and security funds expeditiously and then taken \nthe necessary time for the administration to provide us with more \nspecificity on the plan for the political and economic reconstruction \nof Iraq.\n  Mr. President, we are being asked to approve this $87 billion request \nfor Operation Iraqi Freedom; yet, no one can say authoritatively how \nlong this operation will last. We are being asked to approve $87 \nbillion when we have no information on the extent to which the \ninternational community will shoulder some of the burden of stabilizing \nand reconstructing Iraq. And we are being asked to approve $87 billion \nwith no idea of how much more we will be asked to commit in taxpayer \ndollars and human lives.\n  I plan to support this supplemental. I do so after having supported \namendments to try to improve the reconstruction package, and I do so \nbecause we cannot delay any further the military spending so crucial to \nmaking this mission a success. We owe our fighting men and women in the \nfield our full support and we owe the Iraqi people a fighting chance to \nrebuild their nation. And while it may be true that these debts were \namassed through misguided policies of unilateralism, they are debts \nnonetheless, and they must be paid. So I will vote for this \nsupplemental and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it has been a year since the full Senate \ndebated military action in Iraq, and now\n\n[[Page S12811]]\n\nthe President is asking Congress for $87 billion.\n  It is time to assess where things stand, to look at the reality \nfacing our troops, and to see if we are on the right track in Iraq.\n  Unfortunately, it is clear to me that today we are not where we need \nto be in protecting our troops, gaining international support, or even \nhaving a plan to win the peace.\n  As the daughter of a disabled World War II veteran and the \nrepresentative for hundreds of thousands of Washington State veterans \nand military families, I will fight for every dollar our troops need to \nprotect themselves, and to complete their mission successfully, and I \nam deeply troubled that the President still does not have a plan for \nsuccess in Iraq.\n  I have invested a lot of time examining the President's $87 billion \nrequest.\n  I am taking a close look at what is needed and who will foot the \nbill.\n  I have attended hearings and briefings where I have questioned \nadministration officials, from Defense Secretary Rumsfeld to Ambassador \nBremer. And I have heard a great deal from the citizens I represent in \nWashington State.\n  Everywhere I go at home, I am approached by people who have a family \nmember who is now serving or a family member who is going to be called \nup.\n  As we speak, 3,500 soldiers with the Army's 1st Stryker Brigade \nCombat Team at Fort Lewis are being deployed to Iraq. About 2,100 \nWashington reservists are serving in Iraq today. About 300 Washington \nNational Guard are already serving in Iraq and another 3,300 are on \n``ready alert.''\n  Like their families, I am very concerned about what they--and all of \nour troops--will encounter overseas.\n  Each day in Iraq, our American soldiers face vicious attacks from \nsnipers, car bombs, roadside explosives, and rocket-propelled grenades. \nThese attacks are taking a deadly toll. We learned this morning that \nfour more soldiers were killed in Iraq. Our hearts and prayers go out \nto their families as we continue to support all of the men and women \nwho are still there.\n  Five months ago, President Bush stood on an aircraft carrier--under a \nsign that read ``Mission Accomplished''--and told us that major combat \noperations had ended. Since that day, however, more than 180 American \nsoldiers have been killed, including four from Washington State. Their \nfamilies will never be the same. Their communities will never be the \nsame. They--and all of our troops--deserve our thanks and our \ngratitude. But they deserve much more.\n  They deserve a plan that will help them complete their mission \nsuccessfully and return home safely. So far, there is no plan.\n  Many of the questions I asked on the Senate floor a year ago still \nhave not been answered, but today we must focus on the reality on the \nground.\n  We have about 130,000 troops in Iraq, according to the Defense \nDepartment. They are working hard in dire circumstances, and they are \nfacing deadly attacks every day. There is still no plan for winning the \npeace. There is still no real international support, either in troops \nor treasure.\n  Anyone who asks a legitimate question or who talks about what is \nreally happening is criticized. And now the administration wants $87 \nbillion without accountability.\n  The way to fix this is for the White House to ``swallow some pride,'' \nface reality, be accountable, and offer a credible plan. But instead of \na plan, the administration is offering a public relations campaign.\n  Today we have complaints about media filters and a lively policy \ndebate within the administration, but we still have no plan.\n  So as I assess where things stand in Iraq, I see no real \ninternational support; no tolerance for important questions; no \nconsistent policy--even within the administration; no accountability as \nto how money is spent in Iraq; no plan for success; and a PR campaign \nto ``paper-over'' the failures.\n  With all due respect, that is not a formula that will help bring our \ntroops home.\n  We have to deal with the situation as it is and figure out how to \nmake it better.\n  Sound bites and speeches are not going to help our troops finish \ntheir mission and come home. A credible plan, accountability, and \ninternational support will. We do not need a PR campaign to make it \nlook like things are going well. We need a plan that will actually help \nour troops succeed, and the American people are losing patience. That \nis the context in which we are having this debate.\n  Now I wish to turn to the specifics of the President's $87 billion \nrequest.\n  Most of it--about $65 billion--would go to military operations. I \nabsolutely support that. Without question, we must provide our military \nmen and women with the resources they need to complete their missions \nin Iraq, Afghanistan, and every corner of the global war on terrorism.\n  About one-quarter of the $87 billion is being proposed to rebuild \nIraq. I am concerned with how the burden for Iraq's reconstruction is \nbeing shared with the rest of the world.\n  The Bush administration is proposing to spend more than $20 billion \nin Iraq, while the rest of the international community has currently \npledged only $3 billion--$20 billion from American taxpayers and $3 \nbillion from the rest of the world. This is far different than the 1991 \ngulf war.\n  In 1991, the first President Bush put together a coalition of \ncountries to liberate Kuwait. The cost of that operation was $60 \nbillion. Because that President had won the support of our allies and \nhad secured the support of NATO and the United Nations, America's \nallies paid 90 percent of the cost of that war. The U.S. paid only $6 \nbillion.\n  I am also troubled, both as a citizen who cares about my country and \nas a Senator who will cast a vote on this bill, that Americans were \ntold a lot of things about Iraq before the war which have turned out to \nbe false.\n  One repeated assertion was that Iraq's vast oil reserves could pay \nfor its own reconstruction. In fact, the Deputy Defense Secretary Paul \nWolfowitz said:\n\n       There's a lot of money to pay for this that doesn't have to \n     be U.S. taxpayer money. We're dealing with a country that can \n     really finance its own reconstruction, and relatively soon.\n\n  Just a few months later, it is clear that the bill to reconstruct \nIraq is massive, and that bill is being handed to every American \nfamily.\n  As my Republican colleague, Senator Lindsey Graham, said last night:\n\n       It's very hard for me to go home and explain how you give \n     $20 billion to a country that is sitting on $1 trillion worth \n     of oil.\n\n  The American people were told that Iraq's oil reserves would finance \nits reconstruction but now we are getting stuck with the bill and I \nbelieve the American people deserve an explanation. We all agree that \nwe must help Iraq and Afghanistan get back on their feet quickly, but \nwe should not carry the burden alone while our own schools, hospitals, \nand communities are in need.\n  We all understand the importance of helping the Iraqi people, but it \nneed not come at the expense of our needs here at home. Even though the \nadministration says that Iraq should be able to produce $35 billion in \noil revenues in a few years, the American taxpayer is still getting \nstuck with the bill.\n  Let's remember, there is no guarantee that President Bush will not \ncome back to ask U.S. taxpayers to provide even more money for Iraq's \nreconstruction. The World Bank says Iraq's reconstruction will cost at \nleast $60 billion.\n  Today our families and communities are being asked to do more with \nless. Americans everywhere are sacrificing to make up the difference. \nAmerican families will feel this $20 billion impact in crowded \nclassrooms, delayed transportation improvements, and less access to \nhealth care. One of the reasons American taxpayers are so upset is \nbecause we need those kinds of investments here at home. This \nadministration's priorities are wrong.\n  The people I represent want to see that level of effort and resources \nput back into our own country. After all, we will only be strong abroad \nif we are strong here at home.\n  Let's not forget no matter how much we are sacrificing at home, the \nburden is always far higher on our soldiers overseas. That is why, \nwhile they are fighting for us, we must continue to fight for them. We \nhave to make sure they come back to a country that has\n\n[[Page S12812]]\n\njobs that can support them, health care they can count on, retirement \nthey can look forward to, and education and opportunity for their \nchildren.\n  Before we reach for our wallets again, the American people deserve to \nknow how this money will help bring our troops home as soon as \npossible. It is clear that our concerns and questions will not be fully \naddressed before we are forced to vote on this legislation. It is also \nclear that we cannot afford to fail in Iraq.\n  We have situations in Iraq and Afghanistan that can go either way. \nBoth Iraq and Afghanistan could become either havens for terrorism or \nnations that can inch their way toward stability. We have to get it \nright. We cannot allow Iraq or Afghanistan to descend into chaos.\n  We have tried to make this proposal better through amendments. I \nvoted to separate the military funding from the reconstruction funding. \nI voted to make the entire $20 billion a loan. I voted to require a \nlong-term plan for the reconstruction. Unfortunately, those amendments \nfailed, but I am very pleased that last night, the Senate took a \npositive step to improve the proposal.\n  The Senate passed an amendment that will ensure the burden of debt is \nshared and will give the Iraqi people a greater stake in their own \nreconstruction. The progress last night is a dramatic improvement over \nthe President's proposal and is a good reason to support the modified \nfunding request.\n  At the end of the day, we cannot afford to fail in Iraq. The reality \nis that we have got 130,000 troops over there. We cannot fail to give \nthem what they need to protect themselves and complete their mission. \nReluctantly, I will vote for this $87 billion request because we cannot \ndeny our troops the resources they need even as we demand that the \nadministration offer a real plan.\n  To illustrate just how badly our troops need resources and equipment, \nI want to read an email I received on Wednesday from David Willet of \nBellingham, WA, about his son Ian Willett.\n  David writes:\n\n       My son, Specialist Ian Willet, a 2001 graduate of Sehome \n     High School, was deployed to Iraq on September 5th, his 21st \n     birthday.\n       Prior to him leaving he came to me to request money in \n     order to help him buy combat gear he would need to take with \n     him to Iraq. This is gear the Army either would not issue him \n     or was as old and outdated as to be virtually useless. I, of \n     course, bought the gear that he requested.\n       After talking with other men who have come home or are on \n     their way to combat, I have become quite angry that our \n     government has placed our sons and daughters in combat \n     without the best equipment in the world. As an example, Ian \n     spent $50.00 his grandfather gave him for his 21st birthday \n     on knee pads. The Army-issue knee pads fall down around your \n     ankles when you run with them on.\n       Now I read a quarter of the combat troops in Iraq don't \n     have the right body armor. I am outraged that it has taken \n     over four years to get this ceramic body armor to our combat \n     troops, and that our troops would even be sent into combat \n     without this necessary technology. The reason front line \n     troops don't have this body armor? Delays in funding, \n     production and shipping. Small solace to family that has \n     their loved one killed in combat for lack of the proper vest.\n       Other stories in the press talk about wounded soldiers \n     being given bills for food they ate while in the hospital in \n     the U.S. recovering from combat wounds. The Bush \n     Administration wants us to focus on the good news coming out \n     of Iraq.\n\n  It is outrageous that we are sending our soldiers to Iraq without the \nequipment they need, forcing their parents and grandparents to buy \nthings that our government should be providing.\n  Ian is married and has two children. His family can't wait for him to \nreturn home, and the burden of protecting Ian should not fall on his \nfamily. It is the job of our Government. I am voting for this amendment \nso that soldiers like Ian won't have to ask their parents for the \nequipment they need to protect themselves.\n  Even as I support this funding, I want to be very clear that this is \nnot over. I am going to watch this administration very closely. I am \ngoing to watch how they spend this money; how accountable they are; how \nour soldiers fare; and how much international support we get.\n  We will hold this administration's feet to the fire. I will continue \nto be an aggressive advocate for moving us in the right direction \nbecause there is too much at stake to just trust that the President has \nlearned from his failures so far.\n  America is a strong nation, and Americans are a determined people. In \nour Nation's history, we have confronted adversity. We have dealt with \nthe challenges that have threatened our democracy. In each case, we had \na clear vision and a plan to get there. There were bumps in the road, \nbut at the times of our greatest need, America has come together with \nresolve and determination. Today is no different.\n  The American people are ready, and we are waiting for the President \nto face reality in Iraq and to give us a credible plan to win the war \nand win the peace.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to address my amendment No. 1831 to \nthe Iraq supplemental appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, today, our Nation faces three simultaneous challenges. \nThis amendment would address each.\n  First, we need to support our troops and protect our national \nsecurity. Second, we must not worsen our fiscal crisis. And third, we \nmust work to restore our ailing economy.\n  We are considering today a bill that, among other things, provides \nresources to support our troops.\n  Now many of my colleagues have made the case, and made it well, that \nour government could well have avoided the quagmire that has become \nIraq. And others of my colleagues have also made the case that the bill \nbefore us includes spending that is not appropriate for an emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill.\n  The merits of these disputes aside, that is not the subject of my \namendment. The bill before us includes funding that will help our \nfighting men and women who valiantly serve our Nation. For that reason, \nI, and I expect the vast majority of Senators, will support this bill.\n  But as I noted at the outset, our entanglements in Iraq and \nAfghanistan are not the only challenges that face our Nation. We also \nface crises of fiscal solvency. And we also face a stagnant economy. \nThis amendment would address these two challenges as well.\n  As would the amendment offered by my colleague from Delaware, Mr. \nBiden, my amendment would pay for the spending in the bill before us \ntoday. As was so ably argued by the Senator from Delaware, the two \nSenators from North Dakota, and others, our Nation faces a fiscal \ncrisis. Even for something as important as this bill, we must now seek \nto pay for what we do.\n  The Government's two most-authoritative estimators of our fiscal \ncondition, the President's Office of Management and Budget and the \nCongressional Budget Office, are agreed: The year just ended set an \nall-time record for budget deficits.\n  In its October Monthly Budget Review, CBO stated: ``The federal \ngovernment incurred a total budget deficit of about $374 billion for \nfiscal year 2003, CBO estimates, more than twice the deficit recorded \nin 2002.''\n  And OMB and CBO also agree that the deficit for the year just \nstarted, fiscal year 2004, will again set a record. This summer, OMB \nprojected this year's deficit at $475 billion. CBO projected it at $480 \nbillion. Either way, it will once more be the largest ever.\n  And these summer projections did not include all of the new funding \nthat we are debating today for the military occupation and \nreconstruction of Iraq. The bill before us today would provide $87 \nbillion in additional funding, beyond the $79 billion already approved \nin this spring's supplemental appropriations bill. Of this new funding, \nthe administration says $50 to $60 billion will spend out in fiscal \nyear 2004. This would raise OMB's projection for next year's deficit to \n$525 to $535 billion.\n  This number would be in line with private forecasts. For example, the \ninvestment firm of Goldman Sachs projects a $525 billion deficit next \nyear.\n  Now some say that we should ignore that these are record deficits \nbecause the numbers are smaller when compared to the size of the \neconomy. But these deficits are large even as a percent of the GDP.\n  A deficit of $535 billion this year would equal 4.7 percent of the \nGDP. This would be the same percent of the economy as was the record \n$290 billion deficit in 1992. It is close on the heels of\n\n[[Page S12813]]\n\nthe 4.8 percent to 5.1 percent deficits of the mid 1980s. And it is not \nfar from the all-time record 6.0 percent of fiscal year 1983.\n  And if one excludes Social Security surpluses from the calculation, \nas required by law, this year's deficit would be almost $700 billion. \nNot only would this set an all-time record in dollar terms, it would \nalso set an all-time record as a share of the economy.\n  Over the years to come, both OMB and CBO continue to project \nunacceptably large deficits. OMB projects deficits larger than $200 \nbillion for as far as it projects--the next 5 years.\n  And CBO's August report indicates that if one simply extends expiring \ntax provisions other than the bonus depreciation provision, reforms the \nalternative minimum tax, and spends the expected $400 billion on a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit, then the Government will still end \nthe next 10 years running a deficit of more than $400 billion a year.\n  In other words, if the Government simply stays on its current fiscal \ncourse, CBO projects that the Government will still be running \nunacceptably large deficits in 2013.\n  Under this realistic, indeed, conservative, scenario, over the next \n10 years, the Government will run deficits totaling nearly $4 trillion. \nAnd 10 years from now, the amount of Federal Government debt held by \nthe public will almost double, to nearly $8 trillion.\n  Again, private forecasters back up these scenarios. If anything, \ntheir projections are more pessimistic. The investment firm of Goldman \nSachs is projecting a $5.5 trillion 10-year deficit.\n  Using the CBO projections adjusted as I have discussed, from 2001 to \n2013, the Government will have piled up $4.6 trillion in debt held by \nthe public, or roughly $15,000 in debt for every man, woman, and child \nin America. Every American child born in 2013 will come into this world \nowing $15,000 more in taxes because of the economic decisions that the \nGovernment is making right now.\n  That $4.6 trillion in new debt will come in addition to the $3.3 \ntrillion in debt that we already owed in 2001. So that new baby born in \n2013 will have a total debt burden of roughly $26,000 hanging over his \nor her head.\n  And more and more of the Government's debt is being held by \nforeigners, like China. With this greater debt, we are transferring to \noverseas powers a greater ability to affect our economy.\n  And that level of debt means that by 2013, the Government will be \nspending roughly $400 billion on interest on the debt alone. Before the \nGovernment can choose to spend anything in 2013 on fighting terrorism \nor education or national defense, it will have to spend $400 billion--\nthat's about 11\\1/2\\ percent of the total budget--that is nearly 2\\1/2\\ \npercent of the entire country's economic output--just to pay the \ninterest on the debt that the Government will have accumulated by then.\n  But that is not all. If the Government stays on its current fiscal \ncourse and runs persistent and increasing budget deficits, it will \nincrease its borrowing requirements. It will increase the Government's \ndemand for money.\n  It will thus raise interest rates for mortgages, car loans, and \nstudent loans. It will thus lower economic growth. And it will thus \nlower the standard of living for millions of Americans.\n  Our Nation's high national debt and high deficits at the end of the \nnext 10 years will leave our Nation in a vulnerable fiscal condition at \nexactly the wrong time, as the baby boom generation starts to retire.\n  We know to a near certainty the number of people who will reach the \nage of 65 in 2013. Unlike the likely results of particular economic \npolicies, reasonable people cannot and do not disagree significantly \nover how many people were born in 1948--and thus over how many will be \neligible for Social Security and Medicare in 2013. We know that we have \na substantial budgetary challenge ahead of us, finding the money to pay \nfor the retirement needs of the baby boom generation.\n  If we head into the next decade with high deficits, the Government \nwill have no room to accommodate those retirement needs. The current \npolicy will thus leave the Government with fewer choices to respond to \nthe growing entitlement costs of the decades to come. The current \npolicy will thus leave us with the grim choice of raising taxes, \ncutting long-promised and much-needed benefits, or dramatically cutting \ndefense, education, and other core Government services.\n  So the first thing we need to do is to stop making things worse. We \nneed to bring back the rule of paying as we go.\n  And that is what this amendment would do. It would suspend some of \nthe tax cuts that Congress enacted earlier this year.\n  But my amendment would not do one thing that the amendment offered by \nmy colleague from Delaware would have done. My amendment would not \nalter any of the tax cuts that Congress enacted in 2001. It would only \naffect tax cuts enacted earlier this year.\n  My amendment makes this distinction because I--and many of my \ncolleagues--supported the 2001 tax cuts. We believed then and still \nbelieve that the tax law changes enacted in 2001 were important to our \neconomy. And these tax cuts are still important to our Nation's \neconomic growth. And so my amendment would not change them. Not at all.\n  Instead, it would postpone some of the tax cuts enacted earlier this \nyear. When these tax cuts were debated, we were at war with Iraq. I \nbelieve--and continue to believe--that it is irresponsible to enact tax \ncuts during a time of war. The very fact that we are here debating an \nadditional $87 billion for Iraq proves that.\n  This amendment would postpone some of the tax cuts that are targeted \nto wealthy individuals in order to pay for this $87 billion.\n  It would allow all of the funding in the underlying bill to go \nforward. It would thus support our troops.\n  It would pay for the spending in the bill. It would thus keep us from \nworsening our Nation's deficit crisis.\n  And it would pay for the spending in this bill without altering the \n2001 tax cuts. It would preserve the economically beneficial effects of \nthat tax cut in place. It would thus help our ailing economy.\n  I shall not press my amendment to a vote on this bill. The votes on \nthis bill are now clear. But I urge my colleagues to consider the \npolicies that I am seeking to advance with this amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, just this past April, I voted for the \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill authorizing $70 billion for \nour military operations in Iraq. I felt that funding was necessary at \nthe time. But I expected that the administration would move us toward a \nmultilateral approach, one that would take the burden off our troops \nand our taxpayers.\n  Now the President is asking for $87 billion more for Iraq.\n  While war inevitably carries great costs, both in terms of financial \nlosses and losses in human life, the American people and the families \nof our troops should not be alone in shouldering those costs and \nburdens.\n  We cannot afford to continue down this path without legitimate \nburden-sharing. Our troops are overstretched, our financial obligations \nare becoming more taxing by the day, needs at home are going unmet, and \nthe Federal deficit is absolutely soaring.\n  In Congress we have a responsibility to our constituents to debate \nand decide upon the path that is best for our country. We should not \nrubberstamp every proposal the administration puts forward, \nparticularly when lives are being lost.\n  The American people are not satisfied with the direction of this \ncountry. But all that the administration has offered so far is the \nstatus quo, another blank check for Congress to sign that offers no \nplan to genuinely decrease the strain on American resources.\n  That is why I supported an alternative proposed by Senator Byrd. The \nByrd amendment put the needs of our troops first by authorizing 100 \npercent of the funding requested for military operations, and requiring \nthe administration to gain commitments of funding and manpower from \nother nations to ease our Nation's incredible burden.\n  It also would have carefully reviewed the Iraq reconstruction \nprocess.\n  I also supported several worthy amendments that, if passed, would \nhave greatly improved this bill:\n  The Biden amendment to pay for the cost by reducing the Bush tax cuts \nfor the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans;\n  The Dorgan amendment to pay for the reconstruction of Iraq with Iraqi \noil revenues;\n\n[[Page S12814]]\n\n  The Dodd amendment to shift $322 million in funding for new Iraqi \nprisons to protective gear for our troops;\n  The Stabenow amendment to provide $5 billion in funding for important \nAmerican domestic priorities such as veterans health care, education, \ncommunity health centers, and transportation. This amendment was paid \nfor by delaying $5 billion of Iraq's reconstruction money to 2005.\n  Compared to this $87 billion that will be spent abroad, we are \nspending annually, $23.9 billion on veterans health care, $23.4 billion \non higher education, and $31.8 billion in total highway spending. Our \ndomestic priorities are going unmet.\n  I am pleased that my amendment to reimburse wounded soldiers for \nhospital meals was successful, as well as my amendment to call \nattention to the need to protect commercial aircraft from shoulder-\nfired missiles.\n  But basically, we are left with one huge $87 billion check which will \nbe used to continue a policy that has led to 194 American postwar \ndeaths and 903 Americans wounded in action to date.\n  Administration officials, including Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld \nand Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, repeatedly, and perhaps \neven deliberately, downplayed the cost of reconstructing Iraq. They \nclaimed that we would pay for this war with Iraqi oil revenues and with \nsupport from the other nations. They told us this would be easy.\n  No one is suggesting that we abandon our efforts in Iraq. The Byrd \nalternative responsibly addressed the situation in Iraq by proposing a \nroad map for success. It would have put an end to this blank check \npolicy and established a realistic and responsible plan for the future.\n  My decision to vote no on the $87 billion request and for the Byrd \namendment is a stand against the status quo and for a change in this \nadministration's go-it-alone, pay-it-alone strategy.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I do not support the administration's \npolicy in Iraq. After listening to the administration's hard sell, \nafter hearing a series of ever-shifting justifications for our policy, \nafter discovering that some of these justifications were of extremely \ndubious credibility, after confronting the administration's reluctance \nto straightforwardly acknowledge the costs and commitments entailed in \nthe occupation of a major Middle Eastern country, after watching the \nadministration alienate potential allies who could help us share this \nburden--after all of this, I do not support the notion that American \ntaxpayers should be saddled with astronomical burdens and tremendous \ndebt to support this misguided approach.\n  I wish our policy had been different. But I must deal with the \nreality before us today. The stakes are too high to do anything else.\n  I cannot oppose this bill. I cannot pull the rug out from under our \nbrave troops on the ground, who were called to serve and now find \nthemselves in harm's way, confronting suicide bombings and guerilla \nwarfare tactics. This bill contains resources that they need, and I \nwill cast my vote to get them those resources.\n  I also recognize that stability and reconstruction in Iraq are in our \nnational interest. For years now, I have urged my colleagues to \nrecognize the dangers inherent in weak and failing states around the \nworld. I have studied the appeal that such states hold to criminal \nopportunists, including terrorists. And I know that a weak or failing \nIraq would present a threat to this country. To abruptly pull the plug \non reconstruction, to leave Iraq to the disorder that filled the vacuum \nleft by the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime, would make us less safe, \nless secure.\n  So I will not vote against the final passage of this very problematic \nbill.\n  But I want to be very clear about two points. My vote does not \nsuggest that I am resigned to accepting the administration's policy. I \nam not, and I will continue to urge them to change it. That is my \nresponsibility as a Member of this body, and I will not abandon it.\n  My vote also does not mean that I will support future funding for the \nIraq mission if the administration fails to put that mission on a \nsounder footing. Over 330 U.S. troops have lost their lives in Iraq--\nand over 190 of those deaths occurred after the President declared an \nend to major military operations. Many more have been seriously \ninjured.\n  The administration has tried to argue that Iraq is the central \nbattlefield in the war on terror. I strongly disagree with that point \nof view. Iraq is at best a distraction from that war, which should be \nour country's main focus. At worst, our invasion and occupation of Iraq \nmay well turn out to be a major setback in our efforts to combat \nterror. The extremely well-respected International Institute for \nStrategic Studies recently released a report indicating that ``war in \nIraq has probably inflamed radical passions among Muslims and thus \nincreased al-Qaida's recruiting power and morale and, at least \nmarginally, its operating capability.''\n  I remember what the Vietnam war did to this country. I remember when \ngood people convinced themselves that they had to keep accepting \nterrible losses because of sunk costs, I remember those desperate and \ndestructive efforts to salvage the credibility of long-since \ndiscredited policy. Iraq is not Vietnam, but the lessons of history \nmust not be forgotten. Without a better plan, without burden sharing, \nwithout a clear strategic vision that refocuses on this country's first \nforeign policy priority--he fight against the terrorists who attacked \nthis country on September 11, 2001, and their allies--without these \nchanges, withdrawing from Iraq will be the right thing to do.\n  I would like to comment on one of the most contentious issues that \narose during the debate on the supplemental bill--the debate about \ngrants versus loans. This week I was unable to support the amendment \noffered by Senator Dorgan to the supplemental bill before the Senate. I \ndo not believe that it is in our national interest to have U.S. \nauthorities making decisions about how to use future Iraqi oil \nrevenues. On this point, the President is right. To do so would play \ninto the hands of those who would promote the ugliest, most distorted \nimages of American motives abroad, conjuring images of imperialism and \ncorruption, and undermining one of our greatest sources of strength \ninternationally--the compelling power of our principles and ideals.\n  But while the President is right about that point, he is wrong to \nplace this heavy burden almost entirely on the shoulders of American \ntaxpayers. I am by no means enthusiastic about financing Iraqi \nreconstruction with huge grants. Iraq's reconstruction needs should be \nmet, to the extent possible, by Iraqis themselves. But the decisions \nabout the use of Iraqi oil should be Iraqi choices, not decisions made \nby American occupation authorities.\n  That is why I was pleased to support the amendment offered by \nSenators Bayh and Nelson, which converted a portion of the grants to \nloans, and leverages this approach to encourage international debt \nforgiveness. This amendment did not involve any U.S. decisions about \nIraq's future oil revenues, rightly leaving those decisions to the \nIraqi people.\n  Once again, I urge the administration to take concrete steps to build \nmeaningful international support and ensure real burden-sharing in the \ninternational community. I was pleased to support the amendment offered \nby Senators Byrd and Kennedy, which called on the administration to \npresent a concrete and detailed plan for working with the rest of the \nworld to bring stability to Iraq. I am disappointed that the amendment \nwas defeated. The best way to avoid making unfair demands on the Iraqi \nand American peoples is to give our allies a meaningful role in the \ncountry and ask that they in turn contribute to reconstructing the \ncountry.\n  I am pleased that three amendments I offered to this bill were \nadopted. First, I offered an amendment to establish an inspector \ngeneral for the Coalition Provisional Authority, so that there will be \none auditing body completely focused on ensuring that taxpayer dollars \nare spent wisely and efficiently, and that this effort is free of \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. I am troubled by some of the seemingly \ninexplicable requests and figures contained in the administration's \nfunding request--the $6,000 phones, the state-of-the-art postal system, \nthe new monuments, all of them in an ``emergency'' request. At the very \nleast, we should take concrete steps to ensure that vigorous oversight \nand auditing mechanisms are in place to protect each and every taxpayer \ndollar.\n\n[[Page S12815]]\n\n  I also offered an amendment to help alleviate some of the \ndifficulties faced by families of military personnel deployed or \npreparing to deploy for a contingency operation. My amendment allows a \nspouse, son, daughter, or parent who already qualifies for benefits \nunder the Family and Medical Leave Act to use their benefits for issues \narising from one additional set of circumstances--the deployment of a \nfamily member. Our military families--be they active duty, Guard, or \nReserve--are coping with tremendous strains and a great deal of \nunpredictability. Longstanding childcare arrangements can be suddenly \nupended; in a matter of days, legal powers may need to br transferred \nto allow a spouse to maintain control of the home while his or her \npartner deploys. This amendment has been endorsed by the Military \nOfficers Association of America, the Enlisted Association of the \nNational Guard of the United States, and the National Partnership for \nWomen and Families. I am delighted that it was adopted, and I hope it \nbrings some measure of relief to the families who are sacrificing so \nmuch.\n  I was also pleased that two other amendments to help our Guard and \nReserve were adopted. One was an amendment offered by Senator Bill \nNelson to provide $10 million for the Family Readiness Program of the \nNational Guard. This program provides needed support services and \nassistance for Guard families prior to, during, and after deployment. \nAnd I was pleased to vote for an amendment offered by Senator Durbin, \nwhich also passed, that would ensure that Federal employees who take \nleave without pay in order to serve do not see a reduction in their \npay.\n  In addition, I thank the managers for accepting a very modest \namendment that I offered calling for the Coalition Provisional \nAuthority to regularly post up-to-date information in both English and \nArabic on its Web site about oil revenues, seized and frozen assets, \nand how these resources are spent. Recently the Advisory Group on \nPublic Diplomacy for the Arab and Muslim World reported on how much \nneeds to be done to address the inadequacies of our current public \ndiplomacy efforts. Making a good-faith effort to be transparent when it \ncomes to what is happening to Iraqi resources is just basic good sense, \nand that means making an effort to communicate in Arabic.\n  I believe that the amendments I have discussed are small steps in the \nright direction, but I remain deeply concerned about where the \nadministration's policy is leading us overall. I hear the concerns of \nmy constituents every day--constituents who wonder when their loved \nones in the military will come home, constituents concerned about the \nmassive deficit, constituents who feel betrayed by the mixed messages \nand shifting justifications of the administration. Voting on this bill \ndoes not mean that Congress can set aside the issue of Iraq. In fact, \nvoting on this bill should make it painfully clear to all of us--we \nhave a great deal of work to do to get our policy on a firm footing and \nwe cannot afford to wait any longer.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, 1 year ago, America was on the brink of \nwar. One year ago, Congress debated whether America should go it alone \nto confront Saddam Hussein or get international support to bring the \nworld with us. Now we are finishing work on the President's request for \n$87 billion for Iraq. Again we have debated whether we go it alone or \nfind a way to share the burden and the cost of war.\n  Today, I will vote in favor of the supplemental bill for Iraq and \nAfghanistan because I will not fail in my commitment to support our \ntroops and because the Senate voted to provide loans and not just \ngiveaways.\n  Through this debate, I fought for five principles I continue to \nbelieve are critical for the Iraq supplemental:\n  First, we need to support for our troops. The men and women putting \ntheir lives at risk to serve our country deserve our support.\n  Second, we need international burden sharing. If the stability of \nIraq is in the world's interest, then the world should help pay for the \nreconstruction.\n  Third, we need to give Iraq loans, not giveaways. Iraq has the \nworld's second-largest oil reserves and is capable of pumping out \nmillions of barrels a day. This oil revenue should help with the \nreconstruction.\n  Fourth, we need accountability and responsibility with the money we \nprovide. We need to stop waste, cronyism contracting and profiteering.\n  Fifth, we need for a plan to end the occupation of Iraq. There was a \nplan for war. Now we need a plan for peace.\n  I have used my voice and my vote in the Senate to stand up for these \nprinciples as we considered the supplemental bill.\n  America's Armed Forces are made up of ordinary men and women that are \ncalled upon to do extraordinary, difficult and dangerous things. Last \nyear, when we debated whether to send our troops to Iraq, I asked \nwhether they would be met with flowers or with land mines. Now we know. \nOur troops are at risk and they need our help. Our troops need \nequipment and gear, like modern body armor and replacement vehicles to \nhelp them complete their missions as safely as possible. Military \nfamilies need financial support to make ends meet.\n  The men and women putting their lives at risk to serve our country \ndeserve our support not just with words but with deeds. That Is why I \nvoted for amendments to increase combat pay, to end the practice of \ncharging wounded soldiers for hospital meals, and to improve veterans \nhealth care.\n  I believe we need international burden sharing to share the risks and \nshare the costs of occupying and rebuilding Iraq. We need more troops, \nbut not more American troops. We need more money, but not just American \nmoney. Last year, when we debated the war, I voted to go to the United \nNations, to have international legitimacy and international burden-\nsharing. If the stability of Iraq is in the world's interest, then the \nworld should help pay for the reconstruction. That is why I voted 12 \ntimes for amendments to promote greater burden sharing.\n  Wherever possible, American aid should be loans, not give-aways. Iraq \nhas the world's second-largest oil reserves. Iraqi oilfields are \nalready producing close to 2 million barrels a day. That means billions \nof dollars a year in oil revenue. According to Ambassador Bremer, by \n2005 Iraq will produce enough oil to take care of its basic needs and \nhave additional funds.\n  Congress already provided $75 billion for Iraq last April. It also \nincluded $2.5 billion for Iraq relief and reconstruction. That was \ngrant aid. Now the President wants to give Iraq another $20 billion. A \nbetter solution would have been to loan Iraq the money and have it \nrepaid from Iraq's oil.\n  The facts are simple: There is a loan. $87 billion is added to our \nnational debt. The question is whether the American taxpayer must pay \nit back or whether the Iraqi people will pay some of it back with their \noil.\n  That is why I cosponsored amendments to provide loans rather than \ngrants. I am so glad the Senate voted to make $10 billion of the aid \nloans. These loans would only be forgiven if the rest of the world \nforgives its loans to Iraq.\n  We need to safeguard our troops and safeguard our money. We need \nresponsibility and accountability to stop waste, cronyism contracting \nand profiteering. We need to use American taxpayer dollars to invest in \nAmerica. That is why I supported an amendment to require full and open \ncompetition for contracts in Iraq. That is why I voted for an amendment \nto end cronyism contracting by preventing these funds from going to a \ncompany in which the President or Vice President or a cabinet member \nhas a financial interest.\n  The administration must lay out a plan to end the occupation of Iraq. \nThere was a plan for war. Now we need a plan for peace. The American \npeople deserve full disclosure and a real assessment of where we are \ngoing and how long we will be there. We must not let Iraq turn into a \nquagmire. We cannot just send more money and more troops with no end in \nsight. The President needs to present a clear exit strategy. That is \nwhy I voted for an amendment to require a comprehensive plan for Iraqi \nreconstruction to include goals and timelines.\n  I worked to fulfill my principles on this bill: to support our \ntroops. International burden sharing; loans, not giveaways; \naccountability; and the need for a plan to end the occupation of Iraq.\n\n[[Page S12816]]\n\n  Marylanders are patriotic people, willing to do what's necessary to \ndefend our country and help other people when we can. But they have \nchildren to educate, parents to support, houses to buy and retirements \nto fund. It is not fair to ask them to pay for the rebuilding of Iraq \njust because this administration made critical mistakes in foreign \npolicy.\n  I am going to vote for this bill because I will fulfill my commitment \nto America's men and women in uniform, who are risking their lives for \nthe American people in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I will continue to press for an exit strategy to bring our troops \nhome. I will continue to fight for greater accountability. I will \ncontinue to demand that President Bush bring in other nations to share \nthe burden, to share the risks by sending troops to Iraq and to share \nthe costs by contributing to Iraq's reconstruction.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I have said many times, and I will say it \nagain, it is critical that we succeed in Iraq. But it is equally \nimportant that we do the job the right way--the way that best protects \nour troops on the ground, enhances our security, and shields the \nAmerican taxpayer from undue burden. President Bush's approach fails \nthis test.\n  I support our troops in Iraq--and their mission. I believe we must do \nour part to reconstruct Iraq and make it a force for peace and \nstability in the region. I am prepared to spend whatever it takes to \nwin the peace. But I want to spend that money responsibly and \neffectively--pursuant to a strategy that will maximize our prospects \nfor success through greater internationalization and burden sharing and \nprovide the transparency and accountability that American taxpayers \nexpect and deserve when we spend their hard-earned money. I want to be \nsure that the financial costs are distributed, in the spirit of shared \nsacrifice, among those Americans who can best afford to pay. \nUnfortunately, the President and his advisers disagree.\n  I cannot vote for the President's $87 billion request because his is \nnot the most effective way to protect American soldiers and to advance \nour interests. Simple common sense tells us that we need more countries \nsharing the burden and more troops on the ground providing security. We \nneed a fairer way to pay the bill.\n  I had hoped that the Administration would prepare for building the \npeace in Iraq as well as it prepared for fighting the war. But that was \nnot the case.\n  Over eager to rush to war, the administration failed to plan \nadequately or effectively for the peace. American forces are being \ntargeted daily by remnants of Saddam Hussein's Ba'athist regime, newly \narrived terrorists hoping to capitalize on anti-American sentiment, or \na combination of both. The attacks are becoming more lethal and more \nsophisticated, and increasingly the attackers are going for high \nprofile targets associated with us or our allies. But the \nadministration played down or, worse yet, ignored the likelihood of \nthis kind of resistance when planning for the postwar period.\n  It low-balled the number of forces that would be needed to seize the \nalleged WMD sites for which we fought the war, to protect the \ninfrastructure needed for reconstruction, or to contain civil unrest. \nIt failed to put together a meaningful military coalition to help us \nmeet these needs.\n  The administration underestimated the magnitude of the reconstruction \ntask and, as we now know, misrepresented the ease with which oil would \nflow for rebuilding. It refused to tell the American people up front \nthe long-term costs of winning the peace. And it refused, until \nrecently, to ask the international community to join us in this very \ndifficult endeavor.\n  This administration's brazen go-it-alone policy has placed our \nsoldiers at unnecessary risk and our hopes for success in jeopardy. It \nhas turned American liberators into occupiers in the eyes of many \nIraqis. It has created a terrorist presence in Iraq where none \npreviously existed and made Iraq a recruiting poster for terrorists of \nthe future. It has undermined the legitimacy of our efforts at home, \nabroad, and in Iraq. And it has left Iraqis wondering when they will \nget their country back. We cannot continue on this course. The stakes \nare too high--for our troops, for the Iraqi people, for the region, and \nfor American security.\n  A year ago when we were debating the use of force resolution for \nIraq, I said: ``If we do go to war with Iraq, we have an obligation to \nthe Iraqi people, and to other nations in the region, to help create an \nIraq that is a force for stability and openness in the region.'' That \nobligation is upon us. We are now committed--as a result of our \nmilitary victory and postwar occupation to building a democratic Iraq \nthat is reasonably secure and economically viable. Our credibility and \nour interests demand that we succeed.\n  Successful reconstruction of Iraq is critical to peace and stability \nin the Mideast and to the security of Israel, our closest ally in that \nvolatile region. We cannot allow Iraq to become a failed state or let \nthe Ba'athists return to turn their wrath once again on innocent \nIraqis. We must not allow Iraq to be fragmented into mini-states, \nwarring with one another and further destabilizing the region. Nor can \nIraq be dominated by Iran or any other state in the region. Success in \nIraq is also crucial to our war on terrorism. The terrorist violence \nwhich has emerged in the wake of our military victory in Iraq poses a \nmajor challenge, but it is one we must meet. Iraq cannot become a \nterrorist sanctuary like Afghanistan, either as a platform for al-Qaida \nor Israeli-directed violence.\n  It is imperative that we succeed in Iraq, but to do so, we have to \ntackle the challenge of rebuilding Iraq an effective way, not the Bush \nadministration's failed way. We need a detailed plan, including fixed \ntimetables and costs, for establishing civil, economic and political \nsecurity in Iraq.\n  We need to internationalize both the military and civilian sides of \nthe occupation and build a coalition that will provide tangible \nassistance in terms of boots on the ground and money in the coffers for \nIraqi reconstruction. Only in this way will we reduce the risk to \nAmerican service members and alleviate some of the financial burden on \nthe American taxpayer for reconstruction.\n  We have to give the United Nations a clearly defined, central role in \nthe reconstruction of Iraq and in the process of establishing a new \nIraqi Government, and we must provide the necessary security so that \nU.N. personnel will go back to Iraq. The United Nations is not perfect, \nbut it has far more experience and capacity in these areas than the \nPentagon and the Coalition Provisional Authority. The process of \nreconstructing Iraq and its political system must be an international \nprocess--not an American process. Only then will it have legitimacy in \nthe eyes of the Iraqi people and the world.\n  We have to involve Iraqis more in the process of rebuilding their \ncountry and assure them through concrete steps that political power and \nresponsibility will be transferred to them as quickly as possible.\n  The administration, albeit belatedly, has recognized that we need \nhelp in Iraq. The resolution adopted this week by the U.N. Security \nCouncil is a step in the right direction. It will provide greater \ninternational legitimacy to our efforts in Iraq. It does require that \nthe Iraqi Governing Council lay out by December 15 of this year a \ntimetable and program for the drafting of a constitution and national \nelections, but this resolution does not fundamentally change the lines \nof authority and responsibility for the reconstruction and governance \nof Iraq. It is really more show than substance. Whether it will gain \nmeaningful international support for our efforts in Iraq remains to be \nseen but the prospects do not look good. Already three of our allies \nwho voted for it--Russia, France and Germany--have indicated that they \nwill not provide troops or funds to support our efforts. And Pakistan, \nwhich had been expected to provide troops once a resolution was passed, \nhas now declined. If he is serious about generating funds and troops \nfor the operation in Iraq, President Bush must see this resolution as \nthe beginning of a process of diplomacy--not the end.\n  The President is asking us to give him $87 billion for Iraq. As we \ndecide whether or not to vote for this package, there are some \nfundamental questions each of us should be asking.\n  First, what is it for? Much of it some $66 billion is for our troops \non the ground. Another $20 billion is supposed\n\n[[Page S12817]]\n\nto be for reconstruction of basic services, such as water, sewer, and \nelectricity, and for training Iraqi security forces. It also includes \n$82 million to protect Iraq's 36 miles of coast line, new prisons at a \ncost of $50,000 per bed, a witness protection program at a cost of $1 \nmillion per family, nearly $3 million for pickup trucks at a cost of \n$33,000 each, $2 million for museums and memorials, and a whopping $9 \nmillion for a state-of-the-art postal service. I could go on, but the \npoint is obvious: This supplemental is padded with requests that go far \nbeyond Iraq's emergency needs.\n  Second, who reaps the benefit of this $20 billion for reconstruction? \nOn one level, of course, it is the Iraqi people. But let's not fool \nourselves. Halliburton and other select American companies with close, \nhigh-level connections to the Bush administration are getting the \nlion's share of the contracts funded by this money. No one can object \nto giving contracts to American firms, but those contracts ought to be \noffered on a competitive, open bid basis. And at a minimum, these firms \nshould be required to seek subcontractors from outside of the United \nStates including Iraqi companies where feasible. Opening and \ninternationalizing the contracting process would provide much-needed \ntransparency and give others in the international community a stake in \nthe success of the reconstruction process.\n  Third, what is the plan for spending the $20 billion? We don't really \nknow because the administration has only given us a set of goals and \nvague timetables--not a detailed plan. The President wants us to give \nhim $87 billion on faith. His administration has failed miserably in \nanticipating the risks to our troops, planning for the peace, and \nbuilding international support for our effort. Why should we trust him \nnow?\n  Fourth, how does President Bush intend to pay for rebuilding Iraq? He \nwants to saddle future generations of American taxpayers with the bill \nby adding to the Federal deficit. This is fundamentally unfair. There \nis a better way--the one Senator Biden and I offered when we proposed \nthat the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans be repealed. At a time \nwhen men and women in uniform are sacrificing for our interests in \nIraq, it is only fair to ask those Americans who can afford it to do \ntheir fair share, but President Bush's refusal to accept this approach \nbetrays the spirit of shared sacrifice that has made our nation great.\n  Fifth, what is the urgency for rushing forward with such a large \nproposal now? There isn't one. Ambassador Bremer, the head of the \nCoalition Provisional Authority, has told us that his funds for \nreconstruction will last until the end of the year. Whether or not Iraq \ncan absorb $20 billion over the next year is another question. The \nWorld Bank recently estimated that Iraq could absorb only $5.2 billion \nin reconstruction funds for next year. Instead of rushing to complete \nthis bill, the administration should be doing more of the hard work of \ndiplomacy to generate contributions from other countries and to \ngenerate a more accurate assessment of what Iraq's real needs are over \nthe next year.\n  Finally, it is incumbent upon us to ask what needs at home are \nunderfunded? The answer is: plenty, including health care, education \nand homeland security.\n  The President must be held accountable and he must change course. \nWhile he may still salvage success in Iraq, the question we must ask \nis: at what cost--in terms of dollars and lives? We should do this the \nright way. We can win the peace in Iraq but we cannot--and should not--\ndo it alone. Our troops on the ground deserve a strategy that will take \nthe target off their backs and bring them home more quickly. The \nAmerican people deserve a strategy that decreases the bill, pays our \ncosts fairly, and makes America safer. We must have a new approach, one \nthat maximizes international cooperation and burden sharing and \nminimizes the risk of failure. If the President adopts that new \napproach, I will gladly support any proposal that funds it.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is with great frustration that I come \nhere today to address the President's request for an additional $87 \nbillion to pay for the war in Iraq and to confront the aftermath of \nthis conflict.\n  One year ago, I addressed this body, arguing against the notion that \nIraq posed an imminent threat to the United States. I feared that the \nadministration's single-minded obsession with Iraq would cost American \nlives, poison our relations around the world, divert resources from the \nreal war on terror, and deal a crippling blow to critical domestic \nneeds. I pleaded with the administration to work with the international \ncommunity to address the Iraqi problem in a cooperative manner. I urged \nmy colleagues not to grant the President a blank check to launch a \nreckless, unilateral, preemptive attack against Iraq.\n  Those words fell on deaf ears. The President got his blank check, and \nwe now have to deal with the consequences. While the military campaign \nin Iraq was predictably swift and effective, the aftermath is a mess. \nIt is now obvious that there was a shameful lack of planning for \nanything beyond the initial war, leaving us in a much worse position \nthan predicted. Our military is suffering daily losses. The Iraqi \npopulation is increasingly restive and hostile. Terrorists are flowing \ninto the region, eager to take a shot at American forces and undermine \nour reconstruction efforts. Longtime allies are so put off by the \nadministration's arrogant approach to this war that they are reluctant \nto lend a hand when we, and the people of Iraq, so clearly need the \nassistance.\n  Through it all, the administration has refused to give straight \nanswers to the Congress or the American people. It has misrepresented \nintelligence on the threat posed by Iraq. It has dodged the issue of \nhow much the war and Iraq's reconstruction will cost. And it has \nrefused to provide Congress with a detailed plan for post-war political \nand economic reconstruction.\n  Now the President is back before the Congress, asking for what I \nbelieve amounts to another blank check. Our economy is in dire straits. \nOur schools are woefully underfunded. Millions of Americans are seeking \nwork, and many have given up trying. The number of people without \nhealth insurance is soaring. This Nation's budget deficit is spiraling \nout of control, in no small part because of huge tax cuts for the \nwealthiest Americans pushed through by this administration. \nNevertheless, while the President seeks to reduce funding for pressing \nneeds at home, he urges the Congress to quickly pass his $87 billion \nrequest for Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Just like a year ago, we are presented with incomplete plans for how \nthe money will be spent. We have not been provided with detailed \ninformation on steps the administration is taking to involve the \ninternational community in the reconstruction effort. Moreover, we are \ntreated to blank stares when we seek concrete answers on how much more \nthis occupation and reconstruction will cost and how long our men and \nwomen will be stationed on the ground in Iraq.\n  Ambassador Bremer testified recently concerning the administration's \nplan for rebuilding Iraq. This plan is striking in its failure to \naddress the most critical issues. It is silent on the size of the U.S. \ntroop commitment, a timetable for the return of U.S. troops, the \nfinancial or troop contributions we might expect from other nations, \nand the short-term and long-term costs associated with the U.S. \ninvasion of Iraq. Beyond that, the plan makes assumptions that are so \nunduly optimistic that they call into question the credibility of other \nkey elements of the plan. For example, the plan assumes that U.S. \nforces will defeat internal armed threats and deter external aggression \nand subversion by the end of October. That is 2 weeks from now. Anyone \nwho reads a newspaper or watches TV would have difficulty believing \nthis will happen. This plan seems based upon the notion that merely \nopening the spigot of taxpayer dollars will ultimately overcome \nwhatever shortcomings may exist in our policies toward Iraq.\n  We have it in our power to do something about this situation. This \nSenate must demand answers to these critical questions. It has learned \nthe hard way the consequences of granting this administration a blank \ncheck in Iraq. Enough is enough. Additional funding for Iraq should be \nwithheld until the administration develops and presents a \ncomprehensive, credible plan that details how the money will be spent, \nhow\n\n[[Page S12818]]\n\nthe administration plans to broaden the international involvement in \nreconstructing Iraq, how much more this operation will cost, and when \nour military men and women will come home to their families. We owe at \nleast that much to the American people. And we owe it to our brave \nforces on the ground in Iraq.\n  As a former officer in the U.S. Navy, I know firsthand the importance \nof supporting our troops and have great respect and admiration for \ntheir efforts. On the whole, American military personnel have done an \noutstanding job of providing leadership and direction in countless \nIraqi communities in the wake of the collapse of Saddam Hussein's \nregime. Our officer corps has received widespread praise for their wise \nand humane conduct in a role for which they received little \npreparation. I am proud of many Vermonters' unsung acts of bravery, \nleadership and humanity. RADM Barry Costello of Rutland, VT, served \nwith distinction and played a pivotal role in Operation Iraqi Freedom \nas the Commander of the U.S.S. Constellation battle group. But Vermont \nhas also suffered great losses. We grieve for Mark Evnin of South \nBurlington, Eric Halverson of Bennington, Kyle Gilbert of Brattleboro, \nand Justin Garvey of Proctor, VT. My heart goes out to their families. \nThey are but 4 of over 350 American troops killed since the war began.\n  We cannot continue to accept such losses. We need to make decisions \nthat will help our troops in the long run. It is our job to ensure that \nscarce resources are being spent wisely, and it is our responsibility \nto demand something better than the floundering postwar effort we have \nseen to date. Writing a blank check for Iraq does a disservice to our \nmilitary if there is no coherent plan for securing the peace and \nbringing them home.\n  Meanwhile, the war in Iraq has distracted the United States from the \nreal fight against terrorism, an issue of critical importance to \nAmerican security. We have reduced our forces in Afghanistan and lost \nfocus in our hunt for Osama bin Laden. As a result, the stabilization \nand reconstruction of Afghanistan have suffered serious setbacks in \nrecent months. One could even argue that the U.S. invasion of Iraq \nactually created an opening for terrorists. Osama bin Laden had long \ntargeted Saddam Hussein, whose secularism he loathed. There is no \nevidence that Iraq under Saddam Hussein had any significant connection \nwith al-Qaida, even though the Bush administration has tried hard to \nlink the two. Ironically, in the chaos that has followed the collapse \nof Baath Party rule, Iraq has now become a haven for terrorists who see \nan opportunity to strike against U.S. forces.\n  For over 50 years, America's Presidents have led the world in \nconstructing a web of relationships and institutions that have \nsucceeded in promoting peace, stability, and respect for the rights of \neach and every human being on the face of this Earth. They worked \nclosely with allies to meet common threats and they supported the \nUnited Nations and other world bodies as mechanisms that fit naturally \nwith our goals of promoting freedom, trade and democracy around the \nworld.\n  This administration has turned its back on the work of the last 50 \nyears. This administration has demonstrated time after time that it has \nneither the patience nor the will to engage in real consultations with \nallies and world bodies such as the U.N. President Bush and his \nadministration frequently assert that the attacks of September 11 made \nthe world a different place. Their response has been to abandon long-\nheld American policies and justify radical new approaches like the \ndoctrine of preemptive war. I disagree wholeheartedly with this \nresponse. While the attacks of September 11 were a horrific, senseless \nact of evil, they have not diminished the value of the international \nstructure that America and its allies have worked to build since the \nclose of World War II. The new challenges are different, but now more \nthan ever, they demand a strong and unified international community. \nThey demand more international cooperation, not less.\n  The United States needs its traditional allies and it needs the U.N. \nIt needs them to ensure that the situation in Iraq does not continue to \nslide toward an American occupation and to help defray the costs and \nchallenges associated with rebuilding a deeply troubled nation. It \nneeds them to undercut assertions that the primary interest of the \nUnited States is in controlling Iraqi oil. Moreover, America needs its \nallies and the U.N. because we have too many pressing needs at home to \ncontinue hemorrhaging money in Iraq.\n  Having spurned the international community on the way to war in Iraq, \nthe administration must be prepared to go the extra mile to enlist \ninternational support at this hour. We must be prepared to cede \nmeaningful control over the political and economic rebuilding of Iraq. \nAnd we must do more than adopt the ``join us if you want'' approach the \nPresident set forth in his recent speech to the U.N. President Bush is \ncorrect when he says that it is in the world's interest to join with us \nin working toward the reconstruction of Iraq. Our longtime allies and \nother countries around the world are equally correct, however, when \nthey ask for a measure of control over their efforts. While I am \nencouraged that the U.N. Security Council stands ready to approve a \nresolution backing American plans for reconstruction of Iraq, this may \nbe too little too late. Our closest allies still have deep reservations \nabout how we have conducted ourselves thus far in Iraq, and it remains \nto be seen if any of them will contribute any significant funds or any \ntroops at all. Meanwhile, because of the worsening security situation, \nthe U.N. has been forced to withdraw nearly all of the 600 employees it \nhad in Iraq just a couple months ago. There must be a turn-around in \ncurrent conditions on the ground before most international relief \norganizations can do any effective work in most of the country.\n  We are caught in a real bind. Iraq clearly needs our help. Yet the \nAmerican economy is hurting and basic domestic needs are crying out for \nfunding. While asking for $87 billion more for the war in Iraq, the \nPresident's proposed budget shortchanges his No Child Left Behind \ninitiative by $6.2 billion. Special education will receive less than \nhalf of what it is authorized by law to receive. The President has \nproposed cutting $400 million in afterschool programs, and has \nundermined efforts to make up for the shortfall in early education \nfunding. Pell grants now cover only 40 percent of the cost of attending \na 4-year public college, whereas in 1975 they covered approximately 84 \npercent of the cost. Our entire Department of Education receives only \n$53 billion.\n  The list goes on and on, and it speaks to an administration with \nmisplaced priorities. While the administration seeks $87 billion for \nIraq, water quality grants have been reduced by 32 percent, \nenvironmental enforcement staff has been cut by 6 percent, and funding \nfor land acquisition and conservation has been reduced by 50 percent. \nThe entire Department of Homeland Security is receiving less than half \nof what the President seeks in this bill. Meanwhile, our borders are \nporous, and first responders in our State and local governments are \nstarved of resources. The administration seeks $87 billion for Iraq \nwhen there are over 1.1 million Americans who have exhausted their \nunemployment benefits without finding a job and the President's \nsupporters in Congress have refused to extend their benefits.\n  Meanwhile, tax cuts weighed heavily in favor of our most wealthy \ncitizens are driving up the deficit and politically well-connected \nfirms such as Halliburton and Bechtel are reaping millions from no-bid \ncontracts handed out by the administration.\n  Just as the President must live up to his responsibilities, so must \nthe Congress. It has a corresponding responsibility to the American \npeople, and to our military forces, to demand from the administration a \ncredible plan for bringing U.S. involvement in Iraq to an end and for \nbringing U.S. troops home. The Congress must demand that the \nadministration develop a plan for involving other countries in the \nprocess. We must have a credible, detailed plan for turning over \npolitical and military control to the Iraqis. And the Congress must \ndemand a credible, detailed projection of the costs associated with our \ncontinuing presence in Iraq. Previous administration statements and \ntestimony on these subjects have been markedly lacking in candor.\n\n[[Page S12819]]\n\n  This is the largest supplemental funding request in my memory. \nClearly, our military must have the funding needed to carry out its \ntasks. I also realize that our own security will be damaged if \nreconstruction efforts in Iraq are not successful. Yet this is the \nmoment for Congress to demand answers to these critical questions, \nrather than simply hand the administration another blank check to \npursue its policies in Iraq. We must get our efforts on the right track \nbefore it is too late.\n  I am left with no choice but to oppose this bill. Anything less does \na disservice to the men and women of our military and to the American \npublic.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there are very many things in the Emergency \nSupplemental Appropriations for Iraq and Afghanistan Security and \nReconstruction bill with which I strongly disagree. For example, I \nobject to the virtually unfettered ability of administration officials \nto move dollars from one classification of Iraqi relief and \nreconstruction to other classifications. And I object to Ambassador \nBremer's unilateral approach to spend U.S. taxpayer's money on such \nthings as zip codes for Iraq, expensive business school scholarships, \nand a honey pot for high-priced U.S. consultants.\n  Nevertheless, I will vote in favor of this bill. I do so in order to \nprovide $67 billion to support the American troops who are in harm's \nway in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere. And I do so because the \nSenate wisely decided last night to provide one-half of the funding for \nIraqi reconstruction as a loan, which could become a grant only if 90 \npercent of Iraq's bilateral debt was forgiven. I have long maintained \nthat Iraqis must have a stake in the reconstruction of their own \ncountry and Iraqis must have a say in decisions that affect their \nfuture. The Bayh, et al., amendment gives them the investment in their \nown future that is so important to them and to us.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago the Senate began debate on \nPresident Bush's $87 billion emergency funding request for Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Since that time, many amendments have been considered by \nthis body. Most of them have failed largely along partisan lines. That \nis unfortunate in my view. After all, we are talking about spending 87 \nbillion American taxpayer dollars, and this during a time when so many \nof our national priorities remain unaddressed. Our education system, \nour health care system, and our homeland security priorities are all \ndrastically underfunded. More and more Americans are finding themselves \nout of work. Certainly we need to continue to support our troops in \nIraq and to assist the Iraqi people to rebuild their country. But we \ncan't do this alone and ignore the vital domestic needs that so many \nAmericans are today facing.\n  About a month ago, I rose in this Chamber to share my thoughts about \nUnited States policy toward Iraq. I did so shortly after President \nBush's September 7th televised address to the Nation on the same \nsubject. In that speech, the President was candid with the American \npeople about what we should expect in Iraq, namely that it is going to \nbe ``difficult and costly'' to rebuild that country and to bring \ndemocracy to a people who have had no tradition of political freedom or \nself-determination.\n  This Senator welcomed the President's honest assessment of what we \nare likely to be facing in Iraq. It was a positive change from the \ndoublespeak and ``non-answers'' that the Congress and the American \npeople have been hearing from some officials in the administration \nsince before the outset of our military engagement in that country.\n  Of course, what the President told us wasn't news. The difficulty and \nthe cost of our involvement are painfully apparent. More than 150,000 \ncoalition forces remain in Iraq 5 months after the President declared \nthe end to major hostilities. One hundred and thirty thousand of those \nmen and women are Americans. And every day there are reports of yet \nanother American service man or woman being killed.\n  With the approval of this $87 billion emergency supplemental, the \nUnited States will have committed more than 150 billion of American \ntaxpayers' dollars in a matter of months for our missions in Iraq and \nAfghanistan--the vast majority of those sums for the Iraq mission.\n  In light of those statistics, who could disagree with the President \nthat our mission in Iraq has become difficult and costly--both \nmonetarily and in human terms. I only question why it took our \nPresident so long to come to that realization. In fact, it now appears \nthat estimates of human and monetary costs that were formerly \ndiscounted by the Bush administration--statements made by Army General \nEric Shinseki and the President's former Chief Economic Advisor \nLawrence Lindsey--might not have been so far off the mark.\n  During his most recent address to the Nation, President Bush also \nexplained, in simple terms, United States policy objectives: destroy \nterrorists, enlist the support of other nations for a free Iraq, and \nhelp Iraqis assume responsibility. He was less clear on how he intends \nto achieve those objectives, or to mitigate the myriad of costs to the \nAmerican people.\n  That is why many of our colleagues who have spoken on the floor have \ndecried the fact that at the very time we are being asked to approve \n$87 billion in additional money for the military and reconstruction \ncosts of Iraq and Afghanistan, the administration has yet to lay out a \nclear plan for how any of the objectives mentioned by the President are \nto be achieved. Perhaps progress is now possible in internationalizing \nthe rebuilding of Iraq. I take note in particular of yesterday's \nunanimous U.N. Security Council vote in support of the United States-\nsponsored resolution on Iraq. However, it is important to remember that \nthis resolution is only the first step toward achieving a broad \ninternational coalition with additional governments and international \norganizations willing to share the burden of this difficult and costly \noccupation.\n  Our military has done an exemplary job in winning the war. They \nshould be commended. But they also need help winning the peace. Our \nforces are stretched thin and our troops are tired. Tragically, more \nthan 332 American military personnel have now died in Iraq, 1,511 have \nbeen wounded, and 335 have sustained other injuries. One hundred and \ntwenty of those deaths were unrelated to hostile fire dehydration, auto \naccidents, and other causes.\n  These deaths have prompted legitimate questions about the adequacy of \nthe equipment our troops have been provided for the hostile environment \nbeing encountered. Efforts by the U.S. Army to address some of these \nequipment shortcomings have not been fully funded in the pending \nlegislation. That is the Army's assessment--not mine.\n  That is why I offered an amendment on October 2, to transfer $300 \nmillion from Iraqi reconstruction funds to U.S. Army accounts for the \npurchase of equipment vital to the safety of our troops or to reimburse \nthem for equipment they were forced to buy for themselves. In the \nbroader scope of things, I continue to believe that those few hundred \nmillion dollars were a mere drop in the bucket. But this drop could \nhave helped protect and provide our troops with hydration and other \nlifesaving equipment that they need. I was very disappointed that my \namendment failed, largely along partisan lines, because I strongly \nbelieve that the first and most important priority of this funding bill \nshould be to protect our troops.\n  United States liberation of Iraq has not ended the suffering of the \nIraqi people. They continue to suffer, and they are frustrated as well. \nWhile the decades of fear and brutality perpetrated by the dictatorial \nregime of Saddam Hussein are now gone, uncertainty and hardship \ncontinue despite the best efforts of U.S. Ambassador Paul Bremer and \nmembers of the Coalition Provisional Authority. And this uncertainty \nand hardship have brought resentment--resentment against U.S. forces, \nresentment against the U.N. mission headquartered in Baghdad, \nresentment between and within local communities.\n  That resentment has brought with it increasing acts of violence.\n  While I have not yet had an opportunity to make a first-hand \nassessment of the situation in Iraq, many who have believe that \nsecurity remains the most immediate and pressing challenge confronting \nthe Provisional Coalition\n\n[[Page S12820]]\n\nAuthority. It is my hope that the monies contained in this legislation \nfor our troops, coupled with the $5 billion allocated to assemble and \ntrain Iraqi police and security forces will improve the security \nclimate so that the road is clear for the equally difficult task of \nrebuilding the country. I fully support those elements of the \nsupplemental request.\n  However, I have serious questions about some of the so-called \nreconstruction priorities that the administration intends to pursue \nonce the emergency supplemental is approved--projects that the \nadministration has identified as high priorities in need of immediate \nfunding. A number of these misplaced priorities have been mentioned \nduring the course of this debate. Let me remind my colleagues of some \nof these:\n  No. 1, a $100 million witness protection program for 100 Iraqi \nfamilies--that is $1 million per family;\n  No. 2, two maximum security prisons at a total cost of $400 million--\n$50,000 per prison bed;\n  No. 3, $15 million for the purchase of computers, with a price tag of \n$3,000 per computer;\n  No. 4, $20 million for 4 weeks of business training classes at \n$10,000 per student; and\n  No. 5, $30 million to teach English as a second language to Iraqis.\n  These are just a few of the questionable spending priorities embedded \nin the measure before us.\n  I supported President Bush last year when he sought authority from \nCongress to use all necessary means to secure Iraq's compliance with \nU.N. resolutions. But even while doing so I was deeply concerned that \nabsent broad international support for preemptively removing Saddam \nHussein, the American taxpayer and our troops would be left holding the \nbag when the time came to win the peace in Iraq. That concern has \nproven well placed.\n  Indeed, I am not only troubled by the so-called emergency programs \nthat I just mentioned; what concerns me even more is that we all know \nthat Iraq is going to need more money--above and beyond this current \nrequest. A lot more. Yet despite the recent U.N. Security Council \nresolution, many doubts remain as to the administration's willingness \nor ability to ensure that other governments and international \norganizations will begin to share some of those future costs.\n  The President did not listen to those of us who cautioned him about \nthe implications of removing Saddam Hussein unilaterally. This debate \ngives him a second chance to listen to similar concerns being \narticulated about attempting to unilaterally deliver democracy to Iraq. \nWithout significant and meaningful help from others we risk an even \nmore ``costly and difficult'' engagement in Iraq than the President has \ncontemplated. Equally serious, the President risks losing the support \nof the American people for his policy. Without that support continued \nU.S. involvement will not be sustainable.\n  During consideration of this legislation, Members of this Congress \nhave taken certain steps to press the administration on the issue of \nburden sharing. These were not partisan efforts because this is not a \npartisan issue. It is not partisan to insist that the President not \nhave a blank check to pay for all of Iraq's reconstruction. It is sound \nfiscal policy. Quite simply, we cannot afford to write endless checks \nfor this purpose.\n  Even before the administration's supplemental request, the \nCongressional Budget Office had calculated that the annual budget \ndeficit would reach $480 billion--the largest in history. Over the past \n3 years, 3.2 million Americans have lost their jobs--44,000 alone in \nJuly. So there are clearly pressing needs at home that remain unmet. We \ncould do a lot with an additional $20 billion on the domestic side of \nthe Federal ledger.\n  We could do a lot in the area of health care: $20 billion could \nprovide health coverage for approximately 1.3 million Americans; \ncurrent Medicare prescription drug proposals include large gaps in \ncoverage; the $20 billion could be used to close those gaps; and $20 \nbillion would provide Medicaid coverage for an additional 300,000 \nchildren, adults, senior citizens, and individuals with disabilities.\n  We could do a lot in addressing our Nation's education shortfalls: \n$8.5 billion would fully fund No Child Left Behind; $6.15 billion would \nfully fund title I programs--programs to help our poorest schools \nbetter serve our children; $750 million would bring afterschool \nprograms to their fiscal year 2004 authorized levels; $29 million would \nrestore the Troops to Teachers Programs.\n  We could also do a lot in supporting important programs for our \nNation's children. Twenty billion dollars would: provide 4.4 million \nmore kids with childcare; enable participation of 2.8 million kids in \nHead Start; fund enrollment of 26.7 million kids in afterschool \nprograms; or 16.6 million more kids covered by health care.\n  The bottom line is that we are not going to be able to do any of \nthose things if we continue to go it alone in Iraq. Moreover, the huge \nand unprecedented amounts of national debt that we are incurring are \ngoing to cripple our economy for the foreseeable future.\n  Why do we go through this silly budget exercise of declaring all \nthese projects an emergency? It is so that our budget rules won't \napply--so somehow it won't count. Well, Mr. President, it does count. \nAnd I think we should agree here and now that this is real money. Other \nprograms, real programs, important programs, won't be funded because of \nthe so-called emergency projects I mentioned earlier. There are trade-\noffs.\n  It is now clear that these trade-offs aren't going to be confronted \nby the President unless the voices of the unilateralists in the Bush \nadministration are silenced, or at least the President stops listening \nto them. The recent U.N. resolution was an important first step toward \nthat end. Hopefully it has taught this administration an important \nlesson: that to garner international help in building democracy in--\nIraq help we desperately need--there must be compromise and respect for \nother points of view.\n  There is nothing wrong with compromising or with sharing the costs \nand responsibilities for Iraq's future. In fact, I believe that \nCongress has a responsibility to see that those costs and \nresponsibilities will be shared. International burden sharing was a \ncondition of congressional support for funding U.S. peacekeeping \nefforts in Bosnia and Kosovo. This very Congress included a burden \nsharing requirement in the legislation passed earlier this year \nauthorizing U.S. participation in the Global HIV/AIDS Fund. Why should \nIraq be different? Senate adoption last night of the Bayh amendment, \nwhich would convert a portion of the reconstruction monies to loans, \nshould be understood as one small step toward more equitable burden \nsharing in the rebuilding of Iraq.\n  During consideration of this legislation we have taken some important \nfirst steps. But these are only small steps, and much more needs to be \ndone if the $87 billion we are about to approve is to be effectively \nused. I will reluctantly support final passage of this bill because I \nbelieve we have an obligation to support our troops. However, I want to \nmake it clear, here and now, that if this President expects my future \nsupport, he is going to have to bring together a much broader \ninternational coalition than currently exists--one that will provide \nsignificant financial and military support to our efforts.\n  The recent U.N. resolution holds out the promise that this may be \npossible, but it is only a promise--it is up to the President to see it \nbecome a reality.\n  We cannot and must not let this administration continue to deny what \nwe all know to be true; namely, that ``multilateralizing'' the \nreconstruction and democratization of Iraq is the right thing to do. It \nis the right thing for America. It is the right thing for Iraq. And it \nis the only way to ensure that we will be able to fulfill our \nresponsibilities to the American people. Let us hope that the \nadministration will use the resources and authorities contained in this \nbill to accomplish that goal.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I oppose this appropriation because we \nrefuse to pay for it. Foreseeing our venture into Iraq, in early \nJanuary I introduced a value added tax to pay for it. On this current \nbill I was a strong supporter of the Biden amendment. In fact, I \nnegotiated the rewording to require that we forego the tax cut for the \ntop one percent of income tax payers and use that money to pay for this \nappropriation. Led by the Republican opposition, it was voted down.\n\n[[Page S12821]]\n\n  Ambassador Bremer testified that by next July oil from Iraq would be \nflowing at the rate of three million barrels a day, a net export \nrevenue of $16 billion a year and a 10-year net export revenue of $160 \nbillion. Iraq is not Afghanistan. With the second highest oil reserves \nin the world Iraq is one of the richest countries and could easily pay \nthe bill. Again with White House opposition, the collateralization of \nthis $20.3 billion cost was voted down.\n  This bill includes many items not just to rebuild, but to build \nfacilities that did not exist at the time of war. While we are denying \nmany facilities and services for our people here in the United States, \nwe are going to the extreme financially to correct the mistake of \nPresident Bush. I supported the Stabenow amendment for our facilities \nand services which also was defeated by the White House.\n  The attempt to equate 9/11 with Saddam fails. Al-Qaida was not \noperating from Iraq. Saddam was not a threat to our national security. \nWe had overflights in both northern and southern Iraq. We knew what was \ngoing on. We had economic sanctions on Iraq. The resolution I voted for \nhad two resolution clauses: One, to enforce the United Nations \nresolutions and, two, to protect the national security of the United \nStates. Saddam was not a threat to our national security and we all \nknow it. The United Nations at the time was in Iraq on a search for \nweapons of mass destruction. We preempted the search with invasion. I \ndon't know whether it was oil or finishing the unfinished business of \nDesert Storm, but be that as it may, they have not met us with \nrejoicing in the streets. Saddam still exists. There is a daily killing \nof our soldiers.\n  At this moment we are an occupation army and the enemy. While we try \nto internationalize our effort, there is no question that terrorism has \nbeen internationalized in Iraq. The borders are porous and deployment \nfor law and order is inadequate. I call Iraq a mistake because we have \nmore terrorism since our invasion rather than less. As reported in the \nFinancial Times: ``The London-based International Institute for \nStrategic Studies said in its newly published Military Balance survey \nthat while the invasion of Iraq might have isolated al-Qaida from \npotential state sponsors, it was also likely to have had the effect of \n`swelling its ranks and galvanizing its will.' War in Iraq has probably \ninflamed radical passions among Muslims and thus increased al-Qaida's \nrecruiting power and morale and, at least marginally, its operational \ncapability, the report states.''\n  You can't stop the killing until you have law and order. The twelfth \nRoman Canon still applies: Salus popli sumprema lex--the safety of \npeople is the supreme law. In order to get safety, in order to get law \nand order we need more troops. The administration's approach is to \nregenerate the wetlands, build a sewer system, put in internet, make \nthe people happy and then they will stop killing us. It could happen, \nbut first you have to establish the people's security and we are trying \nto do it on the cheap with troops.\n  As I have told Secretary Rumsfeld on two occasions, more than a money \nsupplemental we need a manpower supplemental. If our troops are sent to \nsecure, there are too few and if they are sent to be killed daily, \nthere are too many. The cheer to support the President and support the \ntroops by proponents of this supplemental misleads. The cheer should be \nto stop the killing of our troops by supplying more manpower. My vote \nsupports the troops by emphasizing the need for more manpower. But more \nparticularly, it emphasizes the reality of our situation.\n  Money will not stop the daily killings, nor will a constitution by \nDecember. With the passage of this appropriation we are not only trying \nto do it on the cheap. We are telling the GI in downtown Baghdad, ``We \nhope you don't get killed. And the reason we hope you don't get killed \nis that we want you to hurry home to pay for it. My generation is not \ngoing to pay for it. This Congress is not going to pay for it because \nwe need a tax cut to get re-elected next year.''\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Leahy \namendment to strike wasteful funding from this supplemental and \nredirect that spending for humanitarian and peacekeeping assistance to \nLiberia. I commend my colleague for advancing this important amendment.\n  Last month, I had a moving meeting with Archbishop Frances of \nMonrovia. He relayed to me stories of suffering and pain in Liberia, a \ncountry that has been ravaged by war and brutal government. He also \nrelayed to me the great hope the people of Liberia place in the United \nStates and pleaded with us to help Liberia in this time of great need. \nThis amendment is an answer to the pleas from Archbishop Frances--and a \nresponse to the hope invested in us by millions of Liberians.\n  Though 85 percent of Liberians are unemployed and 75 percent do not \nhave access to clean drinking water, there are reasons for hope in \nLiberia. A new leader, Charles Gyude Bryant, has assumed the task of \nshepherding the people of Liberia from war to peace, from violence and \ndestruction to rebuilding and reconciliation. The open violence that \nhas plagued the country for over a decade has been checked.\n  An international peacekeeping force will be necessary to ensure \noutright war does not return. This amendment would help pay for an \ninternational peacekeeping force--an African force to stabilize an \nAfrican nation.\n  In addition to renewed security, this amendment ensures that disaster \nrelief and humanitarian assistance will get to thousands of Liberian \nfamilies uprooted by years of conflict and children who have been \nseparated from their parents. The amendment will provide relief for \nLiberians denied access to food and basic services for years.\n  In this supplemental appropriations package, Congress is providing \nfunding to our Nation's efforts to restore stability and democracy in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. We do so not because we are obliged to, but \nbecause we need to see democratic government flourish in these \ncountries that have been so crippled by violence and corruption. \nLiberia, a country to whom we are bound by shared history, enduring \ninterest, and national security, needs our help as much as Afghanistan \nand Iraq.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to answer their call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass?\n  Mr. BOND. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nAlexander) is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from \nTennessee (Mr. Alexander) would vote ``yes.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The bill is read a third time and \npassed, and the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.\n  Under the previous order, the Senate insists on its amendments, \nrequests a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes on this \nmeasure, and the Chair is authorized to appoint conferees.\n  The Presiding Officer (Mr. Sununu) appointed Mr. Stevens, Mr. \nCochran, Mr. Specter, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Bond, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Burns, \nMr. Shelby, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Craig, Mrs. \nHutchison, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \nHollings, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Reid of Nevada, Mr. \nKohl, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Johnson, \nand Ms. Landrieu conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I take the opportunity to express my \nappreciation to the Appropriations Committee staff for the many hours \nand days they worked on this bill. Their commitment and professionalism \nis critical to the bill. I have the list of the names of the majority \nand minority staff who worked so hard on this bill and I ask it be \nprinted in the Record in recognition of their efforts.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           The Majority Staff\n\n       Jim Morhard, Andy Givens, Sid Ashworth, Kevin Linskey, \n     Katherine Hennessey, Dennis Balkham, Jill Shapiro Long, \n     Shannon O'Keefe, Jessica Roberts, Jennifer Chartrand, Alycia \n     Farrell, Menda Fife, Tom Hawkins, and Robert Henke.\n       Lesley Kalan, Mazie Mattson, Kraig Suiacuse, Brian Wilson, \n     Nicle Royal, Paul Grove, Brendan Wheeler, Dennis Ward, Sean \n     Knowles, Rebecca Davies, Leo Spivey, Bettilou Taylor, Lisa \n     Sutherland, and Christine Drager.\n\n                           The Minority Staff\n\n       Terry Sauvain, Charles Kieffer, Charles Houy, Nicole \n     DiResta, Betsy Schmid, B.G. Wright, A. William Simpson, Lila \n     Helms, Kate Elrich, Chad Schulken, Tim Rieser, Mark Lippert, \n     and Christina Evans.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know the regular order is to now \nrecognize Senator Leahy. I ask unanimous consent that we alternate \nbetween Republican and Democratic Senators following Senator Leahy in \nspeeches regarding the vote just taken.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for a very short colloquy prior to the time Senator Leahy is \nrecognized for his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I discussed the appointment of the \nconferees on this important legislation with Senator Stevens and the \ndistinguished majority leader. As I mentioned on the floor earlier, we \nin the minority have been concerned about our lack of input in \nconferences that are now ongoing. And that is unsatisfactory. I have \nmade that clear to the majority leader.\n  This bill enjoys bipartisan support, as we have just seen from the \nvote, and provides an opportunity to begin anew. As a result, I sought \nand received the assurance of the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee that the minority will be full participants in this \nconference on the bill. That should be the norm when the Senate seeks \nto resolve its differences with the House. This means the minority will \nhave the opportunity to provide input on key issues for the duration of \nthe conference and be kept fully apprised of all developments as we \nseek to get a conference report on this legislation which will enjoy \nthe same broad bipartisan support as did the bill before us today.\n  I ask if that is in keeping with the understanding of the \ndistinguished manager of the bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Democratic leader is correct. The \nconference will meet and the minority will be full participants in the \nconference.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the manager of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Chair recognizes \nthe Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer, my friend and neighbor from across the Connecticut River.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator from Vermont, who has been \nso patient, withhold so that the Senator from Pennsylvania, who is \nhere, can make a very important unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will withhold with the understanding that \nI be recognized after my colleague speaks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senators from Nevada and Vermont for their \nindulgence.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 7\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 7, which is the \ncharitable choice bill. I further ask unanimous consent that all after \nthe enacting clause be stricken and the Snowe amendment, which is the \namendment on the child tax credit, and the Grassley-Baucus amendment, \nwhich is an amendment for the tax extenders, which are at the desk, be \nagreed to en bloc; that the substitute amendment, which is the text of \nS. 476, the Senate-passed version of the charitable choice bill, which \nhas the Charitable Giving Act as well as the military fairness \nprovisions, as amended by the Snowe-Grassley-Baucus amendment, be \nagreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; further, that the \nSenate insist upon its amendments and request a conference with the \nHouse; and, lastly, that the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees \nof a ratio of 3 to 2 and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I want the \nRecord to be spread with the fact that this is why Senator Daschle just \nentered into a colloquy with the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. Conferences haven't worked very well in this \nCongress.\n  We are willing to pass this bill, send it directly to the House. \nThere would be a simple amendment. We can do that quickly, soon. We \nfeel that would be the most expeditious way to handle this most \nimportant legislation. We favor the legislation. The minority favors \nthis legislation.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, what the Senator from Nevada has \nsuggested is instead of taking the normal course, which is the House \nhas passed a bill, the Senate has passed a bill, and for us to go to \nconference to negotiate the differences, the Senator from Nevada is \nsuggesting we take our bill and send it back to the House where the \nHouse would simply take it and put a bill there and send it back here, \nwhich would be fully amendable again, and it would go back to the House \nand it could go back to the Senate and we never reach a conclusion. I \nsuggest the way to solve this problem is to go to conference. I hope we \ncan do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           PASSAGE OF S. 1689\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I speak today about the Senate's vote on \nthe President's request for an additional $87 billion in emergency \nfunding for Iraq and Afghanistan, of which $65 billion is for military \noperations and $21 billion is for relief and reconstruction. The lion's \nshare of the funds are for Iraq.\n  I attended the three hearings in the Appropriations Committee, when \nAmbassador Bremer, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, General Pace, and \nseveral other witnesses testified. Unfortunately, there was not nearly \nenough time in those hearings to discuss the details of a budget \nrequest of such enormous size and complexity. I was also disappointed \nthat the hearings provided a one-sided perspective, as there were no \nwitnesses from the U.S. Agency for International Development or the \nState Department, and no witnesses from outside the government.\n  I also reviewed the materials provided by the Office of Management \nand Budget in support of the request, which\n\n[[Page S12823]]\n\nare useful but devoid of detail. For example, a request for $800 \nmillion for police training in Iraq is justified with only three vague \nsentences.\n  It is also one thing to ask for $400 million to build two new \nprisons. It is another to fail to explain why on Earth it costs so \nmuch, when the price of labor in Iraq is half what it is in the United \nStates. This is one of many examples--$33,000 pickup trucks that cost \n$14,000 in the U.S. and $6,000 satellite phones that sell in \nneighboring Jordan for $500, are others--that have been cited in the \npress and in speeches by Senators.\n  Of course there are things that need to be done in Iraq. But some of \nthese costs are shocking and inexplicable.\n  The administration is cutting food aid for poor children in \nNicaragua; a million children die of measles each year because they \ncan't get the vaccine which costs pennies; a third of the world's \npeople live in conditions most Americans would find appalling. Yet we \nare going to build wireless internet access on the Euphrates. It makes \nno sense.\n  And then we saw in last Thursday's New York Times that although this \nis a 1-year, emergency appropriation, only $6 billion, not $20 billion, \ncan be effectively spent in Iraq next year. Could it be that the reason \nthe White House wants this $20 billion now, and not a penny less, is \nbecause they do not want to have to defend this increasingly unpopular \npolicy again next year before the November elections? I think the \nanswer is obvious.\n  I cast my vote against this supplemental. This decision did not come \neasily. There are strong arguments pro and con. I know that I will be \namong a small minority. But for me, this is a matter of principle, and \nafter a great deal of thought I have concluded that I can not support \nthis proposal. I did not support the policy that got us into war alone. \nI do not support the tactics the White House has used to get this \nsupplemental passed. And I do not support appropriating so much money, \nat one time, for an oil rich nation when the responsible thing would be \nto approve a portion of the money today and to revisit this again next \nyear.\n  Before I explain how I reached this decision, I want to make three \npoints.\n  First, I want to mention the issue of support for our troops. We all \nsupport our troops, who have endured great hardship and fought bravely. \nWe worry about their safety. We have spoken to the grieving families of \nsoldiers who have died. I and other Senators have worked to get them \nbetter protective equipment, after we learned that some were sent into \nbattle in Iraq without bulletproof vests or the latest available armor \nfor their vehicles.\n  But supporting the troops is not simply a matter of spending billions \nof dollars so they can remain in Iraq indefinitely, with no exit plan, \ntargets in a guerrilla war that is likely to drag on for years. The \nPresident's policy that caused them to be sent there, and that will \nrequire them to remain there, must also be a policy that each of us who \nhas to vote on this supplemental can support. And if we are to make \ngood use of the taxpayers money, there must be an effective plan to \nimplement that policy.\n  Second, it is beyond dispute that Iraq is infinitely better off \nwithout Saddam Hussein, whose rein of terror was a disaster for the \nIraqi people and a blight on the civilized world. The Iraqi people have \na chance to build the foundations of a more open, tolerant, peaceful \nand prosperous society. Whether they will succeed in that endeavor may \nnot be know for many years, but I credit President Bush, Secretary \nRumsfeld, our troops, and the Iraqi people themselves, for giving them \nthis chance.\n  Third, I am voting against this proposal. If, instead, I thought the \nadministration was being honest with the American people about its \nmotives and its policy in Iraq and the Middle East; if this \nsupplemental were designed to implement a credible plan to \ninternationalize our policy rather than to continue a unilateral \napproach; and if this had not been a one-time only, take-it-or-leave-\nit, partisan approach in which almost every amendment offered by \nDemocrats was defeated along party lines, my vote today might be \ndifferent.\n  I want to be clear. Since 1989, I have served as either chairman or \nranking member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee. I am a strong \nbeliever in foreign aid. Spent wisely, foreign aid is in our national \ninterests. I am not opposed to helping Iraq rebuild. In fact, I \nsupported the supplemental, passed in April, which contained billions \nof dollars to rebuild Iraq and to support our military operations \nthere. I also voted for several amendments, which were defeated along \nparty lines, which I believe would have improved this supplemental in \nimportant ways.\n  For example, the Byrd-Kennedy-Leahy amendment would have allowed $10 \nbillion of the Iraq reconstruction funds to be spent immediately. The \nbalance of $10 billion would be withheld pending a certification by the \nPresident that the U.N. Security Council has authorized a multinational \nforce under U.S. command in Iraq and a central role for the U.N. in the \npolitical and economic development of Iraq, and a second vote by \nCongress. I am convinced that if we do not truly internationalize our \npolicy in Iraq our troops will continue to face daily attacks, our \nefforts to rebuild will be in jeopardy, and U.S. taxpayers, virtually \nalone, will pay the skyrocketing costs.\n\n  The Biden amendment would have paid for the $87 billion by repealing \na tiny fraction of the President's huge tax cut for the wealthiest \nAmericans. I have no doubt that if the American people had been able to \nvote on the Biden amendment it would have passed overwhelmingly.\n  The Dorgan amendment would have paid for the reconstruction with \nrevenues from future Iraqi oil sales. Yearly revenues from Iraqi oil \nare expected to reach $100 billion in less than a decade. This \namendment, had it passed, would have lifted a portion of the staggering \nfinancial burden of this war off the backs of American taxpayers.\n  I offered an amendment, with Senator Daschle, to shift responsibility \nfor rebuilding Iraq from the Secretary of Defense to the Secretary of \nState. The Pentagon's role is fighting wars, which they do superbly. It \nis not nation building. That is the role of the State Department. It is \nironic that President Bush, who ridiculed the Clinton administration \nfor nation building in the former Yugoslavia, is today defending the \nPentagon's role in the biggest nation-building effort in half a \ncentury.\n  These are only four of the amendments that I supported, each of which \nwas voted down because the White House and the Republican leadership \nopposed them.\n  Mr. President, in the weeks and days leading up to this vote, I have \nbeen guided by several things.\n  First is the importance of multilateralism. There is no realistic \nalternative in the 21st century to working collectively with other \nnations to combat terrorism and other grave threats to our security \nwhich extend far beyond our borders. Iraq, perhaps more than any \nforeign policy adventure in recent memory, illustrates the costs we pay \nfor unilateralist thinking--the cost to our soldiers, to our relations \nwith allies and the Muslim world, to our influence with other nations \non so many critical issues, and to American taxpayers.\n  Second, I did not vote for the resolution that President Bush used to \njustify the invasion of Iraq. I felt it gave the President sweeping \nauthority that the Constitution reserves for the Congress. I was also \nconvinced that the White House, despite its protestations to the \ncontrary, was determined to short circuit the U.N. inspectors and go to \nwar alone.\n  This administration's policy has been driven by lofty, unrealistic \nambitions; White House and Pentagon officials who were so convinced of \ntheir own version of reality that they felt no need to ask questions, \nnot to mention listen to the answers; a presumption that other nations \nwould follow us simply because of who we are; and a naive assumption \nthat we would be embraced as liberators and that the Pentagon's chosen \nexiles, unknown to most Iraqis, would be quickly enthroned in the seat \nof power.\n  Detractors were silenced. Other nations were bullied. Members of \nCongress who did not fall into line were called unpatriotic. The \nadministration's justification for a preemptive war, carried out not in \nself defense, not in response to 9/11, and without United Nations \nsupport, has changed from month to month, depending, it seems, on what \nthe White House's polls say the American people will believe.\n\n[[Page S12824]]\n\n  And third is my concern that in the 2 years since the tragedy of \nSeptember 11th, President Bush has squandered the support of the rest \nof the world and has largely failed to build an effective global \nresponse to terrorism.\n  Mr. President, I am not among those who feel that everything we have \ndone in Iraq has been a failure. To the contrary, thanks to the heroics \nof our soldiers--many hundreds of whom have paid with their lives and \nlimbs--the Iraqi people have a chance to build a government they can be \nproud of. But the issues before us are far more complex than whether or \nnot we should help Iraq. We should help in ways that are right for the \nIraqi people, and right for the American people.\n  The question each of us must answer, for ourselves and our \nconstituents, is whether this $87 billion, for the purposes for which \nthe Administration has requested it, is the right way to do that.\n  Thinking back, as I have often done since President Bush launched an \nessentially unilateral, preemptive war against Iraq, I believe the \nPresident got off on the wrong foot from the moment he made that \nfamous, or infamous, remark ``if you are not with us, you are against \nus.'' That statement was made shortly after September 11th, when the \nAmerican people were feeling the brunt of that national tragedy, and it \nmay have been reassuring to hear the President express his world view \nin such bold terms. But I, like many Vermonters, was uneasy about what \nthe President said, and in retrospect I believe it represented a \nfundamentally flawed approach to the threat our Nation faced then, and \nwill continue to face for years to come.\n  What the President's challenge has come to mean is that regardless of \nwho you are, including our oldest, closest allies, if you do not agree \nwith us we will ignore what you say, we will dismiss you as irrelevant, \nwe will punish you if we can, and we will go our own way in spite of \nyou. That, I believe, is a recipe for failure. It is beneath the United \nStates. It weakens the United States.\n  Not only has the White House done grave damage to our \nforeign relations, it has squandered its credibility with the Congress \nand the American people.\n\n  After handily defeating Saddam Hussein's army, virtually everything \nthis administration predicted about Iraq has turned out to be wrong. \nYet one would hardly know that from listening to senior administration \nofficials on television or in testimony before Congress. Rather than \ngive an honest assessment of the pros and cons, they have preferred to \nmake personal attacks against those of us who ask legitimate questions. \nSince jamming through a Gulf of Tonkin-like resolution last year, top \nadministration officials have continually ridiculed those opposed to \nthe war in Iraq, calling them pro-Saddam Hussein or pro-Osama bin \nLaden.\n  Only weeks ago, Secretary Rumsfeld accused those who were asking \nquestions about the deteriorating security situation in Iraq of giving \ncomfort to our enemies.\n  That is baloney. Every one of us wanted Saddam Hussein gone. But it \nis the duty of each Senator to ask questions when young Americans are \ndying overseas.\n  The administration said, over and over, that the reason we had to \ninvade Iraq was because of weapons of mass destruction. The Vice \nPresident said, ``We believe he [Saddam Hussein] has, in fact, \nreconstituted nuclear weapons,'' although there was apparently \nvirtually no evidence to support that.\n  But after blaming the United Nations inspectors for being duped, and \nafter months of searching without any interference, the administration \nhas yet to find any weapons of mass destruction. And now, as reported \nin the press, they want to spend another $600 million to continue the \nsearch.\n  Not long ago, the Secretary of State said the weapons were the \nchemical weapons used against the Kurds in 1988, before the first gulf \nwar. The gassing of the Kurds was a horrific war crime, but as much as \nI respect the Secretary, it is absurd, and contrary to everything we \nwere told a year ago, to use an atrocity of 15 years ago to justify a \npre-emptive war.\n  In fact, when Saddam Hussein used mustard gas against the Kurds, the \nReagan-Bush administration did little about it. And they continued to \nsell weapons to Saddam Hussein for years after. The Secretary of State \nwas a member of that administration.\n  This Administration apparently has no idea what happened to the \nweapons of mass destruction, did next to nothing to secure the sites \nwhere it believed them to be after the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime, \nand now seems to want to forget about them altogether.\n  This time last year, there were daily warnings about mushroom clouds. \nYet in his speech to the Nation on September 7, the President barely \nmentioned the issue.\n  This is not, as some have suggested, a partisan issue. It is an \nAmerican issue. These are questions that get to the heart of U.S. \nsecurity and credibility. Where are these weapons? Were they destroyed? \nAre they in the hands of terrorists, like the Islamic extremists who \nare flooding into Iraq to attack our troops? Are they in Syria or Iran? \nWas this a massive intelligence failure?\n  The administration's handling of this issue has severely undermined \nthe credibility of our intelligence and of the President's \njustification for rushing into war.\n  The White House's other major justification for the invasion of Iraq \nwas to fight al-Qaida and combat international terrorism. Over and over \nagain, hardliners in this administration tried to make this connection. \nThey created a special unit in the Pentagon. They worked hard to link \nSaddam Hussein with 9/11, even if the facts did not support it.\n  Only recently, after misleading a majority of the American people, \ndid the President publically concede that there is no evidence of a \nlink. Yet, Vice President Cheney continues to suggest there is. It \nwould be helpful if the Vice President would agree with the President \non this point.\n  Mr. President, I want as much as any person to mount an effective \ncampaign to deter, prevent, and combat terrorism. But what we have been \ngiven is a partisan, ``take it or leave it,'' rushed approach costing \nscores of billions of dollars that is not backed up with a credible \nplan.\n  And by a plan I mean a detailed strategy that shows us a way to \ninternationalize this policy and bring our troops home within a \nreasonable time.\n  Many in Congress, Democrats and Republicans, warned of the costs and \npitfalls of fighting a war to enforce U.N. resolutions without the \nsupport of the U.N. Security Council, and of rebuilding Iraq without \nthe support of other nations. Iraq is a complex country with a long \nhistory of ethnic and religious conflict, and it was crucial to have a \nsound postwar plan and a viable exit strategy. But the administration \ndid not want to hear those warnings. I think my good friend Senator \nHagel spoke for many of us, when he said the administration ``did a \nmiserable job of planning the post-Saddam Iraq'' and ``treated many in \nthe Congress, most of the Congress like a nuisance.''\n  We also know that the White House ignored concerns expressed by some \nin the administration, especially in the CIA and the State Department, \nabout the difficulties and dangers involved. Instead, a small, \nsecretive group in the Pentagon dominated postwar planning, and \nmiscalculated. Vice President Cheney said ``[t]here's no question [that \nthe people of Iraq] want to get rid of Saddam Hussein and they will \nwelcome as liberators the United States when we come to do that.''\n  Many Iraqis are grateful. But the Vice President says almost nothing \nabout the fact that our soldiers, who have performed so bravely, are \nunder constant attack or threat of attack from terrorists and remnants \nof the Baathist regime. He and others in the White House don't talk \nabout the hundreds of Americans who have died, or the nearly 2,000 \nwounded. And many of these injuries are not just a broken bone or \nscrapes. They are lost limbs. Lost eyesight. Lifetime disabilities.\n\n  The Secretary of Defense does not talk about the billions of dollars \nin this supplemental to repair damage caused by the catastrophic \nlooting of government buildings, electric generating equipment, \nhospitals, oil refineries, railroads, and communications \ninfrastructure, because the Pentagon did not plan for the war's end and \ndid not have enough troops in place to keep order after the fall of \nSaddam's government.\n\n[[Page S12825]]\n\n  This $87 billion request is made by the President of the party that \njust a few years ago gave great speeches in support of a constitutional \namendment for a balanced budget. In fact, it was the Clinton \nadministration that actually had the fiscal discipline to achieve a \nbalanced budget, which President Bush inherited. President Bush and \nVice President Cheney say they are deficit hawks. Yet today we are on \nthe road to putting a $1 trillion deficit squarely on the backs of our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  This is also a President who says we cannot spend another $1 billion \nin emergency funds to combat AIDS this year, a disease that kills 8,000 \npeople every day. This Administration's AIDS initiative, which has such \npromise, is starting looking like more talk than action. Others here \nhave recounted the statements of former chief economic adviser Lawrence \nLindsey, who estimated that it would cost between $100 billion and $200 \nbillion to rebuild Iraq. He was right, but his analysis was disputed \nagain and again by administration officials who wanted to paint a much \nrosier picture. For telling the truth, he was forced out of the \nadministration.\n  Former OMB Director Daniels said between $50 billion and $60 billion.\n  Deputy Defense Secretary Wolfowitz said ``We're dealing with a \ncountry that can really finance its own reconstruction, and relatively \nsoon. The oil revenues of that country could bring between $50 and $100 \nbillion over the course of the next two or three years.''\n  Andrew Natsios, Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment, said that $1.7 billion was all that America's taxpayers \nwould have to pay. $1.7 billion. That is incredible.\n  These estimates were wildly off the mark. After so many \nmisstatements, misjudgments, and distortions, I have no idea who to \nbelieve. This Administration has been wrong, wrong, and wrong.\n  As Senator Byrd has pointed out, this $87 billion brings to $194 \nbillion the amount the United States is spending in Iraq and \nAfghanistan--more than twice what the administration had led the public \nto believe just a few months ago.\n  The 1991 gulf war, by contrast, cost $61 billion, of which the United \nStates paid only $7 billion. That is $7 billion spent in 1991 compared \nto $194 billion today--almost 28 times higher, and this is only the \nbeginning.\n  The $20 billion that the President wants for rebuilding Iraq is more \nthan we are spending this year on foreign aid for the entire rest of \nthe world. The $87 billion is one and a half times the amount we spend \non education in the United States. It is larger than the total \neconomies of almost half the states of the Union.\n  The administration hopes that it will receive an additional $55 \nbillion for Iraqi reconstruction from other countries and Iraqi oil \nrevenues over the next 2 years. But that, again, may be wildly \noptimistic.\n  We are going to rebuild Iraq and put the Iraqis back to work. The \nPresident says there is money for that--$87 billion. But there is no \nsupplemental to help the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs \nhere at home. There is no money to fix our broken public schools. There \nis no money for health care for 44 million Americans who are without \ninsurance. None for affordable housing for the growing number of \nAmericans living in poverty.\n  Instead of a plan, we get more rhetoric about winning the war on \nterrorism. Instead of specifics, we get abstract talk about democracy \nin the Middle East--civilizations that predate ours by a thousand \nyears. This administration continues to support autocratic regimes in \nthe Middle East, Central Asia, and elsewhere, whenever it suits them. \nInstead of a timetable and a detailed justification of costs, we get \nsimplistic and inaccurate comparisons with the Marshall plan.\n  The Marshall plan, as I, Senator Daschle, and others have pointed \nout, bore little resemblance to what we are dealing with here. The most \nspecific thing the President has talked about is the pricetag: $87 \nbillion. This is staggering. It gave many Americans sticker shock and \nawe.\n  Their so-called ``plan'' is a July 23rd document, totaling 8 pages of \ntext and 19 pages of a hypothetical time line. It is not a plan of \nanything. It is a vague statement of objectives, which begins by \nsaying, not a little presumptiously, that ``now that Saddam Hussein's \nregime has been removed, the Iraqi people have the opportunity to \nrealize the President's vision'' for Iraq. I wonder if anyone asked the \nIraqi people about their own vision for their country.\n  This plan, which we did not receive until August 22--the day \nAmbassador Bremer came to testify before the Appropriations Committee--\ntells us only what has become obvious to everyone--the President sent \nour troops into war without a postwar plan.\n  Is everything going badly? No. Iraq is not engulfed in flames, as \nsome press reports might suggest. The port has been rebuilt. Businesses \nand schools are opening. Electric power and health services are \nbeing restored. Rubble is being cleared. A new police force is being \ntrained. There has been progress, and I commend Ambassador Bremer, \nUSAID, and the many private voluntary organizations who are working \nassiduously in extremely difficult and dangerous conditions.\n\n  But there is another picture that the White House prefers not to talk \nabout. The coordinated, deadly attacks against our troops and Iraqi \npolice are growing in frequency. Aid workers are facing daily threats \nand acts of sabotage. Many relief organizations are evacuating their \nemployees, as the U.N. has done. Horrific bombings of civilian targets \nare becoming routine. There is growing resentment among the Iraqi \npeople.\n  Mr. President, we are at a crossroads, not only in Iraq, but in our \nrelations with the rest of the world. A year ago, I listened as the \nPresident suddenly, inexplicably, changed his focus from defeating al-\nQaida in Afghanistan to overthrowing Saddam Hussein. I listened to his \nreasons, which were unconvincing given what we knew at the time, and \nthey are less convincing today. Like many, including some of my friends \non the other side of the aisle, I urged patience. We were ignored.\n  We waited for the evidence. It was distorted and manipulated.\n  After a brilliant military victory, the postwar strategy and the \njustification for the war itself have largely evaporated. Faced with an \n$87 billion down payment on what is likely to be a far more costly, far \nlonger United States involvement in Iraq, I have tried, through \nhearings and amendments, to promote an approach which I believe could \nsucceed. But the White House and the Republican Majority have been \ninflexible.\n  This has been a difficult process. I do not believe the United \nStates, having destroyed Iraq's government, should walk away. But \nneither can I support a policy that was ill-conceived from the \nbeginning, has seriously eroded our influence with our allies, further \npoisoned our already frayed relations with the Muslim world and \nweakened the United Nations. It is a policy which cannot succeed over \nthe long term without a significant change of course.\n  I have listened to some in the majority argue that ``we have no \nchoice'' but to ``stay the course.'' We may have no choice but to stay \nin Iraq, but we do have a choice about the course. I believe we need to \nchange course.\n  We should change course in three key ways.\n  First, as I and so many others have urged, we should internationalize \nour policy. The amendment I sponsored with Senator Byrd and Senator \nKennedy would have helped do that, and the U.N. resolution that was \nadopted yesterday is a welcome and encouraging step, for which I \ncommend Secretary of State Powell. But it is nothing more than an \nexpression of good intentions. We have no idea if it will change \nanything, as this White House has steadfastly resisted meaningful input \nfrom other nations.\n  Will the multinational force be anything more than a fig leaf for an \nongoing U.S. military occupation involving over 120,000 troops? Will \nother nations contribute significant resources? Or will U.S. taxpayers \ncontinue to shoulder 99 percent of the costs?\n  We need to know if the U.N. resolution represents the change in \npolicy that is long overdue, or if it is nothing more than political \ncover to continue drifting along as we are today alone, with our troops \nunder fire and U.S. taxpayers mortgaging their children's savings.\n  Second, we must do a far better job of protecting the taxpayers' \nmoney.\n\n[[Page S12826]]\n\nToday we should be voting to appropriate not a penny more than the \namount of funds that can be spent wisely in Iraq and Afghanistan during \nthe next 12 months. It should be paid for by repealing a portion of the \ntax cut for the wealthiest Americans, as proposed by Senator Biden, not \nby increasing the deficit. By mid-year we should hold thorough \nhearings, and vote again on whether to stay the course.\n  Third, we should get the Secretary of Defense out of the business of \nnation building and put the Secretary of State back in charge. My \namendment would have done that.\n  These are not radical alternatives, but the President's advisers \ndecided that nothing was open for discussion. It has been their latest \nversion of ``if you're not with us, you're against us.'' They have \ntreated this supplemental as a referendum on the President's policy in \nIraq, a policy which I believe is fraught with dangers for our Nation. \nIt is no more the right way to build the peace than the pre-emptive, \nunilateral use of force was the right way to go to war.\n  Mr. President, I voted for every amendment that I felt would make the \nbest use of the taxpayer's hard earned money. I voted for every \namendment that I felt would support our troops and help them do their \njobs better, and come home safely. I support them by spending money \nwisely. And I support them by voting to change course when I believe \nthe course we are on endangers them unnecessarily.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I understood that it \nwould go back and forth between Republicans and Democrats.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I take the floor to make a few personal \nobservations. I don't want to revisit all of the arguments that have \nbeen made over and over again. But I do want to make a few statements \njust for the record. I want to make it very clear, speaking for \nmyself--and I think for other Members of the Senate, but they can speak \nfor themselves--that I have never challenged the patriotism, the \nmotives, or the rights of any Senator who has disagreed with the \nPresident on this vote.\n  I have utmost respect for the senior Senator from West Virginia. I \nhave watched him serve for many years. I watched him serve while I was \na staff member for my father. He and my father served together in this \nbody for many years. I would never, under any circumstances, suggest \nthat I was challenging his patriotism in any way. I do think he is \nprofoundly wrong in the decision he has made with respect to this \nwar. But I recognize that he has every right to make that decision. He \nhas every right to defend that decision in as vigorous language as \npossible, but I want to make it clear to him and to any who may have \nmisunderstood that under no circumstances and at no time have I ever \nchallenged his patriotism.\n\n  I am not sure I know of any other Senator who has ever challenged his \npatriotism. I hope we will understand that as we disagree, as \nvigorously as we do on this issue, we are not, in fact, engaging in \nwhat has been called the politics of personal destruction.\n  I believe the Senator from West Virginia is wrong because I think his \nworld view is wrong with respect to where the world is and where the \nPresident is going in the postwar world.\n  We all celebrated the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the cold \nwar. There were books written about it. One was entitled ``The End of \nHistory.'' We found that history did not come to an end with the end of \nthe cold war, that the challenges to American lives and American \ninterests around the world did not disappear with the Soviet Union, and \nthat we have additional challenges today.\n  I will not suggest that the Bush administration has done everything \nright. I have had my moments of disagreement with this administration, \nsome of them relatively serious and some of them relatively recent. But \nI am behind the President in this effort because I think his overall \nglobal view is the correct one.\n  The primary challenge to peace in the world right now is coming out \nof the Middle East. For a variety of reasons, for a variety of historic \npatterns, that part of the world is producing the principal challenge \nto peace everywhere.\n  Europeans feel more secure than they have ever felt in their lives, \nand perhaps accurately and properly so. The Soviet Union is gone. The \nage-old rivalries between the Germans and the French and the other \nprincipalities in Europe are over. They are striving to write a \nEuropean constitution and bring themselves together in a legitimate \neconomic way. They feel more secure after centuries of war than they \nhave ever felt in their lives. They are no longer the target. We are. \nThey are no longer the focus of those who would bring instability to \nthe world. We are. And we saw that happen in dramatic fashion on \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n  The President has said there is no connection between what happened \non September 11, 2001, and Iraq, and that is true, and the President \nnever claimed such a connection. But there is an overall connection in \nthe sense that those warriors for their cause who attacked us on \nSeptember 11, 2001, came out of an area and a culture and an attitude \nthat exist in the Middle East that must be addressed in the Middle \nEast, even if there are no direct links, even if there was no direct \nfunding, even if there was not a case that a law enforcement official \ncould make in a court of law.\n  We must recognize the significance of the Middle East as the source \nof instability in the world and recognize those players in the Middle \nEast who are part of that instability. I believe Saddam Hussein was a \nprincipal player for instability.\n  We can argue, appropriately, and we can go back and examine the \nmistakes that were made with respect to Saddam Hussein. We can say \nthere are statements made prior to the attack on Iraq which, in \nretrospect, turned out not to be true. I can list some of them.\n\n  No. 1, I heard in this Chamber that we were going to get body bags \ncoming back from Iraq by the thousands. We were told in this Chamber \nthat we were going to have house-to-house fighting in Baghdad, door-to-\ndoor assaults. We were told that our troops were going to be gassed--\nthat from people who voted against the resolution to give the President \nthe authority to go forward.\n  It turns out all of those predictions are not true. Do I attack the \npeople who made those predictions as having botched it? I suggest they \nread the intelligence and came to the wrong conclusion. I also \nrecognize that whenever this Nation or any nation goes to war, you \nnever know exactly what is going to happen.\n  This is perhaps a small example, but it has struck me, as I read the \nhistory of the Second World War. As carefully as we planned the assault \non Normandy, as carefully as we did the disinformation to get Hitler to \nthink we were going to attack someplace other than we did, the \ndisguises, the false information that was put out, all of the rest of \nthe intelligence that was done, we made one very fundamental and, in \nretrospect, stupid mistake. In all of the training of our troops in \nadvance of the Normandy invasion, we assumed that the hedgerows between \nfields in France would be the same height as the hedgerows between \nfields in Great Britain.\n  So as we trained in Great Britain, we trained with hedgerows that \nwere about knee height and then found ourselves in France with \nhedgerows that were almost as high as a building. It completely \ndisrupted all of our tank assaults and plans because as a tank would \ntry to go up and over one of those hedgerows, it would be vulnerable to \nfire from the other side. They could hit the underbelly of the tank \nbecause its tracks were exposed and the base of the tank itself was \nexposed and an artillery shell could take it out instantly.\n  It was improvisation on the field from a GI who used to work on a \nfarm who helped create what would be a version of a snowplow on the \nfront of a tank to drive the tank through the hedgerow. An incredible \nintelligence mistake of something as simple as that, and they could \nhave determined that if they could have found a French farmer to talk \nto.\n  Did this Chamber ring with accusations that President Roosevelt had \nlied to the American people about our plan in Normandy? Were there \ndenunciations of General Marshall or General\n\n[[Page S12827]]\n\nEisenhower because they made that intelligence error? Some would say \nthe analogy doesn't hold, and certainly there are many aspects of it \nthat do not, but the point I think is legitimate. The intelligence \nfailures that we now know occurred with respect to Iraq were not \ndeliberate lies. The intelligence failures that have accompanied every \nAmerican military action are the best efforts of human beings doing the \nbest they can under pressure and always making mistakes.\n  What matters is the overall world view and strategic direction, and, \nas I said, I believe George W. Bush has the right strategic direction. \nHe recognizes that the instability in the world is coming from the \nMiddle East; that we must do everything we can to deal with those \ncharacters who are responsible for that instability. And he made the \ndecision that one of those characters was Saddam Hussein.\n  I cannot believe anyone can look back on it and say that particular \ndecision was the wrong one. As I have said here before, one of the \nfirst people who alerted me to Saddam Hussein and his capacity to \nspread instability throughout the world was Madeleine Albright, \nSecretary of State, as we met with her in S-407 and heard her outline \nthe description of weapons of mass destruction that were in Iraq. We \nheard her boss, the President of the United States, President Clinton, \ndo the same thing in public fora.\n  Was there any reason to believe they were for any purpose trying to \nmislead the American people? We might say they were wrong based on what \nwe now know, but they were wrong, if they were, because of the fog of \nuncertainty over the intelligence reports all of us had. They made the \nbest judgments they could make on the basis of the best information \nthey had, and then they moved ahead. President Bush did exactly the \nsame thing.\n  There are those who say he has squandered our good will in the world. \nEverybody loved us after September 11. There were demonstrations in the \nstreets in Europe, demonstrations of support, demonstrations of \nsympathy. How long would those demonstrations have nourished our \nposition if indeed we had done nothing following September 11?\n  Oh, it is all right to do something as long as everybody is with you. \nIt is all right to do something as long as everybody agrees. Well, it \nseemed to me the United Nations agreed. Fifteen to nothing strikes me \nas a fairly definite vote in the Security Council for resolution 1441.\n  Then when the United States said, all right, resolution 1441 is not \nbeing complied with, resolution 1441 says if it is not complied with, \nthere will be serious consequences--serious consequences is U.N. speak \nfor war--how about it, U.N.?\n  Oh, no, no, said members of the Security Council.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Does the Senator know how much longer his remarks \nwill be? I ask simply because I follow the Senator and I have an \nairplane to catch. It would be helpful if I could get an estimate.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am glad to have the Senator tell me of his schedule \nand I shall cut it as short as I possibly can, because I do not want to \ndisconcert the Senator in any way.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Not at all. When I served in Normandy, I saw a lot of \nthings the Senator is talking about. It is very interesting.\n  Mr. BENNETT. No, I do not need to go on further because it has all \nbeen said.\n  I will conclude.\n  Mistakes have been made. I think both sides can admit that and should \nrecognize that. People have been offended by the administration on both \nsides of the aisle. I think we can recognize that and admit that.\n  The fundamental question to me is whether the overall direction in \nwhich the President is trying to take the country is the right one. As \nI study history and as I listen to the reports that come back from \nIraq, as I talk to the people in Utah who are serving there--we have a \nhigher percentage of our Armed Forces who are Reserve and Guard in Iraq \nthan any other State--I am convinced the President is right in his \noverall direction. Whatever course corrections need to be made we can \ntalk about, but when all is said and done, this President has done the \nright thing.\n  I am proud to have voted to give him the authority in the first \ninstance, and I am proud to be one of the 87 Senators today who have \nvoted to give him the continuing support he requires.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his \ncooperation. I am sorry to interrupt. He did just what the order called \nfor and I respect that.\n  I have a couple of things to talk about and I will try not to be too \nlong. One of the things I want to talk about is the very important vote \nwe just had. I was one of a very small group to have voted against the \nsupplemental appropriations bill for Iraq. I want to make sure my vote \nis clearly understood. I support taking care of our military, making \nsure their conditions are as comfortable as they can be under difficult \ncircumstances, making sure they have the latest in weaponry, and that \nthey are treated fairly and they receive medical care and their health \ncare is the best we can offer. I was prepared to vote for that $67 \nbillion in a flash, but that was not the only thing we voted on. We \nalso voted on extending $20 billion to Iraq for reconstruction.\n  I think it is a noble effort we are making to show we care about \nother people, but we also have to care about the people here. We also \nhave to worry about the schools here that are crumbling, schools where \nit is hard to learn. We also have to understand that when we say Leave \nNo Child Behind, we mean all the children, and we need more funding to \ndo that. That has to be paid for. We do not seem to have the funds for \nthat.\n  Thank goodness we have Social Security surpluses we can borrow from--\nmoney we can take from the senior citizens, those who are here now and \nthose in the future. So we borrow money from one place and then we lend \nor give that money to another place, to Iraq, to make sure they have \nschools and garbage trucks. And I do not mean to diminish that. I think \nit is important to show we care about those people, but we ought to be \na little more inventive in the way we do it. We ought to be able to \nfind the kind of support we need, true support, in the United Nations \nwhich we scorned so much as we were preparing to go to war.\n  I was a supporter of the war, so I cast a vote I feel very good \nabout. I thought very carefully about it. I wore a uniform, as I said \nbefore. I wore it during the ``Big War.'' I enlisted at the end of 1942 \nand got out in 1946. I am very attached to the military and the \nresponsibility they have.\n  Well, the vote has been cast and shortly, we will be distributing a \ntotal of $87 billion for reconstruction aid and for the resources our \nmilitary men and women need.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, we have had a busy week as we have \nconsidered the $87 billion request from the administration. There has \nbeen a great deal of debate. A number of amendments and senses of the \nSenate have been voted on. In the end, we were faced with the difficult \nchoice as to whether we would or would not support this request by the \nadministration.\n  I have the greatest respect for my colleagues who voted against this \n$87 billion. I listened with great interest and attention to my friend \nand colleague, Senator Leahy, as he laid out a compelling argument with \na number of points concerning the reasons why he voted against the \nrequest for $87 billion.\n  I know, from having heard the brief remarks of the Senator from \nFlorida, that in a few minutes we will hear his usual thoughtful \nexposition as to why he, too, voted against the $87 billion.\n  I think it is imperative we all agree that, whichever way one of us \nvoted, for or against this funding, all of us are united in our support \nfor our brave men and women who are literally risking, and all too \ntragically losing, their lives on a daily basis in Iraq.\n  This was a very difficult vote for many of us. There are those of us, \nsuch as myself, who voted to give the President authority. We disagree \nwith the way he used that authority. We have many questions, and still \nmost are unanswered, about the choices the President and his team have \nmade over the\n\n[[Page S12828]]\n\nlast year. But the idea of giving our President authority to act in the \nglobal war against terrorism, if necessary in his opinion, against \nSaddam Hussein, was one I could support and I did so. In the last year, \nhowever, I have been first perplexed, then surprised, then amazed, and \neven outraged and always frustrated by the implementation of the \nauthority given the President by this Congress.\n  One can agree on the goal that was adopted in 1998 for regime change. \nI, for one, am in the camp that believes the world is better off \nwithout Saddam Hussein at the helm of a dangerous, tyrannical regime. \nBut it is not enough to say you support the goal. There are many \ndifferent obstacles and difficulties and choices on the way to \nachieving that goal that have both intended and unintended \nconsequences.\n  A number of my colleagues have addressed the concerns arising out of \nthe use and misuse of intelligence. I, for one, have said repeatedly \nthe intelligence about the threat posed by Saddam Hussein had been \nconsistent--consistent through three administrations: the first Bush \nadministration, the Clinton administration, and now this \nadministration.\n  There was a consensus there had been and were continuing to be \nprograms devoted to the creation of weapons of mass destruction. We \ncertainly knew, as the world saw, that this man had no compunction \nabout using them.\n  Nevertheless, I think it is clear, and it is not just a mistake, it \nis not just a wrong assessment--I think now it is clear that, for a \ncombination of reasons, the administration gilded the lily, engaged in \nhyperbole, took whatever small nugget of intelligence that existed and \nblew it up into a mountain, in order, I suppose, to make the case more \nstrongly and convincingly to the American people. But at what a cost? \nThe cost of our credibility, the cost of our national leadership, and \neven more so the cost of perhaps not being able to take actions in the \nfuture that are necessary to our well-being and our interests because \nwe may look like the nation or at least the administration that cried \nwolf. It is a big price to pay.\n\n  Yet continually, rather than saying what I think all of us would \nagree, the consensus turned out not to be right. There were some, such \nas my good friend from Florida, who at the time was serving as the \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee and was in a position to see all \nthe different interlocking facts, who said: Wait a minute. We are \nheading off in the wrong direction. We are jumping on the wrong horse.\n  But for many of us, looking at the intelligence, being briefed \ncontinually about what the threats were, being told by the highest \nlevels of our Government in public and in private that we were facing \nan imminent threat, it certainly seemed like a bet on which nobody--at \nleast speaking for myself--wished to be on the wrong side.\n  I think there would be considerable understanding on the part not \njust of Members of Congress but of the American public if leading \nmembers of the administration would now come forward and say: You know, \nwe may have gotten overly invested in the intelligence. We may have \ngotten a little ahead of the game. We may have seen more than there \nwas, and we perhaps said a few things and made some claims that we \ncan't support--whether it is uranium in Niger or links with al-Qaida by \nSaddam Hussein--but the fundamental fact remains that this man posed a \nthreat to his neighbors. There is no doubt in anyone's mind--because we \nhad already seen him use it--that he would have employed weapons of \nmass destruction at some future date. Although we may have gone a \nlittle too far, we believe we made the right decision.\n  But you do not hear that from this administration. This \nadministration never makes a mistake, in their own eyes. They are never \nwilling to back off. They have the Vice President still going on \nnational television shows repeating discredited intelligence. That is \nnot free. That is costly. That sends a signal not just to those of us \nwho serve and vote in this body, not just to the American public, but \nto the entire world that either there is an unwillingness to accept the \nevidence and the facts or there is a commitment on an ideological basis \nto a world view or a point of view that is wrong.\n  Time and time again, the administration has had the opportunity to \nlevel with the American people. Unfortunately, they haven't been \nwilling to do that.\n  Among the many questions that I and others raised and the many \ncriticisms we lodged against the use of the authority, which I and the \nmajority of this body voted for, was the administration's aborting of \nthe United Nations process and the inspections regime in order to \nlaunch military action.\n  There was never any doubt in anyone's mind with any knowledge of the \nAmerican military what the outcome would be. I, for one, knew there was \nno worry whatsoever; that we have the finest equipped, trained, and \nmotivated military probably in the history of the world, and they would \ndo the mission they were assigned. So they did.\n\n  But all during the period from the voting on the authority to the end \nof organized major conflict, we kept asking questions: What are the \nplans once we know the military does the job it is sent to do? How many \ntroops will we need? How long will they be there? What will this cost \nus in lives and treasure? Over and over, the answer we received from \nthe administration was: We are ready; we are prepared. And oftentimes \nit came with an almost embarrassingly romantic view of this conflict--\nthat we would be met by cheering and rose petals thrown in the streets, \nthat we would be in and out quickly, that the oil would be flowing. It \nsounded fabulous. But that is what it turned out to be, a fabulous \nfantasy.\n  It is hard for me to really understand how this administration, led \nby many--from the Vice President to the Secretary of Defense to others \nwho have been committed to overturning the regime of Saddam Hussein \nsince they made the mistake of not going to Baghdad in the first gulf \nwar--could be so ill prepared. How on Earth? These people have spent 10 \nyears obsessing over Saddam Hussein and Iraq. One would think they knew \nwhat they would do when they arrived.\n  They would not answer our questions, and all too often they would \npunish representatives of our civilian and military leadership who did \nanswer the questions--most famously General Shinseki who told the truth \nabout the numbers of troops it would take, and the number of years it \nwould take, and was largely ignored or pilloried by this \nadministration. How could they not have been prepared? How could they \nhave turned their backs on the most obvious kinds of planning?\n  I know for a fact there were many from previous Republican \nadministrations who came in over and over again and said: You are going \nto face a looting problem; You don't have enough troops for that; We \nhave to be sure we can secure not just a couple of facilities but we \nneed the troops to secure a number of the most important institutions--\nsomehow they were not hurt, to say nothing of those from former \nDemocratic administrations who offered the same advice.\n  We have the President land on the aircraft carrier, We have him \ndeclare the end to major conflict, and here we are months later losing \non average a soldier a day, seeing the maiming and disabling of \nhundreds more, being asked to spend, last spring, $70 billion in a \nsupplemental to sustain our military function and now being asked to \nspend $87 billion, $67 billion, approximately, for our military and $20 \nbillion for necessary functions on reconstructing Iraq.\n  Given the level of criticism that I and others feel about this \nventure and its failure, it is hard not to see this $87 billion as \nanything but a bill for failed leadership. Yet I, for one, believe this \nmission in Iraq is too important for failure. If we do not stabilize \nIraq, if we do not protect our forces, if we do not clearly send a \nsignal to the Iraqi people who are and certainly will be better off \nbecause of the removal of Saddam Hussein, we will not just have failed \nin this mission, we will have undermined our long-term stability and we \nwill certainly have created a more dangerous world despite our efforts \nto avoid that.\n  I understand very clearly the anger and frustration my constituents \nand Americans across the country feel about this $87 billion. I share \nit. It is really hard to vote for this money. It is hard because you \nwonder what is going to actually be accomplished with it\n\n[[Page S12829]]\n\ngiven the poor track record of this administration. You wonder how you \ncan justify it in the face of the irresponsible fiscal policies of this \nadministration that has undermined our present obligations and our \nlong-term economic security. You wonder how you can possibly support \nthis request when you know you don't get the straight story out of this \nadministration time and time again. Yet, at the same time, it is hard \nto walk away now. In fact, I don't think we can.\n\n  Yes, we have not found the weapons of mass destruction, but we are \nthere. No, we do not really have any links between al-Qaida and Saddam \nHussein to be proven, but we are there. We have not stabilized the \ncountry and we have not even secured the weapon caches all over the \ncountry, but we are there. It is just hard to accept that we are there \nwithout an adequate plan and understanding of what it will take to be \nsuccessful.\n  The fact that the administration purposely left the impression that \nthere would be a quick victory and our troops would be home in no time \nis very hard to accept for a lot of the husbands and wives and mothers \nand fathers and sons and daughters of the people serving. We have all \nread the story today from the interviews done by Stars and Stripes, the \nnewspaper of the Army, reporting in great detail about the questions \nand concerns and poor morale of many of our soldiers and other forces \nin Iraq.\n  I understand completely why people are frustrated and angry, but I \ndon't think we can allow our frustration and anger with the \nadministration to undermine our commitment to our country and our \nnational security.\n  So what is it we are called upon to do? For me, the choice as a \nmember of the Armed Services Committee was to support the money for our \ntroops, wondering, though, as I did, why so many of them still do not \nhave the body armor they should have to protect themselves against \nIraqi attacks and hoping they will shortly. We certainly put enough \nmoney into the defense budget in the last 2\\1/2\\ years to at least \nequip every one of our soldiers with adequate body armor.\n  I also know that we do have to work to help reconstruct Iraq. We are \nthe only people who can and will, in part because the administration \nhas alienated those who would have been our natural allies. It is \nfrustrating for many, but I don't think we can at this point fail to \npay this bill of $87 billion for failed leadership.\n  We have to put the administration on notice that this vote, 87 to 12, \nwas a vote for our troops, a vote for our mission. Speaking as one of \nthose who cast a yea vote, it was not a vote for our national \nleadership. We not only can but should expect more than we have been \ngiven.\n  While we confront the reality of our present situation in Iraq, we \ncannot find ourselves in this position again. Many will no longer be \nable to support this administration if they do not start listening, \noccasionally even admitting when they make a mistake that has life-and-\ndeath consequences, reining in their most rabid neocon ideologues when \nthey try to ``out'' CIA operatives or continue to claim nonexistent \nlinks between the global war on al-Qaida and everything else that \nhappens in the world.\n  I hope the administration understands the level of frustration and \nanger that is out there. It is not just Democratic frustration and \nanger, it is not just partisan, it is across the board, people \nwondering: Where are we going? How will we even know when we get there? \nDid we take on this incredible responsibility under false pretenses?\n  I hope the administration will build on the vote in the United \nNations that gives us at least the opportunity of lessening the burden \nand the costs by sharing it with others who should also have a stake in \na free and functioning Iraq. I hope the administration will change \ncourse when it comes to working with the rest of the world and start \nacting more like allies instead of bullies. We cannot keep on this path \nand sustain the support of the American people. That is my most \nimportant point.\n\n  I have had the great privilege of not just traveling around the \ncountry but spending a lot of time in every State in our Nation. Now I \nhave the great honor of representing the most diverse place in America, \nthe State of New York. Americans are not only patriotic in the best \nsense of the word but they are so compassionate and caring about other \npeople. What other country would free a people from tyranny and then \nreach into their own pockets to help build schools and hospitals and \nroads and fix the electric grid? Americans do not begrudge that. But \nthey want to feel they know where we are headed, that their Government \nis leveling with them.\n  They also wonder and ask me, How come we are spending $5 billion to \nfix the electric grid in Iraq and we have not spent any money to fix \nour electric grid in the United States? We are building schools and we \nhave schools falling down here. We are building hospitals and we have \nhospitals under all kinds of pressures here. Those are totally \nlegitimate questions. They will not go away.\n  One of the greatest issues for us to address is how we will provide \nfor the needs of the American people while we spend this money abroad. \nAmericans will stay with you, Americans will be with you and support \nyou, if they understand where we are headed and why it is important to \nour future.\n  On that count, this administration is losing the confidence of the \nAmerican people even though the mission we face in Iraq is essential, \nin my view, to the long-term safety and security of our country and the \nleadership America should provide to the world.\n  This is not just about money. It is not even, tragically, about the \nlives we lose and the issues we confront in trying to stabilize and \nbuild Iraq. It is about whether this administration can repair the \ntrust it has lost with the American people. I hope it can because I \ndon't think it is in anyone's interest to have the President of the \nUnited States and his top team viewed as having misled our Nation and \nhaving alienated the rest of the world.\n  We are in for a long-term battle in the war against terrorism. I take \nit very seriously. We have determined and ruthless adversaries out to \ndestroy our way of life, inflict violence on as many Americans as \npossible. I take a back seat to no one in my resolve to root out and \ndestroy global terrorism. My question is, What is the right way to do \nit? And how do we prepare the American people to stay the course for \nwhat will be a long, protracted struggle?\n\n  I worry deeply that this administration is undermining both our \nability to win the global war on terrorism and the trust that is needed \nto keep the American people committed.\n  So I cast a vote for this supplemental for our troops and for the \nwork that has to be done in Iraq. But I cannot endorse this \nadministration's plans and policies very much longer if they do not \nrecognize the reality of what we confront, not just in Iraq but \nelsewhere in the world and here at home.\n  The administration has forced false choices on this Congress and our \ncountry. It is very difficult for me, having represented New York \nduring the horrors of 9/11, to realize that we had the will and good \nwishes and support of the rest of the world and we have dissipated \nthat. We desperately need it in this war against terrorism.\n  This may be reported as a resounding victory for the administration--\na large vote--but I do not think it was. I think this was, first of \nall, a vote for our troops, a vote to continue to provide the funding \nthey need to protect themselves and to fulfill their mission. It was a \nvote to take responsibility for what does need to be done in Iraq. \nThere is not, in my view, any doubt about that.\n  But the debate in this body, and the frustration, and even anger \nacross the country shows clearly that it was not a vote of confidence \nin the administration's leadership. That needs to be won back by their \nactions going forward. And it is essential that they attempt to do so.\n  We cannot fail in Iraq. We cannot fail in the war against terrorism. \nUltimately, we must not fail our own people. The American people \ndeserve better. I hope the administration recognizes and accepts that.\n  The last 2 years that I have had the privilege to serve in this body \nhave been very emotional ones--the attacks of 9/11; the military action \nin Afghanistan; the action in Iraq; the destruction of our budget \nsurplus and plunging\n\n[[Page S12830]]\n\nour Nation into huge deficits and burgeoning national debt; the \nundermining of the future, in my view, of this generation.\n  I come not as a partisan but as an American to say, we have to do \nbetter. I hope this administration will do so.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise this evening to elaborate on my vote against \nthe $87 billion supplemental appropriations for the occupation and \nrebuilding of Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  This supplemental appropriation raises significant domestic issues \nfor the United States as well as the fundamental question of what will \nbe required for an honorable completion of our responsibilities in Iraq \nand an expeditious exit.\n  The domestic issues include an enormous addition to our national \ndebt. This year's deficit is now estimated to surpass last year's \nrecord-setting deficit of $455 billion. With this additional $87 \nbillion, we are imposing another crushing burden on our children and \ngrandchildren while assuring that we will escape most of the cost.\n  The President, with our concurrence, has avoided any sacrifice by \nmost Americans, including the sacrifice of paying for the occupation \nand reconstruction of Iraq. This is in sharp contrast with previous \noccupations and reconstructions such as the Marshall plan.\n  The Marshall plan, from 1948 to 1952, was paid for by the generation \nof Americans who were in this country through the period at the end of \nthe Second World War. In fact, the national debt--that debt owed to the \npublic--actually was lower in 1952 than it was in 1948.\n  But today the only Americans who are being asked to sacrifice are our \nbrave men and women in uniform and their families, and our children and \ngrandchildren who will eventually be called upon to pay this crushing \ndebt.\n  A second domestic reality is that while American roads, bridges, \nschools, water and sewer lines, and electric grids are deteriorating, \nthere will be scant Federal funding to contribute to their \nreconstruction because we are making the decision that it is more \nimportant to rebuild Iraq. And we are making the decision to do it \nalone.\n  In spite of my great concern about those domestic implications, I \nwould be prepared to vote for the $87 billion of unpaid funds in this \nsupplemental appropriations bill if I had been satisfied that it would \nachieve the goal of an honorable and expeditious exit from Iraq. \nHowever, it is my assessment that it will not do so. Rather, it could \nwell extend our Iraq occupation into a 21st century sequel to Vietnam.\n  It is my firmly held belief that we need to extricate ourselves from \nthe quagmire that our policy has created in Iraq. We need to refocus \nour foreign policy on the greatest threat facing Americans at home and \nU.S. interests abroad: the networks of international terrorism. We must \nrestart the war on terrorism, which has effectively been in abeyance \nsince this administration shifted our military and intelligence \nresources from Afghanistan to Iraq in the spring of 2002.\n  As I have said previously, that shift was misguided. We have allowed \nal-Qaida to regenerate. We have allowed other terrorist networks--\nHezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad--to continue their devious \nplotting against us and our allies.\n  We still have not caught al-Qaida's and the Taliban's senior leaders, \nincluding Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar. We are witnessing a \nresurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan. International terrorists \noperating from the sanctuary of Syria are now targeting United States \ncitizens. As a result, we have again been forced to endure bombings and \nsignificant loss of life in Riyadh, Israel, the Gaza Strip, and \nelsewhere.\n  Last October, I voted against the resolution authorizing the use of \nforce against Saddam Hussein's regime. I argued at the time that there \nwas no question that Saddam Hussein was anything other than an evil man \nbut, further, that he lived in a neighborhood with many evil men and \nwomen and that we needed to remain focused on the war on terrorism in \norder to deter additional attacks, such as the tragedy our Nation \nsuffered on September 11, 2001.\n  In fact, I offered an amendment to the Iraqi resolution to expand the \nPresident's authority to use force against al-Qaida to include five \nother terrorist networks that pose immediate threats to America.\n  In the rush to war in Iraq, the amendment failed. I am tempted to \noffer that amendment again to emphasize we need to disengage from Iraq \nas quickly as we can honorably do so and to restart the war on \nterrorism, a war against our real enemies, not those with phantom \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  I say: Let us take President Bush at his word, at least the words he \nuttered 9 days after the tragedy of September 11, when he told a joint \nsession of Congress:\n\n       Our war on terror begins with al-Qaida but it does not end \n     there.\n       It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach \n     has been found, stopped and defeated.\n\n  In his State of the Union speech on January 29, 2002, President Bush \nrestated our priority:\n\n       Our Nation will continue to be steadfast and patient and \n     persistent in the pursuit of two great objectives.\n       First, we will shut down terrorist camps, disrupt terrorist \n     plans, and bring terrorists to justice.\n       And, second, we must prevent the terrorists and regimes who \n     seek chemical, biological or nuclear weapons from threatening \n     the United States and the world.\n\n  Frankly, I did not offer my amendment, although I thought it would \nhave provided the legal basis for the President's objectives to be \naccomplished, because I knew my amendment would fail. It would fail \nbecause a coalition from the right, which has elevated the war on Iraq \nover the war on terrorism and now is attempting to confuse the \ndifference between these two, with a coalition from the left which \nopposes any increase in President Bush's authority to use U.S. military \nforce. So I did not offer the amendment. But I will remain true to my \nconvictions, as I voted no on this supplemental appropriations bill.\n  I know a vote against this bill will be described as a vote against \nour troops. I would say, however, the best way to support our troops is \nto get other soldiers from other nations into Iraq. First, we need \ntroops from other nations as an addition to the presence of military \nforce in Iraq to increase security and, hopefully, end the shooting \ngallery which we have forced our brave men and women to endure. I would \nsuggest an additional 50,000 troops are needed to secure the peace.\n  Second, we need to get additional foreign troops on the ground to \nsubstitute for American troops so our soldiers, our men and women who \nhave been enduring long deployments in hot, dangerous conditions, can \nbegin to rotate home. These additional foreign troops should number \nbetween 50,000 and 100,000.\n  Secretary Powell's efforts at the United Nations resulted yesterday \nin a unanimous vote by the Security Council. But that vote was \nimmediately followed by firm statements from the French, the Germans, \nthe Pakistanis, the Russians, and others that they will not lend \nadditional troops or financial aid to the occupation and reconstruction \nof Iraq. The fact that the Security Council passed a resolution is \ncommendable, but not one of the 100,000 to 150,000 foreign troops \nneeded to secure Iraq and relieve our troops has been provided.\n  Without commitments of troops and Euros and rubles and rupees, there \nwill be no additional protection or burden-sharing for U.S. troops who \nare on the ground in Iraq.\n  I warn my colleagues, I have detected two clocks ticking on our \nalmost unilateral occupation of Iraq. The first clock is the increasing \nreluctance of other countries, countries which are capable of doing so, \nto participate in the occupation and rebuilding of Iraq. If the United \nStates had requested immediately after the war that these countries \nparticipate and did so under respectful conditions, it is quite likely \nwe would have significant support on the ground in Iraq tonight. \nHowever, almost 6 months later, as the violence and the cost of \noccupation and restoration in Iraq accelerates, those nations\n\n[[Page S12831]]\n\ncapable of sharing the burden and willing to do so have shrunk. On the \ncurrent course their number may evaporate.\n\n  The second clock has been the declining support of the American \npeople, as evidenced by recent polls. The decline has steepened since \nthe President's request for this supplemental spending bill was \nannounced during a televised address on Sunday, September 7, of this \nyear. Here are the poll numbers. When Americans were asked, do you \napprove of the President's policy in Iraq, as recently as April, 75 \npercent of Americans answered yes. By June, that 75 percent had \ndeclined to 67 percent. From the latest poll, which was published on \nOctober 14, just 50 percent of Americans said they approved of the \nPresident's policy in Iraq. Clearly, the American people are not \nwilling to write a blank check for rebuilding Iraq when we have so many \nunmet needs here at home, when the cost of that occupation has been so \ngreat in terms of loss of life and American dollars.\n  A component of this second ticking clock is the ominous state of \nmorale among our troops in Iraq, as found in a nonscientific survey \nconducted by the military newspaper, Stars and Stripes.\n  This survey demonstrated that fully a third of regular Army troops \ndescribed their morale as either low or very low. Among reservists and \nNational Guard members, 48 percent, almost half, described their morale \nas low or very low.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print a copy of an article from the \nOctober 16 issue of Stars and Stripes in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Stars and Stripes, Oct. 16, 2003]\n\n  In Survey, Many in Iraq Call Morale Low; Leaders Say Job Is Getting \n                                  Done\n\n                          (By Ward Sanderson)\n\n       What is the morale of U.S. troops in Iraq?\n       Answers vary. High-ranking visitors to the country, \n     including Department of Defense and congressional officials, \n     have said it is outstanding.\n       Some troops on the ground have begged to differ, writing to \n     Stars and Stripes and to others about what they call low \n     morale on their part and on the part of their units.\n       There was a correlation between such things as local \n     services and release dates on the one hand, and morale on the \n     other.\n       Stars and Stripes sent a team of reporters to Iraq to try \n     to ascertain the states of both conditions and morale. Troops \n     were asked about morale, among many other issues, in a 17-\n     point questionnaire, which was filled out and returned by \n     nearly 2,000 persons.\n       The results varied, sometimes dramatically:\n       Among the largest group surveyed, Army troops, the results \n     looked much like a bell curve. Twenty-seven percent said \n     their personal morale was ``high'' or ``very high.'' Thirty-\n     three percent said it was ``low'' or ``very low.'' The \n     largest percentage fell in the middle, saying it was \n     ``average.''\n       Among the second largest group, reservists and National \n     Guard members, the differences were much starker. Only 15 \n     percent said their own morale was ``high'' or ``very high,'' \n     while 48 percent said it was ``low'' or ``very low.''\n       Among Marines, the next largest group, 44 percent said \n     their morale was ``high'' or ``very high,'' and only 14 \n     percent said it was ``low'' or ``very low.''\n       Among airmen, the smallest of the four major groups \n     surveyed because fewer questionnaires were allowed to be \n     circulated to them, the results were also very positive. \n     Thirty-nine percent said their morale was ``high'' or ``very \n     high,'' and only 6 percent said it was ``low'' or ``very \n     low.''\n       Very few Navy servicemembers could be found to question in \n     Iraq.\n       The questionnaire findings can't be projected to all the \n     servicemembers in Iraq. Still, the reporting of ``lows'' \n     among the two largest groups surveyed, Army and Reserve/\n     National Guard, seemed significant. The views of these \n     troops, at least, appeared to contrast sharply with those of \n     the visiting VIPs.\n       Respondents to the survey were not given a definition of \n     morale. They responded according to what they interpreted the \n     word to mean. Some believe morale reflects the degree of \n     well-being felt by the servicemember. On the other hand, \n     commanders say that in measuring morale, they want to know \n     if the servicemember is following orders and getting the \n     job done.\n       Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, the top U.S. officer in Iraq, \n     said that low morale isn't an issue because troops are \n     fulfilling the mission.\n       ``Morale is . . . not necessarily giving them Baskin-\n     Robbins,'' he said in a Stars and Stripes interview. \n     ``Sometimes it's being able to train them hard and keep them \n     focused in a combat environment so they can survive.\n       ``So as its most fundamental level within our Army, taking \n     care of soldiers and their morale could have very few worldly \n     comforts. But the morale of the soldier is good. He's being \n     taken care of, he's accomplishing his mission, he's being \n     successful in the warfighting.''\n       Other military leaders say they are always looking at ways \n     to improve the morale of their troops. ``Morale begins with \n     caring leaders looking their soldiers in the eye,'' said Lt. \n     Col. Jim Cassella, a Pentagon spokesman. ``When senior \n     leaders visit the troops in Iraq, they relate that the troops \n     tell them that moral is good, a fact that's backed up by re-\n     enlistment and retention rates.''\n       (These rates have been acceptable or good for the services \n     overall. Figures for re-enlistments in Iraq are not available \n     yet, officials said. In the Stripes survey, half or more \n     respondents from the Army, Marines and Reserves said they \n     were unlikely to stay in the service. Officials say \n     reenlistments normally drop after conflicts.)\n       Cassella said that leaders visiting Iraq seek out the \n     opinions of troops. Some say the views expressed may be \n     distorted as a result of the nature of the get-togethers, \n     ``dog and pony shows,'' in the words of combat engineer Pfc. \n     Roger Hunsaker.\n       ``When congressional delegations came through,'' said one \n     36-year-old artillery master sergeant who asked not to be \n     identified, commanders ``hand-picked the soldiers who would \n     go. They stacked the deck.''\n       Others on the ground in Iraq think top leaders are right \n     more times than they are given credit for.\n       ``I heard that reports/politicians were trying to say \n     morale was down out here,'' Petty Officer Matthew W. Early \n     wrote on his questionnaire at Camp Get Some in southern Iraq. \n     ``What do people back home expect us to feel after a war? Are \n     we supposed to be as happy here as we are with our friends \n     and families back home? Hell no.\n       ``Of course, when confronted by reporters, we're going to \n     voice our opinions about our situation. Unfortunately, some \n     people like to complain about how they live or what they \n     don't have. The complaint concerning morale is the voice of \n     the minority, not the majority.''\n       In the Stripes survey, troops consistently rated their \n     unit's morale as lower than their own. John Kay, marketing \n     director for the Army Research Institute, said, ``Soldiers \n     always rate self [personal] morale higher than unit morale. \n     This is nothing new.''\n       Troops may wish to report what they perceive as the true \n     morale situation without getting themselves into trouble, a \n     way of saying, ``I'm OK, but the unit's not.''\n       Some of the gap can also be the result of hearing other \n     troops complain, compounding the impression that unit morale \n     is low, even if each complainer believes his or her own \n     morale is better.\n       ``Both are true,'' said Charles Moskos, a military \n     sociologist with Northwestern University.\n       The military studies morale regularly, but ``the further \n     you go up the chain in the officer corps, the reality of day-\n     to-day morale cannot register completely,'' said Lt. Col. \n     Daniel Smith, retired chief of research for the Center for \n     Defense Information. ``Whereas when you talk to the platoon \n     sergeants, platoon leaders and even company commanders, you \n     get a better sense of the true state of affairs. Do the \n     weapons work? Are they getting hot meals? Are they getting \n     enough rest? Are their leaders competent and not taking \n     unnecessary risks?''\n       Unlike some officials who have visited Iraq, Defense \n     Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, during a September stop in \n     Iraq, spoke not about morale per se, but about the importance \n     of the mission and about sacrifice.\n       ``You're people . . . who weren't drafted, you weren't \n     conscripted, you searched your souls and decided that you \n     wanted to step forward and serve your country,'' he told the \n     4th Infantry Division, according to a Pentagon transcript.\n       Another speech to air assault soldiers of the 101st \n     Airborne division echoed the sentiment:\n       ``The important thing I would also add is that every one of \n     you is a volunteer. You all asked to do this, and that is \n     impressive and it's appreciated.''\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. At this stage we have two options in the \nconflict that has engulfed us in Iraq. We can continue to carry on \nunilaterally, which is the course we have taken, a course which, in my \njudgment, will be continued through this $87 billion supplemental \nappropriation; or, second, to the maximum degree possible, pursue a \nreal internationalization of the occupation and reconstruction of Iraq, \na sharing of the burden of blood and treasure and responsibility for \ndecisionmaking while also including a central role for Iraqis in \ndetermining the future of their country.\n  Of these two options, the second, the commitment to real \ninternationalization, has significantly more potential to get us out of \nIraq as honorably and as expeditiously as possible. If we do not change \nfrom our current unilateral course, we will continue to bear the \nunilateral burdens alone: One soldier killed per day, 10 soldiers \nmaimed per day, an increasing cost of occupation. Last year the \noccupation cost $1 billion a week. Under the supplemental appropriation \nwe have just voted, it will now\n\n[[Page S12832]]\n\nbe $1.3 billion a week. The total cost of reconstruction, including the \nfunds we have just voted, through September 30 of next year will be \nalmost $25 billion.\n  This administration has avoided answering the question: How much will \nwe spend before we exit Iraq?\n  As a result, I am concerned that this $87 billion supplemental \nappropriation is in essence a blank check for the President's failed \npolicy. It will remove a substantial portion of the pressure for real \nprogress in the internationalization of the occupation and \nreconstruction efforts directed at Iraq. Passage of this supplemental \nspending bill will remove the incentive for this administration to \nnegotiate.\n  Mr. President, the reality is that it is only through significant \ninternational troops and money, only with significant decision sharing \nby the United States with those foreign countries that our Nation has \nany reasonable expectation of an honorable and expeditious exit from \nIraq.\n  This appropriation leads us in the opposite direction. We will do it \nalone. It will increase the risk to our brave soldiers. It will \nunnecessarily transfer reconstruction costs to the U.S. taxpayer, and \nit will lengthen the time when the United States can honorably and \nexpeditiously leave Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today has been a very good day in the \nSenate, as well as in the House of Representatives, with a strong \nbipartisan majority vote in both Houses of Congress approving the funds \nnecessary to support our soldiers and civilians serving in Iraq and to \nmove quickly to stabilize Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I believe this is a major victory for the President of the United \nStates in his efforts to bring stability and peace to Iraq.\n  Personally, I am very pleased with the overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport for the President's proposal in the Senate. When the package \nwas first sent to the Hill several weeks ago, very few thought it \npossible. We have had to make a number of difficult votes and, indeed, \nwe worked very late last night, into the early hours of this morning, \ncompleting this bill, now, just several hours ago.\n  I am certain the Senate- and House-passed bills will allow us that \nopportunity to negotiate a final legislative package that, indeed, will \ngive the President everything he requested.\n  It was important to do. It was important to complete this legislation \ntoday especially, not only to get the money to our troops as soon as \npossible and to rebuild the civilian infrastructure in Iraq as soon as \npossible but also because of the donor conference in Madrid next week.\n  The President, indeed, has made a strong stand for freedom and \ndemocracy in Iraq, as well as Afghanistan, and he has taken forceful \naction against brutality and terrorism in the region, and by doing so \nhas made America safer and our citizens more secure.\n  Indeed, we are at war in Afghanistan as well as Iraq. The funds in \nthis legislation provide both the direct support for our soldiers, as \nwell as an investment in creating a safer environment in the countries \nwhere they serve. The legislation will make them safer and, in all \nlikelihood, will get them home sooner.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to commend Senator Stevens for \nhis tremendous leadership on this particular legislation, as well as \nSenator Warner and Senator McCain and Senator McConnell, all for their \ntireless efforts to pass this emergency funding request.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/17/senate-section/article/S12832-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MEASURE RETURNED TO THE CALENDAR--S. 1689\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in \nPittsburgh, PA. On April 19, 2002, Adam Bishop was bludgeoned to death \nwith a claw hammer by his own brother, Ian Bishop, 14, and alleged \naccomplice Robert Laskowski, 15. As several witnesses testified, the \nkilling was because Ian thought his brother was gay. The victim was \nstruck by his brother at least 15 times with the hammer and was moved \nto various parts of the home before he was left to die in a bathtub.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/17/senate-section/article/S12832-5", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DISARMING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ABUSERS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last week the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun \nViolence United, with the Million Mom March, released a report entitled \n``Disarming Domestic Violence Abusers.'' This report provides a guide \nfor closing loopholes in State gun laws that allow domestic violence \nabusers to purchase or possess firearms and offers Congress some \ninsight into how to help our States effectively enforce gun safety \nlaws.\n  Under current Federal law, domestic violence abusers subject to \nrestraining orders or convicted of domestic violence are prohibited \nfrom owning guns. Despite the law, some domestic violence offenders \ncontinue to gain access to firearms.\n  The Brady report proposes a number of ways to keep guns out of the \nhands of domestic violence offenders. Among the suggestions are \nensuring that restraining orders clearly state that the possession of a \nfirearm is prohibited and that restraining orders be entered into state \nand national databases used to conduct background checks on gun sales. \nFurther, the report recommends that law enforcement remove firearms \nfrom the scene of domestic violence incidents. Finally, stopping \ndomestic abusers from buying additional guns requires background checks \non the sale of all firearm transfers, including those that take place \nat gun shows.\n  The deadly combination of domestic violence and guns put many women \nand families at great risk. While Federal laws provide a general \nframework to prevent abusers from purchasing or possessing firearms, \nthe Federal laws will not be effective in protecting women from armed \nabusers until every State enacts complementary laws. I urge my \ncolleagues to read the Brady Campaign's report and to support Federal \nefforts that assist States with enforcing our Nation's gun safety laws.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/17/senate-section/article/S12832-6", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12832-S12833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             NANOTECHNOLOGY\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, recently I hosted a luncheon of the \nAmerican Chemical Society on nanotechnology. It was a pleasure to be in \nthe company of so many brilliant minds, and those concerned with the \ntechnological and economic future of our Nation.\n  Of all the areas of scientific innovation being developed today, none \nis more profound than nanotechnology. The ability to manipulate \nindividual atoms is unprecedented in human history and could lead to \nthe redesign of\n\n[[Page S12833]]\n\nmost products we know of today. Some have even said it could lead to \nthe ``Second Industrial Revolution.'' Its scope is nothing other than \nbreathtaking.\n  In the area of national security, nanotechnology has been identified \nas one of the most important strategic research areas. Revolutionary \napplications could include: very lightweight but extremely strong \narmor, vastly smaller and more powerful computers, microscopic sensor \nsystems, and tiny unmanned vehicles. These could provide vastly \nincreased capabilities for our armed forces. Conversely, to fall behind \nin these new areas will present us with a critical security risk.\n  Unfortunately, the United States is no longer the only world leader \nin many areas of nanoscience, as many countries have recognized its \nimportance and are greatly increasing their funding. With stakes this \nhigh, we must pay close attention to the choices we make.\n  I understand the stakes and stand four-square behind public-private \nefforts to keep America in the lead in nanotechnology. Just as we led \nthe industrial revolution, America will lead this new scientific \nrevolution for the benefit of generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/17/senate-section/article/S12833-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RETIREMENT OF MG ARNOLD PUNARO\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I was privileged to attend the retirement \nceremony of MG Arnold Punaro from the U.S. Marine Corps on September \n19, 2003 at the Marine Barracks here in Washington, DC. General Punaro \nis known to many here in the Senate from his outstanding service of \nmany years as staff director of the Senate Armed Services Committee and \non the personal staff of Senator Sam Nunn. I ask unanimous consent that \nthere be printed in the Record, at this point, portions of the remarks \nmade at the ceremony by Gen. James L. Jones, Supreme Allied Commander, \nEurope and Commander, U.S. European Command.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nRemarks of General James L. Jones, Supreme Allied Commander, Europe and \n                    Commander, U.S. European Command\n\n       The real reason we are all here is to pay honor to a true \n     patriot who has given so much of his time and talent to our \n     Nation, and to each of us . . . Major General Arnold Punaro, \n     United States Marine.\n       We also honor an exceptional family, which has supported \n     him through his life in the ``public sector' of Capitol Hill \n     and in his career in the U.S. Marine Corps. Jan Punaro stands \n     in no shadow among spouses who deserve our eternal gratitude. \n     Her support to Arnold, through his ``many'' simultaneous \n     careers, has been remarkable.\n       Arnold has been a marine since 1968, a personal staff \n     member for Senator Sam Nunn for 24 years, a minority and \n     majority staff director of the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee for a total of 15 years, a member of Georgetown \n     University's adjunct faculty for ten years, and a most \n     valuable ``utility infielder'' of the Department of Defense \n     on a wide range of issues all having to do with \n     transformation, long before the term itself became popular.\n       As a marine, Arnold Punaro has literally ``done it all'' . \n     . . Republic of Vietnam combat leader, wounded and decorated, \n     the Marine Corps basic school ``staff protocol officer.'' \n     Upon leaving active duty, he went into the reserves where he \n     saw active duty in Desert Shield/Desert Storm, and in the \n     Balkans where he battled the largest snow storm ever to hit \n     Zagreb. He has participated in the Marine Corps \n     transformation starting back in 1995 until today. In 1997 he \n     chaired the ``Defense Reform Task Force'' for Secretary Cohen \n     and produced a document that remains very current. He also \n     participated in the Hart-Rudman Commission, and currently \n     serves on the Secretary of Defense's newly formed Defense \n     Business Board.\n       In the public sector, Arnold Punaro started his post-active \n     duty life working for Senator Sam Nunn, rapidly rising from \n     press secretary to foreign policy/national security \n     legislative assistant on the Senator's personal staff, before \n     moving to the Senate Armed Services Committee and its \n     leadership positions as Director for both the Minority and \n     the Majority. The legislation produced during his time on the \n     committee was both historic and transformational. Let's be \n     clear . . . where we are today in our military has a lot to \n     do with the fact that Arnold Punaro was where he was in a \n     very important time for each of our services, starting with \n     the all-volunteer force and Goldwater-Nickles legislation.\n       Arnold Punaro is currently serving as the Director of \n     Reserve Affairs at Headquarters Marine Corps. He has been \n     instrumental in bringing the ``Marine for Life Program'' to \n     fruition in these past few years, for which I am sincerely \n     grateful. Marines now can have a lifelong association with \n     the Corps regardless of their career pursuits. Always a \n     passionate advocate, Arnold Punaro's well known compassion \n     for the lives of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines and \n     their families defines him in all that he is and cared about.\n       As an adjunct professor (with one bachelor of science and \n     two masters of arts) at my alma mater, Georgetown University, \n     for over ten years he helped mold and shape the minds of our \n     future leaders on national security issues.\n       For all he has done in his short life, Arnold Punaro has \n     always found time for his family . . . the son of Angelo and \n     Anina Punaro, first generation Italian-Americans from \n     southern Italy, who watched with great admiration as young \n     Arnold grew into manhood and became a United States Marine, \n     going off to war in 1967.\n       His company commander in Vietnam, COL Jim Van Riper, and \n     his wife Connie, are here today to pay tribute to this great \n     American, and we welcome them back to this post where they \n     served with distinction in the early 70's. We're all proud of \n     Arnold and Jan and their children, especially as we celebrate \n     the safe return of 1LT Joe Punaro, USMC from Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom where he served at the front of Marine lines in the \n     capture of Baghdad. Joe . . . welcome home, we're all very \n     proud of you and your Marines.\n       Arnold, it is a special honor for me to be able to be here \n     today. We've known each other for 24 years, and for 24 years \n     I've been privileged to have a front row seat which has \n     allowed me to witness your very significant contributions to \n     our Nation, both in and out of uniform. Very simply, you have \n     been and remain today a special asset, and people who make \n     the big decisions, who need the really good advice, the \n     thoughtful consideration on difficult issues, turn to you \n     knowing that you will always give straightforward, \n     thoughtful, and forthright advice. In this respect, you are \n     in a class by yourself.\n       You stand here today, in our eyes, as a great Marine. The \n     Corps has benefitted from your wise advice for many years, \n     through both good times and bad times, and we are all the \n     better for all you have contributed. You represent the finest \n     example of the concept of the citizen-soldier by your \n     selflessness and your dedication to, simply, but \n     relentlessly, trying to do the right thing . . . regardless \n     of the difficulty or the popularity (or lack thereof) of a \n     given position.\n       All of us known full well why we are here today, and it is \n     simply for this reason, to honor you, Jan, and your family; \n     to say thank you for all you have done for all of us; and to \n     wish you well in all you will do from here on out. There is \n     still much more to be done.\n       Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, ``semper fidelis'' means \n     ``always faithful.'' Those words seem awfully appropriate \n     today as we honor Major General Arnold Punaro.\n       Well done, my friend, well done!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/17/senate-section/article/S12833-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12833-S12834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ARABIA MOUNTAIN\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, a mere 20 minutes from the steel and \nconcrete economic dynamo that is modern Atlanta, you can find a quiet \nrefuge where history and natural beauty still exist side by side.\n  I speak of the area around Arabia Mountain which contains ecosystems \nhome to endangered species, historic structures and archaeological \nsites. Its proximity to Atlanta makes it accessible to millions of \nAmericans, but also puts it in danger of urban sprawl.\n  No strip mall should obliterate the ancient soapstone quarry which \nattracted Native Americans over 5,000 years ago. Nor should \noverdevelopment mar Arabia Mountain, the granite outcropping at the \ncenter of the area. This region contains much pristine land, farmland, \nand the charming town of Lithonia. Lithonia, home to many fine \nbuildings made of locally quarried granite, has a name which means \n``stone city.'' The Arabia Mountain area still has a few farms from the \ndays when it was the heart of Georgia's dairy industry, and has \nremnants of the 1820s Georgia Gold Rush which predated the more famous \nCalifornia Gold Rush by two decades.\n  If we are serious about preserving this irreplaceable history and \nenvironment, we must act to designate Arabia Mountain in DeKalb County \nas a National Heritage Area. This designation will help preserve the \nendangered and rare species which live nearby and save historic \nbuildings from the wrecking ball. It will also allow the kind of smart \ndevelopment which preserves our heritage while allowing the kind of \ndevelopment which will provide jobs and growth for this beautiful \nregion.\n  Arabia Mountain and its surrounding area are the result of over 400 \nmillion slow years of geological changes. Men have made an impact for \nthe last 7,000 years. All this could be changed forever in another \ndecade or so of uncontrolled growth.\n\n[[Page S12834]]\n\n  The need for this action has generated support from both sides of the \naisle, in Georgia, and both houses of Congress. I thank Kelly Jordan, \nchair of the Arabia Mountain Heritage Area Alliance, Mayor Marcia \nGlenn, of Lithonia, Vernon Jones, CEO of DeKalb County, Mark Towe and \nGlen Culpepper who all have provided strong support to this effort. I \nalso extend my thanks to Congresswomen Denise Majette, for working so \nhard for this designation, as well as my friend and senior Senator from \nGeorgia, Zell Miller, for supporting this designation.\n  Vernon Jones, CEO of DeKalb County says:\n\n       Nowhere in this great nation is a project more deserving of \n     a National Heritage Area designation than this one. This \n     began as a concept between conservationists, neighborhood \n     activists, landowners and concerned citizens, and over the \n     years has grown in scope to encompass some of the richest \n     landscape Georgia has to offer. DeKalb County citizens voted \n     to tax themselves to support this project. This local funding \n     mechanism was absolutely critical to move this project \n     forward. One visit to Arabia Mountain is all the proof anyone \n     needs to demonstrate the great impact that may be achieved by \n     diverse groups working together to preserve a truly \n     significant natural heritage for future generations.\n\n  He is right. Let us act now to preserve this spot for succeeded \ngenerations and designate Arabia Mountain as a National Heritage Area.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/17/senate-section/article/S12834-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       A TRIBUTE TO LIL GREENWOOD\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I recognize the life and \ncareer of one of Alabama's musical legends, the great jazz singer Lil \nGreenwood.\n  Lil Greenwood is a living legend. She was born on November 18, 1923, \nas the youngest daughter of the late Maggie and Reverend Sylvester \nGeorge, Sr. It was at her father's side, at the age of 3, that she \nbegan to sing in the church that he served.\n  A native of Prichard, AL she grew up in Mobile County and graduated \nfrom Alabama State College. Her talents were evident to all those who \nknew her. In fact, it was the encouragement and support she received \nfrom the Mobile County Schools Music Supervisor that fanned the flame \nof ambition within her, and it was a generous gift of bus fare from a \nformer principal that allowed her to head to Oakland, CA to follow her \ndream.\n  It was in California that Lil Greenwood was to be ``discovered.'' \nDuring a performance at the famed Purple Onion in San Francisco, she \nwas heard by no less than the legendary Duke Ellington. Needless to \nsay, the Duke was suitably impressed. After hearing her sing, he \ncommented that ``the girl has a voice that's a mixture of Marian \nAnderson, Ella Fitzgerald, Dinah Washington, and Mahalia Jackson.'' \nThese women were the embodiments of jazz and blues singing, and it is \ninconceivable that a greater compliment could have been paid.\n  Recently, my home State of Alabama passed a proclamation honoring Ms. \nGreenwood for her personal and professional accomplishments. In honor \nof her upcoming 80th birthday, I would like to take this opportunity to \nread that proclamation into the Congressional Record.\n  The Proclamation reads as follows:\n\n       Whereas, born Lillian George on November 18, 1923, a native \n     of Prichard, Alabama in Mobile county and affectionately and \n     professionally known as Lil Greenwood; and\n       Whereas, Lil received her grade-school education in Mobile \n     County and graduated from Alabama state college; and\n       Whereas, she made her master-level vocal recording as early \n     as 1950 and on such recording labels as Modern, Federal, \n     Tangerine, and Columbia Records and also backed Ray Charles \n     on Paramount Records; and\n       Whereas, Lil Greenwood was the featured vocalist with The \n     Duke Ellington Orchestra and co-authored with Duke Ellington \n     and Billy Strayhorn. She has performed in many places around \n     the world, including the Far East and Europe. She has also \n     performed at many famous spots stateside including, The Blue \n     Note in Chicago, the Apollo in New York and in the San \n     Francisco Bay-Area and Oakland; and\n       Whereas, she has appeared on numerous television shows \n     including ``The Tonight Show'', with Johnny Carson, ``Good \n     Times,'' ``The Jeffersons,'' ``The Flip Wilson Show,'' and \n     ``Grady'' and on stage she has portrayed major characters in \n     such musicals as ``Hello Dolly,'' ``My People,'' ``Buffalo \n     Chips,'' ``Wedding Band,'' ``Back Alley Tales'' and ``Dark \n     Symphony''; and\n       Whereas, Lil Greenwood returned home and remains an active \n     and revered jazz singer in Alabama and has been inducted into \n     the Gulf Coast Ethnic and Heritage Jazz Festival Hall of \n     Fame:\n       Now, therefore, I, Bob Riley, Governor of the State of \n     Alabama, do hereby proclaim July 28, 2003, as Lil Greenwood \n     Day in the State of Alabama and encourage the citizens of \n     Alabama to show their support.\n\n  As is obvious by the proclamation issued by the Governor of Alabama, \nLil Greenwood has lived a life where her gifts have brought and still \ncontinue to bring joy to a great many people. It is only appropriate \nthat we take the occasion of her upcoming birthday to recognize her for \nher contributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/17/senate-section/article/S12834-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN HONOR OF DENNIS MAXWELL'S 75TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today, a constituent of mine, \nDennis Maxwell, will turn 75, and I would like to take this occasion to \nwish him a happy birthday. Dennis was born in New York City, but moved \nto Connecticut when he was six and grew up in Fairfield County. \nDennis's mother, Marguerite Maxwell, was an accomplished classical \npianist who founded the Westport School of Music, which thrives to this \nday. Dennis attended Yale University and received a bachelor's degree \nin Business Administration in 1950.\n  Dennis married his childhood sweetheart, Robin Tucker, and the two of \nthem headed to Texas, where he served in the Army as an intelligence \nofficer during the Korean War. He and his wife contributed four \nchildren to the baby boom generation and lived for a time in Michigan. \nThe Maxwells moved (back) to Connecticut in 1966.\n  Dennis has had a successful business career, working for companies \nlike Scovill Manufacturing, which was founded in Waterbury in 1802, and \nN.L. Industries. For the past several years, he has run his own water \nconditioning business.\n  Andre Maurois wrote, ``Growing old is no more than a bad habit which \na busy man has no time to form.'' If that's true, Dennis may be turning \n75, but he's not growing old. In addition to running a company, he is \nan avid golfer and more important active in his community. At Christ & \nHoly Trinity Episcopal Church in Westport, Dennis has been a vestry \nmember, chaired the church's capital campaign, and served on several \ncommittees. When his beloved wife Robin became wheelchair-bound from \nemphysema, he raised the funds to put an elevator in the church. Sadly, \nshe succumbed to the disease in 1997, after 46 years of marriage. In \naddition to his church-related duties, Dennis has served as president \nof the local Alcohol and Drug Dependency Council, and he has been on \nthe board of Interfaith Housing, a not-for-profit ecumenical group that \nprovides clothing and shelter for area homeless people.\n  Thoreau admonishes us to ``Aim above morality. Be not simply good; be \ngood for something.'' Over the course of his life, Dennis has been \ndevoted to his family, his community, and his country. I think that \ncounts as being ``good for something,'' and I would like to join his \nchildren--Anne, Linda, Lisa, and Gray (who has worked here in the \nSenate for 19 years and is currently Senator Lautenberg's legislative \ndirector)--and their families and Dennis' many friends in wishing him a \nvery happy 75th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/17/senate-section/article/S12834-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12834-S12835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JEAN SUTTON\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndear friend, Jean Elizabeth Rodgers Sutton, of Linden, AL. Jean Sutton \ndied on Tuesday, September 16, at the age of 62.\n  Jean was born in Jackson, MS, and attended Hinds Junior College in \nRaymond, MS. She received a Junior College Press Association \nScholarship to continue her education at the University of Southern \nMississippi.\n  It was at the University of Southern Mississippi that she met her \nhusband, Goodloe Sutton, and they were married in 1964 after Jean had \ngraduated and worked for a year as editor of the Tylertown Times in \nTylertown, MS.\n  After moving to Linden, Jean worked as a reporter for the award-\nwinning Democrat Reporter, the weekly newspaper owned by her husband. \nShe also taught girls physical education and journalism at Linden High \nSchool.\n\n[[Page S12835]]\n\nAfter teaching at Linden High School for two years, she began working \nfull time for the Democrat Reporter where she served as managing \neditor.\n  Together, Jean and Goodloe worked as a husband-and-wife reporting \nteam. In the 1990s, they successfully exposed corruption and a drug \nring involving the Marengo County Sheriff's office, amid death threats \nand intense pressure throughout their community. Their investigative \nreporting led to an FBI investigation and the conviction of the \ncounty's sheriff in 1997.\n  Jean also found time to raise a family. She and Goodloe raised two \nexceptional sons. Their son, Howard Goodloe, is a graduate of Auburn \nUniversity and I am pleased to have him as a member of my staff. He has \nserved as my State Director since 2000. And, William Robert Sutton \nattends Southern Union Community College.\n  Jean Sutton was a good friend, a leader in the Linden community, and \na role model for investigative journalists. Her tremendous courage, her \nhard work and sacrifices on behalf of her readers, and her dedication \nto her family serve as an example of excellence for every reporter, \nparent and citizen. She will be greatly missed by many.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/17/senate-section/article/S12835-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PRESIDENT OF THE ARIZONA FARM BUREAU RETIRES\n\n Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I rise today in the Senate to \nhonor and pay tribute to Charleen Combs and Bob Harris for each being \nnamed the Kentucky Small Business Person of the Year.\n  Almost 20 years ago, Charleen Combs and Bob Harris found themselves \nin a quandary. Their employer had been sold and was downsizing, but \nCharleen and Bob used this setback as a catalyst to strike out \nindependently and started planning the formation for their own software \ndevelopment company. In Harlan, KY in 1983, Charleen and Bob \nestablished Data Futures Inc. Today, it has carved its own sizable \nniche, producing and providing administrative software to K-12 school \ndistricts and health care facilities throughout Kentucky and other \nstates.\n  Data Futures is an outstanding example of how two Kentuckians used \ntheir entrepreneurial talent, drive and vision to create opportunities \nnot just for themselves, but for others. What began as a humble home-\nbased computer services business almost 20 years ago is now a leading \ndeveloper of management systems software for school districts in at \nleast seven States.\n  Eastern Kentucky is fortunate to have Data Future as a home-based \nbusiness. But more importantly, it is fortunate to have Charleen and \nBob call Eastern Kentucky home. I appreciate their loyalty to Kentucky \nand their community. They have been a shining example of leadership, \nhard work, and compassion. They are an inspiration to all throughout \nthe Commonwealth. Congratulations, Charleen and Bob. You are Kentucky \nat its finest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/17/senate-section/article/S12835-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT ILLINOIS COLLEGES \n                            AND UNIVERSITIES\n\n Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I rise today to note that the Arizona \nBankers Association will commemorate its 100th anniversary next month--\non November 13.\n  The Arizona Bankers Association was founded in 1903 by bankers from \nacross what was still known as the Arizona Territory. The association \nwas established to represent Arizona's diverse banking industry as it \ndeveloped and grew to meet the financial needs of the early settlers. \nWhile at first its members served a sparsely populated territory, they \nnow serve on the fastest growing States in the Nation. today, the \nArizona Bankers Association represents banks of all sizes from every \ncorner of our great State, employing over 10,500 people.\n  The Arizona Bankers Association's success and longevity are testament \nto the commitment and dedication of the banks and bankers who comprise \nits membership. The tremendous economic growth that draws so many \npeople from other parts of the country to Arizona is due, in no small \npart, to the financial services and capital that are provided through \nthe association's member banks. These institutions have nearly $3 \nbillion outstanding in loans to small business and some $42 billion in \ntotal loans and leases.\n  To the member institutions of the Arizona Bankers Association, I \noffer my best wishes on achieving this impressive milestone and on \nbeginning their second century of advocacy, service, and leadership. I \nlook forward to continuing to work with them to provide Arizonans and \nArizona's businesses with the financial services and credit that will \nlead the state to even greater prosperity in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/17/senate-section/article/S12835-5", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12835-S12836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 11:12 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 1474.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to low-interest loans for military personnel called \n     to active duty; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 283\n\n       Whereas, The recent events in our country have served to \n     remind us of the degree to which our nation relies upon the \n     sacrifices of our men and women in the military. With the \n     call to active duty of thousands of members of National Guard \n     and reserve units for overseas deployment and an increasing \n     range of domestic security assignments, it is clear that our \n     military strength is rooted in both the professional ranks \n     and those working in civilian life while serving as ready \n     reserves; and\n       Whereas, The men and women called to active duty to help \n     the country respond to a crisis such as we have faced since \n     September 11, 2001, do so at great cost to their families \n     and, often, their careers. The uncertain length of the \n     activation in the current situation can make the return to \n     active duty a devastating blow to the finances of a family or \n     a small business. When the person called to duty is the \n     primary breadwinner in a family, for example, as is often the \n     case, the family can face many difficulties. The mortgage \n     payments, food and utility bills, and costs of raising \n     children do not go away when the regular paycheck is replaced \n     by a military paycheck that is usually far less; and\n       Whereas, While it would be impossible to cover the entire \n     burden facing many families, it would be helpful for the \n     federal government to do all it can to address this issue. A \n     low-interest loan program for those whose active duty pay is \n     less than civilian levels can provide short-term help with \n     the monthly bills. For families who have sent someone to \n     fight terrorism, whether overseas or on assignments at \n     airports or border crossings, this would be an appropriate \n     step to take: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the house of representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to provide a \n     program of low-interest loans for military personnel called \n     to active duty; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-296.

Most recently, Annex 2001 to the Great \n     Lakes Charter has demonstrated the concern of the people of \n     this region that the stewardship for this fresh water \n     resource must remain where it belongs--with the people of the \n     Great Lakes; and\n       Whereas, the Great Lakes governors work closely with one \n     another and their Canadian provincial counterparts on \n     protecting the Great Lakes on a wide range of issues related \n     to water management and a host of economic matters that \n     strongly influence the lakes. This cooperation mirrors the \n     shared stake in the quality of the lakes and reflects the \n     appropriateness of policies that clearly affirm the authority \n     of the Great Lakes Governors pursuant to the Great Lakes \n     Charter; and\n       Whereas, Federal law states: It is hereby determined and \n     declared to be in the public interest that (1) title to and \n     ownership of the lands beneath navigable waters within the \n     boundaries of their respective states and the natural \n     resources with such lands and water and (2) the right and \n     power to manage, administer, lease, develop, and use the said \n     lands and natural resources all in accordance with applicable \n     state law be, and they are hereby, subject to the provisions \n     hereof, recognized, confirmed, established, and vested in and \n     assigned to the respective states or the persons who were on \n     June 5, 1950, entitled thereto under the law of the \n     respective states in which the land is located, and the \n     respective granters, lessees, or successors in interest \n     thereof; and\n       Whereas, the Great Lakes states have demonstrated that we \n     are an effective and efficient manager of Great Lakes water \n     resources. We implore the federal government to continue to \n     allow the Great Lakes states the ability to control the Great \n     Lakes: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the house of representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to increase \n     protections for the Great Lakes and to affirm the authority \n     of the Great Lakes governors on matters or the usage of Great \n     Lakes waters; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n     Adopted by the House of Representatives, January 24, 2002\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-302.

This \n     legislation includes several billion dollars in funding to \n     the state of Florida. While the Everglades and the South \n     Florida ecosystem are clearly a unique resource, the Great \n     Lakes ecosystem has a prevailing international and national \n     economic significance due to the shipping of raw materials, \n     industrial products, and food, not to mention being the home \n     of 20 percent of the world's fresh surface water, and 95 \n     percent of the United States' fresh surface water; and\n       Whereas, With the Great Lakes at the heart of American \n     industrial and agricultural production, and the source of \n     recreation for millions, the United States of America must do \n     all it can to assure the viability of the health of the \n     lakes: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the house of representatives, That we call upon \n     the Congress of the United States to fund the Great Lakes \n     Basin with similar appropriations that have been afforded the \n     Florida Everglades and the South Florida ecosystem; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representative, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, and the United States \n     Secretary of the Interior.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-303.

Consistent with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice, stating that the emergency declared with respect to \nsignificant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia is to continue \nin effect beyond October 21, 2003, to the Federal Register for \npublication. The most recent notice continuing this emergency was \npublished in the Federal Register on October 18, 2002.\n  The circumstances that led to the declaration on October 21, 1995, of \na national emergency have not been resolved. The actions of significant \nnarcotics traffickers centered in Colombia continue to pose an unusual \nand extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and \neconomy of the United States and to cause unparalleled violence, \ncorruption, and harm in the United States and abroad. For these \nreasons, I have determined that it is necessary to maintain economic \npressure on significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia by \nblocking their property or interests in property that are in the United \nStates or within the possession or control of United States persons and \nby depriving them of access to the United States market and financial \nsystem.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to enhance national security by improving the \nreliability of the U.S. electricity transmission grid, to ensure \nefficient, reliable and affordable energy to American consumers, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n[[Page S12840]]\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing comprehensive \nlegislation to ensure the reliable delivery of electric power in the \nUnited States. I am pleased have the Senior Senator from Massachusetts \nand the Senator from Washington join me as original cosponsors of this \nbill.\n  This past August, nearly 50 million people in the Northeast and \nMidwest were affected by a massive power outage. Hurricane Isabel and \nother weather systems left millions more without power. These events \nemphasize the vulnerability of the U.S. electricity grid to human \nerror, mechanical failure, and weather-related outages.\n  Unfortunately, the electricity provisions now being considered in the \non-going energy bill conference were written well before these recent \nevents. The pending energy bill fails to do all that is necessary to \nprotect the grid from devastating interruptions in the future. That is \nwhy I am introducing this bill today to ensure greater reliability in \nour electricity delivery system.\n  My bill, the Electric Reliability Security Act of 2003, will help \nachieve reliability and security of the electricity grid in an \nefficient, cost-effective, and environmentally sound manner. It does so \nby creating mandatory, nationwide electric reliability standards.\n  The bill also mandates regional coordination in the siting of \ntransmission facilities, and provides $10 billion in loan guarantees to \nfinance ``smart grid'' technologies that improve the way the grid \ntransmits power.\n  While a $10 billion investment may seem to be a large investment, it \nis significantly less than the transmission cost estimates that have \ncirculated following the Northeast blackout. In response to the events \nthis past August, industry experts estimated that it would cost \nconsumers as much as $100 billion to upgrade transmission systems and \nsite new lines to meet future reliability needs.\n  However, even this hefty price tag does not factor in the costs of \nadditional generation, does not consider the rising cost of natural gas \ndue to increasing electricity consumption, and does not include the \nenvironmental and other social costs of continued expansion of our \npresently centralized power system. Power lines are expensive and are \nrarely welcomed by the nearby public. The loan guarantees in the bill \nwill help balance the need for new transmission lines by providing \nFederal resources to help improve existing ones.\n  In addition to addressing system operation and transmission needs, \nthe bill also promotes sound system management. It establishes a \nFederal system benefits fund as a match for State programs.\n  Historically, regulated electric utility companies have provided a \nnumber of energy-related public services beyond simply supplying \nelectricity that benefit the system as a whole. Such services have \nincluded bill payment assistance and energy conservation measures for \nlow-income households, energy efficiency programs for residential and \nbusiness customers, and pilot programs to promote renewable energy \nresources. More than 20 States, including my home State of Vermont, \nhave public benefits programs. This bill will provide needed Federal \nmatching money to States for these programs.\n  The Alliance to Save Energy estimates that a Federal program to match \nexisting State public benefits programs would save 1.24 trillion \nkilowatt-hours of electricity over 20 years, and cut consumer energy \nbills by about $100 billion. My bill, which has the potential to save \nconsumers $100 billion is far preferable to raising consumer \nelectricity bills by the $100 billion to raise money for grid \nexpansion.\n  The bill also establishes energy efficiency performance standards for \nutilities. The United States has experienced tremendous growth in \nelectricity consumption over the past decade. Current estimates are \nthat electricity consumption is increasing at roughly two percent per \nyear.\n  Between 1993 and 1999, U.S. summer peak electricity use alone \nincreased by 95,000 megawatts. This is the equivalent of adding a new, \nsix-State New England to the Nation's electricity demand every fourteen \nmonths.\n  Energy experts estimate that as much as 50 percent of expected new \ndemand over the next 20 years can be met through consumer efficiency \nand load management programs. Over the past two decades, utility \ndemand-side efficiency programs have avoided the need for more than 100 \n300-megawatt power plants. However, with the advent of electricity \nderegulation, utility spending on these efficiency programs has dropped \nby almost half.\n  The Federal Government should seek to correct this trend, and this \nbill takes a strong first step in that direction by phasing in a \nrequirement that utilities reduce their peak demand for power and their \ncustomers' power use between 2004 and 2013.\n  Finally, the bill enacts standards that enable increased on-site, or \ndistributed, generation to reduce pressure on the grid and lessen the \nimpact of a blackout should one occur. We have an obligation to ensure \nthat the electricity grid is secure. We currently have a giant system \nconsisting of almost 200,000 miles of interconnecting lines that \nconstantly shift huge amounts of electricity throughout the country.\n  Such a giant and complex system, traversing miles of city and \ncountryside, is inevitably subject to unforeseen problems. Simply \nmaking it bigger will never take away all uncertainty, nor can it \neliminate the vulnerability of the grid to sabotage or terrorist \nattack. We should do all we can to make certain such vulnerabilities \nare reduced.\n  In summary, I am introducing this legislation because I feel that we \nshould be cautious in our assumptions that the answer to our nation's \nreliability woes lies primarily in building a bigger, more expansive \ngrid. Simply building more transmission lines is not the answer.\n  Investments in energy efficiency and on-site generation can \nsignificantly improve the reliability of the nation's electricity grid \nand in most cases will be cheaper, faster to implement and more \nenvironmentally friendly than large-scale grid expansion. We also must \nfill the regulatory gaps in the system, which my bill does. Congress \nshould establish mandatory reliability standards and close other \nregulatory gaps left by state deregulation of the electricity sector. \nIn addition, no national reliability program will be effective or \ncomplete without strong incentives for demand-side management programs, \nfor efficiency and for on-site generation.\n  We cannot solve today's energy problems with yesterday's solutions. \nMy bill is an innovative approach to ensuring electric reliability by \nmaximizing energy efficiency, regulatory efficiency, and efficient \ninvestment. Given the high costs of power outages to our country, we \ncannot afford to do otherwise.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me in my efforts to advance energy \nsecurity and reliability in the United States.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch \nAct\n\n[[Page S12846]]\n\nto provide grants to support farm-to-cafeteria projects; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today, with my \nrespected colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, the Farm-to-\nCafeteria Projects Act of 2003. This important bipartisan proposal will \nsupport grassroots efforts all across our Nation to bring school \ncafeterias and local farms together.\n  It is amazing how many kids do not know where the food that they eat \ncomes from. It is also amazing how far some farm products travel to get \nto the cafeteria table. The Farm-to-Cafeteria Projects Act of 2003 will \nestablish a U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, grant program to help \nschools connect children with local farms by bringing fresh local foods \nto their cafeterias and by implementing hands-on nutrition education \nprograms.\n  Communities all across our Nation are beginning to explore the \nconcept of linking farms and cafeterias. In my home State of Vermont, \nfrom rural towns like Jay and Westfield to the city of Burlington, \nschools have experimented with how they can integrate the daily service \nof school meals with classroom learning and local agriculture. And as \nmore schools create these connections, more and more want to learn how \nthey too can start a program. Oftentimes these are very small schools, \nwhich do not have the staff or money to kick off a project on their \nown. With just a little money and some technical assistance, these \nschools can create a program that teaches kids about good nutrition, \nshows them the importance of agriculture, and supports local farms by \nkeeping food dollars within the community. In introducing The Farm-to-\nCafeteria Projects Act of 2003, Senator Specter and I seek to provide \nthese communities with the assistance they need to get such school and \nfarm partnerships off the ground. I urge my colleagues to join us in \nsupport of this exciting initiative, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1755\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 246\n\n       Whereas the Grand Ronde Restoration Act (25 U.S.C. 713 et \n     seq.), which was signed by the President on November 22, \n     1983, restored Federal recognition to the Confederated Tribes \n     of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon;\n       Whereas the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde \n     Community of Oregon historically inhabited land that extended \n     from the summit of the Cascade Range, west along the shores \n     of the Columbia River to the summit of the Coast Range, and \n     south to the California border;\n       Whereas in addition to restoring Federal recognition, that \n     Act and other Federal Indian statutes have provided the means \n     for the Confederated Tribes to achieve the goals of cultural \n     restoration, economic self-sufficiency, and the attainment of \n     a standard of living equivalent to that enjoyed by other \n     citizens of the United States;\n       Whereas by enacting the Grand Ronde Restoration Act (25 \n     U.S.C. 713 et seq.), the Federal Government--\n       (1) declared that the Confederated Tribes of the Grand \n     Ronde Community of Oregon were eligible for all Federal \n     services and benefits provided to federally recognized \n     tribes;\n       (2) established a tribal reservation; and\n       (3) granted the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde \n     Community of Oregon self-government for the betterment of \n     tribal members, including the ability to set tribal rolls;\n       Whereas the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde \n     Community of Oregon have embraced Federal recognition and \n     self-sufficiency statutes and are actively working to better \n     the lives of tribal members; and\n       Whereas economic self-sufficiency, which was the goal of \n     restoring Federal recognition for the Confederated Tribes of \n     the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon, is being realized \n     through many projects: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that November \n     22, 1983, should be memorialized as the date on which the \n     Federal Government restored Federal recognition to the \n     Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/17/senate-section/article/S12849-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12849-S12850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 247--CALLING ON THE PRESIDENT TO CONDEMN THE ANTI-\n  SEMITIC SENTIMENTS EXPRESSED BY DR.

Bush will be traveling to \n     Thailand to attend the October 20-21, 2003, meeting in \n     Bangkok of the leaders of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation \n     (APEC), which Dr. Mahathir will also be attending: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) thoroughly repudiates the damaging rhetoric of the \n     outgoing prime minister of Malaysia, Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, \n     which makes peace in the Middle East and around the world \n     more elusive; and\n       (2) calls upon President George W. Bush, on behalf of the \n     United States, to condemn Dr. Mahathir's injurious sentiments \n     when the President and the prime minister meet to attend the \n     October 20-21, 2003, meeting in Bangkok of the leaders of \n     Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).\n\n\n[[Page S12850]]\n\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator \nLautenberg, in the introducing an important resolution. This resolution \ncondemns the highly inflammatory and hate-ridden statements by the \nMalaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad at the opening of the \nOrganization of the Islamic Conference this Thursday.\n  Prime Minister Mohamad expressed the most despicable of views toward \npeople of the Jewish faith. The Malaysian Prime Minister did not \nconfine himself merely to vitriolic anti-Semitic remarks, however. He \nmoved to incite Muslims throughout the world to fight Jews. These \nremarks are not only hateful, but directly undermine the goals of \ntolerance and understanding that the U.S. hopes its allies will \npromote.\n  As you are aware, President Bush is currently in Asia and will attend \nthe Asia-Pacific Economic Conference in Thailand, October 20. This \nresolution urges the President to condemn the Prime Minister's remarks \nwhen the two meet next week.\n  I urge my respected colleagues to join us in supporting this \nimportant legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/17/senate-section/article/S12850-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1883.

Mr. President, I rise this evening to call the \nSenate's attention to a despicable expression of hatred that occurred \nin Malaysia yesterday. In his address to the opening of the 57-nation \nsummit of Islamic nations, Malaysia's Prime Minister, Dr. Mahathir \nMohamad, urged Muslims around the world to unite against the Jews who \nhe says rule the world by proxy.\n  Dr. Mahathir is a man known for his incendiary public condemnations \nof the United States, Israel, and the western world. Yesterday, his \nrhetoric escalated, or should I say degenerated, to a new level of \nhate. Using the foul canards Hitler and other anti-Semites have \nrepeated throughout history, he accused the Jewish people of gaining \ncontrol of the most powerful countries.\n  He said ``they, this tiny community, have become a world power,'' and \nhe urged the 1.3 billion Muslims throughout the world to fight this \n``enemy.'' That is his definition. How was the speech received? \nAccording to today's New York Times, it got a standing ovation from the \nkings and presidents, sheiks and emirs, including key U.S. allies, \ngathered in Malaysia's capital, Putrajaya. I believe these comments are \nlikely to encourage violence against Jewish people worldwide, and \nespecially in Israel.\n  The Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) charter calls for \ncreating a favorable atmosphere for the promotion of cooperation and \nunderstanding between member states and other countries. But how can it \nbe so, if the Prime Minister's remarks aptly capture the views of the \nOIC members? After all, they gave him a standing ovation. One has to \nwonder if they really want to promote peace between their nations and \nwestern democracies.\n  The Prime Minister of Malaysia, a country with one of the world's \nbiggest Muslim populations, essentially expressed an open invitation \nfor hate crimes and terrorism. Therefore, I am introducing a resolution \nthat puts the Senate on record as repudiating Dr. Mohamad's loathsome \nremarks to the OIC.\n  My resolution also asks President Bush, who will be traveling to \nSoutheast Asia next week, to repudiate Dr. Mohamad's vile sentiments \nwhen the two participate in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation \nmeeting in Bangkok, Thailand, on October 20.\n  I am pleased that Senator Smith, Senator Feinstein, Senator Clinton, \nSenator Corzine, Senator Boxer, Senator Daschle, Senator Dodd, Senator \nSchumer, Senator Hatch, Senator Murray, Senator Coleman, Senator Wyden, \nSenator Brownback, Senator Reid, Senator Leahy, Senator Graham of \nFlorida, Senator Bayh, and Senator Chambliss are all cosponsors of my \nresolution.\n  I believe the leaders of the Muslim world should be encouraging \nmutual tolerance and understanding between people of different faiths. \nInstead, Dr. Mohamad's anti-Semitic remarks will only serve to \nundermine the peace and security people of all faiths seek so \nearnestly.\n  I send a resolution to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration. This resolution has been cleared, as I understand it, on \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 247) calling on the President to \n     condemn the anti-Semitic sentiments expressed by Dr. Mahathir \n     Mohamad, the outgoing prime minister of Malaysia.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent the resolution and preamble \nbe agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 247) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 247\n\n       Whereas the outgoing prime minister of Malaysia, Dr. \n     Mahathir Mohamad, has become notorious over the years for his \n     virulent opposition to Israel;\n       Whereas Dr. Mahathir opened the 57-nation, October 2003 \n     summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference in \n     Malaysia by characterizing Israel and Jews around the world \n     as ``the enemy'' who ``rule the world by proxy'';\n       Whereas Dr. Mahathir's anti-Semitic remarks are despicable \n     and will serve to incite further sectarian violence; and\n       Whereas President George W. Bush will be traveling to \n     Thailand to attend the October 20-21, 2003, meeting in \n     Bangkok of the leaders of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation \n     (APEC), which Dr. Mahathir will also be attending: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) thoroughly repudiates the damaging rhetoric of the \n     outgoing prime minister of Malaysia, Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, \n     which makes peace in the Middle East and around the world \n     more elusive; and\n       (2) calls upon President George W. Bush, on behalf of the \n     United States, to condemn Dr. Mahathir's injurious sentiments \n     when the President and the prime minister meet to attend the \n     October 20-21, 2003, meeting in Bangkok of the leaders of \n     Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, the \nSenator from New Jersey, for introducing this resolution in such a \ntimely manner. I was proud to be an original cosponsor. I believe it is \nessential the Senate and our Congress be on record standing against \nhate and bias and discrimination, and particularly the kind of anti-\nSemitism that flowed at the meeting yesterday in Malaysia.\n  I join with Senator Lautenberg in urging the President to raise this \ndirectly with the Malaysian Government and with the other participants \nin the APEC meeting. I appreciate the quick action of Senator \nLautenberg in ensuring our Senate could go on record while this meeting \nis still occurring.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/17/senate-section/article/S12852-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12852-S12853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 1751\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 311, S. 300.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the title of the bill.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 300) to award a congressional gold medal to \n     Jackie Robinson (posthumously), in recognition of his many \n     contributions to the Nation, and to express the sense of the \n     Congress that there should be a national day in recognition \n     of Jackie Robinson.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to pay tribute to \nJackie Robinson--a great ballplayer, great leader and a great American.\n  Most Americans know of Jackie Robinson's baseball greatness. He was \nthe 1947 Rookie of the Year; the National League Most Valuable Player \nin 1949; he lead the Dodgers to six pennants and one World Series; he \nbatted over 300 for his career; and he was elected to the Hall of Fame \nin 1962.\n  But there is, of course, far more to the story of Jackie Robinson \nthan talent and success on the baseball diamond.\n\n[[Page S12854]]\n\n  Jackie Robinson was born in 1919 in Cairo, GA. He was the grandson of \na slave and son of a sharecropper. As a boy, he moved with his family \nto Pasadena, CA. Jackie was born a competitor and excelled at sports \nfrom a young age. His talents earned him a scholarship to UCLA, where \nhe lettered in football, basketball, baseball, and track--and he was \nheralded as one of the best-all-around athletes in the country.\n  After college, Robinson was drafted into the Army. He rose to the \nrank of second lieutenant, and along the way he fought for equality and \nagainst injustice. Robinson and his good friend, the boxer Joe Louis, \nopened an Officer Candidate School to black soldiers. When Robinson was \nordered to sit in the back of a bus at Fort Hood, TX, he refused and \nwas court-martialed. Robinson stood his ground at the court martial, \nand for his bravery he was exonerated when the order was ruled a \nviolation of Army regulations.\n  After the Army, Robinson signed to play for 2 years in the Negro \nBaseball League for the Kansas City Monarchs. Then in 1947, Robinson \nsigned with the Brooklyn Dodgers to become the first African-American \nto play in the major leagues. It's hard to imagine the personal courage \nthis demanded of Robinson. Branch Rickey, the president of the Dodgers, \nsaid that, ``Robinson was the target of racial epithets and flying \ncleats, of hate letters and death threats, of pitchers throwing at his \nhead and legs, and catchers spitting on his shoes.''\n  But for all the hatred and ignorance Robinson faced, he responded \nwith strength. Roger Kahn captured that strength in Boys of Summer when \nhe wrote that Robinson ``bore the burden of a pioneer and the weight \nmade him stronger. If one can be certain of anything in baseball, it is \nthat we shall not look upon his like again.''\n  Today, it is hard to understand the significance of Robinson signing \nin the majors. It happened before our military was desegregated, before \nthe civil rights marches in the South, and before the historic ruling \nin Brown v. the Board of Education. Robinson engaged America in a \nconstructive conversation about race even before other great leaders \nlike Martin Luther King. Indeed, King once said that his great crusade \nfor racial justice would not have been possible if not for Jackie \nRobinson.\n  Robinson's skill, demeanor and fortitude made him one of the most \npopular people in America, and he used his fame to encourage the fair \ntreatment of all people. His ideas and principles influenced John F. \nKennedy and Dwight Eisenhower. After retiring from professional \nbaseball in 1957, he dedicated himself to fighting for equality and \njustice. He was a leader with the NAACP, chairing its Freedom Fund \nDrive in 1957, and was awarded its highest achievement award. Jackie \nand his wife, Rachel, began annual concerts to benefit civil rights and \nvoter registration drives in the South. In 1964, Jackie helped create a \nminority-owned commercial bank based in Harlem, New York, called the \nFreedom National Bank. He also started the Jackie Robinson Construction \nCompany to build low-income housing.\n  On October 15, 1972, Jackie Robinson attended a World Series Game \nthat commemorated the 25th anniversary of the breaking of the color \nline in baseball. At the game, as he had done in the past, Jackie \ncalled for more opportunities for black Americans. Unfortunately, \nJackie passed away only 9 days--later and today--56 years after Jackie \nsigned with the Brooklyn Dodgers--we have yet to achieve the \nopportunity for all he so desired.\n  Jackie Robinson once said that, ``a life is not important, except in \nthe impact it has on other lives.'' Jackie Robinson not only impacted \nlives, he impacted the very spirit of our country. He was more than a \nsports hero--he was an American hero.\n  And it is time for Congress to recognize his heroic contributions to \nthe Nation by awarding him the Congressional Gold Medal. The \nCongressional Gold Medal is the highest expression of congressional \nappreciation and has been bestowed on great leaders like George \nWashington, Winston Churchill and Rosa Parks. I cannot think of a more \ndeserving person to join this distinguished group than Jackie Robinson.\n  As I close my remarks, I thank the Boston Red Sox and Larry Luchino \nand George Mitrovich for helping with this legislation. I also thank \nSenator McCain for joining as our lead cosponsor and Representative \nRichard Neal for passing this legislation through the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time \nand passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 300) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 300\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Jackie Roosevelt Robinson was born on January 31, 1919, \n     in Cairo, Georgia, and was the youngest of 5 children.\n       (2) Jackie Robinson attended the University of California \n     Los Angeles where he starred in football, basketball, \n     baseball, and track. His remarkable skills earned him a \n     reputation as the best athlete in America.\n       (3) In 1947, Jackie Robinson was signed by the Brooklyn \n     Dodgers and became the first black player to play in Major \n     League Baseball. His signing is considered one of the most \n     significant moments in the history of professional sports in \n     America. For his remarkable performance on the field in his \n     first season, he won the National League's Rookie of the Year \n     Award.\n       (4) In 1949, Jackie Robinson was voted the National \n     League's Most Valuable Player by the Baseball Writers \n     Association of America.\n       (5) In 1962, Jackie Robinson was elected to the Baseball \n     Hall of Fame.\n       (6) Although the achievements of Jackie Robinson began with \n     athletics, they widened to have a profound influence on civil \n     and human rights in America.\n       (7) The signing of Jackie Robinson as the first black \n     player in Major League Baseball occurred before the United \n     States military was desegregated by President Harry Truman, \n     before the civil rights marches took place in the South, and \n     before the Supreme Court issued its historic ruling in Brown \n     v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954).\n       (8) The American public came to regard Jackie Robinson as a \n     person of exceptional fortitude, integrity, and athletic \n     ability so rapidly that, by the end of 1947, he finished \n     ahead of President Harry Truman, General Dwight Eisenhower, \n     General Douglas MacArthur, and Bob Hope in a national poll \n     for the most popular person in America, finishing only behind \n     Bing Crosby.\n       (9) Jackie Robinson was named vice president of Chock Full \n     O' Nuts in 1957 and later co-founded the Freedom National \n     Bank of Harlem.\n       (10) Leading by example, Jackie Robinson influenced many of \n     the greatest political leaders in America.\n       (11) Jackie Robinson worked tirelessly with a number of \n     religious and civic organizations to better the lives of all \n     Americans.\n       (12) The life and principles of Jackie Robinson are the \n     basis of the Jackie Robinson Foundation, which keeps his \n     memory alive by providing children of low-income families \n     with leadership and educational opportunities.\n       (13) The legacy and personal achievements of Jackie \n     Robinson, as an athlete, a business leader, and a citizen, \n     have had a lasting and positive influence on the advancement \n     of civil rights in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The President is authorized \n     to present, on behalf of Congress, to the family of Jackie \n     Robinson, a gold medal of appropriate design in recognition \n     of the many contributions of Jackie Robinson to the Nation.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a \n     gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions, \n     to be determined by the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n       Under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the \n     Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the \n     gold medal struck under section 2 at a price sufficient to \n     cover the costs of the medals, including labor, materials, \n     dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses.\n\n     SEC. 4. STATUS AS NATIONAL MEDALS.\n\n       The medals struck under this Act are national medals for \n     purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be charged against the United States Mint Public \n     Enterprise Fund an amount not to exceed $30,000 to pay for \n     the cost of the medal authorized under section 2.\n       (b) Proceeds of Sale.--Amounts received from the sale of \n     duplicate bronze medals under section 3 shall be deposited in \n     the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.\n\n     SEC. 6. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n\n[[Page S12855]]\n\n       (1) there should be designated a national day for the \n     purpose of recognizing the accomplishments of Jackie \n     Robinson; and\n       (2) the President should issue a proclamation calling on \n     the people of the United States to observe the day with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/17/senate-section/article/S12855-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

For the information of all Senators, as I mentioned \nearlier today, it had been my hope that we could work out an agreement \nto consider the healthy forest issue during Monday's session. Chairman \nCochran has been working diligently toward an agreement to consider \namendments on both sides of the aisle on that legislation. \nUnfortunately, there is an objection to proceeding to the measure from \nthe other side. We will continue our discussions on that important \nlegislation. I hope we may still reach a consent for its consideration \nas soon as possible.\n  On Monday, under the previous order, we will resume debate on the \nmotion to proceed to the class action bill. Again, this is a critically \nimportant bill that we hope to consider and complete next week, but \nthere is an objection from the Democratic side. We do have a number of \nSenators who are very interested in this bill and will be here on \nMonday prepared to speak on its behalf.\n  Under the earlier consent, we will proceed to a vote on a judicial \nnomination at 5:15 p.m. and that will be the first vote of Monday's \nsession.\n  Again, I do want to thank all Members for their tremendous efforts \nover the course of this week. It took many busy days, and many long \nhours, well into the night, but we did accomplish what we set out to \ndo, and that was to complete the Iraq supplemental.\n\n  Today, we had 11 rollcall votes culminating with a vote on passage, \n87 to 12, a strong bipartisan vote. I, once again, thank Chairman \nStevens for his tireless efforts in helping shepherd this bill through \nthe Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/17/senate-section/article/S12855-6", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRATULATING SENATOR SUNUNU\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

A year ago this month, Congress cast a fateful vote. The \nmajority decided to give the President blanket authority to declare war \nagainst Iraq. On several occasions during our deliberations over that \nresolution, I had the good fortune to be on the Senate floor when the \ngreat Senator from West Virginia, the senior Senator, spoke. Both \nSenators from West Virginia are truly outstanding Senators and men. One \nis extraordinary in his seniority in this body and also the wisdom he \nhas acquired through his experience and service and his search for the \nhistory of this country and the history of other countries throughout \nthe world and across the spans of time.\n  It was my great opportunity, sitting in that chair where the \nPresiding Officer now sits, to be instructed about this country, \nespecially the Constitution which all of us take our oath of office to \nuphold, that extraordinary document which has shown, over the span of \nmore than two centuries, a foresight, a vision, an understanding of\n\n[[Page S12856]]\n\nhuman nature and an appreciation for the potential we bring and the \npitfalls we must avoid. It has been unprecedented in the history of the \nworld and has produced, along with the quality of our citizenry, the \nmost successful form of self-governance that has ever been devised or \npracticed on this planet.\n  As a result of much of what I learned from Senator Byrd, I voted \nagainst the resolution which passed the Senate last October. I did that \nbecause those tutorials convinced me that by acting at that point, \nbefore the President himself had decided whether to recommend or \nundertake an invasion of Iraq, the commencing of a war against another \ncountry, for Congress then to pass not a declaration of war, which the \nConstitution prescribes, but rather a resolution authorizing, with its \nusual euphemism, something like ``whatever force necessary in order to \naccomplish the objectives,'' Congress was abdicating to the President \nthat constitutional responsibility which it had no right or authority \nto pass on.\n  The Constitution says clearly that the Congress shall declare war, \nthat Congress and only Congress shall make that final decision whether \nor not to declare war and to commit this country to that course of \naction against another nation, at which point the President is the \nCommander in Chief and undertakes the prosecution of the war. It is \nexactly that balance of power the Constitution wanted to achieve.\n  I also said last October that I was not persuaded at that time by the \nintelligence and other information that I received to that point that \nSaddam Hussein's estimated military arsenal constituted an imminent and \nurgent threat to the national security of the United States of America. \nI may not have been privy to every piece of information that a few of \nthe more senior colleagues in this body had at the time, particularly \nmembers of the Senate's Select Committee on Intelligence, but as a \nmember myself of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I did have much \nof the information acquired from participating in a score of briefings, \nmany of them classified top secret.\n  In my best judgment, from all the intelligence that was presented to \nme over a 5-year period of time, the case against Iraq was inconclusive \nand unconvincing. Furthermore, it was presented to us by our top \nintelligence officials as incomplete and inconclusive. Those officials, \nin my judgment and my experience, were very candid about the \ninformation they were providing us. They were candid about its \nuncertainty. They were candid about its reliability. They were candid \nabout the difficulty to obtain reliable, accurate, and timely \ninformation in a country as closed as Iraq, where the penalty for any \ntransgression could be torture and death.\n\n  It was reasonable to assume back then that Saddam Hussein possessed \nbiological and chemical weapons of mass destruction, or materials with \nwhich to make them, using the supplies that presumably were not less \nthan what were known to exist when the United Nations weapons \ninspectors were evicted in December of 1998. But our intelligence \nofficials, in the meetings and briefings which I attended, never \nasserted more than that, nor did they assert a 100-percent certainty \nthat those amounts of products still did remain in Iraq, nor did they \never state that Iraq was known to be close to developing nuclear \nweapons. They said they didn't know.\n  My own experience over the last year is that the discrepancies \nbetween our intelligence information and what we now know with 20/20 \nhindsight are far less, than the differences which on several occasions \nI witnessed between what the intelligence briefers were telling us and \nwhat the high level administration officials, especially the President \nand the Vice President, were telling us and were telling the American \npeople and the people of the world.\n  Every time that occurred, administration officials portrayed the \nthreat from Iraq's likely weapons of mass destruction as more certain, \nmore urgent, and more dangerous than it turned out to be. The most \nglaring gaps, therefore, between fears and fiction and facts occurred \nwhen the intelligence information exaggerated the threat, and then the \nBush administration exaggerated that threat.\n  When 138,000 or more U.S. troops and a reported 1,400 weapons of mass \ndestruction hunters and investigators in the course of 6 months can \nfind nothing, virtually none of the primary reasons we went to war in \nthat country, that is about as glaring a gap as it gets. But blaming \nthe intelligence gatherers missed the real culprits. The information \nusers are the ones who should be investigated, not the providers. That \nis the investigation which should be conducted. That is the \ninvestigation which the White House is doing everything possible to \nprevent.\n  The investigation the administration cares about wants the answers, \nat least the answers that they want there to be, concerning the search \nfor Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. That appeared to be their No. 1 \npriority, their No. 2 priority, and perhaps their whole top 10. Several \nof my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee and the \nchairman and ranking members of the Senate Intelligence Committee and I \ntraveled to Iraq in July and saw firsthand and were briefed about the \npriority operations beginning or underway there. The one that was far \nahead of the rest in development, in deployment, and in resources \ncommitted to it was the search for Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.\n  Again, it has been reported publicly that some 1,400 professional \nintelligence gatherers, processors, and prosecutors have been scouring \nthat country, investigating, incarcerating, interrogating. During that \ntime, and the time we were there, many of the other important efforts \nwere barely underway and were badly behind already--like finding and \neliminating Saddam Hussein himself; like restoring basic services, \nelectricity and running water; like connecting, communicating, and \ncooperating with the Iraqi citizenry. Those delays, and the lack of \ntangible progress made in those areas and others, have been costly.\n  The price is paid, tragically, by our own service men and women--\nthose patriotic, courageous, and extraordinary Americans who won the \nmilitary victory in Iraq just 3 weeks from the first day of the \ninvasion to the triumphant takeover of Baghdad, the toppling of Saddam \nHussein himself, and the statue coming down, symbolically, as the \nregime was overthrown. As other colleagues have noted here tonight, \nthat was a great boon to the Iraqi people and to the world.\n  At the same time, American forces and British forces--primarily the \ncoalition, being essentially those two nations--took over occupancy of \nmost of Hussein's former presidential palaces. When I was there, the \nestimate was there were 120 of them throughout the country--the most \nincredible waste of resources one could imagine contrasted to the \nsqualor in which most Iraqis were living their lives.\n  At that time also, American forces had accomplished dispersal of \nSaddam Hussein's army, of his political party, top government \nofficials, and the henchmen who spread that tyranny, and even Saddam \nHussein himself. American Armed Forces won. The mission was \naccomplished. Their objectives had been achieved. The job had been \nexceptionally well done. All of that training, all of that traveling \nand preparing, and all their upbringing, bravery, devotion to their \ncountry, their service, faith, and hard work, all came together \neffectively and successfully and they achieved what they needed to do, \noverwhelmingly.\n  That should have been the end, or very close to it. Their victory was \ndecisive, their victory was complete, and they should have been going \nhome. Most of them should be home today. Most of them were expected to \nbe home today. One hundred and thirty-eight thousand American troops \nremain in Iraq today--more duration than what was planned for at this \nstage in the operation. Instead, for the present time and for the \nforeseeable future, 138,000, or close to that number, will have to \nremain in Iraq. Many of them are Minnesotans. Others have had their \ntours of duty extended 6 months.\n  Most of my colleagues and I went home to our respective States and \nvisited with families and spouses who are getting desperate about the \nabsence of their husbands, their wives, their sons, and their daughters \nwith extensions of duty, not knowing when the end point will be. Many \nof them still do not have a definite return date.\n  It is a terrible way for the military and the administration to be \nmistreating those who are making these\n\n[[Page S12857]]\n\nheroic sacrifices on behalf of their country, and who are doing so at \ngreat personal risk. Often during the course of their responsibilities, \nthey are exposed to the rest of their surroundings, standing at \nstation, and are targets as they guard public and private property and \nother locations and highways throughout that country.\n  Since the takeover of the country militarily by U.S. forces, they \nhave had to become more stationary. The point which should have been \nthe end, or close to it, but which is really barely the beginning, \nAmerican soldiers every single day are being attacked, wounded, maimed, \nand murdered. It has occurred while they are waiting for the rest of \nthese other operations to get started and start getting the necessary \nresults. Every day that those other operations aren't accomplishing \nwhat they must, aren't getting the resources they need, aren't being \ngiven the priorities they should be given, for every one of those \nadditional days American troops must remain in Iraq, American troops \nare likely to die in Iraq.\n\n  It is our responsibility to get the rest of that job done--to get \ntheir government elected and in charge of the country, restore domestic \nlaw and order, train the Iraqi police force so they can maintain that, \nget the society functioning--once again, a lot of which has been \naccomplished. And much has been accomplished. It is important to \nacknowledge that. Hospitals have reopened. They now need to be supplied \nwith the tools and be rehabilitated. An economy that is producing \nagain--producing jobs, producing wealth, producing resources--can bring \nIraq back into the civilized world.\n  A genuine international sharing must be achieved. The ongoing costs \nof responsibilities and risks are still going to be required during \nthis transition until Iraq can take care of itself.\n  For those things to occur with other nations of the world, the United \nStates must offer to provide a genuine sharing of control of postwar \nIraq. It means the Bush administration doesn't make all of the \ndecisions. It means their corporate cronies don't get all of the \ncontracts and the profits. It means their colleagues in the majority \ncaucus in the Senate should not get the only military transport escort \nto tour that country to assess the situation and to support our troops.\n  In fact, I would respectfully urge the President and the Vice \nPresident especially to use the passage of this important supplemental \ntoday by both the House and the Senate to mark the beginning of a new \nchapter in undertaking to restore our conduct before the world, the \ndignity, the civility, and integrity which our great Nation deserves \nand upon which it has built its reputation and its leadership position \nin the world.\n  I urge especially the Vice President to stop attacking the United \nNations which was founded over half a century ago by American leaders \nof both political parties. It has been nurtured, guided, supported, and \nstrengthened during that time as the best hope of the human race, to \nkeep all nations of the world striving together for the peaceful \nresolution of our differences and the prevention of the next world war, \nwhich most believe will be the last world war. Through that diplomatic \neffort, working through the differences and the difficulties and all \nthe barriers and obstacles that remain among the human race, it has \nsucceeded in preventing that kind of holocaust for the last half \ncentury. It has prevented the scourge. It has been successful in \ndiscouraging other nations from launching preemptive military strikes \nagainst other countries and provoking additional conflict and \nconflagration that always threaten and risk escalation and \nannihilation.\n  Other nations of the world have been harangued and denounced for not \nagreeing with the decisions that were made by this Nation's \nGovernment. I urge a new spirit of genuine cooperation, partnership, \nrecognition of their legal and moral autonomy as they also decide \nwhether to commit their own resources, their own citizens, the lives of \ntheir young men and women to the undertakings which we believe are \nimportant but we have no right to compel other nations to adopt.\n\n  Whether we felt one way or the other, viewed the situation one way or \nthe other a year ago, the facts are, clearly, today we are committed to \na country with 138,000 of our men and women who are risking their lives \nand demonstrating courage and patriotism to sustain that operation. We \nowe it to them. We owe it to the world and to ourselves and to future \ngenerations to now complete this undertaking in the ways that bring out \nthe best of America, that showcase the best of America for the world. \nThat is where our ultimate national security is going to derive, from \ncontinued military preeminence, absolutely. That in and of itself is \nnot enough, as we learned on September 11. We need allies, friends, \neyes, ears, intelligence all over the world. We need to establish in \nthe eyes of nations that now misunderstand us and our way of life; we \nneed to showcase as we have been doing the last 2 years in Afghanistan \nand as we must do now over the next 2 years in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nwhat it is about our way of life, our economy, our technological know-\nhow, our compassion, our generosity, what it is about all Americans \nthat makes us a people who have so much to offer the rest of our fellow \ncitizens throughout this planet.\n  I urge the President and the Vice President and the administration to \ndemonstrate the best qualities of America. If they do so, I believe \nwhat comes out of this undertaking will be one that we will all be able \nto live with, better off than we were for many decades to come. \nConversely, a failure to do so will have catastrophic consequences for \ndecades to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/17/senate-section/article/S12857-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, OCTOBER 20, 2003, AT 1:30 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
