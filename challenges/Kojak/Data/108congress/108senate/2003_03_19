Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume \nconsideration of S. Con. Res. 23, the concurrent budget resolution, \nwith 30 hours left for debate on the resolution. Fifteen hours remain \nunder the control of the chairman of the Budget Committee and the \nranking member respectively. Pending is the Boxer amendment No. 272 \nstriking the reconciliation instruction to the Energy Committee \nrelating to ANWR. While Senators on both sides of the aisle \nparticipated in the debate last night, there are still several Senators \nwishing to speak on this amendment this morning.\n  The consideration of other amendments is expected during today's \nsession and rollcall votes will occur throughout the day. The Senate \nwill finish the budget resolution this week. Therefore, Members should \nexpect late nights and rollcall votes for the remainder of the week. I \ndo want to stress to my colleagues that we will finish the budget \nresolution this week. We have 30 hours for debate and then the voting \non the amendments, which is not a part of those hours. Therefore, we \nreally have a challenge over the next 3 days but one that we will step \nup to and meet.\n  There is a lot of indecision in terms of potential military action \nabroad. As we all know, the clock is ticking for a deadline tonight and \nwe will take that into consideration, but we will be focused on the \nbudget over the course of today. It is the Nation's business. The \nAmerican people expect us to pass a budget. We have certain statutory \ndeadlines that we will meet in this Congress and therefore will finish \nthe budget resolution this week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through the Chair to the leader, on the ANWR \namendment, we have 40 minutes remaining on this side. The time on the \nother side is gone. Of course, other time can be yielded, as it will \nbe, to speak on the amendment.\n  We have a couple of amendments lined up. I spoke to Senator Nickles \nlast night. The majority leader was present during most of those \nconversations. We hope to offer another amendment forthwith.\n  The one question that a number of Members have asked is what is the \nleader's--I think we all contemplate something happening in the next 24 \nhours in regard to the situation in Iraq. What is the leader's desire \nas to a resolution, which I am sure will be forthcoming at that time, \nas far as Members being able to speak on the resolution?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, not knowing what will happen tonight with \nthe President's statement, as the deadline is reached for Saddam \nHussein--and I have been working with the Democratic leader--we have a \nresolution of support and are working through the language that is most \nappropriate. We will do that over the course of today. Again, I want to \nbe very careful not to anticipate an outcome which is not quite there, \nbut if military action is begun, we would very soon introduce that \nresolution and give Senators the opportunity to speak. I think we all \nrecognize that if military action is undertaken, although we hope and \npray that things will be very shortlived, we do want to make sure \nSenators have the opportunity to express their support for our troops \nand for this President, if this engagement begins. So that is underway. \nWe will address that over the course of the day. I do want to make it \nclear to our colleagues that we will be here this week until we finish \nthe budget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/19/senate-section/article/S3913-5", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Do we not have 40 minutes on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-one minutes is controlled by the \nsponsor.\n  Mr. REID.

When I left the floor last evening, I yielded to my \ncolleague from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, and it was my understanding \nthe time would be charged against the bill. Instead, I understand it \nhas been charged against the amendment. I ask the manager of our bill \nto allocate to us an equal amount of time as remains for the Senator \nfrom California under the amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to my friend and \ncolleague from Alaska an hour on the bill so he may speak in opposition \nto the amendment of the Senator from California.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The Senator from California has the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to a real leader on \nthis issue, Senator Bingaman, the top Democrat on the Energy Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \nup to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the Senator from \nCalifornia yielding me some time to speak and briefly express the point \nof view that I expressed when we debated this bill last year.\n  As all of us know, this issue has been a perennial one. It comes back \nall the time in the Senate and has now for several decades. I rise to \nsupport the amendment of the Senator from California. The amendment \nwould strike the provisions from the budget resolution that essentially \npave the way for the opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to \noil and gas development.\n  There are various reasons, both related to national security and \nrelated to the environment, that lead me to conclude that I do not \nsupport going ahead with oil and gas leasing and development of the \nArctic Refuge. The most compelling reason for not opening the refuge is \nthat it will do very little, if anything, to further our national \nenergy security. Not a single drop of oil would come from the Arctic \nRefuge for at least 7 years and more likely 10 or 12 years.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the amendment for the \nfollowing reasons:\n  First, drilling in the Arctic Refuge is not an answer to the problem \nof energy security. This chart is familiar to any who were here during \nthe debate on the energy bill last year. The U.S. Geological Survey \nestimates the mean economically recoverable oil on Federal lands on the \nCostal Plain of the Refuge at somewhere between 3.2 and 5.2 billion \nbarrels and that is at prices of somewhere between $20 and $24 per \nbarrel, in 1996 dollars. Clearly, prices are higher today.\n  The Arctic Refuge would supply no more than 2 percent of America's \noil demand in any given year. This chart shows the U.S. oil consumption \nin million barrels per day. The top line is the total oil demand. \nBelow, the green line, is domestic oil production. The small red line \nis the ANWR production. Relative to our total consumption it is a small \nitem. It will be at least 7 years, more likely 10 to 12, before there \nis actual production on the Coastal Plain if we were to vote today to \nopen this area for production. Peak production would not occur for 20 \nyears or more after the initial production started.\n  Another chart shows the same point in a slightly different way, that \ndrilling in the Arctic Refuge does not address in a significant way our \nreliance on imported oil. This chart contains information from the \nEnergy Information Administration. The green line indicates the net \nimports with ANWR production and the blue line is net imports without \nproduction from ANWR. According to our own Energy Information \nAdministration, which is part of this administration, they show that \nproduction would begin in about 2012 and production from ANWR of oil, \nany significant oil, would end by about 2025. Then we are right back \nwhere we started.\n  So our dependence on foreign imports to meet our oil demand will \ncontinue to grow. It will not grow as much during those years when ANWR \nis in production, but it will grow a substantial amount. The Energy \nInformation Agency estimates that production from the Arctic Refuge \nwould reduce the net share of foreign oil relied on by consumers from \n62 percent to 60 percent by the year 2020. As this chart shows, by 2025 \nwe are right back to no reduction as a result of ANWR production \nbecause ANWR production will have largely played out by that time.\n  Another reason I offer to my colleagues today in support of the \namendment, is that a controversy over the Arctic Refuge diverts \nattention from the real opportunities we have for enhancing domestic \nenergy production. There are other ways we can expand production.\n  Senator Grassley, Senator Baucus, Senator Domenici, and I introduced \nthe Energy Tax Incentives Act the other day. Unlike the opening of the \nArctic Refuge, this legislation would provide near-term increases in \ndomestic energy production. Not only does the legislation include tax \nprovisions that would help us diversify our energy supply and increase \nour reliance on renewable sources of energy and enhance energy \nefficiency, it would also provide specific incentives for increased oil \nand gas production.\n  Some would ask, from where is this oil and gas production going to \ncome? I have another chart that makes a point people do not focus on. \nThis is a map of the North Slope of Alaska showing the ANWR area on the \nright, the 1002 area. It shows the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska, \nthe large tan-colored area on the map. The National Petroleum Reserve \nAlaska is an area that has begun to be leased by the Department of the \nInterior. Secretary Babbitt began that process when he was in office. \nSecretary Norton is proceeding with that. Frankly, I support going \nahead with drilling in that area. There is a substantial likelihood of \nvery large energy production from that area. There is a real prospect \nof increased oil and gas production from the North Slope.\n\n  Let me mention gas production. I indicated one of the reasons we \nshould not focus on ANWR is that it is diverting our attention from our \nother opportunities to deal with our energy needs. One of those great \nopportunities is to bring the gas production from the\n\n[[Page S3915]]\n\nNorth Slope of Alaska, gas that is already being produced and \nreinjected into the ground, bring that gas down to the Lower 48 States. \nWe tried very hard in the last Congress to pass legislation to \nstreamline the process for getting a pipeline constructed. I strongly \nsupport that. We need a pipeline to bring that natural gas to the Lower \n48. Anyone who is dependent upon natural gas for home heating today \nknows the price is high. They are going to notice it even more over the \nnext 2 or 3 months as they get the bills during this period of high \nnatural gas prices. The best opportunity we have to relieve that \npressure is building that pipeline to bring Arctic gas down to the \nLower 48. That is what we should concentrate on: develop more oil from \nthe National Petroleum Reserve Alaska, bring the gas already produced \non the North Slope down to the Lower 48. I hope we can do that.\n  I also make the point that we need to continue to emphasize \ndeveloping alternative sources of energy. That is something we will get \ninto in a large way when we debate a new energy bill this Congress, a \nnew proposed energy bill, and we can make the point again.\n  The solution to our long-term energy problems is not to open the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. It is an environmentally \nsensitive area, one we have determined to keep off bounds, out of \nbounds, for drilling up until now. I believe that is a sound policy.\n  In conclusion, there are many reasons why the Coastal Plain of the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge is not needed and should not be drilled \nfor oil and gas. The environmental sensitivity of the area is clearly \nwell recognized by all. Opening the Refuge is not good environmental \npolicy. Equally important, it is far from necessary as part of our \nnational energy policy.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in opposition to the oil and gas leasing \nand development of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and to support \nthis amendment by the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding Senator Boxer has yielded me 5 \nminutes.\n  I say to my colleagues who follow this debate, take a look at this \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge. If you look at the National Academy of \nSciences' recent report, it is clear that drilling for oil in this \nwildlife refuge in the far reaches of Alaska is environmentally \ndangerous. There are some who write that off and say if we get more oil \nout of it and create some jobs, so what. Frankly, that is \nirresponsible.\n  We have a responsibility in this generation to leave to the next \ngeneration the natural heritage that we were given. If we are not \nforced to go to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the survival of \nthe United States or its economy, for goodness' sake, why would we run \nthe risk to endanger this important National Wildlife Refuge that we \nhave protected for over 50 years?\n  Second, this is as shortsighted as it gets, to suggest the only way \nto deal with energy security in the United States is for us to start \ndrilling in wildlife refuges, that small part of the world we set aside \nto protect endangered species, topography, and environment that you \ncannot find anywhere else on Earth. Now the oil companies tell us: I'm \nsorry, our energy needs are so substantial, we have to start drilling \nthere?\n  I say to the young people in America: Following this debate, take a \nlook at the parking lots across America if you want to know what to do \nabout energy. Take a look at the inefficient vehicles we are driving on \nthe road today because this Congress and this country has not shown the \nleadership to have more efficient cars and trucks in America. We can do \nit. We have done it in the past. But this bill, this issue, is \nconsistent with what I am afraid is the wrong message to America.\n  The message in this bill is: We may be minutes away from a war where \nthousands of American lives are at risk, we may be faced with terrible \nnews for families across America and death in Iraq to innocent Iraqis, \nbut we can still call for a tax cut for the wealthiest people in \nAmerica. The message in this amendment is: We may face the question and \nchallenge of energy security, but rather than to say to American \nfamilies, Do your part, buy vehicles that are more efficient, and to \nDetroit, produce those vehicles--instead of that, no, we are going to \ndrill for oil in a wildlife refuge in Alaska. Is that what America has \ncome to? Is that what we are all about? Don't we expect our leaders to \nsummon us to show our best, to sacrifice for our Nation so we can lead \nand demonstrate to future generations that we care about our natural \nheritage, we care about our spirit of national sacrifice?\n  This is an amendment that should be defeated. The Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge should not be drilled. We should not move forward with \nthis exploration. And this bill calling for tax breaks for the \nwealthiest people in America as we are poised to go to war is a \nshameful bill. It is something we should not be considering on the \nfloor of the Senate at this moment in our history. This amendment, if I \nunderstand it correctly, will not change the budget levels. This \namendment failed by only 1 vote, on a party-line vote, in committee. \nBut I believe we will win it now.\n\n  Let me begin by saying that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \nprovision has no place in the budget. For those who want to propose oil \nand gas development in this area of the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge, we can debate that in a more appropriate context, such as the \nenergy bill. This important issue should not be snuck into the budget \nthrough a legislative back door, but should be debated in an open, \nhonest way through the normal legislative process.\n  Let me also note that the full Senate has already defeated proposals \nto drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, because it is bad \npolicy. We should end this perennial debate once and for all, and move \nto more reasonable matters that deserve the Senate's attention. There \nare better, longer-term solutions to our energy crisis than drilling in \nour few remaining frontier areas, including making automobiles more \nfuel efficient.\n  The Refuge is not the answer to energy problems. The most stunning \nstatistic in this whole debate is that the Arctic coastal plain would \nonly yield 6 months' worth of oil for our country; and we wouldn't get \nit for 10 years. And this is under the most optimistic assumptions.\n  There is no doubt that we are over-dependent on foreign oil in our \ncountry. We need to address this issue on multiple fronts, including by \nexploring alternative sources of energy, such as fuel cells, and by \npromoting efficiency and thereby reducing consumption. I have talked \nwith coal developers who say that we may be able to use coal to isolate \nhydrogen for use in fuel cells in automobiles. I have also talked with \nautomobiles researchers, who have told me of myriad existing \ntechnologies to improve fuel efficiency in the transportation sector, \nthe largest user of oil.\n  So to say that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the only answer \nto our energy questions in completely off-base. In fact, it is not even \none of the viable answers, because it holds so little oil compared to \nwhat we demand as a country.\n  The Refuge deserves protection. The 1.5 million-acre coastal plain of \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a clear candidate for protection \nunder the Wilderness Act of 1964. That is why I am cosponsoring Senator \nLieberman's bill to designate this 1.5 million acre area as wilderness. \nThis swath of land is surrounded on three sides by 8 million acres of \nland already designated as wilderness.\n  The Arctic Refuge includes boreal forests, dramatic peaks, and \ntundra. If features a complete range of arctic and subarctic \necosystems, with an extraordinary assemblage of wildlife. Polar and \ngrizzly bears, wolves, muskoxen, and snow geese are just a few of the \nmore than 200 animal species that use the coastal plain. Also the \ncoastal plain is the most significant on-land polar bear denning \nhabitat in the U.S. In addition, the 155,000 member porcupine caribou \nherd has used the coastal plain as a calving area for 20,000 years or \nmore. There is no alternative to this sensitive habitat for the caribou \nherd.\n  Research has documented the ecological importance of this land, and \nthe effects of oil and gas development there. On March 5, 2003, the \nNational Academy of Sciences released a new report that details the \nserious, detrimental, and cumulative effects of oil\n\n[[Page S3916]]\n\nand gas activities on Alaska's North Slope. The report finds numerous \neffects, including ``a large oil spill in marine waters [which border \nthe coastal plain] would likely have substantial accumulating effects \non whales and other receptors because [current cleanup efforts are \ninadequate].'' This is especially significant, given that there is an \naverage of 423 oil spills annually on the North Slope.\n  The report also finds that species population decline, including \nreduction of some bird species such as black brant, snow geese, eiders \nand probably some shorebirds, is common in industrial areas in the \nNorth Slope.\n  In an important new discovery, the report finds ``climate changes \nduring the past several decades on the North Slope have been unusually \nrapid.'' Climate changes can change ice flow and the entire ecosystem \nof this area.\n  The report further finds that only about 100 acres--1 percent--of the \nhabitat affected by gravel fill on the North Slope have been restored. \nThe National Academy of Sciences concluded that unless major changes \noccur, it is unlikely that most disturbed habitat on the North Slope \nwill ever be restored. Because natural recovery in the arctic is slow, \neffects of unrestored structures are likely to persist for centuries, \nand will accumulate as new structures are added.\n  Environmental impacts of oil and gas development are real, and that \nis why we need to site such activities in a careful, responsible \nmanner.\n  In conclusion, Aldo Leopold, the long-time Forest Service employee \nand conservationist said it best in 1949: ``Having to squeeze the last \ndrop of utility out of the land has the same desperate finality as \nhaving to chop up the furniture to keep warm.''\n  The Arctic Refuge is one of the last, remaining wilderness areas \nawaiting protection. Let's not destroy it; let's save it. And let's end \nthis perennial debate once and for all. There are better, longer-term \nsolutions to our energy crisis than drilling in our few remaining \nfrontier areas, including making automobiles more fuel-efficient. And \nif we want to debate energy policy, the budget resolution debate is not \nthe time to do it.\n  Out of respect for the proper legislative process, and out of respect \nfor the seriousness of this decision in terms of energy and environment \nissues, and in terms of the impacts on the present and future \ngenerations of this country, I urge my colleagues to vote for the Boxer \namendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield his remaining time for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wonder if the Senator had seen this chart which shows \nby the year 2030 how much energy is yielded by these various factors. \nThis would be how much energy we would get from the Arctic Refuge \nproduction, 2.38 billion barrels of oil. If we just put better tires on \nour cars, it would result in better fuel economy, we would save more \nenergy.\n  If we just closed the SUV loophole, meaning we got those SUVs up to \nthe same mileage as cars, we would save 10 billion barrels. And, by the \nway, if we did fuel economy, as my friend suggested, up to 35 miles per \ngallon, which is very modest, look at what it would save: 18 billion \nbarrels. Here is what the Arctic gets us, and we destroy a region that \nlooks like this, instead of going this way.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I know my time is running out. I just want to say, when \nyou turn to the conservatives in Congress and say: Can't we improve the \nefficiency of our vehicles? No, that's the heavy hand of Government.\n  Let me tell you, drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is \nthe heavy hand of Government in a part of our world we should be \nprotecting. It is saying to oil companies, make a profit so we don't \nhave to ask American families and automobile manufacturers to do the \nright thing for our future.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am going to take 1 extra minute off the \nbill, if I might, to simply send to the desk a letter from Jimmy \nCarter, former President Jimmy Carter. Last night it was implied by \nseveral colleagues--I have their words actually--I will not go through \nthem now--that President Carter supports drilling in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge. Just to quote from a little bit of his \nletter, he says:\n\n       We can have the untouched sublime wilderness. Or we can \n     have oil field development. But we cannot have both.\n       Opening the coastal plain for oil exploration and \n     development would be, despite all the much-vaunted \n     technological promises, severely damaging to wildlife and the \n     ecosystem. And it is inherently fatal to the wilderness \n     qualities of this matchless example of America's natural \n     heritage.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            The Carter Center,\n\n                                   Atlanta, GA, February 27, 2002.\n     The Honorable Senator,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: Every decade or so we seem to have a great \n     national debate about whether or not to preserve the very \n     best of our natural heritage. In the 1960s it was over \n     building dams in the Grand Canyon, a desecration comparable \n     to oil drilling in Yosemite or Yellowstone.\n       Now, an equally significant showdown is over the fate of \n     the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, an \n     area first set aside for protection by President Dwight \n     Eisenhower.\n       Rosalynn and I have crouched on a peninsula in the Beaufort \n     Sea to watch the defensive circling of musk oxen that \n     perceived us as a threat to their young. We have sat in \n     profound wonder on the tundra near the Jago River as 80,000 \n     caribou streamed around and past us in their timeless \n     migration from vital calving grounds on the coastal plain. We \n     have watched dens of wolves, large flocks of Dall Sheep, and \n     isolated polar bears. These phenomena of the untrammeled \n     earth are what lead wildlife experts to characterize the \n     coastal plain as America's Serengeti.\n       Having raveled extensively in this unique wilderness, I \n     feel very strongly about its incredible natural values. I \n     hope you will not be distracted by the argument that oil \n     exploration and development will have minimal impact because \n     the ``footprint'' of modern drilling technology will be small \n     amid the 1,500,000 acres of the coastal plain.\n       This simply is not true. While a precise measurement of the \n     exact acres finally to be covered by drill pads, gravel pits, \n     access roads, air fields and the vast spider-web of pipelines \n     might not exceed 2,000 acres, these acres would be spread \n     across a far wider expanse, covering hundreds of square \n     miles, connected by a network of modern transportation \n     routes. The impacts on the fragile tundra ecosystem, on \n     migratory waterfowl and on other wildlife would be much \n     greater than the claims of the oil drillers.\n       The point I want to stress to you is that, as with the \n     proposed dams in the Grand Canyon years ago, we face on the \n     Arctic coastal plain a choice about fundamentals. We can have \n     the untouched, sublime wilderness. Or we can have oil field \n     development.\n       But we cannot have both.\n       Opening of the coastal plain for oil exploration and \n     development would be, despite all the much-vaunted \n     technological promises, severely damaging to wildlife and the \n     ecosystem. And it is inherently fatal to the wilderness \n     qualities of this matchless example of America's natural \n     heritage.\n       Through compromises that began more than four decades ago \n     and were concluded when I signed the Alaska National Interest \n     Lands Conservation Act in 1980, 95% of Alaska's North Slope \n     has already been made available for oil exploration or \n     development. We should not sacrifice the last 5%--the area \n     scientists call the ``biological heart of the Arctic \n     Refuge''--for a speculative short-term fix of oil a decade \n     from now.\n       As with previous great environmental debates, this issue \n     has assumed gigantic symbolic stature, as some have elevated \n     it as the alleged ``solution'' to everything from higher gas \n     prices to terrorist threats.\n       The truth is we could drill every national park, wildlife \n     refuge, and coastline and still be importing more than half \n     our oil, remaining just as vulnerable to the price \n     fluctuations of the global oil market. By contrast, raising \n     the fuel economy of our cars and trucks would save far more \n     of then we import from the Persian Gulf, reduce greenhouse \n     gas emissions, and save billions for American consumers. To \n     put this in perspective, had the United States continued to \n     conserve oil at the same rate we did from 1976 to 1985, we \n     could have weaned ourselves from Middle East oil fifteen \n     years ago.\n       I urge you to pass a cleaner and safer energy plan that \n     enhances our security without undermining our nations' great \n     wilderness heritage. Please vote against cloture on any \n     amendment that would authorize oil drilling in any part of \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge coastal plain.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jimmy Carter.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I now yield 5 minutes to Senator Patty Murray who has \nalso been a tremendous voice for the environment here in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I rise this morning to support the amendment of my \ncolleague from California, Senator Boxer, that will stop this backdoor \nattempt to\n\n[[Page S3917]]\n\ndrill for oil and gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  I spoke several days ago here on the floor of the Senate at great \nlength about what this budget proposal would do, the budget resolution \nthat is before the Senate, and how reckless it is. It ignores the cost \nof war, it ignores the cost of the aftermath in Iraq, and it underfunds \ncritical priorities here at home such as homeland security, education, \nand transportation.\n  But I am appalled that there is something else buried in this massive \nbudget that needs to be removed. The budget now before the Senate \nactually assumes increased spending that will result from opening ANWR \nup to exploration and drilling, even though the Senate clearly rejected \nthat last year. Exploration and drilling in ANWR is a controversial \nissue, and it should be fully debated. But the appropriate place for \nthat debate is on the energy bill which the Senate will consider in the \ncoming months.\n  Last year, this Senate soundly rejected efforts to open ANWR to \nexploration and to drilling. This year, proponents of drilling are \nusing a backdoor approach to try to get support for ANWR in this budget \nreconciliation. The amendment that has been offered by my colleague \nfrom California will strike that language and leave the ANWR debate \nwhere it belongs, as part of the upcoming debate on an energy bill.\n  The budget reconciliation process was enacted actually to help us \nreduce our deficit. That is even more important now that our country is \nback in red ink. Instead of supporting a process that helps reduce our \ndeficit, proponents of drilling are using it to pass something the \nSenate rejected last year.\n\n  The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is an important and unique \nnational treasure. It is the only conservation system in North America \nthat protects a complete spectrum of arctic ecosystems. It is the most \nbiologically productive part of the Arctic Refuge. Energy exploration \nin ANWR would have a significant impact on this unique ecosystem.\n  I have heard the proponents of this measure argue over the years that \nenergy exploration has become what they call more environmentally \nfriendly. That may be true. But there are significant environmental \nimpacts for this sensitive region. The oil reserves in ANWR, in fact \nthe oil reserves in the entire United States, are not enough to \nsignificantly reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  There are ways to reduce our need for foreign oil. My colleague, the \nSenator from Illinois, spoke about that a moment ago. We can increase \nthe fuel economy of our automobiles and lightweight trucks. We can \nreduce our need for foreign oil by expanding the use of domestically \nproduced renewable and alternative fuels. We can invest in emerging \ntechnologies such as fuel cells and solar electric cars, and we can \nincrease the energy efficiency of our office buildings and homes. Those \nkinds of strategies will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and \nprotect one of our Nation's most precious resources. That is what we \nshould be focusing on.\n  I think we should also remember the amount of oil in ANWR is too \nsmall to significantly improve our current energy problems. The oil \nexploration in ANWR will not actually start producing oil for as many \nas 10 years.\n  Exploring and drilling for oil and gas in ANWR is not forward \nthinking. It is a 19th century solution to a 21st century problem. The \nSenate should soundly reject this backdoor attempt to use the budget \nprocess to embrace drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge when \nso many in the Senate oppose it. We should debate drilling in ANWR when \nthe Senate energy bill comes up, but we should not make a decision on \ndrilling in this budget resolution.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this very important amendment by the \nSenator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield her remaining time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield my remaining time to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, I appreciate her raising the issue of \nthe safety here because in the Prudhoe Bay oil field and the Trans-\nAlaska we have seen an average 423 spills annually on the North Slope \nsince 1996, and that is according to the Alaska Department of \nEnvironmental Conservation. Over 1.7 million gallons of 40 different \nsubstances, from acid to waste oil, have been spilled during routine \noperations from 1996 to 2002. There were 2,958 spills, commonly diesel, \ncrude oil, and hydraulic oil.\n  My friend is right. Maybe years ago they would have been worse \nspills, but the fact is there are terrible spills now.\n  I see that my colleague's time is up. I thank the Senator for \nparticipating.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Stabenow from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for up \nto 5 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, as I begin, I know I share the \nfeelings of all my colleagues, as we are debating this budget \nresolution and this important amendment, that our thoughts and prayers \ngo to the men and women who are overseas, our troops who are being \nplaced in harm's way. Regardless of our feelings about the policies \nthat have brought us to this point, we all stand united in supporting \nour troops. It makes these kinds of debates even more important.\n  I am very proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment. I commend the \nSenator from California for her steadfast leadership on this issue, \nalong with a number of colleagues of mine who have consistently stood \nfirm about protecting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  I have been pleased to be a cosponsor of legislation to stop drilling \nsince first coming to the House in 1997. I also am proud to be the \nauthor of the ban that we placed on drilling in the Great Lakes, \nanother national treasure. I view this area in Alaska as much of an \nirreplaceable and fragile natural and national treasure as the Great \nLakes. I am very hopeful that today we will, one more time, stop this \nparticular drilling policy from moving forward.\n  I would like to, once again, speak about some of the same points my \ncolleagues have spoken of because I believe we have to keep repeating \nthem to make it clear what the facts are.\n  First of all, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is, in fact, one of \nthe wildest and most pristine places in the United States. We have an \nobligation to protect this area for the future, for those who are \ncounting on us to be able to look beyond the immediate time period and \nlook to the future for our country and for our children.\n  I believe we also have an obligation to stop back-door approaches to \nthis issue. We are seeing, one more time, the drilling in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge being placed in a bill where it should not be. \nThis is a budget bill. We are focusing on the budget priorities for the \nnext year.\n  Frankly, we should be debating how much the war is going to cost, and \nmaking sure our folks on the front line, and our first responders at \nhome, police and firefighters and emergency workers, have what they \nneed as we enter this very challenging time. Those are the kinds of \nthings we should be debating, not seeing a back-door approach to \ndrilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge.\n  Most importantly, we know that drilling in the wildlife refuge will \nnot result in energy independence. This is talked about all of the \ntime, but it needs to be repeated, that only 2 percent--if we were to \ndrill, we are talking about 2 percent of America's oil demand every \nyear; and it would take at least 10 years to begin to see this brought \non to the market.\n  We are talking about 2 percent rather than focusing on other areas of \nenergy policy that will net alternatives in terms of conservation: \nalternative vehicles, alternative fuels, all of those kinds of things \nwe know will allow us to become energy independent sooner and more \neffectively for the long run.\n  It is impossible for the United States to drill its way to energy \nsecurity and independence. What we need to have is a debate about the \nenergy policy of the country and how we are going to move forward. And \nthat needs to be done in the energy bill, not in the middle of the \nbudget resolution.\n  I am concerned when I hear this particular debate tied to Iraq, the \nserious debate about war and the oil in Iraq. It is important to say \nthat gas prices are determined by global supply and demand factors, as \nwe all know, not by opening one area to drilling.\n\n[[Page S3918]]\n\n  In addition, Iraq supplies a very small percentage of our U.S. energy \nneeds. According to the EIA, only 1.5 percent of the Nation's energy \nsupply comes from Iraq. Imports from Iraq were banned in 1990 in the \nwake of the Persian Gulf war, and we obtained no oil from 1991 to \n1995--all with no impact on the greatest economic expansion in U.S. \nhistory. The fact is, Canada and Mexico together supply more oil to the \nU.S. than the entire Persian Gulf.\n  So I encourage my colleagues to join with us in support of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Who yields \ntime?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I, on this issue, yield as much time to \nmyself as I shall need. I ask unanimous consent to do that, and that \nthe time come off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I don't know exactly where to begin on this \nparticular subject. But I would like for the American taxpayers to \nunderstand one thing: We maintain a strategic oil reserve. It is 700 \nmillion barrels of oil that is stored in salt caves in Louisiana. It \ncosts us $175 million a year to maintain the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. I just want the taxpayers to know what they are paying for.\n  The fact is, part of that oil was purchased by this Government and \nput in there, but most of it was taken from royalties. They took the \noil instead of the money. And that was recovered on the Outer \nContinental Shelf or from public lands. So it is there: 700 million \nbarrels of oil that costs the taxpayers $180 million a year to \nmaintain.\n  I suggest that we have a Strategic Petroleum Reserve that is not \ncosting the American people a thing. It is still in the ground in North \nDakota, found on public lands, where we cannot get to it. It is found \nin Montana, on public lands, where we cannot get to it. That is because \nof organizations that deal primarily in fear, not common sense.\n  Abraham Lincoln once said: God must have loved the common man because \nhe made so many of us. Then, when we use the same term in the phrase \n``common sense,'' that sort of changes the definition a little bit.\n  That Strategic Petroleum Reserve is also maintained, and it is still \nin the ground in ANWR. We do not know how big that reserve is. It has \nbeen estimated to be anywhere from 5.3 billion barrels upwards. Does it \nanswer the question of our shortage? Does it take care of all of that? \nNo, it does not. We know that. But, on the other hand, it replaces all \nthe oil we buy that is termed ``rogue'' oil--Iraqi oil that we give \nhard dollars for and that you contribute to every time you fill your \ntank at a filling station.\n  What is that money used for? We have seen it on television every \nnight for the past month and a half. We know what that money is being \nused for. We give it to a tyrant who uses that money to subsidize \nfamilies, to entice them to take one of their children and strap \ndynamite on them and walk onto a bus and blow themselves up, and for \nthe development of weapons of mass destruction, chemical and biological \nwarfare. That is what that money has done.\n  And yet we sit here today trying again to ban the use of a resource \nthat is not only one of the major underpinnings to our economy, but \nalso takes away from that $180 million a year we spend to maintain that \nSPR in case of an emergency. That is 90 days. It wouldn't even last 90 \ndays. We would just go through it, bingo. It defies common sense, what \nwe are doing here.\n\n  As far as my State of Montana is concerned, I don't know what the \nimpact is. I know during the major exploration and lifting of Prudhoe \nBay and the North Slope when it opened up, probably 1,500 families in \nMontana worked on the North Slope. It provided a lot of jobs. I am not \nsaying that their figure here on the creation of jobs is what some \nwould claim, but it isn't zero, I will guarantee you that. It is going \nto put a lot of people to work. Maybe jobs only are important to us if \nthey are just in our home state. Maybe it is the welfare of the people \nif it is just in our State. But the impact it has on Alaska is \nterrific, on the people who live there, work there, raise their \nfamilies there, provide services there.\n  If you wanted to put it to a vote in Alaska, this debate wouldn't \neven be taking place. The Native Alaskans; ask them, take a vote among \nthem, if we really believe in this 50 percent plus 1. It is their \nincome. This is just about all they have.\n  What you see of the pictures over there is a result of a 30-day \ngrowing season. Any other time I would look with great interest at a \nphotograph that was being displayed last night of the caribou that was \nout in the water. They had water clear up over their back going into \nthe sea up there. Do you know why they are standing in that water, \nfolks? It is not to cool off. Because they have mosquitos up there that \nare big enough to turn over your dog tags and check your blood type. \nThat is what they are getting away from. It is a hostile environment.\n  What are we doing here with the new technology: I mentioned a while \nago the jobs of the families who are affected in my State. Those kinds \nof jobs have moved on. New technology has taken over. We drill \ndifferently now. We do it all differently with horizontal drilling \npractices, with one little area impacted. You may see the wells. It \nwouldn't be the size of the Chamber of the Senate. It may have a dozen \nwells. That is the way we do it now. Technology has moved on.\n  I was interested in the words of my good friend, the Senator from \nMichigan, and the Senator from California. And by the way, California \nconsumes 12 percent of all of the transportation fuels produced in this \ncountry. Yet we cannot drill on the Outer Continental Shelf of \nCalifornia. There is a moratorium on that. There is a moratorium on \nFlorida. They are quick to talk about the Gulf of Mexico and off the \ncoast of Louisiana and Alabama. We can't drill off the east coast, yet \nCanada does. When you get north of the border, they drill all the way \noffshore almost to Iceland. If you want to go east of the United States \nand the Canadian line and the northern territories off Alaska, you have \ngas and oil production all across Canada. The largest exporter of \nenergy to this country is Canada, both in crude and in gas.\n  Yet the United States is being denied our own resource in our own \ncountry to supply the heat and the transportation fuels for our own \npeople and our own security. And groups would manipulate information on \nANWR to deny the American people when common sense tells you it is just \nthe other way. Those of us who live near and some of us on public lands \nunderstand what the thinking is.\n  I will tell you this, as we talk about this total resolution. If you \nwant to see something happen, this President has offered a way to \nstimulate the economy and to have it going when those young men and \nyoung women come home from the gulf and they go back into the \nworkforce. Do you want them to come back into a sluggish economy? Is \nthat what we want to do here? Do we want to take a sluggish economy and \npound it down further and have no opportunities for them outside of \nmilitary life, those reservists and also those who serve in the \nNational Guard?\n\n  We are finding out the cost of 50 percent of our force structure and \nmilitary is at home now and not found on military bases, full-time \nsoldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen. This is a part of that growth \npackage. This is a part of a package that shows immediate return to the \nAmerican taxpayer and also gives us that security, our own home \nsecurity, if it is ever needed. What is wrong with finding out how much \noil we really have? We can't even explore, let alone lift. And we are \ndoing it based on thinking and facts that do not heed common sense. It \nis groups, little tiny groups that propagate misinformation and do it \non an emotional ``green, fuzzy'' resolution. That you would deny people \na livelihood, deny them food, deny them the basic needs of education \nand health care in the State of Alaska based on misinformation, that \ncan't make one feel very good.\n  So if we are looking for job creation, if we are looking for energy \nsecurity, if we want to do away with this little ticket of $175 million \na year just to maintain oil in salt caves, then when you get the bottom \nline, the answer is\n\n[[Page S3919]]\n\npretty clear--let alone the promise that this Congress made to the \nState of Alaska whenever they passed the land bill there and also \ncreated the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge.\n  By the way, we are breaking that word, too. That rests on the backs \nof Congress. So I ask for those who live there, the Natives who were \nraised there, with their traditions--I will tell you, I don't know if \nyou have ever seen the caribou come across there. The area is not short \nof wildlife--not from the impact of Prudhoe and North Slope. All the \nbenefits that have gone to Alaska and to America as a result of that \ntremendous resource--those tremendous reserves, in a part of the world \nthat is fragile, yes; all land is fragile, but it is a land we can take \ncare of and still use the resources it provides.\n  I ask my colleagues to use some common sense. Go through the same \nfigures I have. If you get a different number, you let me know, because \nI am just a country boy; I count bushels and heads of livestock. But \nwhen you get to the bottom line, it is a plus for America, a plus for \nour security, a plus for jobs, and it is also a plus for the great \nState of Alaska.\n  Our technology has not gotten us to the point where we can safely and \neconomically do in our transportation fuels, using fuel cells and \nbiomass, anything you want to do. That technology is not there yet, \nfolks. If you want to cut off the oil today, you will see how fast this \neconomy would crumble. But you cannot talk economy, you cannot talk \nnumbers, because this is an emotional debate. It is wrong. It is wrong \nto do it to the State of Alaska, and it is wrong to do it to America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the Senator from North Dakota \nyield such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to do so.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are doing our best, in accordance with \nthe direction we have gotten from the majority leader, to move this \nbill along. We are trying. I spoke to the manager of the bill this \nmorning, and we are trying to do that. We want to offer other \namendments. We have a couple of minutes left to speak on ANWR. We want \nto offer other amendments. We were ready to vote on ANWR last night, or \nthis morning, or early this afternoon--anytime. We need to move this \nlegislation along, and we are doing the very best we can, but we have \namendments we have to offer.\n  I hope we have the opportunity to do that. The time is quickly \ndwindling, and we are doing our best not to have many votes on the \nvote-athon; but with each day that goes by, it appears there will have \nto be more because people are not having the opportunity to offer \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time for the \ncomments I am about to make.\n  The decision whether or not to allow drilling in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge is a defining moment for national energy and \nenvironmental policy.\n  This debate reflects two divergent views of our Nation's values and \nfuture.\n  We have a choice: Either we can continue building oil wells in \nenvironmentally sensitive areas or we can reject the quick fix and \nbroaden our Nation's energy base while honoring our commitment to our \nnatural heritage.\n  It has become apparent that America depends too heavily on some very \nundependable foreign sources of oil.\n  Hostilities in Iraq are just the latest chapter in decades of \ninstability in the Persian Gulf.\n  Meanwhile, production of oil in Venezuela has been brought to a near \nstandstill because of domestic unrest.\n  For the sake of our economy, for the sake of national security, and \nfor the sake of our environment, America must reduce its reliance on \nforeign oil.\n  But instead of diversifying energy supply, investing in new \ntechnologies and promoting efficiency, the Bush administration's \npriority is to look for the next big domestic oil field.\n  Last year, the Senate rejected the Republicans' effort to authorize \ndrilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in comprehensive energy \nlegislation. Now they are back attempting to use the budget resolution \nto grease a change they couldn't make in the energy bill.\n  No matter how clever they view this parliamentary sleight of hand, \nthe proponents of drilling in the Arctic Refuge cannot escape the \nfacts.\n  While endangering one of the most pristine areas in the world, \ndrilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would do nothing to \nmake our country more energy independent.\n  We cannot sit silently by while the administration promotes a short-\nsighted strategy that mortgages one of our most precious and \nirreplaceable wild spaces for a few months' supply of oil.\n  Gasoline prices are soaring today. Yet this proposal would add \nnothing to our oil supply for 10 years.\n  Even then, the Arctic Refuge would supply our country with no more \nthan 6 months' worth of oil and would reduce our dependence on foreign \noil by just 2 percent.\n  This is not a serious attempt to come to grips with America's long-\nterm energy needs. America cannot drill its way out of this problem.\n  Ninety-five percent of Alaska's North Slope is already open to \ndrilling and exploration. Even if we drilled in the last 5 percent, \neven if we drilled in the backyards of every American, we could not \nsatisfy our Nation's appetite for oil.\n  America produces just 3 percent of the world's oil; yet we consume 25 \npercent of that supply.\n  The answer to our energy challenge will not be found in the Arctic \nRefuge.\n  The answer will be found in our willingness to encourage American \ninnovation and break the habit of spiraling energy consumption. We have \nmet this test in the past.\n  In the 1970s, Congress increased fuel efficiency standards and began \nto encourage the development of renewable fuels.\n  Today, those fuel efficiency standards save our country the cost of 3 \nmillion barrels of oil every day.\n  That, and a wide range of clean, domestic, renewable energy \ntechnologies would dwarf any contribution the Arctic Refuge could make \nin the future.\n  Meanwhile, if drilling in the Arctic Refuge is authorized, our lack \nof vision would come at enormous cost.\n  According to the administration's own Fish and Wildlife Service, \n``The Arctic refuge is among the most complete, pristine, and \nundisturbed ecosystems on Earth . . . a combination of habitats, \nclimate and geography unmatched by any other northern conservation \narea.''\n  There is no alternative to Arctic National Wildlife Refuge once it is \ndespoiled. But there is an alternative to this reckless proposal:\n  A true national energy strategy that speaks to our core environmental \nvalues while at the same time frees our country from the dictates and \nuncertain fortunes of foreign oil producers.\n  Now more than ever, we should be aware of the real cost of dependence \non foreign oil.\n  Now more than ever, we need real answers and serious stewardship to \nthe energy challenges of our Nation's future.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to vote to strike the \nauthorization to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \nfrom the budget resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of Senator Conrad, I yield 10 minutes to the \nSenator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada for \nyielding the time to me to talk about the Boxer amendment and talk \nabout the decision we could be making very shortly about the use of oil \nfrom the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  Mr. President, what happens is, as these debates get going, sometimes \nwe hear statements that are somewhat misconstrued or mistaken. We just \nheard it suggested on the floor that funds from the purchase of Iraq \noil are used to purchase bombs. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth. The fact is, that money is passed through the United Nations to \nbuy food to be distributed to the people of Iraq. There is no way that \nmoney can be used to buy\n\n[[Page S3920]]\n\nbombs. It is important we keep the record straight.\n\n  I want so much to see the Boxer amendment prevail, but in order to \nmake the case, apparently, we have to do more than simply justify the \nfact that if we did not do this, we could find other ways to conserve \noil and not have to invade this snow desert, if one has ever seen it. \nIt is one of the most beautiful places in the world, and the last thing \nwe ought to do is turn the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge into an \noilfield.\n  I traveled to Alaska in the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez spill in \n1989. At the time, I was chairman of the Transportation Appropriations \nSubcommittee, so I had jurisdiction over Coast Guard funding. I was \nalso a senior member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. So \nI had a great deal of interest in the Valdez incident.\n  What I saw was shocking, stunning almost. Over 11 million gallons of \noil spilled into the Prince William Sound. I witnessed beautiful \nwildlife covered in oil, many dead or dying. I saw workers from the \nDepartment of the Interior, the fire service, and others hand wiping \noil off birds and other wildlife. It was a devastating tragedy.\n  The disaster left a major impression on me. I thought about my \nchildren, my grandchildren, other people's children, and other people's \ngrandchildren. I never wanted to see the dismay on their faces should \nthey ever witness this tragedy.\n  To this day, 14 years later, the area remains contaminated with a \npersistence that has surprised many scientists. Sadly, the optimistic \npredictions of its recovery proved to be unjustified. Fully 60 percent \nof the area remains contaminated. Pools of toxic oil are still being \nfound several feet deep.\n  Ecosystems, such as those in Prince William Sound and the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge, are so fragile, they are such delicate \ntreasures of our Nation.\n  I had the privilege of visiting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \nat the same time, and I can tell you, from personal experience, that in \naddition to the damage caused by drilling and oilspills, the debris of \nhuman intrusion, acres of rusting pipes and dilapidated structures \ndishonors America's 100-year-old tradition of protecting remote wild \nplaces.\n  On that visit, I flew in a single-engine plane across to a community \ncalled Deadhorse. It is right near Prudhoe Bay. It was troubling to see \nthat area, the tundra littered by refuse left by the same oil companies \nthat now avow they will be good environmental stewards should the \nArctic Refuge be open to drilling.\n  Why would we risk devastating these national treasures? For what \ngain?\n  There is a dispute as to whether it is a 6-month oil supply or more \nthat we will see from the Arctic Refuge, but for this short-term gain, \nwhat is the long-term risk, the cost?\n  I believe the long-term damage is too great. Turning this refuge into \nan oilfield will result in the loss of a national treasure we will \nnever be able to replace. Look at what is happening on the North Slope. \nThe National Research Council's new report shows that oil drilling on \nthe North Slope has drastically reduced the population of nesting \nbirds, such as the snow geese, and seismic exploration has displaced \nthe culturally sacred bowhead whales from their migratory path, \naccording to the National Research Council.\n\n  Additional drilling will only compound the stresses on these and the \n200 other animal and bird species that inhabit the region.\n  What would the payoff be for recklessly endangering this national \ntreasure? We would save more oil than we could drill at the Arctic \nRefuge at the height of production by requiring SUVs to meet the same \nfuel economy standards as regular cars. We never hear talk about \nconservation. We never hear talk about everybody pitching in on the eve \nof a war to economize and use less fuel whenever we can do so.\n  There is simply no good reason to endanger this fragile Coastal Plain \necosystem.\n  More than oil is at stake here. Thoreau wrote:\n\n       In wilderness is the preservation of the world.\n\n  America and the world need the last remaining wilderness places. The \nArctic wilderness is one of those places. It would be unconscionable to \ndespoil it for all time just for a bit of oil. We can find other ways.\n  I came across an article that tells us about the risk, a risk we are \nnot discussing in pure terms. This is an Internet news report from a \nservice called Ananova. The headline is: ``ExxonMobile damages for \nValdez spill cut to $4 billion from 5; to appeal.'' It is going to be \nappealed further by the ExxonMobile company. They already paid some \ndamages to the Alaskans, some money for cleanup, and some money to the \nState and Federal governments. But they have yet to pay a dime for \npunitive damages. This is 1989. We are not talking about recent months \nor even recent years. Fourteen years ago last month that tragedy took \nplace, and they have not paid, and they do not want to pay. They are \ngoing back to court to say, Reduce our damages, even though the court \nthe first time assessed them a $9 billion punitive damage claim. They \nare working their way down, and maybe they will get it down to nothing \none of these days. We ought to stop it right now where it is and not \npermit this to continue. They just want to get their mitts on the money \nthat comes from that oil drilling, and it is without regard for the \nconsequences.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article by Ananova \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From Ananova, December 8, 2002]\n\nExxonMobil Damages for Valdez Spill Cut to $4 Billion From 5; To Appeal\n\n       A US federal court in the state of Alaska has reduced \n     punitive damages awarded in the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill \n     to $4 billion from 5 billion, ExxonMobil Corp said in a \n     statement late on Friday.\n       The company, which had been hoping for a far greater \n     reduction in damages, said it plans to appeal against the \n     ruling, saying it is excessive and ``entirely inconsistent \n     with the law.''\n       ExxonMobil wanted the damages cut to no more than $40 \n     million, a sum which would be ``only slightly less than the \n     largest punitive damages award ever approved by any federal \n     appellate court anywhere.''\n       A US appeals court last year sent the case back to the \n     Anchorage District Court with orders to reduce the award to \n     an amount consistent with constitutional limits.\n       Company officials said ExxonMobil took immediate \n     responsibility for the spill, cleaned it up, and voluntarily \n     compensated those who claimed direct damages.\n       It also paid $300 million immediately and voluntarily to \n     more than 11,000 Alaskans and businesses affected by the \n     spill, 2.2 billion for the cleanup of Prince William Sound, \n     and another 1 billion to state and federal governments.\n\n                   [From Environment, April 20, 1995]\n\n                   Judge Voids Portion of Exxon Fine\n\n       An Alaska state judge, Brian Shortell, ruled that Exxon \n     Corp., did not have to pay $9.7 million in punitive damages \n     to five Alaska native corporations, it was reported March 31. \n     The damages originally had been awarded in recompense for \n     land damage caused by the March 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. \n     The ruling had no effect on the $5 billion in punitive \n     damages that Exxon had been ordered to pay to 14,000 Alaskan \n     natives, fishermen and property owners.

The \n     court sent the case back to the trial court for assessment of \n     a new fine.\n       One Alaska Native leader in Cordova, the town that is the \n     center of the Prince William Sound commercial fishing \n     industry, described a groundswell of anger at the ruling.\n       ``I wouldn't want to be anyone from an oil company in this \n     town today, I'll tell you that,'' said Bob Henrichs, a Native \n     leader in Cordova.\n       Anyone associated with Exxon is particularly unwelcome, he \n     said. ``They hired a drunk who couldn't get a license to \n     drive a car and turned him loose with an oil tanker,'' he \n     said.\n\n[[Page S3921]]\n\n       About 40,000 fishermen, Natives, property owners and others \n     affected by the spill sued Exxon over the disaster. Most of \n     the cases were consolidated and heard at the 1994 trial. Many \n     plaintiffs were counting on payments from the punitive \n     verdict to help heal various problems, including a \n     deteriorating fishing economy.\n       Now the appeals court ruling has dashed those hopes, said \n     Riki Ott, a Cordova fisherman, marine biologist and \n     environmental activist.\n       The ruling means that Exxon Mobil may emerge unpunished for \n     the spill, which continues to harm the area's environment and \n     people, Ott said.\n       ``They just go on, business as usual, and try to shove all \n     of us under the carpet by relying on the court system, which \n     favors big corporations,'' she said. ``Exxon has continued to \n     profit off this, and we're all slowly going broke.''\n\n\n                           Shock and Surprise\n\n       Sue Aspelund, executive director of Cordova District \n     Fishermen United, said she reacted to the news with ``shock \n     and surprise.''\n       The fishermen's group on Wednesday was still trying to \n     figure out what to do next, she said. Henrichs, president of \n     a 500-member tribal organization based in Cordova, said his \n     faith in the court system was shaken by the ruling.\n       I'd like those judges who made that decision to come up \n     here and confront our people, look us in the eye,'' he said.\n       One of the lead attorneys for the spill plaintiffs said he \n     believes the punitive award can be resurrected.\n       Attorney Brian O'Neill said arguments over the punitive \n     fine will be made again within months before U.S. District \n     Court Judge H. Russel Holland, who presided over the 1994 \n     trial.\n       ``And we'll go back and get the $5 billion. Because I think \n     the process was fair, I think the award was fair,'' said \n     O'Neill, who presented most of the plaintiffs' case at the \n     trial.\n       ``The thing that I'm sad about and embarrassed about is \n     that it's taken us so long to get here,'' he said. ``It's \n     going to take another year or two longer, but we'll get \n     there.''\n       Meanwhile, Henrichs' organization, the Native Village of \n     Eyak, and other Native groups are pushing for stricter \n     regulation of the trans-Alaska pipeline. The 30-year leases \n     that allow the pipeline to operate on state and federal land \n     are up for renewal in 2004.\n       Ott is working on a campaign--including a possible new \n     lawsuit against ExxonMobil--to address chronic illnesses that \n     spill cleanup workers said they suffered as a result of \n     working without proper protections.\n       The 11 million gallon (50 million liter) spill, the worst \n     tanker disaster in U.S. waters, polluted more than 1,200 \n     miles of shoreline and was the deadliest ever to wildlife.\n       It killed thousands of marine mammals and hundreds of \n     thousands of seabirds, forced the shutdown of fish harvests \n     and, government scientists say, caused lingering damage to \n     fish, bird and mammal populations.\n       The U.S. District Court jury found that reckless behavior \n     by Exxon and tanker captain Joseph Hazelwood had led to the \n     spill. That verdict paved the way for the punitive fine.\n       Also during the trial, the jury ordered Exxon to pay $287 \n     million in compensation to commercial fishermen, and the \n     company settled some of the Native compensatory claims before \n     the trials's end.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we will wrap up this debate in a very \nshort while. We have to look at the full picture. It is not simply \ngetting oil here or taking advantage of an opportunity to go into the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge to search for more opportunities to \nconsume oil at a rate that has never been heard of. We have to step \nback and take a look into the future as to what we want for our \nchildren and their children.\n  I hope the Boxer amendment will get the support it deserves. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from New \nHampshire desire?\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I had not calculated it. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield to the Senator from New Hampshire as much time \nas he desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. \nAs a new Member of the Senate, I bring to this body, as do many of my \ncolleagues, experience having served in what we like to refer to as the \n``other body,'' the House of Representatives. Prior to that service, I \nworked in what we sometimes refer to as the ``real world'' in \nmanufacturing, having been trained as a mechanical engineer.\n  Engineers often try to develop solutions to problems by arguing from \nfirst principles, and that means simply that you work from the most \nbasic understanding of a problem you wish to address. Once you come to \nterms with the central element of that problem, you are far better able \nto craft a meaningful and effective solution.\n  What the astute listener might ask is: What does this have to do with \nthe Federal budget? And to that I reply, if you really want to put \ntogether an effective budget and a meaningful budget that will serve us \nwell, we need to remind ourselves exactly what this budget resolution \nis for.\n  As we listen to much of the budget debate, one might understand or \ncome to assume that the budget resolution establishes funding levels \nfor every conceivable Federal program, every line item in the budget; \nthat it rewrote the Tax Code; that it modernized Medicare, all in and \nof itself without even having the benefit of the President's signature. \nOf course, this is not the case, even though the rhetoric we hear might \nsuggest otherwise.\n  So what is the budget resolution? It is simply a blueprint. It is a \nvision the Congress puts forward of where we imagine our budget \npriorities should be this year and in future years. We try to set \npriorities for taxes and for spending, try to estimate what we are \ngoing to collect into the Federal coffers, and try to set priorities \nfor modernizing programs like Medicare or Social Security. Above all, \nit reflects a set of priorities.\n  For example, listening to the debate this morning, one might get the \nimpression it actually authorizes oil exploration in northern Alaska. \nThat is simply not the case. What the budget resolution as written \nwould do is allow the Senate Energy Committee to write legislation that \nwould then be debated on the Senate floor. It would still have to pass \nthe Senate to allow exploration or production in northern Alaska to \ntake place. The budget simply provides the mechanism allowing that \nlegislation to be written and then later brought to the floor.\n  Our goal in this debate should be to reflect the right set of \npriorities in our country. To be sure, this is a $2 trillion budget we \nare talking about. If I or any of my colleagues were writing a $2 \ntrillion budget, I am sure someone somewhere would find something in \nthat $2 trillion budget they might disagree with, and I understand \nthat. Any Member of the Senate, any citizen of our country, can find \nsomething in our Federal budget they are not comfortable with, that \nthey do not like, that they would disagree with, a program they would \nchange. But if we want to do the work of the American people in the \nSenate, we need to put together that budget blueprint. We need to set \nthose priorities, and I would hope those priorities would be \nconsistent.\n  As we listen to the debate over the next few days, unfortunately we \nwill hear a lot that is not consistent. We will hear individuals talk \nabout their concern for the Federal deficit, and then they will step \nforward and vote for an amendment that raises domestic spending and \nincreases the deficit. We will hear individuals raise concerns about \nthe cost of military action at this historic time. But after raising \nconcerns about those costs, those individuals will then step forward \nand vote for amendments that raise domestic spending.\n  We will hear Members raise concerns about economic growth, and then \ninstead of stepping forward to propose or support a package that lays \nthe foundation for future economic growth, what will they do? They will \nstep forward and they will vote to raise domestic spending. There is a \npattern, to be sure.\n  We are in challenging and difficult times, and we have work in front \nof us that will require us to make difficult choices and to set the \nright priorities for our country.\n  Why do we need this budget in the first place? We need this budget, \nas I suggested before, to enable us to get our work done. I talked \nabout the budget allowing the Energy Committee to come forward with \nlegislation crafting a comprehensive energy policy that might include \nexploration in northern Alaska. The budget will also set an overall \nlimit on discretionary spending. This year, I think the goal put \nforward in the budget resolution is approximately $784 billion. But we \nneed to set that goal, that cap, that target, so the other spending \ncommittees, the\n\n[[Page S3922]]\n\nAppropriations Committee in particular, can then move the spending \nbills forward.\n\n  This is not insignificant. Last year, we failed to pass a budget in \nthe Senate and we paid for it. We paid for it because as a result we \ncould not get the work of the country done. We ended up completing that \nwork, not in September, October, November, or December of last year, \nbut in January of this year. That is simply wrong. That is why we need \na budget. The budget lays the foundation for critical legislation, and \nnot just a comprehensive energy bill. If we want to modernize Medicare, \npass a prescription drug benefit for retirees in this country, we are \ngoing to need a budget resolution. If we want to pass an economic \ngrowth package that helps lay the foundation for job creation in \nAmerica, we are going to need a budget resolution.\n  The Senate may well appear chaotic under any circumstances, but \nwithout a budget we are even more so. I do think it is important to \nnote the minority in this case has not offered any comprehensive \nalternative to the budget. We will hear debate and criticism of the \npending resolution that is before this body, but no comprehensive \nalternative. This is similar to last year when the minority, then in \nthe majority, failed to offer and pass a comprehensive budget. As a \nresult, not only were we completing last year's business this past \nJanuary, but we were unable to pass a prescription drug benefit under \nMedicare and other work before the Senate was delayed. The budget \nresolution is critical to being able to get our work done in Congress.\n  What is in the budget resolution that is before us? What are the \npriorities we have laid out that have been put together by the hard \nwork of the chairman of the Budget Committee and the members of the \nBudget Committee? Given the challenge of these times, I think it is a \nvery strong package. The overall spending level, $784 billion, \nrepresents a growth in discretionary spending of a little bit less than \n4.5 percent.\n  There is a basic principle at work, and that is we should not be \nexpanding the size and scope of the Federal Government. We should not \nbe increasing domestic spending any faster than an average family \nbudget is increasing.\n  On the defense side, we all know the challenges we face, the \npriorities we need to set in defense spending. Defense spending has \nincreased approximately 3.8 percent. Homeland security, where we need \nto make investments in new technology and new ways of identifying \nthreats to this country, has been increased over 25 percent in order to \nhelp first responders--police and firefighters--around the country.\n  As with defense and homeland security, we have to set priorities \nthroughout the budget. If the Federal spending level is increasing by 4 \nor 4.5 percent, not every program can receive a 10 or 20 percent \nincrease. Priorities need to be set.\n  On veterans health care, we step forward to provide an increase of $1 \nbillion in this budget; on education, a 4.5 percent increase, including \n$1 billion for special education, which is an enormous unfunded Federal \nmandate on cities and towns around the country. In science, space, and \ntechnology research, the budget provides for an additional 5.5 percent \nover last year. Setting priorities in important areas; that is what \nputting together a good budget is all about.\n  This budget will allow us to modernize Medicare, to add a \nprescription drug benefit to Medicare, something that is essential if \nwe are going to deliver on our commitment to a modernized health care \nsystem for our retirees.\n  As we have heard and will continue to hear over the next couple of \ndays, this budget allows for an economic growth package to help get our \neconomy moving, to help create incentives to entrepreneurs and risk \ntakers across the country to create new economic opportunity and to \ncreate new jobs.\n  I think it is the right set of priorities. I think it makes sense to \nput together a package that focuses on economic growth. I think it is \nthe right thing to do to make sure we are not expanding the size and \nscope of the Federal Government any faster than the average family \nmight be expanding its budget.\n  To be sure, we will hear people argue about the level of spending and \nwe will have amendments to increase Federal spending in a number of \nareas. The fact of the matter is, we would hear those arguments and \nhave that debate no matter what the spending level in this budget \nresolution was. If it was at $794 billion, we would have similar \namendments to increase Federal spending. If it was at $800 billion, \n$810 billion, or $820 billion, we would have the same amendments to \nexpand the size and scope of the Federal Government, because some \nlegislators find it more difficult than others to set priorities and to \ncontrol the size and scope of that spending. Now more than ever we need \nto set priorities.\n  We have heard and will continue to hear a lot of discussion in this \nbudget debate about the deficit. It needs to be addressed. We cannot \nignore it. In order to do the right thing regarding the deficit, we \nhave to understand why it is there. Why do we have a deficit?\n  I just talked about spending growth. Growth in spending, expansion of \nthe size and scope of the Federal Government, that alone is responsible \nfor 25 percent of the deficit we have projected for the coming fiscal \nyear and over the coming 10 years.\n  We had surpluses after a long period of expansion that began in the \nearly 1980s, with a sharp brief interruption in 1991. Revenues \nincreased year after year. We had record revenue growth because we had \nstrong economic growth. That enabled us to balance the budget. Coupled \nwith control of growth in spending, we were able to balance the budget. \nSome say the surpluses then just provided incentives to ramp up the \nspending level again. As we have seen over the last 5 or 6 years, the \ngrowth in discretionary spending has been at near historic levels.\n  At the same time, we had unprecedented defense and homeland security \nneeds that had to be dealt with in the wake of September 11. With the \nrecent economic downturn, we have seen unemployment costs increase once \nagain. So new spending has been responsible for about 25 percent of the \ndeficit. An even larger portion, almost half of the deficit, has been \ncaused by the slowdown in the economy and the drop in revenues. This is \nunfortunate, but we all understand we are in slow economic times.\n  The result has not been created by tax cuts. Despite the rhetoric, \nthe Tax Relief Act signed into law in 2001 was responsible for less \nthan 25 percent of the deficit we will see in the coming year. It was \nthe slowdown in the economy, cutting Federal revenues by over $150 \nbillion over the last year, that resulted in 50 percent of the deficit \nwe see today. That is why it is important we include in this resolution \nan allowance for an economic growth package. The economy has slowed \ndown.\n  We need to understand why it slowed down. It is not because of \ninflation. It has not been because of a slowdown in consumer spending. \nAmerican consumer spending has been surprisingly robust over the last \n18 months. It has not been a credit squeeze like we had in 1991. This \neconomic slowdown has been driven by and led by a slowdown in business \ninvestment. Businesses are reluctant to go out and spend additional \ncapital on improvements to plants and equipment, on improvements of \nproductivity and expansion of their facilities. We know of the slowdown \nin technology investment. That has led this slowdown in the economy.\n  If we want to do something about it--and I think we all care about \nthe economic growth in this country--if we want to do something, we \nhave to address the reason for the slowdown, to address the sharp \ndownturn in business investment. That is what the economic package of \nthe President has put forward and what this budget resolution attempts \nto do.\n  We have other options. We could do nothing. At the end of the day, if \nyou watch the votes carefully, you will see that there are a number of \nMembers of this body who would just as soon do nothing. They do not \nsupport an economic growth package. They will argue they do not want to \nincrease the deficit. That means do nothing, do not spend any \nadditional money, do not put together an economic growth package. I do \nnot think with the economy as slow as it is, the American people want \nus to say we are going to do nothing to try to get job creation back on \ntrack.\n  We could spend more money and there will be a series of amendments to\n\n[[Page S3923]]\n\nthis budget resolution to do just that. Some will be offered by those \nwho decry the short-term deficit, or the deficit that we have had over \nthe last year. But they will offer amendments to spend more money and \nultimately increase the deficit. The idea that we could spend ourselves \nout of a recession is ridiculous. It is absurd on its face.\n  We have extended unemployment insurance. That was the right thing to \ndo and it is an important thing to do. But in and of itself, spending \nmore on unemployment insurance will not rekindle economic growth. We \nneed to recognize that in order to create incentives for entrepreneurs \nand risk takers to spur job creation, we need to look at the Tax Code. \nThat is where the growth package comes forward.\n\n  Is it a big package? Relatively speaking, not at all. It represents \nless than 2.5 percent of our Nation's revenue collections over the next \n10 years. But it is focused on making the Tax Code more fair: by \ngetting rid of the double taxation on dividends; by giving small \nbusinesses incentives to invest in plants, equipment and the modest \nincreases I spoke of; and by tripling the amount small businesses could \nexpense over time. It tries to deal with the economic slowdown by \nrecognizing the first principles of why the economy has slowed down in \nthe first place.\n  This budget sets forward a realistic, reasonable and common-sense \nlimit on Federal spending. It sets priorities even within those areas \nfor veterans health care, special education, science and technology, \nhomeland security, and our national defense. It allows us to modernize \nMedicare and add an important prescription drug benefit. It also sets \nforward principles for an economic growth package we all know is needed \nin America.\n  It is a strong resolution. With all due respect to the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, it is probably not a perfect resolution. I served \nfor 6 years on the Budget Committee in the House, and I am the first to \nadmit there is no such thing. But it is a strong set of priorities for \nAmerica. It reflects common sense when you look at the economic \nrealities, the budget realities and the national security realities we \nhave.\n  America was built on a foundation that rests on individual liberty. \nFrom that very first principle comes our country's commitment to \nproperty rights, to free markets, and to open trade. As we conclude \nthis debate on the budget in the coming days, I hope our budget \nresolution will reflect the importance of these ideas; that it will \ninclude provisions necessary to strengthen our economy, but that it \nwill balance the needs of our Government with the rights of \nindividuals. These are not just fanciful ideas, but are bedrock \nprinciples that enabled America to build the strongest economy the \nworld has ever known. They make us strong today and will keep us strong \ntomorrow.\n  Although I am just beginning my service in the Senate, I hope it will \nbe marked by a consistent and enduring commitment to these ideas. I can \nthink of no better way to serve my State and my country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss America's national \nsecurity and the need for American independence from Middle Eastern \noil.\n  America's chronic dependence on foreign oil is a critical national \nsecurity issue. It not only affects citizens and businesses nationwide, \nbut also has a direct impact on our Nation's ability to fight and win \nwars. As we prepare to engage in military operations in Iraq, it is \nimportant to understand that our forces are highly dependent on foreign \noil, much of which comes directly from Iraq. In other words, we are \ndependent on oil from Iraq to fight a war against Iraq.\n  During the 1970s energy crisis, America was 36 percent dependent on \nforeign oil. Today we are 56 percent dependent, and by 2010, we are \nheaded for well more than 60 percent. For the military, it now takes \neight times as much oil to meet the needs of each U.S. soldier as it \ndid during World War II. The Department of Defense today accounts for \nnearly 80 percent of all U.S. government energy use. During the 1991 \nPersian Gulf war, our 582,000 soldiers consumed 450,000 barrels of \npetroleum products--four times the daily amount used by the 2 million \nAllied soldiers that liberated Europe from the Nazis in World War II. \nSince World War I, the outcome of every war has been influenced by the \ncontrol of the energy. We are talking about a serious national security \nissue.\n  As a result of military operations in Iraq, we must prepare ourselves \nfor the possibility of disruptions in the flow of oil from the Middle \nEast. Iraq has been the fastest growing source for United States oil \nimports. Shockingly, in the year 2000, $5 billion of American money \nwent to Iraq to buy oil. After September 11, when asked how U.S. \ndependency on foreign oil relates to our national security, Deputy \nSecretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz said that U.S. dependency on \nforeign oil ``is a serious strategic issue. . . . My sense is that \n[our] dependency is projected to grow, not to decline. . . . it's not \nonly that we would, in a sense, be dependent on Iraqi oil, but the oil \nas a weapon. The possibility of taking that oil off the market and \ndoing enormous economic damage with it is a serious problem.''\n  It is critical that we develop our own resources and establish our \nenergy independence. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham has reviewed our \nnational energy policy. He has warned that unless we act now, we will \nthreaten our national security, damage our economic prosperity, and \nharm our quality of life. Likewise, in both 1995 and 1999, the \nSecretary of Commerce acknowledged, pursuant to a law directing his \nassessment, that our oil deficit poses a threat to national security. \nThis threat has been acknowledged by both sides of the aisle.\n  According to Secretary Abraham, consumption of energy has risen \nsharply yet production continues to decline. In a report released by \nthe Energy Information Administration, the Department of Energy \nestimates that oil and gas reserves totaling 1,166 trillion cubic feet \nare recoverable in the lower 48 states and Alaska. The oil we could \nrecover from three square miles of Alaska alone would allow our Nation \nto replace the oil we buy from Saudi Arabia for 30 years.\n  The time to act is now--not for some immediate quick fix, but for the \nlong-term security of America in the years and decades ahead. Our lack \nof an adequate long-term national energy policy is not a partisan \nmatter. It is a supreme national challenge that cannot be continually \nignored without posing an increasing danger to our security and our way \nof life. Sadly, our Nation has failed for three decades to address this \nissue properly.\n  The tired refrain that ANWR ``will destroy the environment'' is so \nout of date and out of touch with reality when we have the technology \nand the know-how to affirmatively protect the environment while meeting \nan important long-term national security challenge. Additionally, I \nwish it were required for everyone who is going to be voting on ANWR to \ntake a trip up to the North Slope of Alaska to see what we are really \ntalking about. It is not a pristine wilderness. We are only talking \nabout a very small, a minuscule part of that area up there, and we are \ntalking about an environment where the Eskimos, the local people, are \nbegging us to come in and open it up.\n  They have estimated that between 5.7 billion and 16 billion barrels \nof recoverable oil will be found in ANWR's Coastal Plain--up to 16 \nbillion. That equates to over $300 billion worth of American oil. The \nAmerican people want our country to comprehensively rebuild our \nmilitary, our defenses and our future security on all fronts. This was \ntrue before September 11. It is only more true today. It is time for \nthe Senate to vote, for the Congress to act, and for America to move \nforward towards true and lasting energy independence.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \namendment introduced by Senator Boxer, which would strike the \nprovisions contained in the pending Budget Resolution that would allow \nfor the commencement of oil exploration and drilling in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge, ANWR. I am deeply concerned about the \nirreparable damage these actions would have on this unique and \nbeautiful wilderness.\n  A mere 6 days ago, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution \ncommemorating the Centennial Anniversary of the Wildlife Refuge System, \nestablished by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1903 with the \ndesignation of the Pelican Island Reservation on the eastern coast of \nFlorida. According to last\n\n[[Page S3924]]\n\nweek's resolution, which I cosponsored, the Senate ``reaffirms its \ncommitment to continued support for the National Wildlife Refuge \nSystem, and the conservation of our Nation's rich natural heritage.'' \nThe language contained in the pending Budget Resolution, which would \nlead to the disturbance of one of the largest and most pristine \ncomponents of the Wildlife Refuge System, not only falls far short of \nthis reaffirmation, but explicitly breaks the commitment laid out by \nPresident Roosevelt a century ago.\n  The principal mission of the Wildlife Refuge System, in President \nRoosevelt's own words, is ``keeping for our children's children as a \npriceless heritage, all of the delicate beauty of the lesser and burly \nmajesty of the mightier forms of wildlife. . . .'' Moreover, Roosevelt \ndeclared that this mission is founded on the basic principle that \n``wild beasts and birds are by right not the property merely of the \npeople who are alive today, but the property of unborn generations, \nwhose belongings we have no right to squander.'' The environmental \ndamage we have seen throughout the country over the past 100 years has \nstrengthened and reaffirmed President Roosevelt's wise foresight in \npreserving certain areas of beauty and natural significance for present \nand future generations.\n  Proponents of drilling in ANWR have claimed that oil exploration \nactivities on the Refuge's fragile coastal plain will result in \nvirtually undetectable environmental impact. However, an extensive, \ncongressionally mandated report released earlier this month by the \nNational Research Council of the National Academies of Science and \nEngineering makes clear that drilling in ANWR will result in \nsignificant damage to the region. According to the report, which \nexamined the cumulative effects of oil and gas exploration and \nproduction on Alaska's North Slope over the past three decades, \n``[r]oads, pads, pipelines, seismic-vehicle tracks, and transmission \nlines; air, ground, and vessel traffic; drilling activities; landfills, \nhousing, processing facilities, and other industrial infrastructure \nhave compromised wild-land and scenic values over large areas. . . .'' \nMoreover, ``climate changes during the past several decades on the \nNorth Slope have been unusually rapid,'' and ``noise from exploratory \ndrilling and marine seismic exploration'' have disrupted migratory \npatterns and severely impeded reproductive rates of bowhead whales, \ncaribou, native birds, and other species.\n  In addition to the major environmental impact that would likely \naffect ANWR should it be opened for oil and gas exploration, the \nresulting energy supply would do little to address our growing energy \nneeds. Indeed, ANWR represents only five percent of Alaska's North \nSlope the remaining ninety-five percent of the North Slope is currently \nopen to oil and gas exploration and production. According to a 1998 \nU.S. Geological Survey study, the total amount of oil that could be \nharvested from ANWR would roughly equal the amount of oil consumed by \nAmericans in a 6-month period. Finally, this relatively small supply of \noil would do even less to address our immediate energy needs. A 2001 \nreport published by the Congressional Research Service has estimated \nthat American consumers would not begin to benefit from oil recovered \nfrom ANWR for at least 10 years.\n  If we truly want to address the challenge of our country's \noverwhelming dependence on foreign oil, causing irreparable damage to \nan area of exquisite beauty in exchange for a small supply of oil and \ngas is not the manner in which we should proceed. It is my strongly-\nheld belief that we must aggressively pursue sources of renewable \nenergy, as well as turn our focus away from increased production, and \ntoward greater conservation.\n  Mr. President, attempts to open ANWR to oil and gas exploration are \nreckless and shortsighted. I urge my colleagues to honor President \nTheodore Roosevelt's vision by joining me in supporting Senator Boxer's \namendment to preserve the integrity and beauty of ANWR.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate soon will have the opportunity \nto support an amendment to remove the proposal to increase oil and gas \nexploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from the budget \nreconciliation bill. By tucking away this proposal into the energy \nsection of the reconciliation bill, proponents of this provision would \nsmother the open debate the American public deserves on such a \nsignificant and contentious national issue.\n  Just last Friday, on March 14, we celebrated the 100th anniversary of \nthe creation of the Nation's first Federal bird reserve on Pelican \nIsland, the predecessor of today's refuge system. Today we are debating \nwhether to allow further drilling in the fragile arctic environment, \nfor reasons that do not add up to justify such a step.\n  Consider how far we have come since President Theodore Roosevelt had \nthe vision to set aside the 5-acre Pelican Island--a small thicket of \nmangroves off the east coast of Florida--to a system that today totals \nmore than 95 million acres consisting of 540 national wildlife refuges, \nthousands of small wetlands, and other special management areas. The \nNational Wildlife Refuge System hosts 35,000,000 visitors annually, \nwith the help of 30,000 volunteers. It is home to wildlife of almost \nevery variety in every State of the Union, and some part or parts of \nthe system are within an hour's drive of almost every major city. It \nwould be unwise to sanction the degradation of one of the crown jewels \nof our refuge system--the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  The administration argues that allowing an increase in drilling in \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would be an integral part of \nalleviating the Nation's dependence on foreign oil. In reality, \ndrilling in the Arctic Refuge would only provide the equivalent of what \nthe United States consumes in 6 months. Nor would this provision amount \nto any increase in oil production for at least a decade, or truly \nenhance our energy security, or lower prices for consumers, or create a \nsignificant number of new long-term jobs.\n  Furthermore, 95 percent of the potential oil reserves of Alaska's \nNorth Slope are already designated for potential leasing or open to \nexploration and drilling. The last 5 percent--the Coastal Plain of the \nArctic Refuge--is the only wild stretch of the coast of Alaska's North \nSlope that remains off limits.\n  What are the tradeoffs? According to a recent National Academy of \nSciences, NAS, report issued just last month, the impacts of current \nactivity already adversely impacted numerous wildlife species in the \nArctic Refuge. The NAS documented displacement to the fall migration \npatterns of bowhead whales due to noise associated from seismic \nexploration and cited an increased number of predators which adversely \naffects the reproduction rates in migratory and resident birds, as well \nas the migration pattern and reproduction rates of one of the greatest \ncaribou herds in North America. The NAS study concluded that expanding \noil and gas exploration into the surrounding refuge lands would result \nin further degradation of soils, vegetation, and aquatic systems in \nthis fragile environment.\n  Protecting this refuge is our obligation as stewards of this land. As \nPresident Theodore Roosevelt, the creator of the refuge system, said: \n``wild beasts and birds are by right not the property merely of the \npeople who are alive today, but the property of unknown generations, \nwhose belongings we have no right to squander.'' Sanctioning these \nincursions not only would damage the environment today, but it would \ntake away those tangible and inherent values the refuge will provide to \nfuture generations--our children and grandchildren.\n  Last Thursday, March 13, the Senate unanimously approved a resolution \nmarking the Centennial Anniversary of the National Wildlife Refuge \nSystem. This week, we have the opportunity to follow that symbolism \nwith a more tangible step in defense of our refuge system, by voting to \nremove the rider on ANWR oil and gas exploration from the budget \nreconciliation bill.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Boxer-Chafee \namendment that has my cosponsorship along with 14 other colleagues. The \namendment strikes the reconciliation instructions to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources that would open up the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration and drilling.\n\n[[Page S3925]]\n\n  The issue as to whether to open up a pristine and vital habitat \nrefuge for a finite amount of oil is a fundamental policy question that \nshould not have been injected into the budget process, thereby \nbypassing the Senate committee process. Including the drilling receipts \nand reconciliation instructions in the budget is a major policy \ninitiative with serious environmental ramifications.\n  The budget process, with its strict rules for limited debate, is not \nconducive to adequate consideration of this issue. In fact, opening up \nthe Arctic Refuge proved to be extremely controversial in the 107th \nCongress and was debated at length during the Senate's consideration of \nits omnibus energy bill. On April 18, 2002, by a vote of 54 to 46, the \nSenate defeated a procedural motion to invoke cloture to shut off the \ndebate.\n  Revenues from oil leases in the Arctic Refuge have been estimated to \nbe $1.2 billion over 10 years. I believe that the budgetary effects of \noil leases in the Refuge are incidental compared with the weight of its \npolicy impact. The tradeoffs just don't balance out when considering \ndrilling for a finite supply of oil in the biological heart of Alaska's \ncoastal plain.\n  Drilling in the Refuge is not the solution to our Nation's current \nenergy problems, and for years the issue has distracted us from the \nreal answers to energy needs. Unfortunately, over the past several \nyears, rather than being serious about offsetting the nation's \nincreasing thirst for oil by increasing the use of alternate and \nrenewable energy sources, we are now more dependent than ever on these \nforeign oil sources. If we are to be serious about addressing our \nenergy needs, we should be advancing energy efficiency, energy \nconservation and clean, renewable sources of power so that we can \nreduce our need for fossil fuels, which is mainly responsible for air \npollution and greenhouse gases impacting climate change.\n  As the storm clouds gather today in the Middle East, we should be \nputting our energies into becoming more fuel efficient, for instance, \nby increasing corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, standards, to \nclose the SUV loophole that currently allows the increasingly popular \nsport utility vehicles to get only 20.7 miles per gallon while \npassenger cars must meet a 27.5 mpg standard. Increasing the SUV \nstandard to that of passenger cars would help to eliminate the need to \nimport oil from the most volatile area of the globe.\n  In addition, based on the estimate provided by the Department of \nEnergy's Energy Information Administration, it would realistically take \nseven to 12 years from approval to first production of oil, meaning \nthat not a single drop of oil would be available to go to market for 7 \nto 12 years. In contrast, Paul Portney, Chairman of the National \nAcademies' 2001 Report on CAFE standards, stated at the Joint Commerce \nand Energy Committees' hearing that year that ``. . . increases to fuel \nefficiency could be made in a few years.''\n  The fact is that, sooner or later, any oil found in ANWR will run \nout--while increasing CAFE standards will continue to decrease oil \nusage. It is estimated that one million barrels of oil per day would be \nsaved by the Feinstein-Snowe bill that closes the SUV loophole. \nImproving the gasoline mileage of the Nation's new vehicles by just \nthree miles per gallon could take less time and could be expected to \nsave more oil than would ultimately be recovered over the lifetime of \nthe finite oil resources in ANWR. The United States Geological Service \nestimates a 95 percent probability of 4.2 billion barrels of \nrecoverable oil, and a five percent probability of 11.8 billion barrels \nof recoverable oil.\n  Interestingly, CAFE increases would keep more greenhouse gases, \nspecifically carbon dioxide--the major cause of climate change--from \ngoing into the atmosphere because less gasoline would be used and \ntherefore there would be less vehicle emissions of CO2. In contrast, \nthe process of getting oil out of ANWR will add more greenhouse gases \nand air pollution because of the oil drilling facilities and processes \nrequired for extraction.\n  Drilling in the Arctic Refuge poses environmental risks by impacting \nsensitive wildlife habitats. The Refuge is the summer home for \nthousands of migratory birds; year-round home to muskoxen, fox, wolf \nand wolverine; and its lagoons support eight species of marine mammals, \n62 species of coastal fish, and seven species of freshwater fish. Of \nnote, the Refuge is the calving ground of the Porcupine caribou herd. \nMuch has been said on the Senate floor about the Central Arctic caribou \nherds in the North Slope drilling area that have greatly increased \nsince the North Slope pipeline was installed, but these caribou have \nthe ability to move south, unlike the Porcupine caribou herd within the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge that have no place to go due to the \ngeological features of the narrow strip of an island-like area in the \nrefuge between the ocean and the mountains.\n  Again, I would like to reiterate that including drilling receipts and \nreconciliation instructions in the budget is not the right way to go as \nit is a major policy initiative with serious environmental \nramifications that must be debated fully in the proper forum of \ncommittee hearings and subsequent floor and public debates. Consider \nthe National Research Council's recently published report on the \neffects of drilling in the North Slope of Alaska. It stated that, even \nthough oil companies have greatly improved practices in the Arctic, \nthree decades of drilling along Alaska's North Slope have produced a \nsteady accumulation of harmful environmental and social effects that \nwill probably grow as exploration expands.\n  Some of the problems, the report said, could last for centuries, both \nbecause environmental damage does not heal easily in the area's harsh \nclimate and because it is uneconomical to remove structures or restore \ndamaged areas once drilling is over. I urge my colleagues to vote to \nstrike the language from the budget resolution so that drilling in the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge does not begin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask we take 10 minutes off our side of \nthe resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President I will speak a couple of minutes about the \ngeneral budget, and then turn to the ANWR Alaska refuge amendment that \nis pending that I hope will prevail in a vote in a few years.\n  I ask unanimous consent Senators Corzine and Clinton be added as \ncosponsors to my ANWR amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will talk about this budget overall \nbecause I listened to my colleague talk about it in a way that, \nfrankly, is stunning because I remember when Republicans wanted a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. Now they are embracing \na budget that has deficits as far as the eye can see. If you like \ndeficits as far as the eye can see, you will love this budget and you \nshould vote for it because that is what you are getting.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will after I am finished, as I listened to my friend \ntalk for quite a few moments.\n  If you embrace the idea that deficits are a good thing for the \ncountry, red ink is a good thing for this country, you will love this \nbudget; go ahead and vote for it and that is fine and we will talk \nabout it when we go home.\n  If you like the idea that we should ignore an enormous cost that is \nstaring us in the face as our beautiful men and women are standing on \nthe brink of war, if you think this budget should ignore those costs, \nthen you should vote for this budget because this is an Alice-in-\nWonderland-type of budget.\n  The whole country is focused on what is about to happen--but not in \nthis budget. I have seen comments made by friends of mine from the \nother body on the other side of the aisle that said hurry up and get \nthis through before we have to deal with the costs of the war.\n  When I hear Senator Frist say let's push this through fast, that, in \nmy opinion, ties the knot here. The other side wants to get this done \nvery quickly even though it has no costs for the war. The first person \nwho said the war will cost between $100 billion and $200 billion was \nLarry Lindsey, and as we know, he was shown the door.\n\n[[Page S3926]]\n\n  Vote for this budget if you think we should ignore the costs of the \nwar. Vote for this budget if you love deficits. If you like breaking \npromises to our children on No Child Left Behind, cutting afterschool \nprograms and the like, vote for this budget because that is what you \nare doing.\n  The President posed for pictures with Senator Kennedy and Congressman \nMiller--No Child Left Behind--and then he fails to fund it.\n  He is going to kick 50,000 California kids out of afterschool \nprograms, unless we fix it. All through the country, he is going to \nkick 500,000 to 700,000 kids out of afterschool programs, including \nkids in New Hampshire and all over our great Nation.\n  Our kids deserve more than that. If you like the fact that No Child \nLeft Behind is not funded fully, vote for the budget. If you want to \ncut environmental enforcement, vote for the budget. If you want to fund \nthe highways and transit at a lower level than what we need, vote for \nthe budget.\n  Especially vote for the budget if you want to give tax breaks to \npeople who earn more than $1 million a year because they will get back \n$87,000 a year. Definitely vote for this budget if your heart bleeds \nfor those folks who make more than $1 million a year because that is \nthe centerpiece of this budget.\n  I hope we can change it. We are going to try to change it. We have a \nfew brave souls on the other side of the aisle who agree with us. I \ndon't know how it will turn out. But when I hear people talk about why \nour country is in so much economic trouble, it started 2 years ago. We \nlost 2 million jobs because we abandoned fiscal responsibility, we \nabandoned investment in job-producing investments, we abandoned the \nprinciples that led us to the greatest economic recovery in \ngenerations. But if you don't want to go back to those good days and \nstick with these bad days, vote for this budget.\n  On my time that is remaining, I want to say how excited I am that we \nactually may pass the Alaska wildlife amendment.\n  What we have here on this chart is a very simple visual of what we \nwill save from various scenarios on imported oil. I had, yesterday, the \npercentages.\n  We see that while ANWR would reduce our reliance on imported oil by 2 \npercent, if we just did better tires on our cars, which would lead to \nbetter fuel economy, we could save 4.3 percent of imported oil. If we \nclosed the SUV loophole and just had the SUVs get the same mileage as \ncars, we would save 16 percent on the amount of oil we have to import. \nIf we increased our fuel economy by 13--to 35 miles per gallon--which \nthe automobile people say is absolutely possible; we would reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil by 43 percent.\n  The alternative is this reduction of dependence on foreign oil by 2 \npercent. By the way, this wouldn't happen for 8 or 10 years. For \neverybody who says it is going to happen sooner, that is not what the \nproof is. The science tells us it will take 8 to 10 years to get it up \nand running.\n  This is the alternative, drilling in this God-given area.\n  I will give the remainder of my time to Senator Conrad. We are \ntalking about a place that looks like this. Yes, in the winter it is \nicy. Yes, in the winter there is not much--it doesn't look as beautiful \nas this, but I don't look as good as I looked when I was young, so that \nhappens sometimes. But the bottom line is, it is a beautiful place.\n  Here are some other beautiful pictures. We will show you some of the \nwildlife that we have, this beautiful bird which is the whimbrel--quite \nbeautiful. It is my chart bird, I call it. That is a beautiful example \nof what we are trying to save.\n  I will yield the remainder of my time on the resolution to Senator \nConrad and hope my colleagues on both sides will support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am wondering, I ask my colleague and \nfriend from California who showed those pictures of a beautiful area \nadjacent to the Brookes Range--I have been there--I wonder, Has the \nSenator from California visited the 1002 area, the ANWR area?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have been to Alaska and I am going back. I haven't been \nto the 1002 area, but my chief environmental legislative aide took my \nplace on a trip that, unfortunately, I had to cancel 6 months ago, and \njust said it was absolutely exquisite.\n  As my friend knows, we have hundreds of wildlife refuges. I have been \nto a few. I haven't been to them all. But this is God's gift and \nwhether--\n  Mr. NICKLES. The answer to the question is you have not been there?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I stated that clearly in the debate. The last time I \nwas asked this question, people said these photos were----\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would like to make a couple of comments. I am going to \nspeak about ANWR momentarily. My friend and colleague from New Mexico, \nwho happens to be chairman of the Energy Committee, wants to speak. But \nmany of us have been to ANWR. The picture the Senator from California \nshows, the beautiful part, is of Alaska adjacent to the Brookes Range. \nIt is gorgeous. That is not where we are drilling, or proposing to \ndrill.\n  I will say, there are a couple of people who have been there more \nthan the Senator from Oklahoma and that would be Senator Murkowski and \nSenator Stevens. They have been there many times. They know what the \n1002 area is. They know the area we are talking about drilling. It is \nnot the beautiful pictures we see that some people are advertising. \nPeople are not proposing to drill in those areas.\n  The area they are proposing to drill on is not nearly as pretty. It \nis very barren. It looks somewhat like a frozen moonscape area, or \nfrozen Saharan desert, or something like that.\n  My point is, I see the picture of the caribou. I have seen them. I \nhave been to Prudhoe Bay as well. I have seen a lot of caribou. The \ncaribou happen to like the Prudhoe Bay area and the Alaska oil \npipeline. There are a lot of caribou in that area.\n  I think there is a tradition in the Senate that is being violated and \nthat is that we respect home State Senators, when we are talking about \nparks or refuges in their States. We usually assume they know best.\n  I heard Senator Murkowski give an outstanding speech last night that \ntalked about her State and talked about how important this is to her \nState and our country.\n  I heard Senator Stevens, with whom I have had the pleasure of working \nwith for the last 23 years and for whom I have great respect, and he \nknows this better than anybody. He used to be Solicitor at the \nDepartment of the Interior. He goes way back on this issue. He knows \nmore about Alaska than the rest of the Senate combined.\n  To ignore his comments, or those of the Senator, Ms. Murkowski--or \nGovernor Murkowski--on this issue I think is a serious mistake, \nespecially if people haven't been there. I encourage my colleagues, if \nthey have questions about this area, to go visit it. I think it would \nbe very educational. I think it would be very helpful, especially if we \nare going to try to dictate exploration in an area smaller than a \ncouple of thousand acres, smaller than Dulles Airport. If we are going \nto try to mandate they cannot forever drill in those areas, I think we \nought to at least go there and visit the area and know, really, what it \nlooks like. If we have not been, I think we ought to defer to the home \nState Senators for their expertise and advice.\n  I yield to the chairman of the Energy Committee, Senator Domenici, \nsuch time as he desires on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from New Mexico yield just for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Which Senator is going to ask a question?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course.\n  Mr. REID. Last night the Senator from New Mexico said he wanted to \nspeak for approximately an hour? How long, just so we can get people \nready here.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator knows I don't have a notebook full here. I \nwanted to make sure. One thing I learned, as a Senator, from Senator \nByrd is if you want to make a speech, don't agree to the shortest \namount of time because, sure enough, you never get what you wanted to \nsay said. I said an hour. I probably will use an hour.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you very much.\n\n[[Page S3927]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished minority floor leader.\n  Mr. President, fellow Senators, and more importantly, fellow \nAmericans who might be watching, I am going to have one of my aides \nturn this chart for a moment. You are going to be able to read the \nprint very easily. It says:\n\n       If ANWR was the size of this chart, the total footprint of \n     any development there would be smaller than the box below.\n\n  You see the people running the television here in the Senate have to \nbe very careful because if they are not, you will not even see it. ANWR \nis as big as this chart. We have done it to scale, all of that blue.\n  Now, regardless of what is said about what you are going to do to \nANWR, let me submit to you that you are going to do it on this little \npiece, I say to the chairman. Look at this. Can you see it? Maybe I can \nshow the chairman of the Budget Committee. Do you see that little piece \nthere? I don't think you can even see it, that little piece. That is \nwhere ANWR is going to have a footprint to produce oil for America.\n  Can you imagine we are here arguing about whether or not we ought to \ntake this tiny little piece? Here it is. Let me show it to you again. \nDo you see this, Mr. Chairman? I don't think you can see it from there. \nThat is the size of the footprint. And the whole chart is the size of \nANWR.\n  Now, I can guarantee you, the thousands of Americans who have been \nwriting to their Senators and who joined the Sierra Club to say don't \ndo anything in ANWR have no understanding, have never been told--as a \nmatter of fact, have been told to the contrary--that of this huge \nwilderness, that is the amount of the footprint which will yield oil \nfor America's future.\n  I ask the Presiding Officer, are you looking at this chart?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do you need any assistance to see it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I can see it from here.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You don't have to answer. As a matter of fact, I am \nvery hopeful that everybody can see it, because you saw beautiful polar \nbears, you saw fantastic growth everybody is proud of. But can anyone \nbelieve that little, tiny footprint is going to affect polar bears in \nthe ANWR wilderness? Can you believe that much property, used to drill \noil for America's future, is going to have an impact on America's \neconomic future?\n  I submit, if the issue had not already been framed, and if, as a \nmatter of fact, Senators had not already been convinced, if they truly \nstarted right here on the floor--let's discuss America; let's discuss \nthe amount of oil we have to use each day; let's discuss our future; \nand now let's take a look at ANWR. If we had not received messages in \nthe mail, if we had not received requests for contributions from those \nwho support keeping ANWR exactly like it is, and not letting us have \nany of the resources that belong to America--if none of that occurred, \nwe were here in a closed session, all 100 Senators, and those who \nwanted to say ``no drilling'' got a day, and I got an hour, they could \ntalk all they wanted, and I would put this chart up and say, ``Are you \nkidding? You don't even want America to take a look at that?''\n  Now, having said that, it has been said on a number of occasions on \nthe floor there isn't enough oil in ANWR to amount to anything. A few \nyears ago, when I was sitting around and heard somebody say, ``America \ndoesn't need this oil,'' I said to myself, ``Who are we kidding? How \narrogant about our future are we? We don't need the oil that could be \nproduced from Alaska because it isn't very much oil?''\n  Well, I started, over the weekend, asking, How much oil is it? How \nmuch oil is it in a way that maybe Americans would understand? And I \ndecided we could take a little trip. We could take a trip through \nAmerica and look at where we are producing oil today, and as we came \nupon a State that was producing oil, we would decide whether we needed \nthat oil. After all, we are so strong and so arrogant about our \neconomic future that there is a lot of oil America might have we \nmust not need.\n\n  Guess what happened. The very first State I came upon was Texas. \nTexas. As I rode across America and stopped in various States, I \nstopped in Texas. And what did I find? I went to their Department of \nMinerals and Resources, and I looked, and I said: Could you help me? I \nam trying to find out where oil is produced in America and whether we \nneed it or not. And what in the world did I find? ANWR has more oil \nthan Texas. So I surmise we do not need the oil from Texas either. I \nsurmise Texas oil does not amount to that much, because, after all, for \ncomparison purposes, the total reserves in the State of Texas are 5.2 \nbillion barrels. That is data for the year 2000. Let's repeat that. The \nreserves in the State of Texas for the year 2000 are 5.2 billion \nbarrels.\n  According to the Energy Information Administration, upon which we as \npolicymakers are basing our decisions, ANWR's oil reserves would range \nfrom a low--a low--of 5.7 billion barrels to a high of 16 billion \nbarrels.\n  Let's repeat it. The reserves in the State of Texas, because that is \nwhere I started that sojourn--I would have ended up, had I not found \nthat out in Texas--we did not have to go any further--I would have gone \nover to New Mexico and found their reserves, and then I would have gone \nto Oklahoma. But just stopping at Texas, you find the reserves in the \nState of Texas are estimated to be 5.2 billion barrels. And according \nto the experts advising the policymakers, the present Congress, and \npeople of America, the reserves for ANWR--from that little, tiny dot--\nare 5.7 billion barrels for the low estimate, and 16 billion barrels \nfor the high estimate.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Alaska in the Chamber. That \nmeans, I say to the Senator, if I read it right, that the reserves in \nyour State, just in ANWR, if one uses the most conservative estimates, \nare equivalent to or more than the State of Texas. And if you use just \na middle point, a 50-percent expectancy in terms of reserve estimates, \nI imagine if you do that, the yield is twice the State of Texas. Twice \nthe State of Texas. If you like this Senator's estimate, it will be \ntwice the State of Texas, it will not be the 5.2 billion barrels \nbecause that is the lowest estimate.\n  Now, I would like, once and for all, whatever has been said in this \nSenate--with the charts up there about us not needing this, that it is \nonly a speck of the world's production of oil--I would like to submit, \nwe need the production from the State of Texas, and we need an \nequivalent to the production from the State of Texas which would come \nfrom ANWR. America, as rich as we are, as powerful as we are, as \nwilling as we are to say, ``We just don't need this. We will buy it \nfrom the world. We just don't need American oil. We don't even need as \nmuch as Texas produces''--right--``Just forget about it; we will buy \nit''--we will buy it, all right. And then, as war looms, the case for \nArctic oil gets better and better and better.\n  As we look at America's future, we hear people get on the floor and \nsay: Don't worry about producing more oil; we will just conserve more. \nWell, we will have an Energy bill here on the floor about when we come \nback from the April recess. I welcome Senators to come to the floor and \ntell us how in the world in the future we are not going to have to \ncontinue to import huge quantities of oil.\n  Now, somebody can get up and say: We only want half the automobiles \nwe are driving today 4 years from now and 5 years from now. That is \nridiculous. Or: We are going to use hydrogen cars. Of course, we are \ngoing to use a few of them each year, and in 20 years we are going to \nuse a bunch of them. What do we do in the meantime?\n  They will say: Let's use electric cars. We will use them, but how \nmany? Everybody understands the oil consumption is not going to come \ndown dramatically during the next decade to 20 years. And what are we \ngoing to be doing? We are going to be depending upon the world for that \nperiod of time, and well beyond that, to buy it from the world.\n  It seems to me that a secondary issue--maybe a primary issue--we are \ndebating in the Senate is jobs for Americans. I regret to tell you that \nfor those who oppose that little tiny piece of this budget resolution \ncalled ANWR, they are opposing the biggest job producer this whole bill \nhas in mind. I am more certain that if ANWR is permitted to be \ndeveloped, when the time comes that it is producing, it will produce \nmore jobs for America than this bill with all its tax provisions and\n\n[[Page S3928]]\n\nat the same time will produce oil for Americans. This is the estimate \ngiven by the experts of the American jobs, high-paying jobs. We are not \neven including in this the fact that American companies will own it. \nAmericans will be part of the rig operators. Americans will be \nproducing the pipelines.\n  Here is the estimate of employment that would flow from ANWR. You \ncould vote against all the tax relief if ANWR was coming on board next \nmonth. That can't happen because it is a few years away. Here are the \njobs: 575,000 full-blown American jobs for American men and women and \nAmerican executives, and they have to be high paying. For any State \nthat would like to look: for Colorado, there is estimated employment of \n8,000; New Jersey, 17,000; California, 63,000 jobs if ANWR comes on. I \nsuppose in the course of things, 63,000 jobs doesn't mean that much for \na big State such as California.\n  Incidentally, if I would have followed that little trip through \nAmerica to see where the oil was produced and I would have passed right \non by Texas, and passed right on by New Mexico, and passed right on by \nArizona and a little pinch of Nevada, and ended up in California, and \ngone to their mineral extraction department and said, how much oil do \nyou produce? guess what I would have found. I would have found that the \nproduction in California of crude oil for America is about equivalent \nto what will be produced from ANWR when it is producing oil for \nAmericans. Think of that.\n  People look at California and say: Boy, if we didn't have that \nproduction from California, where would we be? Isn't that interesting? \nIf we had ANWR on board and producing and we took our little trip \nthrough America and ended up in Alaska and somebody would have said to \nus, well, that is producing about the same as Texas and California, \nlet's just not produce it anymore, what do you think would happen? Do \nyou think anybody would vote for that? I mean, it would be such a \nridiculous proposition that we don't need it, even though it is about \nthe equivalent of California and about the same as Texas, that clearly \nthis issue to this Senator reaches the point where you can hardly \nunderstand what we are doing on the floor of the Senate with as close a \nvote as you can possibly get on this issue.\n  To the two or three Senators who still might have enough courage, \nenough concern, enough freedom to say I am going to do what is best, I \nsubmit that they ought to vote to keep ANWR, keep that marvelous huge \nwilderness that President Eisenhower is cited as having been \ninstrumental in creating, keep it, and use this tiny piece here to \nproduce oil for generations to come.\n  There is an excellent review and outlook in the Wall Street Journal \nthis morning called ``Drilling for Votes.'' That is probably what they \nassume their editorial is doing, it is drilling for votes. It outlines \nthe issues before us. It is rather succinct. It covers what I have just \ndiscussed, the insignificance of the probable damage to ANWR. I have \ntried to depict it in terms of jobs. It discusses that with words. They \nare wordsmiths, and they have done it in a very exciting, excellent, \nand forthright manner. They discuss jobs, which I just did. They also \ndiscuss what the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee \ndiscussed for just a few moments as to what is the nature of this tiny \npiece of geography that is part of ANWR. It is not the beautiful parts \nof this that have been shown in pictures here on the floor. It is \ndiscussed in this editorial in words as to what it is. It says:\n\n       This oil would come from a tiny piece of land that is \n     nowhere near the ``pristine'' mountains shown in the Sierra \n     Club ads. Exploration would be on Alaska's coastal plain, a \n     sliver of tundra that [the Secretary of the Interior] has \n     described aptly as ``flat, white nothingness.''\n\n  The editorial continues:\n\n       Far from pristine, it is the home of the town of Kaktovik, \n     with its people, cars, boats and airplane hangars. The actual \n     drilling footprint would be about 2,000 acres, the size of \n     Washington's Dulles Airport.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entirety of this editorial be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 19, 2003]\n\n                           Drilling for Votes\n\n       If war in Iraq, sky-high oil prices and a moribund energy \n     bill aren't reason enough for the Senate to finally approve \n     drilling in the Arctic, could someone please tell us what is?\n       The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is back in the \n     headlines, and the good news is that Senate Republicans are \n     very close to passing a drilling amendment. By attaching ANWR \n     to the Senate budget resolution, they need only 51 votes and \n     can avoid the filibuster threats (and Presidential \n     aspirations) of certain opposition Senators from the \n     Northeast.\n       The arguments for Arctic drilling haven't changed, but it's \n     worth running through them again. The biggest is the ANWR is \n     a new and important supply of oil. The site is expected to \n     produce 10.4 billion barrels, or 1.4 million barrels a day--\n     the largest single prospect for future oil production in the \n     country. To put this in perspective, the oil-rich states of \n     Texas and California each offer about one million barrels a \n     day. No, ANWR won't provide ``energy independence,'' but it \n     will give a cushion in the event of future oil-supply crises.\n       This oil would come from a tiny piece of land that is \n     nowhere near the ``pristine'' mountains shown in those Sierra \n     Club ads. Exploration would be on Alaska's coastal plain, a \n     sliver of tundra that Interior Secretary Gale Norton has \n     aptly described as ``flat, white nothingness.'' Far from \n     pristine, it is home to the town of Kaktovik, with its \n     people, cars, boats and airplane hangars. The actual drilling \n     footprint would be about 2,000 acres, the size of \n     Washington's Dulles Airport.\n       As for the environmental consequences, we'd point to the \n     recent National Academy of Sciences report on the cumulative \n     effects of drilling in the nearby North Slope. Green groups \n     have spun the report as evidence of eco-calamity, but anyone \n     who reads it knows it shows more or less the opposite.\n       The report, for instance, found that there had been no \n     major oil spills on the North Slope through operation of oil \n     fields, and that small spills had had no cumulative effects. \n     While some animals had been ``affected,'' the committee could \n     not list any species that were threatened. And it conceded \n     that drilling hadn't led to any large or long-term \n     declines in the much-celebrated caribou herd.\n       It also noted that new technology had reduced damage to the \n     tundra. Given the report was measuring the effects of 25-year \n     old equipment, and that a Senate bill would require best-\n     technology, we can expect even better results. And the report \n     acknowledged that oil development had resulted in real \n     improvements in schools, health care, housing and other \n     community services for Alaskan communities.\n       As good as these policy arguments are, the reality is that \n     drilling ultimately hinges on the environmental politics of \n     the Senate. Republicans have 48 sure votes. They need two \n     more, because Vice President Dick Cheney is standing by at \n     his secure, undisclosed location to break a tie. Most of the \n     focus is therefore on a few moderates, Arkansas Democrats \n     Mark Pryor and Blanche Lincoln, and Republicans Gordon Smith \n     and Norm Coleman.\n       If it's political cover these folks are looking for, they \n     might consider the environmental advantages that would accrue \n     to their home states with a yes vote. For starters, the ANWR \n     plan would divert $2 billion of the $2.15 billion in federal \n     royalties from drilling directly to the states for land and \n     water conservation. A gusher of new oil in Alaska would also \n     reduce the incentive to keep drilling in the lower 48, which \n     has its own environmental costs.\n       And if these ``moderates'' are truly on the fence, they \n     could give the Administration the benefit of the doubt, vote \n     to keep ANWR in the Senate budget resolution for now and then \n     fly to Alaska to see the site for themselves. At least if \n     they changed their mind in the final budget later in the \n     year, they'd really know what they were voting against.\n       We know it is perhaps a forlorn hope that Senators will \n     vote on substance over environmental symbolism. But why not? \n     On the economic and environmental merits, this isn't even a \n     close call.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. One remaining issue is: How do you drill for oil today, \nand how did you drill for it 25 years ago or even 30 years ago, when \nsome of the wells were drilled in California--maybe hundreds of the \nwells were drilled in California and hundreds, maybe thousands of the \nwells in Texas were drilled? Has America made any strides in changing \nthe way we drill for oil in 15, 20, 25 years?\n  I can tell you, some of the most dynamic, intelligent engineers in \nthe world have spent years finding out how to drill holes in Mother \nEarth. As a matter of fact, the expertise in drilling did not just come \nover these years from people interested in drilling for oil wells. We \nhave had an interest in drilling for many reasons.\n  Would you believe that the great laboratories of America--Los Alamos, \nSandia, Livermore--have had a genuine, abiding piece of their research \ndirected at, how do you drill holes into Mother Earth?\n  One time, they were experimenting in one of the laboratories in \ndrilling\n\n[[Page S3929]]\n\nthousands of feet underground to see if they could tap into the \ngeothermal heat pockets. They learned all kinds of things about \ndrilling. Then they had to drill holes as part of the nuclear weapons \nactivities in the deserts of Nevada. Millions of dollars were put into, \nhow do you do it so you don't waste time, so you don't produce a whole \nbunch of environmental degradation? Couple that with the resources of \nthe energy companies, which wasn't soft; it was pretty big. It was \npretty hot stuff. You put it together, and you have the most profound, \ninnovative ways to drill for oil you could ever imagine.\n  Let me just suggest, if oil is about 400 yards over there and you \nfound it--about four football fields away--and you don't want to touch \nthat ground, you can start here, where I am standing, and you can drill \nover there in what is called slant drilling. It is done with such \nprecision today that it can take place for yards and yards and yards \nfrom the actual point under the earth where you attempt to strike the \nliquid mineral, or the natural gas. That is what will be used if you \nare worried about how will you use this tiny piece, the size of Dulles, \nto go into the hinterland without touching anything.\n  That is the answer. You will go in when it is frozen, you will do \nyour drilling activity, and when it starts to thaw, you get out and \nwait until it freezes again, you come back and, frankly, you won't know \nanything has happened--except that underground you will be moving ahead \nfull speed to make America have more of the oil that is ours, that we \nown, that we will use for our future.\n  I have a little picture up here from Science Times. It was covered in \nthe Times. It is called ``Hunting For Oil: New Precision, Less \nPollution.''\n  I am sure those who have circulated millions and millions of letters \nand the hundreds of TV ads saying we are going to ruin ANWR--if we take \na tiny piece of that property, the size of Dulles, which I have just \nshown you on the map, and we drill, they are assuming you are going to \nspoil the earth as you do when you are producing with the conventional \ndrilling of wells.\n  This is a pictorial of the chronology and the evolution of how you go \nabout drilling today.\n\n       Using the latest drilling techniques, oil drilling sites \n     like those in the Alpine Fields of Alaska's North Slope are \n     using cutting edge technology in the hope of reducing \n     environmental damage.\n       To reduce the damage, recent advances are lessening the \n     industrial impact on the fragile Arctic ecosystem.\n\n  They proceed to show you an Alpine Field, Alaska. They show you what \nis happening. Let me move over here because I described it in not too \ngood a manner a while ago when I said the oil was 400 yards away, four \nfootball fields. You could drill from here.\n  Let's look at this diagram. You see, here is the platform that might \nbe the size of Dulles. Here is the drilling. Here is the oil \nunderground. And you see, way far away, the oil is underground, and it \nis going to be drilled and come up, and everything is going to be done \non this platform. The same here. Here is a giant reservoir underground. \nIt is many yards from where you have set out to manage and control the \ndestiny of the tundra. There you are with this dramatic picture of how, \njust like a curved straw, you put it underground and maneuver it, and \nthe ``milk shake'' is way over there, and your little child wants the \nmilk shake, and they sit over here in their bedroom where they are \nfeeling ill, and they just gobble it up from way down in the kitchen, \nwhere you don't even have to move the Mix Master that made the ice \ncream for them. You don't have to take it up to the bedroom. This \ndescribes the actual drilling that is taking place.\n  I told you a while ago that I was going to give you just a shirt-\nsleeve example, where four football fields over there is where you \nthought the oil was. I used an example that is way too small. As a \nmatter of fact, 4 miles--not 400 yards, but 4 miles--away is this oil \nfrom this drill. It is not yards, not football fields, but miles. How \nmany? Four. Now, you tell me that those who are telling America this \nwill damage this tundra, damage this wilderness, are scurrying to the \nAmerican people and telling them: Did you know you can set a piece of \nthat aside and 4 miles away you can take oil out of the ground? Pretty \nfantastic.\n\n  As a matter of fact, I am using 4, because my staff told me 4. They \nhave evidence from the science that it is 4. I don't see any reason it \ncould not be more than 4. I don't see why it cannot be 6. In fact, if \npeople want to know, we could go ask the experts how far away it can \nbe. It can be plenty far away.\n  So no hard feelings. Everybody makes their case. I have been here a \nlong time. I try to make mine. But I guarantee you, this one has me \nworried. If the Senate cannot say, 1, we need oil; 2, we need American \noil; 3, if we have got American oil and we can take it out of the \nground, we ought to properly assess the risk, we ought not to just say \nno. We just established we need it. It should be American, if possible. \nSo, third, we ought to properly assess the risk.\n  The risk is not properly assessed by saying it is under ANWR, \ntherefore no oil. That is not a risk assessment. That is an arbitrary \ndecision--that in one swath negates the first two propositions of \nsignificance and reality. We need oil, and we need American oil.\n  It is too bad that we do hear in America--and people are fair \nminded--we should not be using so much oil. I hear that. I am prepared \nto confront that on the floor of the Senate because, when the energy \nbill comes up, some people are going to say we are not a very good \ncountry because, after all, we use a third of the energy of the world. \nWho do we think we are? Do you know what I say? I say we need it for \nour standard of living, but we don't deny it to the other people in the \nworld. We will help them produce more. We will help them produce clean \nelectricity so they can grow. But I am not prepared to say, since we \nneed it for our standard of living--just because we use a \ndisproportionate amount--abandon the oil in Alaska. What does that have \nto do with it? What does that have to do with whether we are using oil?\n  Mr. President, the other thing I think Senators and the people of \nthis country ought to look at is, what is oil? It is easy to say we \ndon't need oil, why should we buy so much oil? But oil is our everyday \nlife.\n  Fellow Americans, do you want to live without cars? Sure, you do. Can \nyou? No, you cannot. I will repeat, would you like to live without \ncars? Most Americans would say, of course, I love cars, I like them. If \nyou want to say I wish I didn't, I wish I didn't have a car, I ask you, \nhow would you make a living?\n  Equally important, where would you live? There are two freedoms that \nare not covered anywhere in the sacred documents of our country that \nhave evolved, and they are about as American as the proverbial apple \npie. They are: The freedom to own a house anywhere one can afford it; \nthe yearning to have a house that is your own. We are not going to \nchange that until America is no longer America. The second freedom is \nto own an automobile or two so you can go where you want when you want.\n  I respect the fact that Americans say: This is our life. But I regret \nto tell my fellow Americans, without oil or if oil becomes so ungodly \nhigh priced, both of those freedoms will be in jeopardy. There is no \nquestion, both of those freedoms will be in jeopardy because we have \nbuilt our life around those freedoms being reasonably priced. If we \nmake them unreasonably priced and create anger among the American \npeople, and if, in fact, part of the reason the oil is so highly priced \nis because you did not want to use your own oil because you did not \nwant to touch that little piece of property in ANWR, I surmise people \nwill not think you have a very good excuse. I for one would say you do \nnot have any excuse at all.\n  I want to recap--and I apologize to the Senate if I have spoken too \nlong and if I have made any misstatements. I do not think I have, but \nif I have, I will try to correct them.\n  In summary, it is almost impossible to prove that ANWR will be \ndamaged to any noticeable degree if we produce the oil that is under \nthe footprint the U.S. Government would like to lease so we can \ndetermine whether oil is there and how much. It is almost impossible to \nprove damage.\n  I am prepared, although this debate will not go on much longer, to \ntake any instrument, any study, any report anybody wants to bring to \nthe floor to\n\n[[Page S3930]]\n\nthe contrary and debate it. If they want to use the Academy of Sciences \nstudy that has just reviewed the Prudhoe area, let's debate it. One may \nfind a few sentences in there that are cautionary, but they will find \ntremendous amounts of information saying those who claim Prudhoe Bay \nhas been significantly damaging are in error, and it produced that \nother part, Prudhoe, which passed this Senate by one vote and has \nproduced oil for America without which we would really be in trouble. \nWe can debate that issue.\n  This is so small in comparison to the size of this wilderness, an \narea in the wilderness for which we are very grateful to whomever \nstructures the underground oil reserves that they put it in this part \nof ANWR such that the drilling will occur in the area as I have \ndescribed it: not mountainous and beautiful and full of flowers, but \nlevel and barren and frozen in a gigantic piece that looks like part of \nNew Mexico that turned white and froze.\n  The next is we are not strong enough to throw away this much of our \nown patrimony. I do not know where I got the word except it is so \nimportant to own your own resources that in Spanish-speaking countries, \nsuch as Mexico, they call the oil of Mexico ``El patrimonio del estado \nde Mexico,'' the patrimony of the state. That is how important oil is. \nThis is our patrimony. It belongs to us. For those who say we should \nnot drill in ANWR because somebody went there and said, We just should \nnot touch this wilderness, to me is absolutely ignoring the reality of \nAmerica's future.\n  Every other issue I can think of--new technology which will cause a \nminimalization of environmental degradation, jobs in the future, and \nevery other issue one can think of--is on the side of the last two or \nthree votes deciding to get this done, not for me, but I have nine \ngrandchildren. I hope they can still drive a car and own a house \nwherever they would like and work hard and give us ample time to make \nthe transition toward other technologies that will make our lives like \nthey are today rather than lock this up for no good reason.\n\n  I close by saying the patrimony of Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask to take 5 minutes off the resolution \nto respond to the Senator from New Mexico. I believe I might pause here \nfor a unanimous consent request. Mr. President, I ask Senator Nickles, \nis that correct? Does the Senator wish that I wait while he propounds a \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will.\n  Mrs. BOXER. As long as it does not come off my time. I would like to \nreserve the 5 minutes off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am going to propound a couple unanimous \nconsent requests. I appreciate the cooperation of my colleague.\n  It is our intention to have a vote on the ANWR amendment at 3 o'clock \ntoday. I know there are still some Senators, including Senator \nMurkowski and Senator Stevens, who wish to speak on the ANWR amendment, \nand we will accommodate their request. Also, Senator Graham from South \nCarolina has an amendment. It would be my intention to send it to the \ndesk so that discussion and debate can occur on that amendment as well. \nWe will not lock in a time for a vote on that amendment, but we may \nvote on that shortly after the ANWR amendment.\n  We are also shopping, for the information of our colleagues, for a \ncouple other major amendments. It was my intention, and it is still my \nintention, to have a vote on the 350 amendment, the size of the growth \npackage, today. I would think that is a major amendment and will \nrequire some significant debate. That possibly could happen shortly \nafter the ANWR vote or maybe early afternoon, maybe by 4 or 5 o'clock \nand have some of that debate between now and that point on the 350 \namendment. That amendment is not ready right now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote in relation to \nthe Boxer amendment No. 272 occur at 3 o'clock today, with no \namendments in order to the language to be stricken prior to that vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, just so everyone within the sound of my \nvoice understands, we tried to have the vote earlier than 3 o'clock. \nThe Vice President is going to be here for one reason, and I think that \nis a powerful reason we are going to have the vote at 3 o'clock. I have \nno objection to the vote at 3 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may, while the manager of the bill is \non the floor, I hope this sense of the Senate--I am happy it is their \nturn to offer an amendment, and we have no control over what they \noffer. But I hope, Mr. President, that we will not spend a lot of time \non this sense-of-the-Senate amendment and that we can get to another \namendment before 3 o'clock. I hope the manager will work with us so we \ncan have Senator Graham debate this amendment as long as he thinks \nappropriate. We will respond, if necessary. I think this will pass \noverwhelmingly, with the little knowledge I have of it, and I hope we \ncan get to other amendments.\n  I say to my friend, we are ready to move forward on a homeland \nsecurity amendment. We are ready, as we speak, to move forward on an \neducation amendment. We hope we can get to those amendments before too \nlong, recognizing that my friend, the manager of the bill, wants a vote \non the best kept secret around here, the $350 million amendment which \nwe will vote on sometime.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friend and colleague from Nevada. I have been \nworking with Senator Conrad, and it is a pleasure to work both with the \nSenator from Nevada and the Senator from North Dakota. It is my hope \nand desire to consider a lot of amendments, the serious amendments, the \nbig amendments. I encourage people to give us copies. I have heard \nthere is a desire to have a vote on the Hagel amendment. I have seen \nsome language, but I am not sure which language.\n  That is maybe changing the Budget Act. So we kind of need to see that \nin advance. If people will give us these amendments, on both sides, we \ncan try to get these in queue so we can have adequate but not extended \ndebate, so we are not just burning time.\n  We know there is a limitation on debate. In years past, we have burnt \nall the time and then we have a very unpleasant vote-arama. I want to \navoid that. I know the Senator from North Dakota wants to avoid that. \nWe will cooperate with the managers to try to make that happen.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California will state her \ninquiry.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to make sure I have my 5 minutes to respond to the \nhour-long speech of the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That unanimous consent request was granted.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 279\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I send a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \noffered by the Senator from South Carolina to the desk and ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles], for Mr. Graham of \n     South Carolina, proposes an amendment numbered 279.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the urgent need \n    for legislation to ensure the long term viability of the Social \n                           Security program)\n\n       On page 79, after line 22, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 308.

Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, we \nwill have a vote on the ANWR resolution at 3. We will have a vote on \nthe Graham of South Carolina sense-of-the-Senate amendment sometime \nshortly thereafter. It is my hope and desire that we will get another \namendment in queue. I would like to see that amendment be the $350 \nbillion limitation on the growth package. If not, we will work with our \ncolleagues to find another substantive amendment to consider and try to \nget that in as quickly as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have 7 \nminutes following the Senator from California. Is that consistent with \nthe way the manager of the bill has been operating the floor? If not, I \nwill withhold.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield, that has been done. It is not \nthe best legislative procedure. I would like to follow a better \nlegislative procedure and not stack. In order to manage the floor, \nSenators should be recognized at the conclusion of a speech, and if my \ncolleague seeks recognition, I will yield to my colleague as soon as \nthe Senator from California concludes her remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 272\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico spoke with \ntremendous conviction about why he wants to drill in the Alaska \nWildlife Refuge. He said he had no hard feelings for those people who \nfelt differently, but he said a number of things that deserve to be \nrebutted, and I am going to do that.\n  I certainly believe that whether one has an area that looks like \nthis--and my colleagues said this is not a photograph of the area that \nwould be drilled, but they are completely incorrect. This has been \nmapped. We have exactly where this is on the back of the photograph. It \nis right in the heart of the refuge. We had this picture last year, \nwhich then-Senator Frank Murkowski said was not taken in the refuge \narea. We had the head of Fish and Wildlife in Alaska phone in, irate, \nand essentially\n\n[[Page S3932]]\n\nsay, yes, this is exactly where they want to drill, where the caribou \nare roaming.\n  So let's get that right. I am not going to stand up in front of \npictures that do not apply to make my case. That is ridiculous. I would \nnot do that. That is wrong. It is not a fair way to debate. I want to \ndebate on the merit.\n  I also have never, ever said in this debate--and I spoke last night, \nas well as this morning--that people on the other side are doing this \nbecause they get campaign contributions from oil and gas companies and \nother economic interests. I will not do that. I have more respect than \nthat. But, of course, my colleague from New Mexico says the only reason \nwe are fighting for this is that we get contributions from a few \nenvironmental organizations. Hogwash. I would like to line up the \ncampaign contributions of the environmental organizations versus the \ncampaign contributions of big oil and gas companies.\n  Let's just cut it out. The Senate should be above that. I speak from \nmy heart when I say there is an inconsistency with setting aside this \nbeautiful acreage and then saying, oh, well, now we need to drill.\n  I received a call this morning from former Representative John \nSeiberling. Last night, his picture was held up by Senator Stevens. \nSenator Stevens said there was a deal cut in 1980 to allow oil \ndrilling. Obviously, I was not in that meeting. The fact is I came to \nthe Congress in 1982, so I missed that by 2 years.\n  Representative Seiberling phoned us this morning. He was the chairman \nof the House Subcommittee on Public Lands. He was in that picture, and \nhe said there was no deal to open the Alaska Wildlife Reserve to \nexploration. So I want to state that for the record, just as last night \nI talked about the letter from President Jimmy Carter who said he is \ntotally opposed to this drilling, even though he, too, was referred to \nas being part of this so-called deal.\n  I also want to show a footprint of the New Jersey Turnpike. Now, my \ncolleagues are going to say: Well, Senator Boxer, what does that have \nto do with anything? The fact is, this is the same size footprint that \nthe opposition is saying would be the footprint of the oil field that \nwould be allowed in this refuge.\n  I say to my friends, the way Senator Domenici posed it, he had a \ngreat big chart and a little dot. Well, what goes on when you drill for \noil is not a little dot. That is so obvious; it is kind of silly. If we \neven take the footprint that they talk about, the 2,000 acres, that is \nthe footprint the size of the New Jersey Turnpike, and I say to anyone \nwho has some common sense, no one would say that what happens on the \nNew Jersey Turnpike does not have an impact on the surrounding \ncommunity.\n\n  I also say to my friend, because he opposes me in a lot of areas--\nthis is my friend from New Mexico. I served on the Budget Committee for \nyears. I have tremendous respect for him, but we disagree. I, with just \nas much fervor as he, will say to my colleagues today I want them to \nlook at the footprint for offshore oil drilling off the coast of \nCalifornia. It will look really small if the whole coastline is taken \ninto account, but my people in California know it is destructive. How \ndo we know that? We have seen it. We have seen what happens when oil \nspills. We know that no matter what technology is promised, accidents \noccur. We have certainly experienced that in Alaska given what has \nhappened in the past from spills, and I put that in the Record before.\n  We know the USGS analysis says that oil in the refuge is scattered in \nmany different areas. It would require multiple fields across the \nCoastal Plain, 250 miles of roads, 100 miles of pipeline.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask for 3 additional minutes off the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from North Dakota yield 3 \nminutes?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like 3 additional minutes, if I could, off the \nresolution, or I could take it off the amendment; it is immaterial.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We are now in a situation where we have had very extended \ndebate on ANWR. At some point, we have to draw it to a close.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will take the time from the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That will be fine, if we take it from the amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That will leave 1 minute, and I will reserve that.\n  I say to my friend from North Dakota, the Senator from New Mexico had \nan hour speech and I believe I need to rebut it. We know from USGS we \nare talking 250 miles of roads, 100 miles of pipeline, airfields, \ngravel pits, power lines, waste facilities, and other structures. We \nare talking about this, not coming from the side of those who believe \nthis pristine area ought to be left alone, but from the USGS survey.\n\n  John Seiberling says no deal was cut in 1980; Senator Stevens sees it \na different way. People can take away different meanings. But I mention \nthat in the Record. When we hear President Carter's name as being part \nof a deal, and he writes a letter and says he does not want to see \ndrilling here, we ought to set the record straight.\n  This is a fair debate. But it ought to be based on the facts as the \npeople who were in the room saw it. Senator Stevens laid out how he \nfelt. John Seiberling phoned and left his phone number. I am sure if \nSenator Stevens would like to chat with him, that would be fine with \nhim.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Who should I call?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to answer on your time. May I answer on your \ntime?\n  Mr. STEVENS. You mentioned my name, thank you very much.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am sorry, I have 60 seconds left to rebut an hour-long \ntirade by someone on the other side who said the reason we are \npreserving the Arctic is because we received campaign contributions.\n  I print in the Record the facts, a letter from Jimmy Carter who \nopposes drilling in this area. He talks about it very eloquently.\n  John Seiberling, then-chairman of the House Subcommittee on Public \nLands and National Parks, was in the picture that my friend from Alaska \nheld up last night, and has said absolutely there was no deal cut to \ndrill in this area. It is important we set that record straight.\n  I correct that. He was not in the picture, but in the meetings that \nled to the picture. He was the chairman of the House Subcommittee on \nPublic Lands.\n  Lastly, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy \nof a very important document put together by the Alaska Wilderness \nLeague. In it there are comments of the National Research Counsel on \nthe cumulative environmental effects of oil and gas activities on \nAlaska's North Slope. We keep hearing there is no problem, no problem \nat all, but there are newspaper reports that say the local people who \nlive up there claim there is a problem with the caribou herds. They are \ngoing elsewhere, away from the drilling.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Comments on the National Research Council Report on the Cumulative \nEnvironmental Effects of Oil and Gas Activities on Alaska's North Slope\n\n       Overall: The report documents significant environmental and \n     cultural effects that have accumulated as the result of three \n     decades of oil development on Alaska's North Slope. \n     Industrial activity has transformed what once was part of the \n     largest intact wilderness area in the United States into a \n     complex of oilfields and their interconnecting roads and \n     pipelines that stretches over 1,000 square miles. Many \n     important effects on animals and vegetation extend well \n     beyond the actual ``footprint'' of development. New \n     technologies have reduced some effects, but despite this, the \n     committee concluded that expansion into new areas is certain \n     to exacerbate existing effects and generate new ones.\n       While no economic assessment of the environmental costs of \n     oil development on the North Slope has been done, the report \n     estimates that the costs of removing facilities and restoring \n     habitat will run in the billions of dollars. No money has \n     been set aside for this purpose by either the oil companies \n     or the government. Because natural recovery in the arctic is \n     slow, effects caused by unrestored facilities are likely to \n     persist for centuries.\n\n\n                                animals\n\n       Bowhead whale migrations have been displaced by the intense \n     noise of seismic exploration offshore. Spilled oil poses a \n     great potential threat to bowhead whales due to their \n     specific morphological characteristics.\n       The reproductive success of some bird species in the \n     oilfields has been reduced to the\n\n[[Page S3933]]\n\n     point where some oil-field populations are likely maintained \n     only by immigration from more productive ``source'' habitats \n     elsewhere. An important consequence of this phenomenon is \n     that loss of such ``source'' habitats can threaten the \n     viability of a population even though most of the habitat \n     occupied by the species in a region remains relatively \n     intact. The location of important source habitat for birds or \n     other species is not well characterized for the North Slope. \n     Thus, the spread of industrial development into new areas \n     could result in unexpected species declines, even though \n     total habitat loss might be modest.\n       Some denning polar bears have been disturbed by industrial \n     activities. Though limited development offshore has taken \n     place to date, full scale industrial development offshore \n     would displace polar bears and ringed seals from their \n     habitats, increase mortality, and decrease their reproductive \n     success. Predicted climate change is likely to have \n     serious effects on polar bears and ringed seals that will \n     accumulate with those related to oil development.\n\n                                Caribou\n\n       Although industrial development has not resulted in a long-\n     term decline in the Central Arctic Herd (the herd most \n     affected by current oil development), the Committee concluded \n     that by itself is not a sufficient measure of whether adverse \n     effects have occurred. Female caribou exposed to oilfield \n     activity and infrastructure produced fewer calves, and \n     following years when insect harassment was high, that effect \n     increased, which may have depressed herd size. The spread of \n     industrial activity into other areas that caribou use for \n     calving and relief from insects, especially to the east where \n     the coastal plain is narrower than elsewhere, would likely \n     result in reductions in reproductive success.\n       The Porcupine herd, which calves in the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge, has the lowest growth capacity of the four \n     arctic herds and the least capacity to resist natural and \n     human-caused stress. Higher insect activity associated with \n     climate warming could counteract any benefits of reduced \n     surface development by increasing the frequency with which \n     caribou encounter infrastructure.\n\n\n                       development ``footprint''\n\n       Development has directly affected 17,000 acres spread \n     across an area roughly the size of the land area of Rhode \n     Island. Of this, 9,000 acres are covered by gravel, excluding \n     TAPS, the Haul Road and facilities in NPRA. The environmental \n     effects of oil development are not limited to the \n     ``footprint'' (actual area covered by a structure), but occur \n     at distances that vary depending on the environmental \n     component affected, from a few miles (animals), to much \n     farther (visual effects and seismic effects on whales).\n\n\n                  climate change and new technologies\n\n       Climate change will continue to affect the usefulness of \n     many oilfield technologies and how they affect the \n     environment. For example, the length of the winter season \n     when seismic and other off road tundra travel is permitted, \n     and ice roads and pads are constructed, has been steadily \n     decreasing since the 1970's. The coastline of the North Slope \n     is presently eroding at a rate of 8 feet per year, the \n     fastest rate of coastline erosion in the United States, and \n     this will accelerate with climate change.\n\n\n                               wilderness\n\n       Oil development has compromised wilderness values over \n     1,000 square miles of the North Slope. The potential for \n     further loss is at least as great as what has already \n     occurred as development expands into new areas. Roads, pads, \n     pipelines, seismic vehicle tracks, transmission lines, air, \n     ground and vessel traffic, drilling activities, and other \n     industrial activities and infrastructure have eroded \n     wilderness values over an area that is far larger than the \n     area of direct effects. Most analyses of wilderness effects \n     conducted by the government are cursory, out of date, or \n     both, and none has used new techniques for measuring \n     wilderness values, or attempted to coordinate wilderness \n     assessment or planning among different jurisdictions.\n\n\n                Economic costs of Environmental Effects\n\n       There have been no economic valuation studies of the \n     effects of oil development on the physical biological, or \n     human environment on the North Slope. As a result, the full \n     cost of oil development on Alaska's North Slope has not been \n     assessed, quantified, or incorporated into decisions that \n     affect use of public land. Incorporation of environmental \n     costs into an overall economic assessment of development \n     would alter projections of economically recoverable oil and \n     gas on public land on the North Slope. For example, the U.S. \n     Geological Survey periodically estimates the amount of \n     recoverable oil in various areas of federally owned land on \n     the North Slope. In doing so, the USGS generally projects the \n     amount of oil that is ``economically recoverable'' from these \n     lands given a particular price of oil and given a set of \n     costs associated with development and transportation. By not \n     fully accounting for environmental costs in its projections, \n     the USGS underestimates the cost of development, which in \n     turn inflates the amount of oil considered economically \n     recoverable at a given market price.\n\n\n                                 Spills\n\n       Hundreds of spills occur each year in the oilfields, but to \n     date they have not been large enough or frequent enough for \n     their effects to have accumulated. Offshore, the industry has \n     not demonstrated the ability to clean up more than a small \n     fraction of oil spilled in marine waters, especially when \n     broken ice is present.\n\n\n                             Air pollution\n\n       Not enough information is available to provide a \n     quantitative baseline of spatial and temporal trends in air \n     quality over long periods across the North Slope, and little \n     research has been done to quantify effects. More than 70,000 \n     tons of NOx, are emitted each year by industrial \n     facilities on the North Slope, along with thousands of tons \n     of sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, volatile organic \n     hydrocarbons, and millions of tons of carbon dioxide. Even \n     though air quality meets national ambient air quality \n     standards, it is not clear that those standards are \n     sufficient to protect arctic vegetation.\n\n\n                          Lack of restoration\n\n       Only about 100 acres (1%) of the habitat affected by gravel \n     fill on the North Slope have been restored. The Committee \n     concluded that unless major changes occur, it is unlikely \n     that most disturbed habitat on the North Slope will ever be \n     restored. Because natural recovery in the arctic is slow, \n     effects of unrestored structures are likely to persist for \n     centuries, and will accumulate as new structures are added.\n\n\n                            decision-making\n\n       Decisions about development on the North Slope have \n     generally been made one case at a time, in the absence of a \n     comprehensive plan and regulatory strategy that identifies \n     the scope, intensity, direction, and consequences of \n     industrial activities judged appropriate and desirable. \n     Similarly, the minimal rehabilitation of disturbed habitat \n     has occurred without an overall plan to identify land-use \n     goals, objectives to achieve them, performance criteria, or \n     monitoring requirements. Little consideration has been given \n     to how future trajectories of development would be viewed by \n     different groups, including North Slope residents. In \n     addition, as indicated above, the full cost of oil \n     development on Alaska's North Slope has not been assessed, \n     quantified, or incorporated into decisions that affect use of \n     public land.\n\n\n           winter off-road seismic exploration and ice roads\n\n       The Committee estimates that more than 32,000 miles of \n     seismic trails, receiver trails, and camp-move trails were \n     created between 1990 and 2001, an annual average of 2,900 \n     miles each year. If current trends continue, some 30,000-line \n     miles will be surveyed on the North Slope over the next \n     decade. These trails produce a serious accumulating visual \n     effect and can damage vegetation and cause erosion. Data do \n     not exist to determine the period that the damage will \n     persist, but some effects are known to have lasted for \n     several decades. Seismic exploration is expanding westward \n     into the western arctic and the foothills, where the hilly \n     topography increases the likelihood that vehicles will damage \n     vegetation. The use of ice roads and pads has increased and \n     will continue to do so, but little information is available \n     on how long effects persist.\n\n\n                           regilatory issues\n\n       The report did not evaluate the adequacy of existing \n     regulations. However in the course of the review, a number of \n     issues arose. Examples include the following.\n\n           Protecting the tundra from winter off road travel\n\n       DNR permits tundra travel for seismic camps where there is \n     an average of 6\" of snow and 12\" of frozen soil, which the \n     committee concluded are not based on scientific evidence. The \n     only published study of seismic disturbance in relation to \n     snow cover suggests that disturbance occurs at snow depths of \n     10\"-28\" of snow. In addition, the use of AVERAGE snowpack and \n     frost thickness by regulatory agencies does not take into \n     account differences in snow cover across different land forms \n     or across the slope.\n\n                              Restoration\n\n       Fewer than 1% of Corps permits contain restoration \n     requirements, and those don't generally include specific \n     standards, requirements for long term monitoring, or \n     performance criteria. Only 6 of the 1,179 permits issued by \n     the Corps require the re-use of gravel. The Corps does not \n     have an estimate of the area affected by permits it has \n     issued.\n\n                              Groundwater\n\n       Existing data on groundwater suggests that sub-permafrost \n     groundwater may meet the regulatory definition of a drinking \n     water source more commonly than thought. No testing of \n     groundwater is required prior to waste injection.\n\n                           Water withdrawals\n\n       Water withdrawals from fish-bearing lakes for purposes such \n     as building ice roads and pads are limited to 15% of the \n     estimated minimum winter water volume. The committee cited \n     the lack of data to support this criterion, which it terms \n     arbitrary. For fishless lakes, there were no restrictions on \n     removal of water as of late 2002; all unfrozen water from \n     such lakes can be drained. The effects of such complete \n     withdrawals have not been evaluated.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, it is very important everyone vote. This \nis a close vote. I don't think this should be in a budget resolution. \nIt is very obvious what the proponents of drilling want to do. They \nwant to get this into\n\n[[Page S3934]]\n\nreconciliation so those who have deep, strong feelings will not be able \nto talk at length about it, to stop it. I hope we stop it today.\n  I reserve 1 minute for closing debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, previously I yielded the Senator from \nAlaska 1 hour on the amendment. Is there any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 12 minutes remaining on the \namendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield to the Senator from Alaska not only those 12 \nminutes but also such time as he desires on this resolution. I also \nremind him I told the Senator from Alabama that he would be recognized \nfor a few minutes, as well. I yield to the Senator from Alaska such \ntime as he desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I am delighted to be here when my \nfriend from California mentions my name and someone I should call. I \nassume that would be President Carter. President Carter told the House \nof Representatives not to send him the 1980 bill until after the \nelection. And he waited until after the election, but he did sign it.\n  The item I read last night is from Jimmy Carter's own record, his own \nwords at the time he signed that bill. It is true, since that time he \nhas campaigned against a provision of the bill that he signed.\n  We have an amendment introduced now by the Senator from Connecticut \nto repeal that provision. But that is the first time there has been an \namendment to repeal that provision, primarily because the people who \nwere here then who made the commitment to Alaska are all gone. It is \nsad we have to wait until those people who make commitments to a State \nthat leads to a decision to withdraw over 100 million acres of Alaska \nland, the one decision we got was we would be able to open up \nexploration and development on the Arctic coast if we could show there \nwould be no irreparable harm in that area. That was shown with two \nenvironmental impact statements.\n  Later I will make comments about the impact of the provision of the \nSenator from California with regard to the people of California. I \nspent a good period of time in California. I was raised there and went \nto school there--UCLA. I tell the people of California when their price \nof gasoline goes up, call Senator Boxer. Call her and ask her why she \nopposes oil coming from Alaska as it used to. For over 20 years we sent \noil to California from the same area. Now she refuses to allow us to \ncontinue to explore in the area that her two colleagues, Senator \nJackson and Senator Tsongas, in 1980, said would be open.\n\n  There are pretty flowers all over Alaska in the summertime. I can \nshow the Senator from California a picture of a million acres of golden \nrod waving in the breeze. It is beautiful. But I can also show a \npicture again of the tundra. This is what the area she had a picture of \nlooks like most of the time, the tundra, solid, frozen tundra, and we \ndo this in the wintertime. We do not spoil the flowers. We build ice \nroads across the tundra and drill for oil and gas. It is completed when \nit is still frozen land.\n  We did not disturb the caribou. As a matter of fact, here is a good \nexample. I am sorry the Senator from California has not seen fit to \ncome to Alaska and look at the area she talks about. There is the \ncaribou right near Port McIntyre field. That is where they come. They \ndo not look disturbed to me. I have been up there, and there are so \nmany on the runway we had to wait until they decided to leave because \nthey get first call on the runway.\n  It is time we talk facts. And the fact is, Congress pledged this area \nwould be available for oil and gas exploration. The 1002 area was \nspecifically reserved for oil and gas exploration. It is not \nwilderness. The Senator from California and others insist on coming out \nhere and saying we want to drill in wilderness. That is not true. It \nnever was wilderness from the time it was withdrawn when I was in the \nDepartment of Interior in the 1950s. We specifically allowed oil and \ngas leasing under the Mineral Leasing Act to continue, although the \narea was withdrawn from all other forms of entry under public land \nlaws.\n  As long as the Senator from California mentions whom I should call, \nshe might want to visit with the Eskimos in the Senate gallery. They \nare part of 100,000 Alaska Natives in favor of drilling in this area. I \nintend to spell that out in more detail later.\n  I don't need to call a former President. I know where President \nCarter stands now, but I knew where he was when I saw him signing the \nbill. He signed that bill that contained the section 1002, and he gave \nus the right and approved the offer made by Senator Jackson and Senator \nTsongas to me that if we allowed the million acres to be withdrawn, we \nwould continue to have the right to explore in the Arctic.\n  I yield to my friend, and I reserve the remainder of my time. I will \ntalk right up to the vote and urge Members of the Senate to think about \none thing, and that is the value of the oil in our area of Alaska as \ncompared to the continued dependence upon foreign oil in increasing \namounts in this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for \nhis tremendous leadership on this issue. It is a very important issue \nto America. I salute the Presiding Officer for her leadership on it. It \nis so important.\n  There is no doubt about it; any activity in this area would have \nminimal environmental impact. This is going to be the most closely \nwatched drilling ever to occur in the world, I suppose. It will be \nenvironmentally sound in every possible way, using the newest \ntechnology, as Senator Domenici said. It will be on land where you can \ncontrol things better. It will be a minute footprint in these millions \nof acres of land. It is going to be carefully done.\n  While we are talking about safely drilling in Alaska, today no one I \nknow of is seriously opposing drilling in the Caspian Sea. No one is \nopposing the drilling that goes on in Venezuela. We are drilling off \nthe coast of Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi, and in the Gulf of \nMexico right now, producing oil and gas in a much more high-risk \nenvironment than this would ever be. So this is an unbelievable \nargument to me. It goes against all logic.\n  This is a minute environmental impact, I suggest. But it represents, \nwithout doubt in my mind, the greatest economic growth potential of \nanything in the President's package or anything we are dealing with on \nthe floor right now. This is an important growth issue for America. The \nreason is, we are talking about new wealth to America.\n  Every day, if we do not buy the oil that comes from this region, we \nwill be sending our money to Venezuela and Saudi Arabia and Iraq and \nwhatever other OPEC nation we would be sending it to--a direct sucking \nsound of American wealth going to foreign nations.\n  We have had various studies. One said 735,000 jobs would be produced. \nAnother one has come in at 575,000 jobs that would be created.\n  I want to make one point. These are going to be critical jobs, high-\npaying jobs in drilling--environmental engineers, pump manufacturing, \nshipping, transportation, rail, airlines are going to be active, \nsteelworkers, teamsters, and that kind of thing, high-paying jobs. \nMoney will be paid to them out of the money that we would have \notherwise sent outside of this country for foreign oil that would not \nhave been paid to American workers. High paid salaries to American \nworkers--it will be missed by us.\n  So I would say this is big. I will just briefly make this point. How \nbig is it? If we had 575,000 jobs, and they are making higher wages, if \nthey are a spouse who is working, they may be paying more than the \nfigure I would float out, but I suggest these jobs will result in IRS \npayments to Uncle Sam, Uncle Sugar, of probably $10,000 per job.\n  You add that up, 575,000 jobs at $10,000 to the tax man of the United \nStates, that turns out to $5.75 billion a year to the Treasury of the \nUnited States. Over 10 years that is almost $50 billion.\n  Are we going to pay this to the ``stans,'' to Russia, Venezuela, \nMexico, Iraq, Kuwait, those countries? That is who is getting it now \nand will be getting it in the future. It is really a tremendous amount.\n\n[[Page S3935]]\n\n  This does not count the royalties that will be paid by the drilling \ncompanies to the United States. They will be paying $10 to $20 billion \nover the life of this activity.\n  We have also not forgotten, I hope, that the drilling here, under the \nlegislation as proposed, will result in the payment of $2.5 billion to \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund for conservation programs in \nAmerica. I have absolutely no doubt--I know the Presiding Officer \nshares this--that $2.5 billion will do more environmental good \nthroughout the entire United States than this 2,500-acre footprint of \ndrilling would cause damage in this vast ANWR region of Alaska.\n  I really believe this is a tremendously important economic issue for \nAmerica. It is jobs, jobs, jobs. Those of us who are wrestling with a \nbudget in this country that shows declining revenues, it will guarantee \nincreased tax revenues to the United States. We must not allow \nexaggerated fears to pull us back from this important issue.\n  It is great to be with the Senator from Alaska, and know he knows \nthis issue so well. I appreciate his leadership. Yes, it is good for \nAlaska, but it is good for America. We thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 274\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I know the Senator from South Carolina \nhas a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. Let me just say I regret that \nbecause we have done our level best to stop the practice of offering \nsense-of-the-Senate amendments on the budget resolution. We have \nestablished a point of order against them to try to discourage sense-\nof-the-Senate amendments. And we have been so far, until this moment, \nsuccessful on both sides. I just say to my colleagues, if we start down \nthis path, we will be right back to where we were in the past. We are \ngoing to be right back to vote-arama. We are going to be right back to \na circumstance in which, when all time has expired, we are going to \nface 30 or 40 or 50 votes and nobody is going to have a chance to \nexplain them. We are going to have Senators, hour after hour after \nhour, marching down into the well of the Senate to cast votes on issues \nthey have not even had a chance to debate or had a chance to discuss.\n  I regret very much the sense-of-the-Senate amendment has been put in \nthis queue. I say to my colleagues on the other side, if we start down \nthis path, the same thing is going to happen over here.\n  Let me say, it is not the fault of the Senator from South Carolina. \nHe has offered an amendment in good faith. We respect that Senator. But \nthe point is a larger question of how we proceed on a budget \nresolution. Both sides have worked very hard to prevent vote-arama.\n  We are right now rushing toward that result. I hope everybody thinks \nvery carefully now about the decisions we are making because we are \ngoing to reap the whirlwind.\n  Let me just say this to my colleagues. There is an alternative. The \nSenator from South Carolina has gotten in the queue. I hope we can work \nout an agreement on his amendment. I understand staffs on both sides \nare working on that. If we do not draw the line here, it is Katie bar \nthe door. And we should all understand that.\n  No. 2, I hope after the Senator from South Carolina has a reasonable \ntime to discuss his amendment, hopefully during that period our staffs \ncan work together and we can reach an accommodation and agreement so \nthe amendment of the Senator can be adopted without a vote. I urge that \ncourse on my colleagues on the other side.\n  Next, that we then move to a debate on another amendment with the \nability to come back and finish off on ANWR before the vote that is now \nscheduled at 3 o'clock. I just hope we all think very carefully, now, \nin these minutes, before we head down this path, of where it leads. At \nthe same time, on both sides, we discussed trying to reach an agreement \non a set number of amendments, those to be debated and those to be in \nvote-arama.\n  On our side we are calling a caucus to discuss that very question. I \nhope the other side--I have already talked to Senator Nickles about \nit--will give it close consideration as well, so we avoid this \nspectacle of vote-arama. But right now colleagues should understand we \nare headed for the vote-arama of all time, and it will not reflect well \non the body, and it probably will not lead to the best results.\n  With that, I yield the floor and, again, hope my colleagues consider \nthese options.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, while the Senator from North Dakota is \nhere, I would like to see if there could be an agreement. I understand \nwe are going off this amendment to delete the ANWR provision in this \nbudget resolution for a little while. I wonder if it would be possible \nif we could ask unanimous consent that we return to this amendment at 2 \no'clock--the vote will be at 3--and the time between 2 and 3 o'clock be \nequally divided between the two sides.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would certainly be open to that. I would want the \nopinion of the manager and chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I have no objection to that. This is a very important \namendment. It is one of the reasons why I encouraged our colleagues to \nbring it up. I knew it was going to take some time. I have no objection \nto that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We have no objection on this side.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do offer that unanimous consent request. I point out, \nI could speak from now until 3 o'clock, if the Senate would like to do \nthat, but I think it is best we go ahead as the leader requests we do. \nI renew my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Madam President, I have a housekeeping \nchore. I would like to submit to the clerk a modification to my \namendment and ask unanimous consent that the amendment be modified.\n  No modification is needed, I am told. Thank you.\n  Madam President, Social Security is not only hard to solve, it is \nalso hard to get before the Senate. So I apologize for the confusion.\n  I understand the concern of my colleague from North Dakota. But \nhaving a bit of time to talk about Social Security I think is very \nappropriate.\n  The budget resolution process is a roadmap to make sure we can \nunderstand what we are doing as the year progresses in terms of \nspending and taxes and what provisions to take up and when. I applaud \nboth the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from Oklahoma for \nworking together to try to make this as painless on the body as \npossible. But this amendment, hopefully, can be accepted in some form, \neither voted on or accepted by the body.\n  If you are going to have a roadmap for America this year or any other \nyear, it is time we start putting Social Security on that roadmap. \nSocial Security is a system that Democrats and Republicans embrace as \nbeing vital to the Nation. It is a system that working Americans pay \ninto every year. Millions of Americans receive a substantial part, if \nnot all, of their retirement income from Social Security, after years \nof paying into the system.\n\n  This amendment is part of this roadmap for America that we are \ntalking about. It lays out some findings and some facts that are not \nRepublican spin, not Democratic spin, but come from the Social Security \ntrustees themselves, the people in charge of telling us, in managing \nthe program--``us'' being the House and the Senate--the state of \naffairs with Social Security.\n  We are on the verge of a war. Only God knows what will happen here \nshortly. But it is my belief, unless there is some major miracle, we \nwill be involved in hostilities with young men and women in harm's way \nprotecting our freedom. I know one thing every Member of the body can \nagree on is that these young men and women deserve our support and our \nprayers if ordered into battle. And they will get that support and \nthose prayers in a bipartisan way because what they are doing is very \nnoble, in my opinion, trying to preserve our freedom and bringing about \nmore stability in the Mideast.\n\n[[Page S3936]]\n\n  We can argue about the nuances of the diplomacy and lack thereof in \nsome people's opinion that got us to being on the brink of war, but \nonce hostilities begin, I am sure everybody will come together and say \na prayer for our troops and support our President the best they can.\n  That same dynamic needs to exist with Social Security, because there \nis a big, gaping hole in America's domestic agenda. You can talk about \nthe size of the tax cuts, whether we should have one, whether it should \nbe $750 billion or $350 billion or 30 cents or $2 trillion. Whatever \nopinion you have, I respect, and I have my own about that; and that is \na point of debate.\n  One thing we need to understand and come together on quickly, in my \nopinion, is certain facts surrounding Social Security.\n  In 75 years--I know that seems forever. But my predecessor, Senator \nThurmond, turned 100 a few months ago. He is going to be a first-time \ngrandfather. Our State's former junior Senator, now senior Senator, is \n81. So in South Carolina, 75 years is not long in politics. It seems \nforever, but it is not, really.\n  In 75 years, our trustees, the people in charge of the Social \nSecurity trust fund, tell us we will be $25.3 trillion short of the \nmoney necessary to pay benefits. I want to repeat that. I know there \nare a lot of important votes to come on ANWR and tax cuts, and this \nroadmap is about this year; and we are trying get through this day to \nmake sure we can get on with the business of the Senate. And that is \nthe way politics is, probably to a fault sometimes: getting through \nthis day, getting through this amendment, so we can get on with the \nnext event of the next day. We are in the middle of an international \ncrisis, and our hope is we can get through the coming days as quickly \nas possible and resolve it.\n  Time is not on our side in solving Social Security structural \nproblems. You could say: Well, 75 years is a long time. But between now \nand 75 years from now, for the obligations of the trust fund, and the \nmoney to pay those obligations, there will be a $25 trillion gap. And I \nask, simply, the following question: Where does the money come from?\n  People want to know how much the war is going to cost--and the \noccupation. The truth is, it is going to be billions of dollars over \nseveral years. As we try to find out where the money comes from to get \nus through this day and this year, I hope we will start focusing on, in \na bipartisan fashion, where does the money come from to keep Social \nSecurity solvent?\n\n  Seventy-five years from now, if nothing changes--if all we do is run \nads against each other and belittle opportunities to fix it in a \npartisan way; if the Democratic and the Republican parties stay on \ntrack, based on the last campaign cycle, of trying to use the Social \nSecurity issue as a way to capture power for the moment--then we are \ngoing to allow one of the best programs in the history of the Nation \nnot only to become insolvent but create a financial crisis in this \ncountry that we have not experienced, ever.\n  Another date I would like to point out: In 2042, which seems forever, \nbut it is not, a problem occurs with Social Security. Seventy-five \nyears from now, the unfunded liability in obligation will be $25.3 \ntrillion. But before you get to that point in time, the next major \nevent, according to the trustee report released yesterday, is 2042.\n  What happens in 2042? In 2042, the amount of money available to pay \nbenefits will be such that benefits will be reduced for the average \nrecipient by 28 percent. I want to say that again. If we do nothing \ndifferent, if we just collect the same amount of money, and get the \nsame growth rates, in 2042 you are going to reduce benefits for \neverybody on Social Security by 28 percent. The other option is, \naccording to the trustees, raise payroll taxes of the workforce in \nexistence then by 50 percent. These are two very dramatic and \nunacceptable options, in my opinion.\n  Now, in 2042, I doubt if I will be here. But if the history of my \nState stands the test of time, I will be here because I will turn 100 \nin 2055. If I can do what my predecessor has done, which I very \nseriously doubt, I will have another term left. I doubt if that will \nhappen in my case, but somebody is going to be here in 2042 from South \nCarolina and every other State represented here today.\n\n  My hope is that during my time in the Senate, I can join with my \ncolleagues of like mind on both sides of the aisle to make life a \nlittle better for the American public, the taxpayer, and those who will \nbe doing the job we are engaged in today a little better than the \ntrustees tell us of what is going to happen in 2042.\n  I would like to recognize certain Members of this body: Senator \nGregg, Senator Breaux, and many others, Senator Moynihan, a former \nMember of the Senate, who have brought ideas to the table, have worked \nin a bipartisan manner, along with President Bush. I compliment \nPresident Clinton for putting the issue of Social Security on the \ntable. I didn't particularly like his solution to better growth rates, \nbut he acknowledged that growth rates were a problem. So there is the \nfoundation being laid in the last couple years to do something \nconstructive.\n  I compliment everybody in this body who has been part of that \nprocess. As a Member of the House for four terms, I tried to be a \nconstructive Member dealing with Social Security over there.\n  The temptation to achieve political power is great when the Senate \nand the House are so closely divided. Every issue is looked upon as the \nissue that can get you back in the majority or the issue that may cost \nyou the majority. My concern is that if we have that approach to \nreforming and solving Social Security--I know the Senator from North \nDakota who is managing the minority side of the bill is a fine Member \nwho loves his country as much as I do--if we keep this partisan \natmosphere going that has existed in the past and has been bipartisan \nin the demagoguery, we will run into a problem. So in 2042, I would \nlike us to avoid what is coming our way. The only way to do is to start \nnow.\n  Another date the Social Security trustees tell us is a very important \ndate is 2018. I have gone from 75 years now to 2042 to 2018. What \nhappens in 2018? In 2018, for the first time in the history of the \nprogram, we will pay more in benefits than we collect in taxes. What is \ngoing on here? There are a lot of young folks working in the Senate--\npages, interns. We are really talking about their future more than \nanything else.\n  In 2018, we pay out more in benefits than we collect in taxes. What \nis wrong with Social Security? Why is it mounting up this unfunded \nobligation? Why are we beginning to pay more in benefits than we \ncollect in taxes? Why do we have to cut benefits in 2042, and why are \nwe $25 trillion short in the money to pay everybody 75 years from now?\n  Well, it is not a Republican or a Democratic problem in terms of \npolitics. It is just the way the country has changed. I was born in \n1955. In 1950, a few years before I was born, there were 16.5 workers \nto every retiree. According to the trustees, in 1950, there were 16.5 \npeople working paying Social Security taxes for every retiree. Today \nthere are 3.3 workers to every retiree. Twenty years from now, there \nare going to be two workers for every retiree. That is not a Republican \nproblem. It is not a Democratic caused problem. That is not because we \ncan't get along up here. That is because the ratios have changed. There \nis no reason to believe they will go back the other way.\n  My father and mother are deceased now, but I think in my mother's \nfamily there were nine members of her family, and my father had eight. \nI am not married. I don't have any kids. My sister has one. I sort of \nreflect what is going on in the world. I hope to help solve the problem \nlater down the road. If I do what Senator Thurmond has done, 23 years \nfrom now, I would have my first child. I doubt if that will happen, \neither.\n  But as we kind of mark these points in time and make it personal, the \nproblem is that the demographic changes in America have put Social \nSecurity at risk. It is nobody's fault, but it is everyone's problem. \nYou cannot keep the program solvent when the ratio has gone from 16.5 \nworkers to 1 in 1950 to 20 years from now being 2 to 1. There is just \nnot enough money coming into the system.\n  Now, when you talk about Social Security spending and what to do and \nthe idea that we are spending Social Security surpluses to run the \nGovernment,\n\n[[Page S3937]]\n\nyou get everybody upset. And they should be. I came to the House in \n1995. One of the first things we tried to do was isolate Social \nSecurity money surpluses and make sure we did not use the Social \nSecurity dollars paid into the system to run the Government. That has \nbeen a practice that has been going on for 30 or 40 years. Both parties \nhave engaged in that practice.\n  Every year we collect more in Social Security taxes than we pay in \nbenefits. That extra money is called surplus. We have borrowed that \nextra cash, given the trust fund IOUs that have to be redeemed in the \nfuture. That has allowed us to grow this Government without a direct \ntax on people.\n  That is a bad practice. It is not good government. It is not good \nbusiness. For several years we have been able to avoid doing that in a \nbipartisan way.\n  You remember in the last debate there was the lockbox. Let's put \neverything related to Social Security in this lockbox. In my last \ncampaign for the Senate, I constantly heard it: If you just left Social \nSecurity money alone and you didn't take it out to run the Government, \nif you kept it in a lockbox and left it alone, most of these problems \nwould go away.\n  That is not true. As much as you would like to believe that, that is \nnot true. If you took every penny collected from Social Security and \nyou dedicated it totally to the trust fund and totally to the benefits \nto be paid, you are still $25 trillion short in 75 years. It still runs \nout of money in 2042. The problem is that two workers paying into the \nsystem will not be able to support the massive number of baby boomers \ncoming into the system.\n  Having said that, I would like to work with my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to do a better job of protecting Social Security. I \ndon't believe there is any party that has been in power for the last 40 \nyears that could look the American public in the eye and say that they \nhave not been guilty of using the surpluses in some fashion for other \nthan Social Security.\n  In September of last year, I wrote a letter to the Social Security \nAdministration asking 17 questions. Here is one of the questions I \nasked: Some have proposed a Social Security lockbox; would a lockbox, \nby itself, extend the solvency of Social Security beyond the year \nSocial Security is expected to become insolvent? In a nutshell they \nsaid, the implementation of a Social Security lockbox would not alter \nthis commitment and thus would have no direct effect on the future \nsolvency of Social Security.\n  Having said that, I do believe we should isolate Social Security \ndollars and dedicate those dollars to the payment of Social Security \ntrust fund obligations. That is just good government. But please do not \ntell your constituents back home that will fix this problem because it \nmost certainly will not.\n  After having heard my rendition, there is probably not much good news \nyou have heard yet. The good news: there is a way, in my opinion, to \nmake up the $25 trillion shortfall over 75 years, to change the fact \nthat you will have to reduce benefits by 2042 by 28 percent--that is \nall the money you will have to pay benefits by then--and to even change \nthe dynamic of paying more out in benefits than you collect in taxes by \n2018.\n  The good news--just like everything else in Washington, there is a \nbad news/good news part of what I am about to say--is that the growth \nrates for Social Security, the amount of return you get on your FICA \ntax dollars or Social Security tax dollars taken out of your paycheck \nfor younger workers, people born in the 1980s, it is less than 2 \npercent. If you happen to be a minority in this country, born in the \n1980s, it is less than 1 percent.\n  Let me say that again. This is not Lindsey Graham saying that. The \nSocial Security trustees have reported back to me in this letter.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  Social Security,\n\n\n                                  Office of the Chief Actuary,\n\n                                Baltimore, MD, September 26, 2002.\n     Hon. Lindsey O. Graham,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Graham: Thank you very much for the opportunity to \n     answer the questions you have posed in your letter of \n     September 6, 2002. The answers below are based on the \n     intermediate assumptions and projections presented in the \n     2002 Annual Social Security Trustees Report and estimates \n     that we have provided for a number of reform proposals over \n     the past several years.\n       Many of the questions that you raise are very complex and \n     the answers are subject to considerable uncertainty and even \n     debate. I am providing brief answers reflecting my \n     understanding of these issues based largely on the work done \n     in the Office of the Chief Actuary for the Trustees, the \n     Administration, and the Congress. I hope these responses will \n     be helpful. I look forward to working with you, and Aleix \n     Jarvis and Jessica Efird of your staff in the effort to \n     develop proposals to reform Social Security and restore long-\n     term solvency for the program.\n       (1) Based on the Social Security Administration's \n     projections, in what year does Social Security begin to pay \n     more out than it takes in?\n       Answer. Under the current intermediate assumptions of the \n     2002 Annual Report of the Social Security Board of Trustees \n     to the Congress, and assuming that current law is not \n     changed, we project that annual cash flow for the Social \n     Security program will remain positive through 2016 and will \n     turn negative for calendar year 2017 and later. Annual cash \n     flow is defined here as the excess of income (excluding \n     interest) over expenditures.\n       (2) Based on the Social Security Administration's \n     projections, in what year is Social Security expected to \n     become insolvent?\n       Answer. Under the intermediate assumptions, full benefits \n     would continue to be payable after 2016 and part of the way \n     through 2041 by augmenting current revenue from taxes with \n     revenue from redeeming special United States Treasury \n     obligations held by the Trust Funds. During 2041, the \n     theoretical combined Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) \n     and Disability Insurance (DI) Trust Funds are projected to \n     become exhausted and full scheduled benefits would no longer \n     be payable on a timely basis. This condition is referred to \n     as insolvency of the Trust Funds, because available tax \n     revenue would then be sufficient to cover only about 73 \n     percent of the cost of scheduled benefits. In fact, the OASI \n     and DI Trust Funds operate separately and the projected dates \n     of insolvency are 2043 for the OASI Trust Fund and 2028 for \n     the DI Trust Fund. For simplicity of analysis, the date for \n     theoretical combined Trust Funds is usually considered.\n       (3) Assuming current growth rates remain the same would \n     benefits have to be reduced or taxes increased to keep Social \n     Security from insolvency? If so, how much?\n       Answer. The intermediate assumptions for the Annual \n     Trustees Reports reflect the Trustees, best judgment about \n     the continuation of current trends in demographic and \n     economic variables like birth rates, death rates, average \n     wage increases and price increases. Assuming the intermediate \n     assumptions of the 2002 Trustees Report are realized, Social \n     Security will require either a reduction in benefit levels or \n     an increase in revenue starting in 2041 for the combined \n     OASDI program (and in 2043 for the OASI program and 2028 for \n     the DI program). If benefits were reduced to meet the \n     shortfall in revenue for the combined program, the reduction \n     would need to be 27 percent starting with the exhaustion of \n     the Trust Fund in 2041 and would rise to 34 percent for 2076. \n     Alternatively, if additional revenue were provided beginning \n     in 2041, revenue equivalent to a payroll tax rate increase of \n     about 3.3 percent (from 12.4 percent under current law to \n     about 15.7 percent) would be needed for the year. The \n     additional revenue needed for 2042 would be equivalent to a \n     payroll tax rate increase of about 4.5 percent. Thereafter \n     the amount of additional revenue needed would gradually rise, \n     reaching an amount equivalent to an increase in the payroll \n     tax rate of about 6.4 percent for 2076. There is, of course, \n     a great variety of ways in which benefits could be reduced or \n     revenue increased for the Social Security program. Many \n     different combinations of provisions to reduce benefits and/\n     or provide increased revenue from taxes could be developed to \n     avoid insolvency of the OASDI Trust Funds throughout the 75-\n     year projection period, and beyond.\n       (4) If Social Security surpluses were not diverted from the \n     general budget, how would that affect the system? Would it \n     avert a future insolvency?\n       Answer. I assume you are referring to the fact that for \n     most years in which Social Security has taken in more tax \n     revenue than it has paid out in benefits and other expenses, \n     the rest of the Federal budget has operated in deficit. In \n     these years, the Social Security tax revenue not currently \n     needed for benefit payments has, by law, been invested in \n     securities backed by the full faith and credit of the United \n     States Government. In practice, this revenue has been \n     invested in special issue United States Treasury securities. \n     These securities represent a commitment to redeem these \n     investments, with interest at the market rate, when the \n     Social Security Trust Funds are in need of revenue. Such \n     commitments to the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds \n     have always been met in the past and should be expected to be \n     met in the future regardless of the fiscal operations of the \n     rest of the Federal Government. Therefore, the trust funds \n     are in no way compromised in their role of maintaining \n     solvency as a result of being invested in special Treasury \n     securities. However, redemption of these Treasury securities \n     held\n\n[[Page S3938]]\n\n     by the Trust Funds does require the Treasury to allocate \n     General Revenue for this purpose, and this allocation must be \n     met by increasing taxes, reducing other federal spending, or \n     increasing borrowing from the public.\n       (5) Some have proposed a Social Security ``lock box.'' \n     Would a ``lock box'' by itself extend the solvency of Social \n     Security beyond the year Social Security is expected to \n     become insolvent?\n       Answer. As suggested above, the Social Security Trust Fund \n     investments represent commitments of the United States \n     Treasury that should be expected to be met when the Trust \n     Funds need to redeem these investments. The implementation of \n     a Social Security ``lock box'' would not alter this \n     commitment and thus would have no direct effect on the future \n     solvency of Social Security.\n       However, if the effect of a ``lock box'' were to require \n     that the non-Social-Security Federal budget be in balance or \n     surplus for the years in which Social Security makes \n     investments, then the amount of borrowing from the public \n     might be reduced. In this case the difficulty of generating \n     General Revenue for the redemption of Trust Fund investments \n     in the future would likely be diminished.\n       (6) How many South Carolinians do you project will be \n     receiving Social Security benefits when the program becomes \n     insolvent? How many South Carolinians currently receive \n     benefits?\n       Answer: In December of 2001, about 704 thousand South \n     Carolinians were receiving Social Security benefits. This \n     represented about 1.5 percent of all Social Security \n     beneficiaries at that time. If this percentage remains the \n     same in 2041, when the combined Social Security Trust Funds \n     are projected to become exhausted, we estimate that about 1.4 \n     million South Carolinians will be receiving Social Security \n     benefits at that time.\n       (7) What is the ratio of workers per retiree when the \n     program began, in 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, today, \n     2010, 2020, 2030, 2040?\n       Answer: The table below provides the historical and \n     projected numbers of Social Security covered workers and \n     beneficiaries. Ratios of covered workers to beneficiaries are \n     shown both where beneficiaries include all beneficiaries and \n     where beneficiaries are limited to retired workers. The \n     number of beneficiaries was extremely small in 1940, the \n     first year that monthly benefits were payable, because only \n     workers with some work in 1937 through 1939 could qualify. \n     This resulted in a very high ratio of covered workers to \n     beneficiaries at the start of the program, which required \n     several decades to mature.\n\n                  SOCIAL SECURITY (OASDI) COVERED WORKERS, BENEFICIARIES, AND RATIOS--1940-2080\n                                                 [In thousands]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Beneficiaries           Ratio of Covered Workers\n                                                      ---------------------------------           to--\n                                                                                       -------------------------\n                                                        Covered    Retired     Total                    All\n                                                        workers    workers               Retirees  beneficiaries\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1940.................................................     35,390        112        222      316.0        159.4\n1950.................................................     48,280      1,771      2,930       27.3         16.5\n1960.................................................     72,530      8,061     14,262        9.0          5.1\n1970.................................................     93,090     13,349     25,186        7.0          3.7\n1980.................................................    113,649     19,564     35,118        5.8          3.2\n1990.................................................    133,672     24,841     39,470        5.4          3.4\n2002.................................................    152,461     29,123     46,239        5.2          3.3\n2010.................................................    165,443     34,126     52,865        4.8          3.1\n2020.................................................    172,848     48,324     68,699        3.6          2.5\n2030.................................................    178,131     61,740     84,070        2.9          2.1\n2040.................................................    184,433     66,895     90,068        2.8          2.0\n2050.................................................    189,845     69,692     94,109        2.7          2.0\n2060.................................................    194,568     74,937    100,177        2.6          1.9\n2070.................................................    198,687     80,635    106,723        2.5          1.9\n2080.................................................    202,238     85,939    112,895        2.4          1.8\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Projections are based on the intermediate assumptions of the 2002 Trustees Report.\n\n       (8) What is the sum of the total cash shortfalls that \n     social security is projected to experience from now through \n     2075, from 2025-2050, and from 2050-2075? (in constant and in \n     present-value dollars)?\n       Answer. Combining financial values over substantial periods \n     of time is generally done taking into account the ``time \n     value of money''. This is accomplished by accumulating or \n     discounting the separate annual values with interest to a \n     common date. Values combined in this way are referred to as \n     present values as of the date to which they are accumulated \n     or discounted.\n       In present-value dollars (discounted at the OASDI Trust \n     Fund interest rate to January 1, 2002) the total net OASDI \n     cash flow for years 2002 through 2076 is projected to be \n     nearly -$4.6 trillion. When the Trust Fund balances of over \n     $1.2 trillion at the beginning of 2002 are added to this \n     value, we get a financial shortfall (or unfunded obligation) \n     for the 75-year period of $3.3 trillion. This unfunded \n     obligation indicates that if an additional $3.3 trillion had \n     been added to the Trust Funds at the beginning of 2002, the \n     program would have had adequate financing to meet the \n     projected cost of benefits scheduled in current law over the \n     next 75 years. It should be noted that if the dollar amount \n     of this unfunded obligation is accumulated with interest to \n     the end of 2076, and then expressed in constant (CPI-indexed) \n     2002 dollars we get $33 trillion.\n       The present-value net cash-flow of almost -$4.6 trillion \n     for the p0eriod 2002 through 2076 can be separated into the \n     three 25-year sub-periods:+$0.4 trillion for the period 2002 \n     through 2026, -$2.7 trillion for the period 2027 through \n     2051, and -$2.3 trillion for the period 2052 through 2076. If \n     only years of negative cash flow are included then the value \n     for the first 25-year sub-period is -$0.5 trillion and the \n     total for the 72-year period is -$5.5 trillion.\n       Summing constant 2002-dollar values from several different \n     years is equivalent to taking their present value and \n     assuming that the operative real interest rate is zero. This \n     may result in values that are difficult to interpret. \n     Constant-dollar values are generally used for comparing \n     separate values over time rather than for combining them. A \n     comparison of constant-dollar values for a series covering \n     many years is helpful in illustrating the extent of real \n     growth in the series over time. There is no meaningful \n     interpretation of the result from summing constant dollar \n     values from many different years.\n       Expressing the combined values discussed above in terms of \n     simple sums of constant 2002 dollars (CPI discounted dollars) \n     results in quite different results from present value because \n     much greater weight is placed on more distant future years \n     than would be indicated by current market interest rates. \n     Using this approach produces constant-dollar cash-flow sums \n     of +$0.1 trillion for 2002 through 2026, -$8.6 trillion for \n     2027 through 2051, -$15.3 trillion for 2052 through 2076, and \n     -$23.8 trillion for the entire 75-year period. The sum for \n     the first 25-year period with only negative values included \n     is -$1.1 trillion. The sum for the 75-year period including \n     only negative annual values is -$24.9 trillion.\n       (9) As a demographic group, do African-American males \n     receive the same proportional return from the retirement \n     portion of Social Security as other demographic groups?\n       Answer. Due to the nature of the Social Security program it \n     is difficult to look at retirement benefits in isolation. The \n     payroll tax rate is specified in two components, one for \n     retirement and survivor benefits and the other for disability \n     benefits. In addition, a significant portion of the benefits \n     payable from the retirement and survivor tax, for years \n     after reaching normal retirement age (NRA), is actually \n     attributable to the fact that many become eligible for \n     disability benefits before reaching retirement age. \n     However, there are some observations that we can make.\n       To understand the tradeoffs, first consider the comparison \n     of returns on retirement and survivors taxes for men and \n     women. Men tend to die younger and have higher career-average \n     earnings than women. These factors tend to make the return on \n     contributions for retired worker benefits alone lower for men \n     than for women. However, most men marry, and many have \n     spouses with lower career earnings who receive spouse or \n     widow benefits based on the earnings and contributions of \n     their husbands. This tends to raise the relative return for \n     contributions made by men. Finally, men have higher \n     disability rates than women and thus are more likely to have \n     a shortened career, lessening their lifetime payroll tax \n     contributions without materially affecting their monthly \n     benefit level when retirement and survivors benefits become \n     payable. Thus, with all these factors taken into account it \n     is less clear whether men get a lower return on their \n     retirement and survivor taxes than do women.\n       For African-American males the situation is even less \n     clear. Life expectancy for African-American males is lower \n     than for white males. But average career earnings are also \n     lower. These factors have at least partly offsetting effects. \n     Because African-American males have higher death rates, they \n     are also more likely to leave a widow beneficiary if married. \n     Importantly, African-American males are also more likely to \n     become disabled than are white males.\n       Some recent studies have suggested that African-American \n     males get a lower return from Social Security retirement \n     benefits. But these studies have not sorted out many of the \n     complicating factors mentioned above. In particular, many of \n     these studies consider actual case histories of individuals \n     who work successfully without becoming disabled up to \n     retirement. For such individuals, life expectancy at \n     retirement is clearly greater than for those who have been \n     disabled prior to that time, but these studies use overall \n     population death rates. Because African-American males are \n     relatively more likely to become disabled, this distortion of \n     overstating death rates for those who do not become disabled \n     is relatively large for them. This is a significant \n     shortcoming that causes a disproportionately large \n     understatement in retirement returns for African-American \n     males. We are working on a more complete model that we hope \n     will address these concerns and will inform you of our \n     progress in the future. But for now, the evidence on this \n     question appears to be inconclusive.\n       (10) What is the average current return on investment for \n     FICA tax contributions for someone born before and after \n     1948?\n       Answer. Actuarial Note Number 144 ``Internal Real Rates of \n     Return Under the OASDI Program for Hypothetical Workers'' \n     authored by Orlo Nichols, Michael Clingman, and Milton Glanz \n     in June 2001 addressed this issue. This note provides \n     extensive estimates of real internal rates of return for a \n     wide variety of cases.\n       The most representative of these hypothetical cases \n     presented may be the married couple with a husband and a \n     wife, each having medium career earnings. For this case, \n     assuming a realistic earnings scale through the working \n     lifetime, the real internal rate of return was computed to be \n     3.50 percent for those born in 1920, declining to 2.33 \n     percent for those born in 1943. Assuming that present-law \n     scheduled benefits would be payable in the future with no \n     change in the payroll tax rate, this real rate of return \n     is projected to decline gradually, reaching 2.20 percent \n     for those born in 1964, and then rising\n\n[[Page S3939]]\n\n     gradually as life expectancy rises. However, the current \n     payroll-tax rate is projected to be inadequate to finance \n     scheduled benefits in the long run. Under the hypothetical \n     assumption that payroll tax rates would be increased as \n     needed to finance scheduled benefits in the future, future \n     real rates are return are projected to decline more \n     rapidly, reaching 1.95 percent for those born in 1985 and \n     1.63 percent for those born in 2004.\n       In general, real rates of return are higher for married \n     couples with one earner and for workers with low earnings. \n     Rates are generally lower for single workers and for high \n     earners.\n       (11) Have policy proposals been introduced that keep Social \n     Security from insolvency, allow for personal accounts, and do \n     not change benefits for those already receiving Social \n     Security benefits?\n       Answer. Absolutely. A number of Congressional proposals \n     would accomplish these goals. At a hearing before the House \n     Ways and Means Committee in June 1999, ten plans were \n     presented by Congressional sponsors. The sponsors of these \n     plans were, Archer/Shaw, Kolbe/Stenholm, Nadler, Moynihan/\n     BKerrey, Gregg/Breaux, PGramm, NSmith, Stark, MSanford, and \n     DeFazio. We estimated that all ten of these proposals would \n     restore solvency for the Social Security program for at least \n     the full 75-year projection period. None of these proposals \n     would reduce benefits for current beneficiaries, but three of \n     them would slow growth in benefits for current recipients by \n     reducing the size of the automatic cost-of-living adjustment \n     (COLA) either directly, or indirectly (through modifying the \n     CPI). Seven of these proposals provided for individual \n     accounts on a voluntary or mandatory basis.\n       Since 1999 additional proposals have been developed that \n     would meet these criteria, including the Armey/DeMint plan \n     and Models 2 and 3 of the President's Commission to \n     Strengthen Social Security.\n       (12) Have there been any proposals introduced that would \n     create personal accounts, avert a future insolvency of Social \n     Security, without reducing benefits or increasing taxes? Have \n     there been any proposals without personal accounts introduced \n     that would avert a future insolvency of Social Security \n     without reducing benefits or increasing taxes?\n       Answer. The financial shortfalls projected for the Social \n     Security program can only be eliminated by reducing the \n     growth in benefit levels from what is scheduled in current \n     law, or by increasing revenue to the program. In the long-\n     run, additional revenue can be generated by expanding the \n     amount of advance funding either in individual accounts or in \n     the Social Security Trust Funds. All of the proposals \n     mentioned above pursue this approach to some degree. However, \n     creating additional advance funding requires additional \n     revenue for a period of time. This additional revenue may be \n     generated by (1) reducing Social Security benefits paid from \n     the Trust Funds, (2) directly increasing the amount of \n     payroll tax or some other tax, or (3) providing transfers or \n     loans from the General Fund of the Treasury. Whether General \n     Revenue transfers or loans represent an indirect increase in \n     taxes depends on a number of complex factors many of which \n     are generally unknown in the context of Social Security \n     reform, so no definitive answer can be given.\n       All of the plans that we have analyzed in recent years \n     provide for one or more of the three measures to generate \n     additional revenue both to restore solvency for the Social \n     Security Trust Funds and to provide for additional advance \n     funding. This is true for plans that include individual \n     accounts as well as for those that do not.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Stephen C. Goss,\n                                                    Chief Actuary.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. They have laid out the rates of return \nfor people born after 1980.\n  As I have told you, they are less than 2 percent. Over time, they go \ndown because the problem, over time, gets worse. As you pay into the \nsystem as a young worker, the obligations of the system get greater, \nand there really will be no rate of return. As a matter of fact, by \n2042, not only does your money not work for you, it is not enough to \npay benefits to people who are already in the system.\n  Here is the good news. If we could, in a bipartisan fashion, work \ntogether, I am confident we could construct a program for younger \nworkers--voluntary in nature--that would allow them to take part of the \nmoney they pay into Social Security, invest it in a different system--\nequity and nonequity, depending on what they want to do--that will \ndramatically outpace a 1.8 percent return.\n  Here is what I suggest to you as reality. If you had a business and \nyou wanted to sell an annuity to young people in America, and you laid \nout the program of that annuity and it mirrored Social Security, nobody \nin the country would invest in it simply because they can get a better \nrate of return leaving it in a checking account.\n  Now, everything about Social Security is not total retirement. There \nis a component of Social Security that pays for people who have been \ndisabled and injured. That aspect of the program is extremely important \nalso.\n  But to have a better business view of Social Security is necessary. \nIf we could achieve better growth rates--and the trustees tell us that \nif you achieve better growth rates, every dollar in additional growth, \nevery time the fund beats that 1.8 or 1.6 rate of return, that extra \ndollar allows benefits to be paid without raising taxes.\n  We are going to argue about the tax cut and how to stimulate the \neconomy. I remember in my last campaign, when I presented this idea, \nthe ad was that ``Lindsey Graham is going to take your Social Security \ntax dollars and put them in Enron stock.'' Well, I didn't wake up one \nday and think investing in Enron with Social Security was a good idea. \nThat is not what this program is designed to do.\n  There is bipartisan support for personal accounts, allowing \nindividual Americans the opportunity, if they choose, to invest in \nplans to get better growth rates. There are visitors here from all over \nthe country, most likely, and I welcome them here. One thing about \nbeing a Member of the Senate, or the House, or a Federal employee in \nany fashion, is that you have the opportunity, if you choose, to invest \nin the Thrift Savings Plan. It is a pretty good deal. I, as a Senator, \ncan invest up to about $10,000 of my salary into a thrift plan. It is a \nGovernment-sponsored plan, administered by the private sector, where I \ncan choose between three or four different investment options, based on \nthe risk I want to take. There are stock funds, mutual funds, bond/\nstock funds, Treasury notes, which I can choose based on the risk I \nwant to take.\n  All of these funds are supported by the Government in the sense that \nwe are going to stand behind them and not let them collapse. It is even \nbetter than that. The Government puts in 50 cents on the dollar up to \nthe $10,000 I put in, and they do the same for every Federal employee.\n  I suggest something like that should exist for the average working \nperson in this country because under the current tax system, the \naverage American will pay more in Social Security taxes than in any \nother form of tax, because this comes out of our paycheck--6.5 \npercent--no matter what our income is, up to a certain level.\n  For middle- and low-income workers struggling to get by, 6.5 \npercent--I think that is the correct number--comes out of your paycheck \nto go into the Social Security trust fund. For younger workers, we are \ntaking that money from you. We are giving you no options to invest it. \nWe are controlling it for you, and you are going to get that 2 \npercent--eventually less than 1 percent--over time.\n  I think that is wrong for the people paying taxes. But here is the \nbig crime of it all: That system locks in failure for Social Security. \nSome Senate, somehow, someday--if we don't do something relatively \nsoon--is going to be dealing with a trust fund that is $25 trillion \nshort of the money necessary to pay the obligation, and it is going to \nbe dealing with a trust fund from which somebody gets a letter one day \nsaying: That check you got last month will be reduced by 28 percent, \nand I am sorry we don't have the money to pay you.\n  I don't know who will be occupying this seat then--I doubt if it will \nbe me--but I would like to take some of that burden off their shoulders \nand off the working families and the working people in this country, in \nterms of taking their money and getting a better rate of return for it.\n  So the hope and purpose of this amendment is to put into the record \nthis year, 2003, let it be said--if there is a record that stands the \ntest of time, let it be said that in 2003 the Senate will soon adopt \nfacts that I think are irrefutable, nonpartisan in nature, that lay out \nthe future of Social Security solvency in a very honest, dramatic, and \nchilling way.\n  I congratulate my colleagues who are willing to accept this amendment \nas part of the roadmap for the budget this year. The facts are real. \nThey are not going to go away unless we make things happen differently.\n  One thing I remember from President Clinton--and it was a good line--\nis that\n\n[[Page S3940]]\n\nthe definition of insanity is doing an event the same way and expecting \ndifferent results. So I think it is insane politically for us to keep \nthis system in place expecting different results to fall out of the \nsky. They will not fall out of the sky.\n  Our freedom is about to be strengthened because some young man and \nwoman chose to volunteer to serve their country and risk their life for \nour freedom. You can debate all you would like whether this is an \nappropriate thing to do. But they have taken on that sacrifice, and \nthey will accept the order, if given, to go forward. That model is the \nmodel that has kept us free for over 200 years--average, everyday \nAmericans who are willing to do their part, willing to risk their sons \nand daughters, their own lives, to make sure the next generation can \nhave the blessings of liberty that we have enjoyed.\n  There was an interview I heard today of a family with twin sons \nserving in the same Marine unit, both of them ready to go tomorrow, if \nthat is the day chosen. The mom and the dad were very worried but \nbursting with pride about the fact that both of their sons have chosen \nto serve in the Marine Corps and both of them are on the tip of the \nspear. What they were trying to tell the commentator was that they are \nproud of them because they are willing to serve their country and \nprotect their way of life. The parents mentioned the fact that their \nhope is that life will be better for their kids than it was for them, \nand that truly is the American dream. That is what keeps us all going, \ntrying to make sure that we pass on to the next generation a future \nwith a possibility, with hard work, to be better than the one we have \nexperienced.\n  I can say with all the confidence in the world that if we don't act \nsoon, and act decisively, and if we are not willing to sacrifice \npolitically and make some structural reforms to Social Security, we are \ncommitting political malpractice, and the future of Social Security is \ndismal and the ability to maintain the system is going to be \nunbelievably costly, and you can wind up with a Social Security pension \nplan and the military, and no money to do anything else. That is what \nawaits us as a nation.\n  But I am just as confident that we will rise to the occasion, and I \ncannot see how right now--it is beyond my ability as a political person \nto see how all this is going to come together. I am telling you that, \nbased on faith, I know it will. The problems facing our troops--there \nare so many scenarios that face them in the aftermath of Iraq. There \nare thousands of different scenarios of ``what if that'' and ``what if \nthat.'' I can only tell you I have the same faith that at the end of \nthe day we will be successful and at the end of the day the sacrifices \nwill be made.\n  Unfortunately, some people, most likely, will lose their lives or be \ninjured. We are going to get through this thing at the end of the day \nstronger rather than weaker. We are doing the right thing.\n  I have faith in our troops and in our President that the dictator, \nSaddam Hussein, will be gone soon. I have faith that this body, \nstarting this year--I hope it is this year--will come together to \naddress the looming problems that face Social Security. This amendment \nlays out those problems. It puts it as part of the road map for this \nyear's budget and, at the end, it encourages all to work together with \nthe President to come up with solutions to avoid raising taxes and \ncutting benefits. It is a small step that will hopefully get us to the \nright place one day.\n  I am standing on the shoulders of people who have gone before me who \nhave addressed problems of Social Security, such as Senator Moynihan \nand other Senators in this body from both parties. I do not know how \nlong I will be here. Only the Good Lord and the voters know that. I can \ntell my colleagues one thing for certain: While I am here--I consider \nit to be an honor to be here--I want to do as many constructive \nactivities for my country as possible. I think one of the best things I \ncan do is to come up with an approach my colleagues from the other side \ncan buy into, which means a give and take, to put in place a plan that \nbegins to turn around the dynamics that are facing Social Security.\n  The good news is if we work together, if we start now, we can beat \nthis problem, we can solve this problem. The bad news is if we continue \nto do what we have done for the past decade, we are going to pass on to \nthe next generation of political leaders and taxpayers a dismal \npicture. I would argue that would be the first time in the history of \nthe country that political leaders passed on a country that was \ndiminished, not enhanced. I am confident we will not be the first ones \nto make that mistake.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his statement. I \nwill take a few moments later to respond. Hopefully, we can get an \nagreement on the contents of the Senator's amendment. In the meantime, \nthe Senator from Washington has been patiently waiting. I yield her 10 \nminutes or whatever time she uses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I will later be offering a very important \namendment on the budget resolution. It will fully fund the No Child \nLeft Behind Act, and I will be offering that amendment with Senators \nKennedy, Bingaman, Kerry, Mikulski, and Johnson.\n  Given the bipartisan support for the No Child Left Behind Act a year \nago, I am disappointed that there are still no Republicans who have \nasked to cosponsor the funding that bill promised to all of our \nconstituents.\n  A budget is a statement of our priorities. In an environment where we \ncannot fund everything, we have to make choices based on our values. \nEven when times are challenging, certainly as they are today, it is \nimportant that we continue to fund our children's education and to \ninvest in their future.\n  This budget that is before the Senate has a meager investment in \nfunding for the No Child Left Behind Act, and it fails our children and \nfails their future. It actually fails the very promise that Congress \nand this President made to students just a few years ago.\n  Leaving no child behind was a very important, noble goal, and it \npassed with bipartisan support. It was an education reform bill that \nwas set out to say we will leave no child behind. But the Republican \nbudget that is now before this Senate does not even come close to \nmeeting the needs of our students or keeping the important promises of \nthat legislation.\n  When we passed the No Child Left Behind Act, we passed it based on \ntwo commitments. The first was that we would hold schools accountable \nfor their progress--an important promise. But we also had a second \ncommitment that we would provide those schools with the resources to \nmeet those new requirements. We are certainly keeping the first part of \nthat bargain, but this budget suggests that my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle do not intend to keep the second part of that \npromise.\n  We have to ask why this administration is willing to keep a \ncommitment to come down very hard on low-performing schools, but it is \nunwilling to keep a commitment to provide the resources that our \nstudents need to succeed. Tougher accountability without adequate \nfunding is not reform. Mr. President, that is politics.\n  I want to talk a few minutes about the ways this budget shortchanges \nAmerica's students. The budget before us could cut funds for \nafterschool programs for more than 500,000 latchkey children in this \ncountry. That is on top, by the way, of the more than 6 million \nlatchkey children we already are not serving.\n  This budget leaves 6 million of our most disadvantaged students \nbehind by not providing the title I funding they need.\n  It also falls short on funding for teacher quality, class-size \nreduction, English language acquisition, safe and drug-free schools, \nand rural education.\n  At a time when we are demanding more than ever from our students, our \nteachers, and our schools, this budget does not invest in them. Some of \nmy colleagues may argue that this budget increases funding for \neducation, but let's be pretty clear. This budget before us robs Peter \nto pay Paul to provide that meager increase. Even that increase falls \nshort.\n\n[[Page S3941]]\n\n  Title I in this budget is underfunded by almost $6 million. This \nbudget assumes the elimination of 46 education programs, including, by \nthe way, rural education, support for small schools, and dropout \nprovisions.\n  This budget also assumes a $400 million cut in afterschool programs \ndespite the strong evidence that keeping children safe after school \nreduces juvenile violent crime and prevents children from engaging in \nrisky behaviors.\n\n  This budget also freezes most of the other major No Child Left Behind \nprograms, including funding for teacher quality, class-size reduction, \nbilingual education, and State test development. The Federal Government \nis not only requiring that States put assessments in place, we are \nrequiring those students pass those assessments. That is where our \nobligation to provide the funding promised in No Child Left Behind \ncomes in. Students need more tests, they need afterschool programs, \ntutoring, quality teachers, and small classes to pass those tests.\n  Given the budget crisis that is occurring in many of our States--my \nState has a $2.5 billion shortfall with which they are dealing--I think \nit is unrealistic to expect the States are going to suddenly pick up \nincreased education funding to meet the new Federal mandates that this \nbody passed on to them just a few short years ago.\n  Setting a high bar is obviously important. We all agree with that. \nBut setting a high bar and failing to give our kids the resources to \nsucceed is simply setting them up for failure. We know what the needs \nare out there. We know what works to help our children succeed, and I \nam really dismayed that the level of education funding in this budget \nis going to leave many of our children behind.\n  That is why later this afternoon I will be offering my amendment to \nfully fund the commitments we made, all of us made, in the No Child \nLeft Behind Act. It will provide the resources that parents, teachers, \nand students are asking for. It will fully fund title I at the level \nthat was agreed upon in the No Child Left Behind Act. It will continue \nto fund the effort to hire 100,000 fully qualified teachers so we can \nreduce the size of classes in early grades where our children are \nstruggling to learn the basics, and when they are in a class of 35 or \n40 students, they simply cannot get the attention they need to assure \nthat when they move on in to the later grades they have the basic \nskills they need to be successful.\n  My amendment will also put a high-quality teacher in every classroom. \nEvery parent knows the most important question you ask when your child \ncomes home from school on the first day is, Who is your teacher? Why is \nthat? Because they want to make sure their child has the best teacher. \nWe promised in the No Child Left Behind Act that we would put a high-\nquality teacher in every classroom.\n  This budget fails to fulfill that promise. My amendment will also \nallow communities to offer more afterschool programs to keep our \nchildren safe and in a place where they can learn those high standards \nthat we, at the Federal level, are now requiring. It will give children \nwith limited English proficiency more support to succeed, and it will \nfund initiatives such as rural education and dropout prevention that \nthis President's budget zeroes out.\n  We know the needs are there. We know what works to help our children \nsucceed. We need the will of the Members of this Senate to make it \nhappen.\n  I am out in my State, like every other Senator, and everywhere I go \nstudents, teachers, parents, principals, and community leaders come up \nto me and say: We want the No Child Left Behind Act to succeed. We want \nour students to be held to high standards. We want our principals, our \nteachers, and all of our administrators to be held to high standards. \nBut we cannot do it when you rob us of the seriously needed funds to do \nit. Do not put a Federal mandate on us that is not followed through \nwith the resources.\n  The amendment I am offering will fulfill the second half of that bill \nthat so many Senators spoke so eloquently to a short time ago.\n  Two years ago, we started down a road of promising all children in \nthis country a quality education. We did the first part by calling for \nschools to be more accountable for their progress, but now we are \nseriously stumbling on the second part, providing the funding so local \nschools can reach those goals that we set at the national level. I hope \nwe are going to do the right thing, I hope we follow through on the \npromises that every single Senator in this body made to students \nseveral years ago, and I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting \nthis amendment and doing the right thing for our children and our \nfuture.\n  We are at a very critical time in this country. We are facing a \npossible war in Iraq within hours. I think every American is feeling \nthe anxiety and the angst that all of my constituents are as we move \nforward. Even at this time, we cannot ignore the anxiety that is \nhappening in our children's classrooms. We need those children to \nsucceed so we can have a strong country in the future. My amendment \nwill assure that we keep that part of the commitment that was such an \nimportant part of No Child Left Behind.\n  I look forward to being able to offer this amendment at some time \nlater this afternoon, and I urge my colleagues to support it. I yield \nthe remainder of my time to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nher excellent presentation on this amendment and hope that we can \nproceed with more substantive amendments as soon as possible and that \nwe can have a healthy debate and then vote on these matters so the body \nhas a chance to indicate their priorities.\n  I know there are other Senators wishing to discuss matters. I notice \nthe very able senior Senator from South Carolina is in the Chamber. How \nmuch time is the Senator seeking?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Is it controlled time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, it is controlled time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina on the Graham \nof South Carolina amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have a very high regard for my \ndistinguished junior colleague, but anybody who puts up this particular \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution relative to Social Security could not \npossibly be voting for the tax cuts.\n  I know a majority of our Republican-controlled Budget Committee has \nvoted for the tax cuts. The President is for the tax cuts. Right to the \npoint, we are about to pass a tax cut in this budget resolution.\n  I want to bring into focus the sham of the so-called resolution of \nthe distinguished junior Senator from South Carolina because he worries \nabout the year 2042 hours before we are going to war and totally \ndisregards the law. I will propose an amendment to strike all after the \nenacting clause and inserting in lieu thereof the Budget Act, section \n13301.\n  Section 13301 was a very deliberate and discussed matter that we had \nnot only in the Budget Committee, but I had help on both sides of the \naisle, and we voted on it 98 to 2. It was signed into law on November \n5, 1990, by President George Herbert Walker Bush. It signed into law \nthe Greenspan commission. With this particular Graham of South Carolina \nresolution, one would think there was no President Bush commission.\n  President Bush's commission was chaired, I think, by one of our \ndistinguished former Members, the Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan, \nwho is under the weather and we all pray for his speedy recovery, but \nwe have that commission report on what to do.\n  This resolution says we really are concerned about Social Security at \nthis particular point but, by passing this resolution, we want \neverybody to disregard the fact that this day, this week, this year, \nthis budget, we will be spending Social Security trust funds in order \nto afford a tax cut. That is all it is. It is an absolute sham. They \nknow it, and I know it.\n  Section 21 of the Greenspan commission said, put this money in a \ntrust off budget. If we had adhered to it, I think we would have about \na $1.3 trillion trust fund. The distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Nickles, said we have always taken from the general \nfund in order to pay for Social Security, but that is not\n\n[[Page S3942]]\n\nright. I have two pages of the 2003 annual report of the Social \nSecurity Commission, page 4 and page 5. I ask unanimous consent that \nthose two pages be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               B. Trust Fund Financial Operations in 2002\n\n       The table below shows the income, expenditures, and assets \n     for the OASI, the DI and the combined OASDI Trust Funds in \n     calendar year 2002.\n\n      TABLE II.B1.--SUMMARY OF 2002 TRUST FUND FINANCIAL OPERATIONS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                             Amounts (in billions)\n                                     -----------------------------------\n                                         OASI         DI         OASDI\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAssets at the end of 2001...........    $1,071.5      $141.0    $1,212.5\nTotal income in 2002................       539.7        87.4       627.1\n                                     -----------------------------------\n    Net contributions...............       455.2        77.3       532.5\n    Taxation of benefits............        12.9          .9        13.8\n    Interest........................        71.2         9.2        80.4\n    Transfer from General Fund of             .4  ..........          .4\n     the Treasury...................\nTotal expenditures in 2002..........       393.7        67.9       461.7\n                                     -----------------------------------\n    Benefit payments................       388.1        65.7       453.8\n    Railroad Retirement financial            3.5          .2         3.6\n     interchange....................\n    Administrative expenses.........         2.1         2.0         4.2\nNet increase in assets in 2002......       146.0        19.5       165.4\nAssets at the end of 2002...........     1,217.5       160.5     1,378.0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Totals do not necessarily equal the sums of rounded components.\n\n       In 2002, 85 percent of total trust fund income consisted of \n     net contributions, comprising taxes paid by employees, \n     employers and the self-employed on earnings covered by Social \n     Security. These taxes were paid on covered earnings up to a \n     specified maximum annual amount, which was $84,900 in 2002 \n     and is increased each year automatically (to $87,000 in 2003) \n     as the average wage increases. The tax rates scheduled under \n     current law for 2002 and later are shown in table II.B2.\n\n               TABLE II.B2.--TAX RATES FOR 2002 AND LATER\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                 OASI             OASDI\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTax rate for employees and employers, each        5.30     0.90     6.20\n (in percent)................................\nTax rate for self-employed persons (in           10.60     1.80    12.40\n percent)....................................\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Two percent of OASDI Trust Fund income came from subjecting \n     up to 50 percent of Social Security benefits above a certain \n     level to Federal personal income taxation, and 13 percent of \n     OASDI income came from interest earned on investment of OASDI \n     Trust Fund reserves. Social Security's assets are invested in \n     interest-bearing securities of the U.S. Government. In 2002 \n     the combined trust fund assets earned interest at an \n     effective annual rate of 6.4 percent. More than 98 percent of \n     expenditures from the combined OASDI Trust Funds in 2002 went \n     to pay retirement, survivor, and disability benefits totaling \n     $453.8 billion. The financial interchange with the Railroad \n     Retirement program resulted in a payment of $3.6 billion from \n     the combined OASDI Trust Funds, or about 0.8 percent of total \n     expenditures. The administrative expenses of the Social \n     Security program were $4.2 billion, or about 0.9 percent of \n     total expenditures.\n       Assets of the trust funds provide a reserve to pay benefits \n     whenever expenditures exceed income. Assets increased by \n     $165.4 billion 2002 because income to each fund exceeded \n     expenditures, as shown in table II.B1. At the end of 2002, \n     the combined assets of the OASI and the DI Trust Funds were \n     288 percent of estimated expenditures for 2003.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We can see from the table:\n  Assets of the trust funds provide a reserve to pay benefits whenever \nexpenditures exceed income. Assets increased by $165.4 billion in 2002 \nbecause income to each fund exceeded expenditures--as shown in the \ntable II.B1.\n  Unlike what Senator Nickles says at the end of 2002, the combined \nassets of the OASI and the DI Trust Funds were 288 percent of estimated \nexpenditures for 2003.\n  This resolution of Senator Graham of South Carolina is just cover for \nthe looting of the Social Security trust fund. As the distinguished \nPresiding Officer knows, all that is needed to secure the Social \nSecurity trust fund is quit spending it on any and every other thing \nother than Social Security.\n  Is my time up?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would the Senator like additional time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes, I would like additional time, if I can have \nadditional time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield an additional 10 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The reason I would like additional time is to amend \nthis resolution, and insert section 13301. That is the budget law.\n  How can we bring into sharp focus that is the law? I have tried by \nputting different penalties in, but I cannot get the Senate to pass \nthem. We have to quit worrying about the year 2042 and start worrying \nabout today and getting by. Our soldiers in the front lines are ready \nto go into Iraq, and they are worried about being around this time \ntomorrow, not 2042.\n  It is a shame for the Senate to engage in this charade at this hour. \nWe are looting the Social Security trust fund. We are running, this \nfiscal year, according to the President, $554 billion in the red. That \nis without the costs of the war, without a supplemental. We ran a \ndeficit last year of $428 billion. That right there is $1 trillion of \nstimulus into this economy.\n  They should be ashamed to come here asking for tax reform under the \ncover of stimulus. No one believes the relief of taxes on dividends \nwill stimulate the economy or the estate tax will stimulate the \neconomy. Those with estates and those with dividends, Bill Gates and \nseveral other witnesses, have said that is the wrong course to take. \nThey know it. I know it. You know it.\n  I had to speak on the initial amendment of my distinguished colleague \nfrom South Carolina for whom I have the greatest respect, but we are \nnot going to be able to join in these charades. We have to start paying \nthe bills, including paying for the war, and not engage in tax cuts.\n  Yesterday, I sent a Dear Colleague letter to everyone in this body \nabout paying for the war. It is very simple. Here we are saying: GI, we \nwant you to go into Iraq and we hope you do not get killed. Then we \nwant you to come back. The reason we want you to come back is because \nmy generation, this Congress, isn't going to pay for it. You are going \nto have to pay for it. You are not only going to have to fight the war \nbut pay for it.\n  What do we need in this Congress right now--a tax cut so we can go to \nDisney World? That is the charade going on here, a few hours before we \ncommit our troops to freedom in Iraq. We ought to sober up.\n  I am informed by the staff that we have to wait until the end of the \nconsideration to put up the amendment.\n  Everyone is on notice, I would like to strike all of the \n``whereases'' because that is poppycock. We do not all have to be \nworried about 2042, today, as we go into Iraq. We ought to cut out the \nplaying of games and get serious around here that we are running the \neconomy into the ground.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and I ask that I be able to \ncall the amendment at the proper time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the manager has the right of recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I hope we have an understanding from the Chair that the \nmanagers have the first right of recognition here or we will have a \nreal problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator's right.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senators from South Carolina, in describing the \nproblem, are correct. The problem with Social Security is severe. The \nSocial Security trust fund is currently running surpluses. But we all \nknow it is then going to turn to cash deficits. Those are going to \nbecome very large cash deficits. This is like falling off the cliff. \nThis is the Social Security Administration's outlook for the Social \nSecurity trust fund.\n  Why is that? Very simply, the baby boom generation will start to \nretire. They are alive today. They are eligible for Social Security. \nWhen they start drawing Social Security, there will be 77 million, \nabout double the number eligible now. When that occurs, we will have a \nvery serious problem on our hands.\n  The Senator from South Carolina who offers the amendment has \ncorrectly described the problem, but he is not dealing with the budget \nresolution before the Senate. It exacerbates the problem severely.\n  This chart shows the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. The \ngreen bar is the Social Security trust fund; the red bars are the \nPresident's tax cuts, both enacted and proposed. One can see very \nclearly as the Social Security trust fund is running surpluses, the \nsize of the President's tax cut proposals are growing. At the very time \nthe Social Security trust fund turns cash negative, the cost of the \nPresident's tax cuts explode.\n  The result of this is a totally unsustainable plunge into deficits \nand debt. That is the fundamental problem\n\n[[Page S3943]]\n\nwith the budget resolution before the Senate; it is the fundamental \nproblem with the President's budget before the Senate.\n  The budget before the Senate takes out of the Social Security trust \nfund nearly all of the surpluses over the next 10 years. Social \nSecurity will run surpluses over the next 10 years of $2.718 trillion. \nThe mark before us by the chairman takes $2.718 billion of those \nsurpluses and uses it for other purposes, uses it to fund tax cuts, \nuses it to fund other expenditures.\n  The Senator from South Carolina said that is not an appropriate way \nto proceed. I agree. I hope he will consider opposing the budget \nresolution on that basis.\n  However, the Senator from South Carolina is also correct to say even \nif we do not do this, even if we do not raid the Social Security trust \nfund surplus, we still have a problem. This is a necessary step to stop \nthis raid, but it is not sufficient. It is necessary because if instead \nof taking these funds and using it for other purposes we were to use \nthat money to pay down debt or to prepay the liability, we would be in \na less severe circumstance going forward.\n  The Senator from South Carolina, who offered the amendment, has \nreferenced a $25 trillion shortfall in Social Security; that is, if you \ntake each year and accumulate it over time. The net present value of \nthose gaps between income and outgo for Social Security is not $25 \ntrillion. The net present value is $3.5 trillion. Yet the President is \nproposing a tax cut with interest costs of $1.96 trillion, even though \nwe are already in deficit.\n  Both Senators from South Carolina have revealed the flaw in this \nbudget. We have record deficits now. The President proposes cutting \ntaxes almost $2 trillion with the interest costs included. The result \nis we are taking virtually every penny--under the President's budget, \nevery penny of the Social Security surplus over the decade, right on \nthe eve of the retirement of the baby boom generation. I remind my \ncolleagues, what earthly sense does this make? At the very time the \ncost of the Government explodes with the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration, the costs of the President's tax cuts explode, driving us \ndeep, deep into deficits and debt.\n  I hope this budget resolution falls on the basis that it puts us in a \ncircumstance of ever mounting deficits and debt right at the time the \nbaby boom generation retires.\n  If there has ever been an illogical, irrational, dangerous budget, \nthis is it. To me, this is it. We are about to make fateful decisions \nwe are going to be living with for a long time. Nobody should be under \nany illusion about where this is headed. This is headed right off the \ncliff.\n  We can either together find some way to restrain both our spending \nimpulses and our tax-cutting impulses or we can wage what we have waged \nso far, which is a rush to deficits and debt.\n  It will be a sad day when we wake up from this hangover and from this \nbinge of tax cutting and spending that can only lead one place, and \nthat is to shredding of Social Security and Medicare and most of the \nrest of Government as we know it.\n  We have worked with the Senator from South Carolina to try to reach \nan agreement. I don't know if those modifications have been agreed to. \nIf they have, we are prepared to accept them.\n  I think Senator Craig is perhaps waiting to speak on this matter so I \nwithhold going further. Perhaps the Senator from South Carolina would \nlike to speak further. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I compliment the \nSenator. I thought that was a fairly eloquent rendition of where we \nfind ourselves. But I would like to add to it and respond to my good \nfriend, really, the senior Senator from South Carolina. If anyone has \nearned that title, Senator Hollings has. He is the senior Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  But there is a difference between what the Senator from North Dakota \nand the senior Senator from South Carolina were saying that I think is \nimportant.\n  The purpose in my offering this sense-of-the-Senate amendment is to \ntake facts that have been reported by the Social Security \nAdministration and make them part of this year's roadmap when we decide \nwhat to do to get through the budget process this year and to remind \nthe Senate and get the Senate to focus on the short- and long-term \nproblems our Nation faces.\n  ``Poppycock.'' I don't know what it means, but it is often used by my \ngood friend from South Carolina, the senior Senator. It sounds good. \nEverything he says is intriguing to me, just by his speaking style. But \nI do want to respond to the gist of what he was saying. The sham and \nthe fraud which I think has been going on, which has been going on for \nyears, is to suggest there is an easy solution. It is to suggest if you \njust left Social Security alone, didn't use it for tax cuts or didn't \nuse it for spending, everything would be OK. My senior Senator doesn't \nwant to talk about 2042. I do. The reason I want to talk about 2018 and \n2042 is I believe the reason I am here today is to pass on to the next \ngeneration a country very sound and very fit. If we do not address the \nproblem of having two workers for every retiree, versus 16.5 when I was \nborn, then we are going to fail and commit political malpractice.\n  I think it is political malpractice to suggest that if you just let \nSocial Security alone, the problem will go away. Here is what the \nSocial Security trustees said about that solution:\n\n       The implementation of a Social Security lockbox would not \n     alter this commitment and thus would have no direct effect on \n     the future solvency of Social Security.\n\n  As to the Senator from North Dakota, he is telling us, telling me, \nthat now is not the time to cut taxes because of a variety of reasons, \nand one would be it will put pressure on the Social Security trust fund \nbeyond the pressure that exists today.\n\n  People on my side would say that additional spending in the past, \nwhen the Democrats were in control, took money out of Social Security \nto put pressure on the trust fund.\n  The point is, the current income stream, diverted or not, is not \ngoing to save Social Security. We are going to have a $25 trillion \nshortfall in 75 years. And it does compound on itself. That is the \npoint. The Senator from North Dakota is right. Every day, literally, \nthat we ignore the problem of Social Security, it gets worse by \nbillions. The unfunded liability has grown dramatically as we have been \ntalking, and nobody is going to fix it except people such as us.\n  Here is why I will support the tax cut. One thing that is for sure, \nthere are two Senators from South Carolina and we are going to cancel \neach other's vote a lot on taxes. He has his reasons and I have mine. \nThe reason I will vote to cut your taxes is to stimulate the economy.\n  Where does Social Security money come from? What is the source of \nSocial Security dollars? It is payroll taxes.\n  Well, who pays payroll taxes? People working.\n  How do you get a job? Somebody hires you.\n  How do they pay you? They make a profit.\n  The economy needs infusion, in my opinion. But I respect the Senator \nfrom North Dakota tremendously because he is saying let's put no \npressure on Social Security, let's not have a tax cut. I respectfully \ndisagree. I believe a tax cut will help stimulate the economy, making \nthe economy and payroll taxes stronger, not weaker. But I respect him \ntremendously because he has bought into the big picture. We disagree \nabout what to do today. We may disagree about spending plans tomorrow. \nBut the Senator from North Dakota has bought into the big picture. He \nunderstands what faces our Nation.\n  As we argue about how to fix problems each year with the trust fund, \nI encourage him to work with me and others to come up with an overall \nsolution that will hit the problem head on. This is a cancer that needs \nto be treated--and not with a Band-Aid. The problem we are facing as a \nNation is we would not have enough money coming into the system, if it \nwas all dedicated, to come close to paying benefits. In 2042--I will \nmention that date again--28 percent reduction in benefits; 2018, you \npay more benefits in taxes. Every day we talk about it, it gets worse.\n  Having said that, I do believe the Senator from North Dakota and \nmyself\n\n[[Page S3944]]\n\nwill be able to work on a compromise that reflects accurately the facts \nfacing the trust fund, the problem the Nation faces, and we will \ndisagree about this year's budget and how to have a tax cut or not. But \nI do wish to work with him in the future because I believe he has got \nit. I believe he understands it.\n  With that, I will yield 10 minutes to my colleague, Senator Craig, \nfrom Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I first ask unanimous consent I become a \ncosponsor of amendment No. 274.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the senior \nSenator from South Carolina on a sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nexpressing that Congress well ought to act sooner rather than later in \nstrengthening our Social Security Program for the long term, for the \nyoung men and women today who are beginning to invest in the system and \nwho have grown increasingly to believe it will be unreliable and not \nthere when they get to be of Social Security age.\n  Why? The statistics have been talked about this morning, but here we \nare again. Year after year, trustee report after trustee report has \nbeen played out, spoken to, shown on the floor of the Senate. Hearings \nafter hearings, month after month in our committee rooms, have given us \nthe same message. Whether it is the junior or senior Senator from South \nCarolina, they both agree on the outcome. They may disagree on the \nreasons, but the trustees are always reflecting the graph or the chart \nthat is so effectively displayed here. This comes directly from the \nSocial Security trustee report of 2002 that we are speaking to this \nmorning.\n  Current retirees and those approaching retirement age are going to \nget their money. Why? Because Social Security in that sense is solvent. \nBut what we are concerned about, and why we begin to express a degree \nof urgency about reform for Social Security, is that you do not reform \nSocial Security today for tomorrow, you reform it today for 40 years \ndown the road, or 50 years down the road. It is like an insurance \naccount. We are the board of trustees responsible for establishing and \nsustaining its actuarial soundness so we do not have to dump large sums \nof general fund money into it at the last minute to keep it whole.\n  I think all of us agree with the general understanding and the \noverlook that the trustees and the studies have shown. Social Security \nis solid today for our seniors. I am chairman of the Special Committee \non Aging. We have spent a lot of time looking at this issue. Some folks \ntake umbrage when they hear that Social Security will be broke. I don't \nknow of anything that would express it differently than this bright red \nink that would suggest at about 2020 it breaks beyond the black ink, or \nthe break-even, and it heads into deficit. That is exactly what the \njunior Senator from South Carolina is talking about and what I am \ntalking about.\n\n  Last month, Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve was before our \nSubcommittee on Aging. He was not there to talk about interest rates. \nHe was there to talk about global aging. He testified that the country \nfaced ``abrupt and painful'' adjustments down the road as related to \nSocial Security if we do not address it sooner rather than later.\n  He simply meant that baby boomers were going to get cut. In essence, \nthis is what is going to happen: I am a baby boomer. I am afraid my \ngrandkids are going to say to me: Grandpa, we can't afford you anymore. \nWe can't afford a huge bump in our taxes just to pay for your well-\nbeing.\n  And I would not blame them, when we look at the kind of tax scale \nthat will result if you stand here and say there is nothing required \nnow and in the future to deal with this red ink, except leave the trust \nfund alone, and that in some magical, mythical way you can take it out \nof the general fund of the Treasury of the United States, and that you \ndon't spend it, or at least you don't borrow it back to Government to \nspend on other programs until such time as it is necessary and on call \nand Government can afford to pay for it.\n  Those are the issues at hand. That is what this resolution is about, \nto push us forward and into action in the near future, to make the \nkinds of adjustments that will assure my grandchildren that Social \nSecurity is going to be there for them and that grandpa isn't going to \nbreak them by demanding they keep Social Security whole, because he did \nnot have the common sense and the good judgment to deal with it in the \nappropriate fashion.\n  I hope I do have that common sense and good judgment. Certainly, the \ngroup that has been looking at it and the group that reports and talks \nabout insolvency down the road and the need to adjust are doing a great \nservice to this country.\n  Last November, Peter Fisher, the Under Secretary of Treasury for \nDomestic Finance, compared the unfunded promises in Social Security and \nMedicare to those of a spendthrift insurance company unable to make \ngood on its promises.\n  When I asked Alan Greenspan, well, let's compare Social Security and \nMedicare and fixing it, he said: Frankly, Social Security is not that \ndifficult. Why? Because you have real figures and exact numbers in a \nrelative sense. You have demographic studies that project the number of \npeople who will come online, and you can make the adjustments for it.\n  Medicare is tied to a very dynamic health care system. It is growing \nand changing, and its costs will grow and change. It is a much more \ndifficult task at hand, if you will, than that of us building up the \nbackbone to deal with Social Security.\n  To his credit, our President appointed the blue-ribbon panel to \nexplore ways of addressing this challenge. The President's bipartisan \ncommission to strengthen Social Security was cochaired by former \nSenator Pat Moynihan, our colleague and former Finance Committee \nchairman. He is an undisputed expert on Social Security, with unique \nbipartisan credibility.\n  Now the President's bipartisan commission has come forward with three \nmodels to strengthen Social Security. Many of us are studying those \nmodels to determine what is the best way to reform not the politically \npossible, because we are going to have to convince ourselves and the \npublic about reform--and that is what we are about to do, I hope--but \nwhat is the right way to reform Social Security, to create the dynamics \n30 or 40 years down the road, to assure that young people who are now \nbeginning to invest in it with their hard-earned tax dollars--their \nwithheld dollars from their payroll--to assure that it will be there \nfor them.\n\n  This week, the trustees have done their job, and they have done it \nwell. They have talked about it, and they have determined a status quo \nor do-nothing plan versus a variety of others. The do-nothing plan is \nwhat the trustees laid before us on Monday. And the do-nothing plan is \nthe plan represented right here, in all of the bright red ink that is \neither displayed by my chart or by the chart of the Senator from North \nDakota. I think my chart is prettier, but the charts are the same. \nDemocrat or Republican, the figures don't lie, and we can't lie about \nthem.\n  We both agree that herein lies the problem. A dynamic economy--people \nworking softens it, and that is what this tax cut is about, getting \npeople back to work, putting money in the market, creating jobs. We are \ngoing to have to tighten our belt a little bit on the other side. We \nare going to have to quit spending at the rate we are spending while we \nare stimulating the economy and putting people back to work. That helps \nthe bottom line and softens the deficit a little bit.\n  But most economists agree, if you do not give a tax cut, and you \ncontinue to spend at the rate you are spending, you are going to have \ndeficits for a long time to come. You can't cut your way out of them. \nYou have to grow the economy and put some money back in the Treasury, \nand in doing that, for the short term, you strengthen Social Security.\n  But this is what is true about the long term, and in the long term \nare people like me at 55, 50, 57 years of age. I am 57. And in a short \ntime we are coming online--62, 65, 67 years of age, eligible for Social \nSecurity, being part of that baby boom generation, that tidal wave of \npeople hitting the Social Security system.\n\n[[Page S3945]]\n\n  The Senator from North Dakota talked about the doubling of the \nnumbers of recipients. That is what this red ink is all about. We need \nto create dynamics in the system, and change it, and assure that the \nright kind of investment is going in, that the right kind of energy and \nmultipliers are at work there, to assure that not only is the system \ngoing to be there in the long term for me, but, most importantly, that \nthe system is going to be there for the young people who are investing \nin it today.\n  I am not alone in condemning the do-nothing plan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair wants to inform the Senator he has \nused 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. If the Senator would like additional \ntime----\n  Mr. CRAIG. If I could have an additional 2 minutes to wrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may continue.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding me the \ntime.\n  Whether it is former Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat from Nebraska, \nwhether it is former Senator Pat Moynihan, Democrat from New York, \nwhether it is Republican Larry Craig of Idaho or Republican Lindsey \nGraham of South Carolina, the reality is, we all understand we must act \nnow, sooner rather than later, to recreate, strengthen, and ensure the \nfuture for a Social Security system that is good for my grandkids to \nput their money in, that is a sound investment that will yield for them \na reasonable supplemental income in their retirement years.\n  I am not alone in condemning the do-nothing plan. Our former \ncolleague, Senator Bob Kerrey, from Nebraska wrote a letter to another \nformer colleague, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, from New York, on \nthe eve of his assuming the cochairmanship of the President's \nCommission to Strengthen Social Security. He wrote:\n\n       Dear Pat, In that I have a great and abiding interest in \n     your success on the 2001 Social Security Commission and that \n     I am willing to provide free advice, I offer the following \n     two suggestions:\n       1. Start talking about the details of the most popular plan \n     in Washington to fix Social Security. . . . It is called the \n     do-nothing plan. The do-nothing plan discloses no details. . \n     . . Citizens who want to know the rest of the details must \n     look to the Social Security Trustees who will tell them this: \n     The do-nothing plan proposes to cut benefits 25 to 33 percent \n     by 2043.\n       2. Wealth should have a goal. . . . Our goal is to \n     eliminate poverty amongst eligible Social Security \n     beneficiaries. By the way, the do-nothing plan will increase \n     poverty rates.\n\n  For every year we delay strengthening Social Security, it will only \nbecome more difficult to do.\n  The challenge calling out to this generation in Congress is how to \nsustain Social Security beyond this generation of retirees without \noverburdening our children and grandchildren with excessive taxes on \ntheir labor or huge cuts in retirement income.\n  It is not too late. We can still do the right thing. We can save \nSocial Security by embracing the framework provided by the President's \nCommission and working to strengthen it soon.\n  David Walker, the Comptroller at the General Accounting Office, \ntestified just this January before the Aging Committee that we have:\n\n     a, window of opportunity to craft a solution that will \n     protect Social Security benefits for the nation's current and \n     near-term retirees, while ensuring that the system will be \n     there for future generations.\n\n  We should embrace that window of opportunity for the sake of our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  As I said: Here we are again. The trustees are trying to get Congress \nand the public to face the future with confidence and action. The \nchallenge for us is to respond.\n  That is why the Aging Committee has been and will be holding hearings \nand briefings this year. We will continue to highlight the work of \nthe--nonpartisan and bipartisan--General Accounting Office, the \nPresident's Commission to Strengthen Social Security, the Congressional \nResearch Service, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Social \nSecurity trustees.\n  The call to action begins with understanding what the trustees have \ntold us again this week. The consequences of the do-nothing plan will \nbe devastating for today's workers and tomorrow's retirees.\n  That is what the study was all about. That is what the commission has \nbeen about. That is what this amendment is all about.\n  I thank the Senator from South Carolina for bringing forward this \nconcurrent resolution, urging us forward now, to begin to act. \nHopefully, by 2004, 2005, or 2006, we will have developed the political \nwill to do the right thing for the Social Security system and its \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, if I may, to put a \ncouple things in perspective as we close out the discussion on the \namendment, No. 1, I have been able to reach accommodation with the \nSenator from North Dakota about the language of the amendment. I am \nwilling to accept his changes. I think they are reasonable and helpful.\n  I encourage my colleagues, we can have disagreements about how to \nbest protect the Social Security trust fund. We can have a debate that \nwe should not cut taxes, that we should make sure that we do nothing in \nterms of spending or tax cuts that jeopardizes the dollars coming in. \nThat is a legitimate, healthy debate. I believe the best way to protect \nthe trust fund is to create additional jobs and grow the economy so we \nwill have more payroll taxes coming in to shore up the trust fund.\n  The focus of the amendment is to clarify in this roadmap the status \nof Social Security, not based on what a Republican thinks or what a \nDemocrat thinks. And here is the summary of that status.\n  No matter what happens with the current amount of money coming into \nthe system, if it is all protected, or some of it is bled off, if every \ndollar were to be collected that is going to be paid, it is $25 \ntrillion short to pay bills in the next 75 years. And in 2042, you \nwould have to cut 28 percent of the benefit package or increase taxes \nby 50 percent. In 2018, you would pay more in benefits than you collect \nin taxes. Why is that? The amount of money to be dedicated to this \nsystem, if it is all left alone, is nowhere near the amount of money to \npay the benefits. It is no one's fault. It is not Senator Hollings' \nfault, and it is not my fault. The problem is we went from 16.5 workers \npaying into the system in 1950 to 20 years from now having two to one. \nThere are just not enough people paying taxes to take care of the baby \nboomers.\n  One thing I am trying to make crystal clear is, there is no easy fix. \nThe demagoguery must stop now. Those who say a tax cut this year or a \nspending plan next year is the problem with Social Security are missing \nthe boat and engaging in conduct that is going to prevent us from ever \nfinding a solution that works.\n  My belief is that you grow the economy to help Social Security. The \nbelief of the Senator from North Dakota is that you don't do anything \nto jeopardize the trust fund this year through a tax cut. I respect \nthat. I just disagree.\n  I hope if there is a vote in any fashion on this amendment, that my \ncolleagues would allow the product that the Senator from North Dakota \nand I have come up with to be part of the record because it is vitally \nimportant that the Senate incorporate information from the Social \nSecurity trustees that tells us exactly the future of Social Security \nand its status so that there will be something we can agree on and we \ncan start working toward a solution sooner rather than later. If we \ncan't agree on the basis, if we can't put into the budget resolution \nwhat the Social Security trustees are telling us about the status of \nthe fund in 2018 and 2042 and the structural problems, if we can't do \nthat because somebody wants to make a point about the tax cuts for \npolitical advantage, how in the world are we ever going to solve this \nproblem?\n  I hope the Senate will overcome the temptation to kind of punch and \ncounterpunch on the debate about taxes or any other debate and put in \nthe record the real facts about Social Security, a record that has been \nestablished between myself and the Senator from North Dakota. It would \nbe a great day, a small step forward to finally come to grips with the \nproblems that Social Security faces.\n\n[[Page S3946]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I must say, when I hear the suggestion \nthat cutting taxes now won't affect Social Security in the future, that \nis no economics that I understand.\n  Just so we all understand how it works, all the revenue of the \nFederal Government goes in a pot. All the expenditures come out of that \npot. That is the way it works. When you take revenue away from that \nrevenue stream and you already can't pay your bills, guess what. You \ncan't pay your bills in an even more serious way. Any family's \neconomics would tell them that if you are not able to pay your bills \nnow and you go out and cut your income more, you have more bills you \ncan't pay. That is what our friends on the other side are trying to \nconvince people of. I don't think that is going to work.\n  This is the hard reality of the budget before us. There is over $2.7 \ntrillion of Social Security surplus available in the next 10 years. I \nbelieve we ought to take that money and either pay down debt or prepay \nthe liability. That would strengthen Social Security.\n  The other side has offered a budget that takes virtually every penny \nof those Social Security surpluses and uses them to pay for tax cuts or \nother expenditures. That does not help Social Security. That hurts \nSocial Security. That makes the shortfall more serious going forward \nbecause we have not taken the resources, those trust fund surpluses, \nand used it to either pay down debt or prepay the liability.\n  The other side tries to posture that one side wants to do nothing; \nthe other side wants to do something about economic growth. No. No, I \ndon't believe their program improves economic growth. Why not? Because \nthe tax cuts are not paid for by reducing spending. The tax cuts are \npaid for by borrowing. You can't borrow your way to prosperity.\n  Here is the work of the macroeconomic advisers. These are people \nunder contract to the White House and under contract to the \nCongressional Budget Office to tell us what the effect of various \nfiscal policies are on economic growth. Do you know what they tell us? \nIf we enact the President's plan, it will actually hurt long-term \neconomic growth. It will hurt economic growth. Why? Because of \nincreased deficits and debt that put a weight on the economy. What is \nthat weight? When you run deficits and debt, that reduces the pool of \nsocietal savings, that reduces the money available for investment. That \nhurts economic growth. That is exactly what the folks who have analyzed \nthis have concluded.\n  Is the Senator from South Carolina seeking time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, right to the point, when the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho was talking about growing out to it, I \nask unanimous consent to print page 6 of the budget resolution before \nus in the Record at this particular point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Fiscal year 2012:-$327,375,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2013:-$317,115,000,000.\n       (5) Public debt.--The appropriate levels of the public debt \n     are as follows:\n       Fiscal year 2003: $6,687,816,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2004: $7,269,629,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2005: $7,825,005,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2006: $8,366,224,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2007: $8,885,256,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2008: $9,412,708,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2009: $9,932,454,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2010: $10,443,080,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2011: $10,971,657,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2012: $11,449,831,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2013: $11,919,328,000,000.\n       (6) Debt held by the public.--The appropriate levels of the \n     debt held by the public are as follows:\n       Fiscal year 2003: $3,858,449,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2004: $4,184,748,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2005: $4,446,730,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2006: $4,661,214,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2007: $4,828,626,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2008: $4,980,020,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2009: $5,101,852,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2010: $5,190,541,000,000.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. On page 6 you will see that the appropriate levels of \nthe public debt are as follows: Fiscal year 2003, $6,687,816,000,000, \nbut for the fiscal year 2013, the public debt is $11,919,328,000,000. \nSo it is an increase of $5.2 trillion. Good gosh, I said ``trillion.'' \nI was hoping to say ``billion.'' The debt goes up, up, and away. Well, \nwe know what the interest cost is going to be on that. That is going to \nbe in excess of $600 or $700 billion a year. We just can't afford that.\n  Let me say to the distinguished colleague from South Carolina, again, \nI was here in the 1970s. I was here in the 1980s. We didn't spend the \nSocial Security trust fund, but we were beginning to drain it at the \nvery end of the 1970s. And we appointed the Greenspan commission, and \nthe Greenspan commission put on a graduated increase in taxes over the \nyears to take care of the baby boomers in the next generation, exactly \nwhat my colleague from South Carolina is talking about. We foresaw \nthat. It was supposed to build up these reserves and surpluses. That is \nexactly what has occurred.\n  I refer, since it is already in the record, to page 4 of the annual \nreport of the Social Security trust fund that was issued on Monday.\n  It shows at the end of 2002, we had assets in the Social Security \ntrust of $1.378 trillion. Of course, they have been spending the money \non any and everything but Social Security. You can propose plan A, and \nplan B. You can talk about 2018 and 2042 and all those other funny \nlittle things until you are blue in the face. But unless and until you \nstop spending Social Security moneys on everything but Social Security, \nnone of those plans is going to work--whether you privatize or not. \nThat is why the Congress, under the leadership of President George \nHerbert Walker Bush, in November of 1990, wrote into law section 13301.\n  I want to put Section 13301 into the amendment to make it crystal \nclear. I don't mind some of the whereases--and I understand the Senator \nfrom North Dakota wants to try to move things along and accommodate my \ncolleague from South Carolina in taking a sense of the Senate. But \nthere is no way in the world to make that a bill because there is no \nway to write it. You have to provide what the budget impact is, and \neverything else like that, and have it appraised. So it remains as a \nsense of the Senate at the desk. So that we can clear the air from this \nparticular sham, I raise a point of order under section 305 of the \nBudget Act that sense-of-the-Senate resolutions are nongermane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A point of order is not in order at this time. \nIt can only be made when the time of the amendment has been used or \nyielded back.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Very good. I yield the floor. I think I have made my \npoint. I ask the Chair, is it still a sense-of-the-Senate resolution? \nWhat is the form?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. A sense-of-the-Senate amendment. Right, mine would be \nthe sense of the Senate. So I don't know--may I ask unanimous consent, \nthen, to be recognized at the end, not to make a point of order?\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the time expires, I may be \nrecognized to have considered the amendment, or voted on the amendment \nthat I have at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, reserving the right to \nobject, I believe an effort is being made between my office and Senator \nHollings' to work something out we can all live with. I ask him to take \nthat into consideration. There are negotiations going on as we speak.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Do you object?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator object?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. No, I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, simply put, a couple \nthings: My senior Senator seems to suggest we did something in the \n1980s that has made Social Security sound. Social Security has \nsurpluses today, but every day that goes by, those surpluses are not \nenough to pay the bills that are due and yet to come. Here is what the \nSocial Security Administration told us yesterday: There are 3.3 workers \nto every retiree in 2002. Twenty years\n\n[[Page S3947]]\n\nfrom now, it goes 2 to 1. They told us yesterday that without \nstructural reform--I emphasize again, structural reform does not \ninclude leaving Social Security current dollars alone. If you leave \nevery dollar owed to Social Security alone and do nothing else, it \nstill runs out of money in 2042. It is $25 trillion short in 2075. That \nis not the problem. People who say that are not being forthright about \nthe problem.\n  Having said that, I join my colleague from South Carolina and the \nSenator from North Dakota to try to make sure we preserve Social \nSecurity, keep it strong and healthy until we can find a structural \nreform. He has made an argument that cutting taxes reduces the family's \nincome. The point is that payroll taxes are the income for Social \nSecurity. We are in a depressed economy right now.\n  We are trying--at least I am trying--to take some dollars and invest \nthem back into the families and businesses of America, to create \nadditional jobs, to strengthen the revenue flow, and to protect the \nrevenue flow of Social Security.\n  My friend from North Dakota doesn't believe it will work. I totally \nrespect him. But it is very difficult to be lectured to by some of my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle about needing to be good \nstewards with taxpayer dollars. I came to Congress in 1994. When I came \nhere, there were deficits as far as the eye could see. We had not \nbalanced the budget in 30 years. We were able to balance the budget and \ncut taxes twice. Now, because of war, recession, and other problems, we \nhave a debt. The debt, compared to the gross domestic product, is very \nsmall as compared to years past. But it is still a debt, and it is a \nreal problem, and we need to work together to solve that debt, and we \nwill.\n  I am asking my colleagues today, whatever you think about the tax \ncut, or other proposals that my party may present today or tomorrow, \nplease do not prevent us from having in the Record for the country to \nsee the true state of affairs with Social Security. My amendment \ndoesn't fix the problem; it identifies it. I have been able to work \nwith the Senator from North Dakota to put it into the Record. Today \ncould be a good day--a day that the Senate agrees on the outyear \nproblems of Social Security and begins to define it in a nonpartisan \nway or today could be the same old politics, where the political moment \nprevents us from talking honestly and openly about the looming problem \nof Social Security.\n  I am hopeful this will be a different day because, if not, we have \nlost the opportunity to do something constructive to fix Social \nSecurity. I appreciate the Senator from North Dakota working with me. I \nhope I can reach an agreement with my senior Senator from South \nCarolina to define the problem in honest terms, without anybody putting \ntheir spin on it, because the wording comes from the Social Security \nAdministration. If I fail, I deeply regret the fact that I was not able \nto achieve this small first step. I am hopeful that, working together, \nwe can achieve this small first step. That is all I know to say.\n  This is a great exercise in what this country faces. I am trying to \nuse the Social Security trustees' report to define the problem. I don't \nwant the demagoguery of the moment to keep us from doing that, because \nthe country loses in the debate of the moment. There are honest \ndifferences. Let's do something constructive and define the problem in \nthe terms given by the Social Security trustees.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, has the Senator from South Carolina now \nseen the modification suggested by the senior Senator from South \nCarolina? Is the Senator from South Carolina, at this point, willing to \naccept the modifications we previously discussed, as well as the \nmodification of the senior Senator from South Carolina?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. After having reviewed the documents, I \nam willing to agree to the modifications as offered by my senior \nSenator and the modification offered by the Senator from North Dakota. \nI am willing to do that. I think it is a good first step.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I appreciate that and I think that would be a good \noutcome. I will soon seek unanimous consent to accept the amendment as \nmodified, and then we will be able to proceed. As you know, at 2 \no'clock, we have to turn our attention back to the ANWR discussion.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, without losing my right to the floor. We are up \nagainst the 2 o'clock time limit.\n  Mr. REID. I would like to get this amendment accepted.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would the Senator from South Carolina, including his \nmodification, accept that?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That would be acceptable.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 274, As Modified\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we accept \nthe amendment of the Senator from South Carolina, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator has a right to modify \nhis amendment. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 79, after line 22, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 308. SOCIAL SECURITY RESTRUCTURING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Social Security is the foundation of retirement income \n     for most Americans;\n       (2) preserving and strengthening the long term viability of \n     Social Security is a vital national priority and is essential \n     for the retirement security of today's working Americans, \n     current and future retirees, and their families;\n       (3) Social Security faces significant fiscal and \n     demographic pressures;\n       (4) the nonpartisan Office of the Chief Actuary at the \n     Social Security Administration reports that--\n       (A) the number of workers paying taxes to support each \n     Social Security beneficiary has dropped from 16.5 in 1950 to \n     3.3 in 2002;\n       (B) within a generation there will be only 2 workers to \n     support each retiree, which will substantially increase the \n     financial burden on American workers;\n       (C) without structural reform, the Social Security system, \n     beginning in 2018, will pay out more in benefits than it will \n     collect in taxes;\n       (D) without structural reform, the Social Security trust \n     fund will be exhausted in 2042, and Social Security tax \n     revenue in 2042 will only cover 73 percent of promised \n     benefits, and will decrease to 65 percent by 2077;\n       (E) without structural reform, future Congresses may have \n     to raise payroll taxes 50 percent over the next 75 years to \n     pay full benefits on time, resulting in payroll tax rates of \n     as much as 16.9 percent by 2042 and 18.9 percent by 2077;\n       (F) without structural reform, Social Security's total cash \n     shortfall over the next 75 years is estimated to be more than \n     $25,000,000,000,000 in constant 2003 dollars or \n     $3,500,000,000 measured in present value terms;\n       (G) absent structural reforms, spending on Social Security \n     will increase from 4.4 percent of gross domestic product in \n     2003 to 7.0 percent in 2077; and\n       (5) the Congressional Budget Office, the General Accounting \n     Office, the Congressional Research Service, the Chairman of \n     the Federal Reserve Board, and the President's Commission to \n     Strengthen Social Security have all warned that failure to \n     enact fiscally responsible Social Security reform quickly \n     will result in 1 or more of the following:\n       (A) Higher tax rates.\n       (B) Lower Social Security benefit levels.\n       (C) Increased Federal debt or less spending on other \n     federal programs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the President, the Congress and the American people \n     including seniors, workers, women, minorities, and disabled \n     persons should work together at the earliest opportunity to \n     enact legislation to achieve a solvent and permanently \n     sustainable Social Security system; and\n       (2) Social Security reform--\n       (A) must protect current and near retirees from any changes \n     to Social Security benefits;\n       (B) must reduce the pressure on future taxpayers and on \n     other budgetary priorities;\n       (C) must provide benefit levels that adequately reflect \n     individual contributions to the Social Security system.\n       (D) must preserve and strengthen the safety net for \n     vulnerable populations including the disabled and survivors.\n       (3) We should honor section 13301 of the Budget Enforcement \n     Act of 1990.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senators yield back their time on the \namendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, we are prepared to yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 274, as modified.\n  Without objection, the amendment, as modified, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 274), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S3948]]\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, the agreement we had that I be \nrecognized now should be vitiated. It is not necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is vitiated by this action.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 272\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Parliamentary inquiry: Are we now in the circumstance \nthat we are back on the debate on ANWR for 1 hour preceding the vote at \n3 o'clock?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Time is equally divided during that time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I believe we have an hour equally \ndivided at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I yield such time as my colleague from \nAlaska, Senator Murkowski, desires. Does she need 10 or 12 minutes?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Ten minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. Madam President, the discussion \nabout ANWR is more than just pictures. It is more than statistics, \nnumbers, and barrels of oil that might be recoverable. ANWR is about \nreal people, real jobs, and real opportunities, and that is what we \nneed to be focusing on. We do not need to get caught up in the hype of \nthe pretty pictures. I will be the first to tell you that my State is \nabsolutely drop-dead gorgeous, and I want to keep it that way. I would \nnot be supporting anything, and I would not be standing on the floor of \nthe Senate suggesting that we should do anything to despoil that.\n  I want to talk briefly today about three points and what ANWR means \nto us in Alaska. It is jobs, it is protection of the environment, and \nit is also about economic security--three commonsense, basic issues.\n  Let me talk quickly about the environment because it is these attacks \nthat I think first and foremost have kept ANWR from being developed for \nthe past 20-some years, all the concern of the development of oil and \ngas reserves on the North Slope, on the Coastal Plain. It was intended \nand identified as early as 1960 by President Eisenhower that this area \nhad great potential for oil exploration and drilling and should be \nutilized as such.\n  We do care for the environment. We have shown that through \nconstruction of our 800-mile Trans-Alaska pipeline that carries the oil \nsafely, bisecting the State from top to bottom. We have done a darn \ngood job, and the scientific studies and reports, including the \nNational Academy of Sciences' report that came out 2 weeks ago, \ndemonstrate that. We do a good job. We care for our environment in \nAlaska.\n  The environment and development are not mutually exclusive terms. We \nhave demonstrated time and again that they are not mutually exclusive. \nFor those who will take the time to visit our oilfields up North, I \nthink they will be amazed at the technology, the innovation we utilize \nwhen it comes to the extraction of our natural resources.\n\n  The good Senator from New Mexico stood in this Chamber earlier and \ntalked about the directional drilling and the technique that is now \navailable to develop our oil. I think he used the number 4 miles; that \nwe can snake this oil well down across a 4-mile area of terrain. He \nused the analogy of a child with a straw and a milkshake and that straw \ncould go 4 miles. That is a pretty vivid image. Actually, the good \nchairman of the Energy Committee is incorrect; we can actually go 6 \nmiles. The technology has come so far in the 30 years since we have \nbeen drilling on the North Slope.\n  We talk about the footprint. The footprint has been described in so \nmany ways. You can fit six of the oil development areas in the size of \nDulles Airport. It is the size of the Pinehurst golf course. The \nvisuals are there, but what we need to impress upon people, what we \nhave to impress upon people is that the footprint is practically \nnegligible in the context of the whole Coastal Plain and certainly in \nthe context of the whole of ANWR and even more certainly in the context \nof the entire scope of our State.\n  What we are talking about, first of all, is very small. But even if \nit is small, we still need to do it responsibly, and we do that through \nthe technology. The State of Alaska is the first to make sure the \nenvironmental standards are met and the permitting requirements are \nmet. Nobody wants to rape, spoil, or ruin the land.\n  Madam President, I am third generation Alaskan. I am the first person \nserving in Congress for the State of Alaska who was actually born in \nthe State. I was born in the territory. I am the last person to suggest \nwe should do anything that would spoil our environment, my environment, \nthe environment in which I choose to raise my family. My boys, my \nhusband, and I live for fishing, hunting, camping, and backpacking. \nThis is the part of Alaska we want to preserve. So let us do it right. \nWe know how to do it right.\n  I will talk a bit about the jobs. We have talked about jobs \nrepeatedly on this floor. Last night, we demonstrated through the \ntestimony and the charts that we are talking about some 575,000 jobs \nacross the country. We need to remember that when I talk about jobs, I \ndo not want people to think that Alaska is interested in opening up \nANWR just because it means jobs and opportunity for my constituents, \nfor the people in my State. It does. It means that, and it means more. \nIt means roads, hospitals, schools, and facilities. It enables people \nin my State to live, but it also means jobs across America.\n  As I said, this means 575,000 jobs across the country. If we look at \nthe numbers, they are all over the board: The State of New Jersey, \n178,000 jobs; the State of Pennsylvania, 27,000; the State of Ohio, \n25,000; the State of Kentucky, 10,000; the State of Texas, 47,000; the \nState of California, 63,000 jobs. We are talking about real jobs for \nreal Americans across the country.\n  We are considering the economic stimulus package that the President \nhas put forth. There is no better economic stimulus than jobs and job \nopportunity. We can provide that for America through ANWR, and they are \ngood-paying jobs.\n  I made the point last night--and it is compelling--that the job \nopportunities right now for Alaska are approximately 11,000 jobs within \nthe petroleum industry. If we were to accept this amendment, if we were \nto strip ANWR from the budget resolution, what these other States would \nbe saying is that it is OK for us to have petroleum-based jobs in our \nStates but, Alaska, we do not want you to have any more. We are cutting \nyou off. In other words, Massachusetts could keep its 20,000 petroleum-\nbased jobs, New Jersey could keep its 27,000 petroleum industry jobs, \nand New York could keep its 37,000 petroleum industry jobs, while \nAlaskans should look for alternatives.\n  The impression I get as an Alaskan, looking from the inside out, is \nthat the lower 48 would just as soon lock us up, not allow us to have \ngood-paying jobs that will feed our families and allow us to live in \nthe State we want to live.\n  But, no, the jobs we should have are jobs such as carrying the bags \nfor the tourists who come to our State. Yes, we want tourism but we \nalso want real jobs, and these petroleum-based jobs are jobs that are \nreal for Alaskans.\n  It is one thing if the residents of the State of Alaska said we do \nnot want this and Congress was trying to shove it down their throats, \nbut Alaskans have said yes. We have said we will accept responsible oil \ndevelopment and production in our backyard. We will take it, and we \nwill do it responsibly. We promise we will be responsible.\n  This gets to my last point, which is economic security and basically \nplain old common sense. There is kind of an 800-pound gorilla sitting \nin the Chamber now. We are literally at the brink of war. We do not \nknow what is going to happen in Iraq. We do not know if Saddam Hussein \nis going to torch the oil fields. We have no idea. What we do know is \nthat in the past several months, we have increased our imported oil \nfrom Iraq. We have doubled our imports from Iraq in the past couple of \nmonths. We have sent billions of dollars to Iraq. I am not quite sure \nhow the paper trail goes, but I do not think it is too farfetched to \nassume that we send billions of dollars to Iraq to Saddam Hussein, who \nin turn sells us the oil that we place in our aircraft or our\n\n[[Page S3949]]\n\nair carriers and we send our men and our women over to defend no-fly \nzones, to put them in harm's way, when we could be producing \ndomestically. If that does not keep us awake at night, I do not know \nwhat will. It does not make sense at this point in time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask for an additional minute.\n  Mr. STEVENS. One additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may continue.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I have placed on each Member's desk a copy of Review & \nOutlook from the Wall Street Journal that ran this morning. I urge each \nMember to review that, because it does speak exactly to the issue I \naddressed.\n  I conclude by reminding members of some very pertinent facts. ANWR \nhas more oil in it than the State of Texas. These are not made-up \nfacts. This is Department of Interior, USGS. This is not insignificant \nquantities we are dealing with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used her minute.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  I ask the Senator from Alaska, is it OK upon my completion of 5 \nminutes that Senator Feingold address the Senate for 5 minutes, and \nthen we would turn it back to the time of the Senator from Alaska? Is \nthat all right with the Senator?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, let's be clear. Ninety-five percent of \nAlaska's North Slope is open for drilling. That is a fact. We are \ntalking about the last 5 percent. The debate is whether that should be \nopened as well.\n  Clearly, this is going to be a very close vote. I have great respect \nfor the Senators from Alaska, but I would welcome it if they wanted to \nhelp preserve the environment in my State.\n  As far as jobs are concerned, there was a report done by the Joint \nEconomic Committee on March 14, 2002. They issued a report that said \nthere would be 65,000 jobs nationwide by 2020, an employment gain of \nless than one-tenth of 1 percent of the U.S. workforce, and CRS--that \nis the Congressional Research Service--Report No. R.S. 21030, October \n1, 2001, said under the most likely scenario, full development in the \nArctic would result in 60,000 jobs.\n  I am not one to say 60,000 jobs are no jobs--that is a lot of jobs--\nbut the more than 2 million jobs we have seen go down the drain in the \nlast 2 years, that is a bigger debate.\n  I also want to make the point that for those of us in California who \ndefend and protect our coastline from oil companies every day of the \nweek, we made a choice. Yes, we know there would be jobs developed \nthere, but it would destroy that coastline and have the potential for \nhorrific accidents and problems because we have experienced those.\n  So I say to my friends from Alaska, I hope they will understand the \npeople in this country who support keeping this 5 percent of the North \nSlope in its pristine environment are doing so because we think it is \ngood for the soul of this country, and we believe there are more jobs \nto be created through other means.\n  The reason I have this photograph--and it was challenged not by my \ncolleagues from Alaska at all but by others--this is clearly in the \ndevelopment area--and also by Secretary Norton, who is quoted in the \nnewspaper as saying the image of flat white nothingness is what one \nsees the majority of the year. This is the reason I felt compelled--and \nI was glad to see my colleague from Alaska say she agrees, it is \nmagnificent, and I wish every Member could have the chance to take a \nlook at this beautiful book, Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: Seasons \nof Life and Land. It is a photographic journey by this incredible \nphotographer through all the seasons. Some of the most beautiful scenes \nare in the winter. I know my colleagues cannot see this, but it shows \nthe birds and the snow and all the rest. It is quite beautiful.\n  I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Maybe Secretary Norton \nlooks at this and comes away with another point of view, and I respect \nthat. I just do not happen to agree with it.\n  In April--I think it is April 10--there will be an exhibit opened at \nthe Smithsonian on the Mall which will show these photographs, and \nmore. So I hope people will take a chance to look at it, because it is \nquite breathtaking to see.\n  I want to reiterate that I printed in the Record last night a letter \nfrom the Alaska Inter-Tribal Council. They have asked me to make a \npoint of this letter they have written, in which they say:\n\n       We urge you to reject . . . any other proposals to \n     authorize oil exploration and development of the birthplace \n     and nursery of the Porcupine Caribou Herd, the coastal plain \n     and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n\n  They talk about they support the Gwich'ins to seek permanent \nprotection of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I know the Gwich'in \npeople are here. I also know there are other tribal people here as \nwell, and I say that I have met with them many times and have been \ntouched and moved with their testimony. They are very proud the Alaska \nInter-Tribal Council that represents 187 tribes is with them, and they \nasked me specifically to put this letter into the Record.\n  Let me finish by saying the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has a \nbeautiful Web site and they say on it:\n\n       The Arctic refuge is among the most complete, pristine and \n     undisturbed ecosystems on Earth . . . a combination of \n     habitats, climate and geography unmatched by any other \n     northern conservation area.\n\n  This is a quote from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This is very \nclearly the point of view of most people, and I hope that we would \nhonor this God-given treasure today and vote to strip this language \nfrom the bill and take a stand in favor of keeping this area pristine.\n  I look forward to the remarks of Senator Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise today to support this amendment \nwhich is similar to one I offered in the Budget Committee. It would \nstrike the reconciliation instruction to the Energy Committee contained \nin the budget resolution before us.\n  This instruction requires the Energy Committee to produce $2.15 \nbillion by reporting out legislation by May 1, 2003, with the \nassumption that they open the coastal plain of the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge to oil drilling.\n  Management of the Arctic Refuge Coastal Plain has been hotly debated \nfor many years. Some Senators, like myself, believe that this area \nshould be designated as a Federal wilderness area. Other Senators \nbelieve that this area should be explored for its oil potential.\n  I support this amendment because I believe that the fate of the \ncoastal plain of the Arctic refuge is a question of Federal National \nWildlife Refuge management, not budgetary policy. If a Senator believes \nthat oil reserves which may be located under the coastal plain are \nneeded today, or 20 years from now, for reasons of enhancing this \ncountry's energy security, then the fate of the refuge is a question of \nenergy policy, not budgetary policy.\n  No matter where a Senator might consider himself or herself in the \ndiscussion over the fate of the refuge, and this issue was debated at \nlength during the Senate's consideration of the energy bill last year, \nno Senator has said that the primary reason to change the management of \nthe refuge was because we just needed the revenue.\n  In fact, the chairman of the Budget Committee, Mr. Nickles, again \nstated, when I offered my amendment in committee, that these \ninstructions are included in the budget resolution because Arctic \ndrilling is needed to stimulate the economy, create jobs, and produce \noil, not for purposes of revenue.\n  I know there are strongly held views on this topic, and I do not \nintend here to go into all the reasons why I have concerns about the \npossibility of oil drilling in the refuge. Other Senators who join in \noffering this amendment will be making that case and making it \neffectively.\n  I feel that the fate of the coastal plain of the Arctic refuge is too \nimportant to become a number in the budget process.\n  I also think that, for several reasons, Senators who support drilling \nin the\n\n[[Page S3950]]\n\nrefuge should support this amendment and object to using the budget \nresolution and reconciliation to achieve that goal.\n  As Senators know, debate on a reconciliation bill and all amendments, \ndebatable motions, and appeals related to it is limited to a total of \n20 hours. After 20 hours, debate ends. Consideration of amendments then \nmay continue without any debate.\n  I am concerned that using a fast track procedure like reconciliation \nto open the refuge exposes the Senate to criticism that we are using \nthe refuge revenues in part for tax cuts, or to authorize new spending \nprograms.\n  Particularly, the Senate may be accused of dispensing refuge revenues \nin unrelated accounts to gain political support for refuge drilling. \nOur constituents may also be concerned that we will have to spend a \ngreat deal to implement a drilling program in the Arctic refuge because \nmuch of the infrastructure needed to bring oil from the refuge to the \nrest of the country does not exist today.\n  As well, I am concerned that some Senators are supporting drilling in \nthe refuge because they feel that it can be done in an \n``environmentally safe'' way or they feel that it should be done \njointly with energy efficiency, oil savings, and alternative energy \nprograms to reduce our dependence upon foreign oil.\n  Reconciliation limits the way in which Senators who are concerned \nabout these issues, and who do not serve on the Energy Committee, are \nable to address those issues on the floor. ``It'' cuts it off. You \ncannot have a real debate about what should be done. It is simply a \nbudget number.\n  The Congressional Budget Act explicitly prohibits the offering of \nnongermane amendments to a reconciliation bill. If a Senator felt that \nthe Energy Committee's reconciliation bill opening the refuge did not \ngo far enough to regulate environmental impacts associated with Arctic \ndrilling, or to promote alternative energy in light of Arctic drilling, \nthe Senator may not be able to offer amendments on the floor to improve \nthe bill.\n  Such amendments, which might improve the bill from an environmental \nstandpoint, might well be considered extraneous because they do not \nraise revenue.\n  I would caution all members of the Senate who have committed to \nsupport Arctic drilling only in certain cases, or only if certain other \nlegislative or regulatory actions take place, to think seriously about \nwhether reconciliation serves their interests and their constituents' \ninterests.\n  Finally, I oppose using reconciliation because I believe it is being \nused to limit consideration of a controversial issue. The American \npeople have strongly held views on drilling in the refuge, and they \nwant to know that the Senate is working to pass legislation to manage \nthe area appropriately in a forthright and open process.\n  That will not be achieved if reconciliation instruction on the Arctic \nrefuge is included in the resolution before us. I urge support for my \namendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, the Senator from California could not \nbe more in error about the amount of land on our north arctic \nshoreline. It is not 95 percent open. There is the naval reserve No. 4. \nThat is 52 percent of the coastline closed. She knows it is closed.\n  Beyond that, the Senator from California comes in with a letter from \nthe Inter-Tribal Council of Alaska. That is a group of dissidents in \nAlaska, as far as I am concerned. The 100,000-member group of Alaskans \nknown as the Alaska Federation of Natives--my colleague Senator \nMurkowski had printed in the Record last night their Resolution 9505 \nabsolutely supporting opening of this area to oil and gas drilling.\n  The main thing is, in 1985 it was drilled pursuant to a law passed in \n1980 to drill a test well to see if the area could produce oil and gas. \nThe exact results have been classified, but we know it does have the \nlargest basin on the North American continent. If it is drilled, we \nexpect it to produce enormous amounts of oil. One estimate I have \nbefore me is the total expected reserves for oil and gas in nongas \nliquids from Alaska, not taking into account the price per barrel, is \n32.5 billion to 69.36 billion barrels.\n  When they first told us about the discovery in the Arctic known as \nPrudhoe Bay, they said the estimate was about a billion barrels. Last \nyear, we produced the 17 billionth barrel, and it is still producing. \nAs a consequence, we face a process of discrimination. We are crying to \nbe treated equally. In California, they have four refuges. Three of \nthem produce oil and gas: Hopper Mountain, Seal Beach, and Sutter. The \nfourth has a producing well and did not produce until 2000.\n  The Senator from California says, protect the pristine wildlife \nrefuges. This is an enormous area. Her area is less than 100,000 acres, \nand they are drilling it. It comes down to the question, How much are \nyou influenced by the extreme environmental movement in the United \nStates?\n  This comes down to a question of jobs. It is jobs. There are many \nAlaska Native people in the gallery now. They need jobs. This is their \narea. This is a chart showing how many of the wildlife refuges in the \nUnited States have oil and gas drilling: California has 4, two northern \nStates have 4 each, Illinois has 4, and there are 17 in Louisiana. \nLouisiana has proved you can have oil and gas drilling and compatible \nprotection of wildlife at the same time.\n  All we are seeking is to be treated equally. We have a whole series \nof points that have been made in the last few days. And when I have \nthis debate--there have been a lot of debates here since 1980. The \ncommitment was finally made by two friends of mine who are now \ndeceased, Senator Jackson and Senator Tsongas. After they made their \npledge, I helped them to get the whole bill passed, over 100 million \nacres.\n  There were newspaper ads: Ted Stevens, come home; you made a mistake. \nIf we lose today, I probably did make a mistake because I trusted the \nSenate. I trusted the Senate to follow the law. I hope the time comes \nwhen other people face the same proposition and they can rest assured.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am finding the source for the comment \nI made that Senator Stevens took issue with that the 5 percent of the \nNorth Slope was available for drilling. That comment was made by the \nInterior Secretary to the Senate in the committee. That statement was \nmade in 1995. I am putting my hands on the exact words.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut who has been a real \nleader in this fight, Senator Joe Lieberman.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend from California for \nthe steadfast and spirited advocacy she has made of this amendment.\n  We come in about half an hour to another moment of truth. President \nBush said earlier in the week that we were at a moment of truth with \nregard to Iraq and Saddam Hussein and weapons of mass destruction. I \nagreed with him. In half an hour we come to a different kind of moment \nof truth in the long, ongoing battle about whether we will preserve the \nmagnificent natural gift we received from our Creator in the Arctic \nRefuge known as the American Serengeti and inhabited by so many \nmagnificent species of wildlife, for a very small amount of oil.\n\n  This question, this moment of truth also raises the question about \nwhether we will accept a contention of the Bush administration that \nsomehow, by doing this, we are solving America's energy problem. With \nall respect, there could not be a more ridiculous contention.\n  The facts are clear. If drilling occurs by the year 2020, our \ndependence on foreign oil, as a result of the oil from the Arctic \nRefuge, will be reduced from 62 percent to 60 percent. That is not the \nroad to energy independence.\n  Those of us on both sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats, \nwho oppose drilling in the Arctic Refuge support new domestic energy \nproduction, including new fossil fuel energy production. In fact, it is \nworth pointing out that the previous administration leased more land \nfor energy development than either of the preceding two. But it opposed \ndrilling for oil in the Arctic Refuge. Those decisions need not be \nhazardous to our environment. They need not destroy precious places. \nEach must be evaluated in light of the\n\n[[Page S3951]]\n\nspecific environmental consequences of the exploration, and our most \nimportant shared environmental treasures must be placed off limits.\n  The Arctic Refuge, in my opinion, is one such place. We simply would \nnot gain enough in oil or energy independence to justify long-term harm \nto this place. The facts in that regard are clear. Setting up the \nintricate infrastructure required to pump oil out of the refuge will \ndespoil the land and its ecosystems forever. After hundreds of pin \npricks, the refuge will be in that sense bleeding, its wildlife will be \nreeling. We will never be able to get it back to where it was.\n  Supporters of drilling insist on numbers that grossly overestimate \nthe benefits and underestimate the cost. Could the drilling in the \nrefuge coexist with wildlife? Not by a long shot. The USGS, part of the \nadministration, confirmed that development of the refuge would result \nin substantial environmental destruction.\n  Do we want to tear up this magnificent piece of America for such a \ntiny reward, when harnessing American technology to improve \nconservation and efficiency and developing alternative energy sources \ncould reap many times the benefit? To me, the answer is clear. Oil \ndrilling in the refuge is not a path to energy independence. It is not \na path to economic security. It is, in fact, a road to ruin, \nenvironmental ruin of this wildlife refuge. The oil that would be \ngained will come and go in almost no time. But the destruction will \nlast forever.\n  This is an unsettled time in our Nation's history. People feel \ninsecure about so much--about the war in Iraq, about terrorism, about \neconomic insecurity. It does seem to me that the decision we make today \nrelates to that. There have to be some places, some things, some \nvalues, some natural treasures that do not change, that we have to \nprotect, particularly at this moment. This is a place from which we \ngain strength, from which we gain purpose, from which we gain \ntranquility. Let us not, in the pressures of the moment, let it be \ndestroyed forever.\n  I quote, finally, the words of Theodore Roosevelt, who may be \nconsidered in his time to be an extreme environmentalist. In 1916 TR \nsaid:\n\n       The greatest good for the greatest number applies to the \n     number within the womb of time, compared to which those now \n     alive form but an insignificant fraction. Our duty to the \n     whole, including the unborn generations, bids us to restrain \n     an unprincipled present-day minority from wasting the \n     heritage of these unborn generations.\n\n  The final sentence from TR, President Teddy Roosevelt:\n\n       The movement for the conservation of wildlife and the \n     larger movement for the conservation of all of our natural \n     resources are essentially democratic in spirit, purpose, and \n     method.\n\n  Those are timeless words which come home to us almost a century later \nas we face the moment of truth for today and for tomorrow in this vote. \nI urge my colleagues, please support the best of America. Vote for this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield myself just 1 minute while the Senator from \nConnecticut is here. We have 77 percent of all the wild refuges in the \nUnited States in Alaska. We are talking about 2,000 acres out of almost \n90 million acres of land.\n  I don't understand people who stand here and say save this pristine \npart of the United States. I invite all of them--I will take them up \nthere right now and let them see the Arctic Slope. It is frozen tundra. \nLook at this map. That shows how much of this area is withdrawn. The \nSenator from California says it is 95 percent--look at it. If you go \nfrom the coast on the Arctic coast of Alaska, it is not open. The only \npart of Federal land that is really open now is 1.5 million acres that \nwas left open by the Jackson-Tsongas amendment. The rest of it is \nclosed.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Parliamentary inquiry: Could you tell me how much time \nremains on the Senator from Alaska's side and how much on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 12 minutes 29 \nseconds; the Senator from Alaska has 13 \\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask the Senator, what is your preference? Senator \nChafee would like to speak, but if you would like to take some time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I was waiting for Senator Domenici. I \nthink Senator Chafee was waiting for time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was just asking my colleague if he preferred Senator \nDomenici to go since he just spoke.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We will wait.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 5 minutes for Senator Chafee. I want to say he is \na leader on this issue, and he is one of six Republicans who signed a \nletter saying don't deal with this issue in the context of a budget \nresolution. I look forward to hearing his 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I accepted an offer last August to go to \nANWR, to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Since I have been here \nfor 3 years, I have heard a lot of debate about it, and I assumed I \nheard a lot of exaggeration also. I wanted to go myself and so I \naccepted the invitation.\n  I took a bush plane from Fairbanks over the Brooks Range, as you see \nhere. The Brooks Range is very desolate, almost devoid of any sign of \nlife, any sign of vegetation. It is quite a trip over the Brooks Range. \nAs we cleared that mountainous terrain, stretching out before the \nArctic Ocean, the Beaufort Sea, was the most gorgeous grasslands, the \nlast thing I expected to see that far north.\n  We banked around with our bush plane and you can see here where we \nlanded. As we banked in for a landing, scurrying through the brush was \na big, brown, cinnamon-colored beast, a grizzly bear.\n  We got out of our plane and immediately were covered with tremendous \namounts of mosquitoes. It was quite an experience. We pulled the nets \non our hats over our heads and set up our tents, which we can see here. \nWe had some chow and then that night it snowed. We came on the Brooks \nRange earlier, and they had no snow on them, but the snow came that \nnight. Thankfully, we never saw another mosquito, so we had the great \nexperience of having mosquitoes but then had 2 days--3 days in order to \nhike around the area. Every day we would hike for as much as 4 or 5 \nhours, then come in for lunch, and go out and hike for the afternoon \nanother 4 or 5 hours.\n  In August, it is just as light at 3 in the afternoon as it is at 3 in \nthe morning, so it is quite an experience that far up.\n  I will have to say, Senator Stevens, this is the most beautiful \nplace. I have been in 49 out of 50 States. The only one I have not been \nin is Hawaii. This is the most beautiful place I have ever been.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The oilwells are just 25 miles away; does he know that?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes. I will conclude in that direction. Not only did we \nsee the grizzly bears and one caribou--the caribou migration had gone \nthrough, but we did see one caribou--but we saw all kinds of life: \nGround squirrels, prairie chickens--I think they call them ptarmigan. \nWe also saw all sorts of birds and saw also the signs of life--musk ox \ndroppings. We didn't see musk ox, but we saw the droppings all over the \nplace. So obviously they had been there. All kinds of caribou droppings \nwere everywhere you went.\n  What a surprise it was to go this far north and see such beautiful \ncountry. It is like the plains of Wyoming or Montana. And it was a \ngreat surprise to me.\n\n  So all the environmentalists who talk about it being the Serengeti of \nAmerica, they are right. This is unique. It is special. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment for that reason.\n  On the trip, we then had an opportunity to go to Prudhoe Bay. And \nwhat a change it is, as you go west from the 1002 area, which is where \nwe were camping, to Prudhoe Bay. Before we leave the 1002 area, here we \nare, as shown on this picture. There I am, my wife Stephanie, the small \nband of us up there braving the elements, experiencing the 1002 area.\n  When we went to Prudhoe Bay, it was a change in the topography. It \ngets much more pockmarked with water. It is a lot different from what \nwe saw here in ANWR. And it seems more suitable for man's incursion and \nfor drilling as you get closer to Prudhoe Bay.\n  We landed in Prudhoe Bay. We went to the hotel, which was a \ncollection,\n\n[[Page S3952]]\n\nreally, of trailers put together. And the proprietor of the hotel at \nPrudhoe Bay said: Be careful. There is a grizzly bear in town. His name \nis Toby. When you walk around, just be careful. You never know. You \ndon't want to surprise him and have him attack you. So just keep your \nwits about you.\n  We had a great tour of Prudhoe Bay. And after we left and came back \nto the States, about 2 months later, I saw, in the New York Times, a \nlittle filler article, that Toby was getting into the inn where we were \nstaying and they had to put him down. So it made the New York Times, \nToby getting into the inn and having to be put down.\n  But the point is, there should be places for the Tobys of the world. \nAnd then there are other places where we should drill. And, obviously, \nthey are incompatible. No one wanted to harm Toby, but it just came to \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may continue.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Senator.\n  Madam President, that is the point. There should be areas of the \nworld for man and drilling, and then there should be areas of the world \nfor the Tobys of the world. And if we are going to proceed with \ndrilling in ANWR, absent any effort at conservation--and many of the \nSenators who are going to vote in favor of drilling in ANWR did not \nvote for raising the CAFE standards that would save much more of our \nresources in natural fuels--that is a bad policy and a wrong direction \nto go.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I am delighted the Senator from Rhode \nIsland has gone to our State and seen it in August. I would invite him \nto come up and join me right now, and go take a look at that same \nplace.\n  But what I would really like for him to do is to remember, if I had \nnot changed my vote in 1980, there would have been no refuge at all. It \nwas a wildlife range. My colleague wanted to block it entirely, and I \nassociated myself with Senator Jackson and Senator Tsongas and got the \njob done, and got it withdrawn, so we could proceed with development. \nAnd now the colleagues you have joined want to renege on the commitment \nthat was made to me as a Senator by two distinguished leaders of the \nSenate, the Senator's father included.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time remains, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 13 minutes; the \nSenator from California has 6 minutes 13 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I yield the Senator from New Mexico 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, fellow Senators, I come from New \nMexico. New Mexico is right next to Mexico. Mexico has oil underground, \nGod made. Do you know what they call it? They call it their patrimony. \nIt is so important that they claim it is theirs and it is their \nfuture--not locked up under the ground--to use. It is their patrimony. \nIn fact, in Spanish, they say: ``El patrimonio del pais es el \npetroleo.'' That is how important it is.\n  Now, for all of those who have been here giving speeches about making \nsure we protect the ANWR wilderness, look at this picture. Look at this \npicture with me. You see this big, blue picture? I am going to go \naround the edges for you. Isn't that big?\n  Senator, do you want to take a look? That is drawn to scale. That is \nANWR. Unless you have very good glasses, very good eyes, you can't see, \nfrom your seat, where ANWR's drilling sites will be, because it will be \nthat big, Senator. Can you see that little spot?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes, I can.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is how big the development for oil for America \nwill be out of this wilderness.\n  Now, anybody who blesses this floor piously about preservation is \nignoring the reality. America cannot live without oil. I wish we could.\n  Alaska is America. Oil in Alaska is our patrimony, just like oil in \nMexico is the patrimony of the Republic of Mexico. To say that using \nthat piece of property--see it. I am not sure our TV cameras are \nshowing it to Americans, that is how big it is.\n  It is now said, that is all you need to drill for oil--to do what?--\nto produce as much oil as the State of Texas produces. There are even \nenvironmentalists who say, in their literature, it is an irrelevant \namount of oil, it is not needed.\n  Well, Madam President, as I crossed America, looking to find \ncomparisons, as soon as I got to Texas, I asked, how much oil is there? \nThey told me, it is almost the exact amount of billions of barrels of \nreserve as is in this tiny piece of property as big as the properties \nat Dulles here in Virginia.\n  So if this is irrelevant to America, I assume we should not have \ndrilled in Texas. How much oil might it produce? About the same amount \nas California per year. I ask Senator Nickles, is one to say \nCalifornia's production is not needed? We are so rich and arrogant \nabout our wealth that we can throw away this huge amount of oil? We \ndon't need it for America?\n  I believe to turn this down is not an insult to Alaska; it is not \nreneging on something to Ted Stevens; it is an absolute denial to the \nAmerican people of the increased prospect of reasonably priced oil for \nthe future.\n  If you are worried about the future high prices of oil and you want \nto blame someone, I say, blame the vote this afternoon. If this is \ndefeated, you can put it right up there along with any other country \nthat you assume is out to raise prices on the American consumer. \nBecause that vote, denying the right of Americans to produce this oil, \nwill just as assuredly result in the prospect of increased costs of oil \nto Americans.\n  I wish we could stand on the floor and say: Americans, we have a \nplan. We are going to dramatically reduce the number of automobiles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the Senator, could I have 1 additional minute?\n  He said yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me just say, I wish we had a plan that said: In the \nfuture, we do not need all this; we do not need all these cars; we can \nget by with far less. But, frankly, I believe, under any scenario, for \nthe next 25 to 30 years, our children, our way of life, our standard of \nliving, demand that we do right and that we use that tiny piece of real \nestate without doing damage to this gigantic wilderness to produce \nenergy for our great country.\n  I thank Senator Stevens for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time \nremains on each side, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 6 minutes 13 \nseconds; the Senator from Alaska has 7 minutes 25 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to retain my time to close debate, if it is \nall right with the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield my colleague 2 minutes, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, it has been suggested in the past few \nminutes and last evening that instead of opening ANWR, we need to look \nto conservation; we need to discuss CAFE standards; we need to look to \nalternative fuels.\n  We need to keep ANWR in context. This is not an either/or debate. \nThese concepts are not mutually exclusive. We have to have increased \nconservation efforts, of course. That is reasonable. But as the Senator \nfrom New Mexico has stated, we will never be entirely free in our \nreliance on oil, on petroleum products.\n  When you look at what we get from petroleum products, it is not just \nthe gasoline that goes in our vehicles. That is not the only issue. We \nuse it in our\n\n[[Page S3953]]\n\nplastics. We use it for Band-Aids, for perfume, for so many things that \nyou can't even imagine. We will continue to need gas. We will continue \nto need oil. These are necessary for us as a society.\n  To suggest that we are going to conserve our way out of reliance on \npetroleum is not reasonable. It is not feasible. We have to accept \nboth. We need the domestic energy sources that only ANWR can provide to \nus. We have heard it repeated time and time again today and yesterday \nand in the years throughout the debate, this is where the energy \nreserves are. We can't deny that. We can't be put off or led astray by \nlooking at nice pictures and thinking that somehow or other in order to \npreserve this area, we have to give up development.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 5 minutes 24 \nseconds. The Senator from California has 6 minutes 13 seconds. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, momentarily we will be voting on the \nBoxer amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote no. I compliment my \ncolleagues, Senators Stevens and Murkowski. I listened to the debate \nlast night and today. If people are interested in the facts, they \nhappen to know the facts. They live there. They have been there. A lot \nof people are pointing out pristine pictures of wildlife.\n  That is not the 1002 area that would be drilled. I have seen that. We \ncan do drilling in that area in a very environmentally sensitive and \nsound way. We can do it. Our country happens to need that million \nbarrels per day of domestic oil that can be produced. We need it. If \nnot, we will be buying it from Iraq. We will be buying it from the \nMiddle East. We will be buying it from areas that are a lot more \nvulnerable than Alaska. This way we can keep the jobs in the United \nStates. This way we can keep production and our dollars in the United \nStates.\n  We have a tradition in the Senate that we listen to home State \nSenators in areas that concern their State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield myself an additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Alaska yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Certainly.\n  Mr. NICKLES. For people who live outside the State and have never \nbeen in this area to try to dictate that we should never drill there, \nwithout living there, and override and superimpose their will over the \ntwo home State Senators, I find to be almost incredible. It is denying \nAlaska a chance to grow. It is denying our country a chance to grow.\n  I urge my colleagues to listen to Senator Stevens, to listen to \nSenator Murkowski, and let's allow some environmentally safe and sound \nproduction that our country desperately needs.\n  I thank my colleagues from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask the Chair to let me know when I have 1 minute \nleft.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will notify the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, this is a diagram of the 1002 area. I \npointed out previously that in 1958 there was a well drilled just east \nof Kaktovik. It is still classified as the result of overwhelming \ninterest by the oil industry after that to conduct seismic in this \narea. This is the Marsh Creek anticline. East of that area is where \nthis enormous reservoir is. To the west going over to the river, where \nthis is the Prudhoe Bay area, that has all been very prolific. There \nwas a well drilled off shore in Camden Bay. There has been a series of \nwells drilled offshore. The only well that has been drilled onshore was \nin 1985.\n  This is an area, as I said, a million and a half acres that in 1980 \nwas kept open for oil and gas exploration by the Tsongas-Jackson \namendment. The balance of this area is wilderness. This has never been \nwilderness. We heard repeatedly about wilderness.\n  I have now been here 35 years. I have trusted the Senate quite often. \nThe one time I really trusted Senators was when I decided to work with \nSenators Tsongas and Jackson to get this bill passed, get it done. We \nthought we had a substantial concession in the fact that the Arctic \nSlope would continue to be open for oil and gas exploration as it was \nintended by President Eisenhower, as it was intended entirely up until \n1980.\n  Through the period of the discussion of this matter, since 1980, I \nhave had a series of Senators tell me, I will be with you if you need \nme. They know who they are. This is the day that I need them. This vote \nis going to be very close. It represents a vote that culminates some \nsubstantial period of my life because I started working on this area in \n1956.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will save it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nLautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from California. In a short \nstatement I would like to identify what has happened since 1989 when \nthe Exxon Valdez ran aground, since the period of time when the court \nsaid that ExxonMobil should pay $9 billion in punitive damages for the \nhavoc it created in Prince William Sound. Lest we be fooled that these \nenvironmental stewards are going to take good care of our assets, of \nour natural resources, let's look at what happened.\n  The fine is now down $4 billion. This is since shortly after 1989. \nAnd who is paying the tariff here? Well, the Anchorage Daily News on \nAugust 4, 1998, reported ``Apparently Delay Pays.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 1 minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Exxon is earning $90,000 an hour, about $2 million a \nday, or nearly $800 million a year, on the same $5 billion as long as \nthe case drags on. And the money stays in its coffers. They are not \neven paying for it. In fact, what they are doing is making money, \ninterest on that money which belongs to the citizens of the country and \nfor the protection of our environment.\n  What we are looking at is a corporate behavior that should be \nunacceptable under any standard and where they are using this \nopportunity to cash in on delays by skillful lawyers instead of paying \ntheir obligation as it fell upon them through the courts.\n  It is an outrage. We cannot trust these people to take care of this \nenvironment of ours for our children and our grandchildren. I hope the \nBoxer amendment passes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 5 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to be told when I have a minute left.\n  We are reaching the end of a tough debate. It is a very close vote, \nno doubt about it. The Vice President, I understand, is on his way over \nin case it is a tie vote. I want to pick up on something Senator \nNickles said when he kind of cast aspersions on those who live outside \nof the State of Alaska and are speaking up in favor of this Arctic \nWildlife Refuge.\n  Let me be clear. I come from a State that has millions of acres of \nwilderness, thousands and thousands of acres of beautiful Federal land. \nWe are very proud of it. We have forests, desert, wetlands, and the \nrest, including Yosemite National Park. Let me be clear. I welcome the \nsupport of my colleagues. I don't shun it. I welcome them to help me \npreserve those acres for the people of California and the people of the \ncountry and, indeed, the people of the world. In our State, we consider \nthese treasures not only to be God-given resources, but we look at them \nas God-given resources that we, the people of this planet, have to \nprotect.\n  I am interested in Senator Domenici's presentation. It was well done. \nHe has a big chart and he has a dot on the chart. He says: Look at \nthis, it is a dot on this chart. Well, if you go up into space and you \nlook at the Earth, it looks like a little marble. Does that\n\n[[Page S3954]]\n\nmean we should not care about what happens on God's Earth?\n  So I think we are getting to the point at which we have to make a \nchoice. Do we want to change the policy and go into this beautiful \nrefuge or do we want to look at other ways to get more energy--I \nunderscore, much more energy?\n  Look, if we just close the loopholes on SUVs--by the way, I represent \na lot of soccer moms and let me tell you, they want their SUVs, and \nthey want to get better fuel economy from them. I live in a community \nwhere almost every other car is big because I live in suburbia. They \nwant to have the option to drive those cars and not have to spend $100 \nevery time they fill up the tank. If we were just to close that SUV \nloophole, we would save, by 2030, 10 billion barrels of oil. This is \nwhat we are talking about. That is far more than you would get out of \nthe Arctic. If you moved up the fuel economy just to 35 miles a \ngallon--listen to this--we would be 43 percent less dependent upon \nforeign oil. With ANWR, it is 2 percent.\n  Vote for the Boxer amendment. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  The Senator from Alaska has 1 minute 2 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, again, I think this is the most \nimportant vote in the history of my service in the Senate. I worked on \nthis with President Eisenhower. Our people were about ready to go to \nwar. He said in World War II that our ships, our planes, and our tanks \nmust have oil. That will continue on into the future. Opening this area \nwill not give our people oil now but will assure that we have a greater \nreserve in the future.\n  My last comment is this. In the time I have served here, many people \nhave made commitments to me, and I have never broken a commitment in my \nlife. I make this commitment: People who vote against this today are \nvoting against me, and I will not forget it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, this is a country of laws, not men. This \nis a country that treasures its God-given gifts--from the mountains, to \nthe prairies, to the oceans white with foam. God bless America, my home \nsweet home.\n  This isn't about us being here for 2 years, or 6 years, or 10 years, \nor 20, or even 50. We will be gone. But we need to think about the \nfuture. We can do more for our troops were we just to increase fuel \neconomy. We will save far more doing that than by drilling in a \npristine area that has wildlife that looks like this picture.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Regular order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I hope we will stand with the \nenvironment and vote for the Boxer amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nBoxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 272. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 48, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 59 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--52\n\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--48\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 272) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have been authorized by the manager of \nthe bill to yield 20 minutes to the Senator from West Virginia, Senator \nByrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                      america's image in the world\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I believe in this great and beautiful \ncountry. I have studied its roots and gloried in the wisdom of its \nmagnificent Constitution and its inimitable history. I have marveled at \nthe wisdom of its Founders and Framers. Generation after generation of \nAmericans has understood the lofty ideals that underlie our great \nRepublic. I have been inspired by the story of their sacrifice and \ntheir strength.\n  But today I weep for my country. I have watched the events of recent \nmonths with a heavy, heavy heart.\n  No more is the image of American one of strong, yet benevolent \npeacekeeper. The image of America has changed. Around the globe, our \nfriends mistrust us, our word is disputed, our intentions are \nquestioned.\n  Instead of reasoning with those with whom we disagree, we demand \nobedience or threaten recrimination. Instead of isolating Saddam \nHussein, we seem to have succeeded in isolating ourselves. We proclaim \na new doctrine of preemption which is understood by few but feared by \nmany. We say that the United States has the right to turn its firepower \non any corner of the globe which might be suspect in the war on \nterrorism. We assert that right without the sanction of any \ninternational body. As a result, the world has become a much more \ndangerous place.\n  We flaunt our superpower status with arrogance. We treat U.N. \nSecurity Council members like ingrates who offend our princely dignity \nby lifting their heads from the carpet. Valuable alliances are split. \nAfter war has ended, the United States will have to rebuild much more \nthan the country of Iraq. We will have to rebuild America's image \naround the globe.\n  The case this administration tries to make to justify its fixation \nwith war is tainted by charges of falsified documents and \ncircumstantial evidence. We cannot convince the world of the necessity \nof this war for one simple reason: This is not a war of necessity, but \na war of choice.\n  There is no credible information to connect Saddam Hussein to 9/11, \nat least up to this point. The twin towers fell because a world-wide \nterrorist group, al Qaida, with cells in over 60 nations, struck at our \nwealth and our influence by turning our own planes into missiles, one \nof which would likely have slammed into the dome of this beautiful \nCapitol except for the brave sacrifice of some of the passengers who \nwere on board that plane.\n\n  The brutality seen on September 11th and in other terrorist attacks \nwe have witnessed around the globe are the violent and desperate \nefforts by extremists to stop the daily encroachment of Western values \nupon their cultures. That is what we fight. It is a force not confined \nto territorial borders. It is a shadowy entity with many faces, many \nnames, and many addresses.\n\n[[Page S3955]]\n\n  But, this administration has directed all of the anger, fear, and \ngrief which emerged from the ashes of the Twin Towers and the twisted \nmetal of the Pentagon towards a tangible villain, one we can see and \nhate and attack. And villain he is. But he is the wrong villain. And \nthis is the wrong war. If we attack Saddam Hussein, we will probably \ndrive him from power. But the zeal of our friends to assist our global \nwar on terrorism may have already taken flight.\n  The general unease surrounding this war is not just due to ``orange \nalert.'' There is a pervasive sense of rush and risk and too many \nquestions unanswered. How long will we be in Iraq? What will be the \ncost? What is the ultimate mission? How great is the danger at home?\n  A pall has fallen over the Senate Chamber. We avoid our solemn duty \nto debate the one topic on the minds of all Americans, even while \nscores of thousands of our sons and daughters faithfully do their duty \nin Iraq.\n  What is happening to this country--my country, your country, our \ncountry? When did we become a nation which ignores and berates our \nfriends and calls them irrelevant? When did we decide to risk \nundermining international order by adopting a radical and doctrinaire \napproach to using our awesome military might? How can we abandon \ndiplomatic efforts when the turmoil in the world cries out for \ndiplomacy?\n  Why can this President not seem to see that America's true power lies \nnot in its will to intimidate, but in its ability to inspire?\n  War appears inevitable. But I continue to hope that the cloud will \nlift. Perhaps Saddam will yet turn tail and run. Perhaps reason will \nsomehow still prevail. I along with millions, scores of millions of \nAmericans will pray for the safety of our troops, for the innocent \ncivilians--women, children, babies, old and young, crippled, deformed, \nsick--in Iraq, and for the security of our homeland.\n\n  May God continue to bless the United States of America in the \ntroubled days ahead, and may we somehow recapture the vision which for \nthe present eludes us.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Expressions of approval or disapproval are not permitted.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to use time \nunder the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I observed the comments of the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia concerning the events which \nare about to transpire within the next hour or so, or days. I did not \nreally look forward to coming to the floor and debating the issue. It \nhas been debated. It has been discussed in the media. It has been \ndiscussed at every kitchen table in America. But I felt it would be \nimportant for me to respond to allegations concerning the United States \nof America, its status in the world, and, in particular, what happens \nafter this conflict is over, which I do not think we have paid enough \nattention to, perhaps understandably, because our first and foremost \nconsideration is the welfare of the young men and women we are sending \nin harm's way.\n  But to allege that somehow the United States of America has demeaned \nitself or tarnished its reputation by being involved in liberating the \npeople of Iraq, to me, simply is neither factual nor fair.\n  The United States of America has involved itself in the effort to \ndisarm Saddam Hussein, and now freedom for the Iraqi people, with the \nsame principles that motivated the United States of America in most of \nthe conflicts we have been involved in, most recently Kosovo and \nBosnia, and in which, in both of those cases, the United States \nnational security was not at risk, but what was at risk was our \nadvocacy and willingness to serve and sacrifice on behalf of people who \nare the victims of oppression and genocide.\n  We did not go into Bosnia because Mr. Milosevic had weapons of mass \ndestruction. We did not go into Kosovo because ethnic Albanians or \nothers were somehow a threat to the security of the United States. We \nentered into those conflicts because we could not stand by and watch \ninnocent men, women, and children being slaughtered, raped, and \n``ethnically cleansed.'' We found a new phrase for our lexicon: \n``ethnic cleansing.'' Ethnic cleansing is a phrase which has incredible \nimplications.\n  The mission our military is about to embark on is fraught with \ndanger, and it means the loss of brave young American lives. But I also \nbelieve it offers the opportunity for a new day for the Iraqi people.\n  Madam President, there is one thing I am sure of, that we will find \nthe Iraqi people have been the victims of an incredible level of \nbrutalization, terror, murder, and every other kind of disgraceful and \ndistasteful oppression on the part of Saddam Hussein's regime. And \ncontrary to the assertion of the Senator from West Virginia, when the \npeople of Iraq are liberated, we will again have written another \nchapter in the glorious history of the United States of America, that \nwe will fight for the freedom of other citizens of the world, and we \nagain assert the most glorious phrase, in my view, ever written in the \nEnglish language; and that is: We hold these truths to be self-evident, \nthat all men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with \ncertain inalienable rights, and among these are life, liberty, and the \npursuit of happiness.\n  The people of Iraq, for the first time, will be able to realize those \ninalienable rights. I am proud of the United States of America. I am \nproud of the leadership of the President of the United States.\n\n  It is not an easy decision to send America's young men and women into \nharm's way. As I said before, some of them will not be returning. But \nto somehow assert, as some do, that the people of Iraq and the Middle \nEast are not entitled to those same God-given rights that Americans and \npeople all over the country are, that they do not have those same hopes \nand dreams and aspirations our own citizens do, to me, is a degree of \ncondescension. I might even use stronger language than that to describe \nit.\n  So I respectfully disagree with the remarks of the Senator from West \nVirginia. I believe the President of the United States has done \neverything necessary and has exercised every option short of war, which \nhas led us to the point we are today.\n  I believe that, obviously, we will remove a threat to America's \nnational security because we will find there are still massive amounts \nof weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.\n  Although Theodore Roosevelt is my hero and role model, I also, in \nmany ways, am Wilsonian in the respect that America, this great Nation \nof ours, will again contribute to the freedom and liberty of an \noppressed people who otherwise never might enjoy those freedoms.\n  So perhaps the Senator from West Virginia is right. I do not think \nso. Events will prove one of us correct in the next few days. But I \nrely on history as my guide to the future, and history shows us, \nunequivocally, that this Nation has stood for freedom and democracy, \neven at the risk and loss of American lives, so that all might enjoy \nthe same privileges or have the opportunity to someday enjoy the same \nprivileges as we do in this noble experiment called the United States \nof America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CRAPO).\n  The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 284\n\n(Purpose: To fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act in 2004 and reduce \n       debt by reducing tax breaks for the wealthiest taxpayers)\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senators Kennedy, Harkin, Bingaman, Kerry, Mikulski, \nJohnson, Sarbanes, Edwards, and Clinton. \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for herself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Harkin,\n\n[[Page S3956]]\n\n     Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \n     Sarbanes, Mr. Edwards, and Mrs. Clinton proposes an amendment \n     numbered 284.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the amendment I offer is the one I spoke \nabout earlier today. Clearly, we are in a very important day in the \nhistory of this country, and really of this world, as we wait to find \nout what is going to happen in Iraq. All of our thoughts and prayers \nare with the young men and women who wait, as we do, to see what is \ngoing to happen. Certainly our country is anxious and on edge, and we \nall hope they are successful. We all hope this endeavor leaves us where \nthis country needs to be. But certainly a lot else is going on as well.\n  Here we are on the floor of the Senate debating a budget resolution \nthat has been put forward by the majority party.\n  I am one of those who come to the Chamber to express my serious \nconcern that the budget before us does not include any funds to pay for \nthe war in Iraq, nor does it pay for the peace we hope will ensue \nafterwards. We do not know what the cost is going to be. Yet hidden \ninside this budget is a major tax cut that will make it impossible for \nus to be able to provide what is important for the country, whether it \nis a war in Iraq or, as my constituents are worried about, a conflict \nin North Korea, if one occurs there as well.\n  Also, in this budget we are looking at tremendous cuts to the \neducation of our young children. It is especially important today, as \nwe face the uncertain future of where we go from here, that we give \nsome certainty to the children in our classrooms, because now more than \never we need to make sure they have a solid education, that they are \ncapable of making it through school with the skills they need so they \ncan help get our economy back on track and make us strong for whatever \nfuture conflict the country may find itself in, but also so they can be \nproductive adults.\n  Not very long ago this body passed a bill called No Child Left \nBehind. It was a promise from the President and all of us who worked on \nit that we would put in place for the first time strong accountability \nrules for the public education system. We would hold schools, teachers, \nand principals accountable to make sure our students met the high \nstandards we were setting. But that was not all the legislation \npromised. It also promised that we would fund what was necessary to \nhelp our children reach those goals.\n  It promised that every classroom would have a high-quality teacher. \nThat is a problem in our country today where many teachers are in \nclassrooms where they don't have the skills they need to teach the \nsubjects they are required to teach. It requires in this bill that we \nhave a highly qualified teacher in every classroom. That doesn't just \nhappen. It happens because we make sure the resources are there to do \nit. Without the money to make that happen, we have passed on an \nunfunded mandate to the States.\n  We said in No Child Left Behind that children will be in an \nenvironment where they can learn. Far too many children are in \nclassrooms that have 35 or 40 children in first, second, and third \ngrade classrooms. There is no way those children who come to class, \nmany of them in very difficult situations, have the ability to learn \nbasic math, science, English, writing skills because they don't have \nthe time of a teacher when there are too many kids in the classroom. We \nneed to make sure we help provide the resources so we don't set kids up \nto test but that we actually provide the resources so they are in a \nsmall enough classroom with a highly qualified teacher.\n  The budget before us does not provide funds for this. It only comes \nthrough with half of the promise we gave to our children several years \nago that we would leave no child behind. It leaves the promise of \ntesting, but it does not fulfill the promise of funding.\n  The amendment I have sent to the desk will fully fund the No Child \nLeft Behind Act. It says it is a priority of our country that we will \nnot just pass an unfunded mandate on to States but that we will assure \nthat children have afterschool programs so they can get the extra \nskills they need to catch up and pass the tests we are requiring them \nto take. It means we will fully fund title I funding so that 6 million \nof our most disadvantaged students will not be left behind. It provides \nfunds for English language acquisition and safe and drug free schools \nand, importantly, rural education.\n\n  The Presiding Officer knows, as I do, that in many of our rural \nschool districts we have a difficult time attracting qualified \nteachers. They often leave to go to urban or suburban schools where it \nis easier to teach. We want to make sure that even if there are only 40 \nkids in a school building, that they get the same help and instruction \nand qualified teachers so they can learn the skills they need to pass \nthe tests we have required of them. My amendment will make sure that we \nfund the rural education programs.\n  If we don't do this, we are passing an unfunded mandate on to States \nat a time that they cannot afford to take it. My State legislature is \nfacing a $2.5 billion budget deficit right now. They are struggling to \ncome to some difficult decisions. It is extremely unfair of us at the \nFederal level to tell them, while they are struggling through these \nbudget decisions, that they now have a new unfunded mandate of making \nsure children pass tests; otherwise, their schools are failing and not \nproviding the funds to make sure that happens.\n  Our State legislators do not have the funds to fund a Federal \nmandate. If we will not follow through with the funding, we cannot keep \nthe first half of No Child Left Behind that says that schools have to \nbe held accountable. I don't want to lower the standards. I don't want \nto take that accountability away. But I also do not want to pass on an \nunfunded mandate to schools today when they are struggling with fewer \nresources because our own State legislatures are having difficulty in \nthese tough economic times giving them the tools they need. I hope we \ndon't fail at No Child Left Behind by not providing funding but \nproviding the mandates.\n  It will be imperative for this Congress to come back and revisit this \nif we don't provide the funds because I assure you every school board \nmember--and I was a school board member at one time--will be back here \nscreaming about unfunded mandates. We will end up having to take steps \nbackward in accountability in order to accommodate them. I don't think \nthat is where any Member here wants to go.\n  The amendment I sent to the desk will help us reach that goal by \nfully funding the No Child Left Behind Act so we can keep both sides of \nthe promise that we made to the children and to the parents and to the \nschool employees and to the districts across the country that when we \nsaid No Child Left Behind, we said accountability, but we also said \nresources.\n  I stand here terribly conscious that Senator Wellstone no longer sits \nbehind me because of the tragedy that occurred right before the \nelection of last year. I know if Senator Wellstone were here, he would \nbe walking up and down this aisle yelling about the fact that we can't \neducate kids on a tin cup budget.\n  I will tell you, the Republican budget that is before us today is a \ntin cup budget. It is a budget that does not provide the resources that \nour young people need in order to be able to learn, in order for \nteachers to educate our children, and for them to be a success.\n  It would be a tremendous setback for this country in terms of \neducation if we don't pass this amendment and assure that our schools \nare funded.\n  It is a difficult day for all of us to be in the Senate debating \nthese critical issues. We all know that hanging over us is a war that \ncould possibly begin at any time. Our hearts are heavy with what could \noccur in the next few weeks and months. But it is also a time that we \ncannot abandon our young children. They are counting on us as the \nadults to make the right decisions for them and not to forget them in \nthis time of crisis. If we don't pass this amendment and fully fund No \nChild Left Behind, it will send a message to every child that we have \nforgotten them. I will not do that. I will work hard every day to make \nsure we fund the important education structure and give our kids the\n\n[[Page S3957]]\n\nopportunity to learn and succeed. That is a commitment every one of us \nshould take as a tremendous responsibility.\n  I know there are other Senators who wish to speak on the amendment. I \nwill yield the floor in a few minutes.\n  I want to make a few more comments before I do that. I see Senator \nGregg is here as well. I know we have to debate what is full funding \nand what should be our responsibility. But I think the outlines of No \nChild Left Behind are fairly clear in what our commitment is to young \npeople. If we don't fully fund title I to give disadvantaged students \nthe opportunity to learn, we are requiring them to take a test and not \ngiving them the resources they need, coming from a disadvantaged \nbackground, to be able to pass those tests. I think that is a pretty \nsorry statement in the Senate.\n\n  The amendment I am offering has $8.9 billion in funding for Function \n500, so it will fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act. As I stated \nearlier, the programs that it will fully fund are title I, teacher \nquality, class size, English language acquisition, afterschool centers, \nand rural education. It also includes sufficient funding to restore the \nPresident's cuts that are in the Republican budget before us for \nprograms such as smaller learning communities and dropout prevention \nprograms.\n  The amendment also includes $8.9 billion for deficit reduction. I \nthink both the education and deficit reduction funding are extremely \nimportant right now. This is all taken from the dividend tax cut.\n  I know we are going to have a tax debate later on, but I have talked \nto many of my constituents across the State of Washington, and when \nthey are given the choice of whether or not to have a tax cut that \nactually doesn't benefit many of the residents of the State of \nWashington or this country or the opportunity to provide a good \neducation for young children who are in school today, they all choose \nthat their money be spent on young children so they can have an \nopportunity.\n  Bill Gates is a constituent of mine. He is a wonderful success story. \nHe will benefit tremendously from the tax cut in the Republican budget. \nBut I think he and most of my constituents agree that they would \nbenefit much more from a citizenry that is left behind that is educated \nand capable of producing and capable of producing another Bill Gates in \nthe future.\n  If we rob our children of an education, we are also robbing ourselves \nof future entrepreneurs who can be successful businessmen, \nbusinesswomen, and be in walks of life that help create new jobs for \nthe future. It is very shortsighted to not fully fund No Child Left \nBehind for the future of the country.\n  We will have other amendments, I know, during this budget debate, to \nfully fund IDEA. That is an issue this Senate has taken up and talked \nabout many times. We actually had hoped to fully fund IDEA not that \nlong ago, but we were told we had to wait for reauthorization. We are \nstill waiting for the reauthorization bill to come over, and we still \nhave not fully funded IDEA.\n  I know Senator Kennedy is on the floor as well. He has been a staunch \nproponent of fully funding education for our young children and is even \nconcerned about the Pell grants and their funding in this budget. We \nhave many students in college who are struggling to pay their tuition \nand are finding themselves taking out loans of tremendous size just to \nget through school, and they are graduating with thousands of dollars \nin loans. It is really important that we don't leave a generation with \nhuge debt, trying to pay them off, if we want our economy to get back \non track.\n  Senator Kennedy will talk later on the importance of increasing the \nPell grant funding so that we leave fewer students with tremendous \nloans in the future. I know Senator Dodd will be out here also to talk \nabout Head Start and day care and other issues affecting young people.\n  Let me conclude by saying that there are thousands of young children \nin this country who are waiting anxiously to see if the U.S. Senate can \nlive up to the obligations of the No Child Left Behind Act that was \npassed not long ago. Today, we will have an opportunity with the \namendments that I have to let the young kids know that we in this \ncountry are ready to stand by them.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CORNYN). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we vote in \nrelation to the Murray amendment at 5 o'clock this evening, with the \ntime until then equally divided. I know my colleague from Washington \nspoke, but I say the time divided equally on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am trying to understand the amendment. \nI have not looked at it totally. The Senator's amendment would increase \nfunding in this education function by $8.9 billion for fiscal year \n2004?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. We have a 10-year budget. Do you increase funding in \n2005 or 2006 or any of the outyears?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. This just sets the appropriations level for this year \nand 2004.\n  Mr. NICKLES. You also increase taxes, or decrease the tax cut--\nwhichever language you want to use--by an amount of how much?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The amount in the amendment reduces the tax cut by $17.8 \nbillion.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Now, what percentage of an increase in the--$8.9 billion \nis what percent of an increase over the money being spent this year?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. It is approximately an 8-percent increase.\n  Mr. NICKLES. My calculation is that it is closer to 40 percent.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Well, I am happy to doublecheck to answer the Senator, \nbut I would be astounded--I believe it is an 8-percent increase over \nthe funding level.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes, absolutely.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Doesn't your amendment deal only with No Child Left \nBehind?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. It ensures that we fully fund No Child Left Behind for \nfiscal year 2004 and the programs within the No Child Left Behind.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Correct me if I am wrong, but isn't that figure $23.6 \nbillion, and so you would increase that amount by $8.9 billion, and \nisn't that closer to 40 percent?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. You are talking about the overall education funding. I \nam talking about the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  Mr. NICKLES. We will have to debate that. I believe I am talking \nabout the No Child Left Behind. I believe you are increasing that by \nabout 40 percent, which is kind of hard to understand.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am happy to yield to my colleague from Massachusetts. \nI want to clarify that the vote that will occur at 5 o'clock will be on \nthe amendment that I have offered; is that correct?\n  Mr. NICKLES. On or in relation thereto.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. No amendments will be in order prior to the vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am reserving the right to table the amendment, and no \namendment prior to that vote. We still would have the option for a \nmotion to table, and if a motion to table wasn't successful, to offer a \nsubstitute amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the budget that is before us at this \npresent time is about one basic and fundamental issue, and that is the \nissue of priorities, the issue of choices, how we are going to allocate \nscarce resources in this country.\n  The fact is that the Republican budget has said we will add $1.6 \ntrillion in additional tax breaks, most of which will go to the very \nwealthy individuals in this country.\n  The Senator from the State of Washington says, no, let's just take \n$8.9 billion of that and designate that for the No Child Left Behind \nAct, and then let's take another $8.9 billion towards reducing the \ndeficit that we are additionally creating with the $1.6 trillion in \nadditional tax reductions.\n\n[[Page S3958]]\n\n  The question is very simple: Do we want to educate the children of \nthis country, or do we want more tax breaks for the very wealthy? That \nis the issue before the Senate.\n  It is going to be clouded up with a lot of other kinds of rhetoric, \nbut it is a choice. Do you want to educate the children, or do you want \nmore tax breaks? That is the issue. That is the issue.\n  Mr. President, I will use figures from the Department of Education. \nThe Department of Education--this is their document--for the year 2003, \nthe total figure for education is $53 billion. And now the President's \nrequest is $53 billion. There it is. That is the Republican President's \nrequest on No Child Left Behind--effectively flat funding. Flat \nfunding.\n  Now, we know the President of the United States worked with the \nCongress--Republicans and Democrats--to enact the No Child Left Behind \nAct. That added important reforms and accountability--accountability \nfor the children to perform, accountability of the schools to teach, \naccountability for the teachers to learn and to be well-qualified, \naccountability for the parents to become involved, accountability on \nthe local communities to have responsibilities. It also had \naccountability for the Congress of the United States to fund that \nprogram, and this administration has abandoned that accountability. It \nhas abandoned it. The documents from the administration's Department of \nEducation show that.\n\n  At this hour, the Senator from Washington is saying: We do not want \nto abdicate our responsibility. Maybe the administration does, but we \ndo not, and the Senate will have an opportunity at 5 o'clock to \nindicate whether they prefer to give additional hundreds of millions of \ndollars to the wealthiest individuals, or to meet our fundamental \ncommitment to children and parents, 55 million of them across this \ncountry, and make sure they have a well-qualified teacher in their \nclassrooms, make sure there are going to be after-school programs to \nassist these children, make sure they have a sound curriculum, make \nsure that the tests are going to test those children on that \ncurriculum, and that if a child falls behind, they are going to get the \nsupplementary services they need. This is all at a time when the States \nare in deficit of $90 billion. A third of that money is education; 75 \npercent of that is for K through 12.\n  The children are being put through the wringers. They are being put \nthrough the wringers in all 50 States. I will not take the time to read \nfrom letters from teachers and superintendents of schools or school \nboards, but that is the message they are sending.\n  We made a commitment, a promise to those children and to their \nparents. The choice is very simple: Are we going to meet that \ncommitment in supporting the amendment of the Senator from Washington, \nor are we going to give additional tax breaks to the wealthiest \nindividuals? It is as simple and fundamental and basic as that, Mr. \nPresident, make no mistake about it. I hope later on we will have a \nchance to do something about that.\n  Finally, on the President's proposal for education, if we look over \nthe period to the year 2010, with the requests that are being made in \nthe President's budget there are still 5.6 million children left \nbehind. There it is under this administration. I remember when the \nadministration wanted the title ``No Child Left Behind,'' and we talked \nabout that in our conference. As we talked about that, we said: Are we \nreally going to leave children behind, or is this going to be a \ncommitment? It was clear to me that Republicans and Democrats in the \nconference said: This is going to be a commitment.\n  Unless we accept the amendment of the Senator from Washington and \nunless we are going to start on a glidepath towards funding No Child \nLeft Behind, we are going to leave millions of children in this country \nbehind. Which is it, Senate of the United States: billions more for tax \nbreaks for wealthy individuals or investing in the children who are out \nthere tonight, today, this evening, studying hard, trying to make a go \nof it and finding out that instead of having maybe 15, 18, 20 pupils in \na class, this year there are going to be 25 or 30 in it? And we can go \ndown the list. Every Member knows that.\n  It is a question of priorities, and the Murray amendment is as clear \nas can be. I hope when the time comes, the amendment will be accepted.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the status of the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma retains 26 minutes. \nThe Senator from Washington retains 10 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask to be yielded 15 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first, I always enjoy hearing the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts and the Senator from Washington discuss education, \nespecially the Senator from Massachusetts. I appreciate the fact we put \nmicrophones in the Chamber because that certainly helps me hear him as \nwe go forward.\n  I wish to start, however, with the question of the budget. I thought \nI would bring along the budget on education that we passed last year \nwhen the Democratic membership controlled the Senate. So I did, and \nhere it is.\n  You may be asking, Where is it? It did not pass. The budget on \neducation was not even brought to the floor last year. An epiphany has \noccurred. Suddenly, they are concerned about education. Suddenly, they \nare interested in education enough to debate it in this budget. But \nwhere were they last year? Where were they? They were not on the floor \nof the Senate promoting a budget to promote education. This is their \nbudget last year on education. A blank page.\n  We have to go back in history to find out what the position of the \nmembership of the other party is relative to the issue of funding \neducation in comparison with what this President has done.\n  This President has dramatically increased funding for education, and \nif we compare his commitment to education to the prior administration's \ncommitment to education in the years when the prior administration \nproposed education funding, we will see that in the last year of the \nClinton administration, there was $42 billion being spent on education. \nThis year, a proposed $66.5 billion is being spent on education by this \nPresident.\n  President Bush's commitment to education has been the second largest \nfactor of increase in the Federal budget over the last 3 years. It has \nmeant real dollars going to the issue of education.\n  Now let's turn to the question of title I, which is the purpose of \nthis amendment, which is the No Child Left Behind issue. Let's look at \nall the issues for a moment. Let's compare what the Democratic \nleadership did when they controlled the Senate versus what we have done \nunder Republican control of the Senate over the last few years.\n  From the period 2001 to 2004, when we had Republican leadership in \nthe Senate, the red bars reflect increases in education funding for \ntitle I, for IDEA, Pell grants, and total discretionary education. \nIncreases from the Democratic side of the aisle during this same period \nwere minuscule; in fact, one was even a negative in the Pell grant area \nduring that same period. There are dramatic increases coming from this \nPresident.\n  Let's look at title I because this is the most stark, dramatic, and I \nthink precise chart we have to reflect what is really being done.\n  Since the Republicans took control of the Senate and the Congress, we \nsee these huge increases in funding for title I: $1 billion a year \nsince President Bush has been in office. Every year, $1 billion, $1 \nbillion, $1 billion on top of the prior amounts, as compared with 1993 \nthrough 1995. In fact, if we went back further, it would be worse \ncoming in from the prior administration. So the commitment has been \nthere.\n  If we look at the history of title I increases, which is what this \namendment is about, and compare what President Clinton did when the \nDemocrats were in control to what President Bush has done since he has \nbeen in charge, during the 1994 to 2001 period, over the 8-year period, \nPresident Clinton proposed $2.4 billion in increases in title I \nfunding; in 3 years, President Bush has proposed $3.9 billion in \nincreases in funding.\n\n[[Page S3959]]\n\n  It is very easy to come to the floor in a difficult fiscal time when \nwe are facing a war, when there are a lot of pressures on us because of \na deficit, and say you have no responsibility because you do not \nproduce budgets that you are willing to increase spending ad infinitum, \nwhich is what this amendment essentially does. It is a little more \ndifficult, however, in a time of deficits, when we are at war, to come \nforward and actually increase spending, which is exactly what President \nBush did.\n  I note, during this period, 1994 to 2001, we were running surpluses. \nThe opportunity was there to increase spending without a great deal of \nchoice in the area of priorities. Today it is a much tougher situation, \nand the choices on priorities have been made, and President Bush is \ncommitted to that funding.\n  Now I will go to one other chart, which I find absolutely startling \nbecause I think this shows some of these amendments we are going to be \ngetting from the other side, especially on the issue of education, are \ntaking advantage of the fact that the other side does not have to \nproduce a budget.\n  Let's look back when they did, theoretically, have to produce a \nbudget. Of course, they did not. We could go back to their budget, \nwhich was a blank page, but they did produce an appropriations bill, \nwhich they never passed. In fact, they never even called it to the \nfloor of the Senate. It took the Republican Congress 2 weeks to pass \nit. The other side had a whole year. They were not able to do it, but \nwe were able to do it. I will get into the numbers there, but the fact \nis when they produced their budget, or their appropriations bill, what \ndid they have in their numbers for funding? They had $11.8 billion. \nWhat was the authorization level? It was $16 billion. So by their own \nterms, the last time they had control, the last time they had the \nopportunity to do the job of governing, they underfunded the title I \naccount by $4 billion--by their terminology, not by mine.\n  How many children did they silence, to use the term of Senator \nKennedy? How many are added up in that $4 billion figure? I do not \nknow. Personally, I do not think that is a proper way to address it, \nbut if those are the terminologies one is going to use, then what is \ngood for the goose is good for the gander. The fact is they were $4 \nbillion short of their own goal. So a lot of what we are hearing today \nis tilting with straw dogs when it comes to the issue of how much is \nbeing spent and who is spending what.\n  Let's look a little bit, though, at what this President has done--a \n145 percent increase in education funding, as compared with health, as \ncompared with defense, a huge increase.\n  The argument is being made that title I has not been fully funded \nbecause the authorization levels have not been met. That, of course, \ngoes to this chart. If we were to fully fund every bill that has been \nauthorized by this Congress--well, just by our committee--we would be \ntalking trillions of dollars. We all recognize that authorization level \nis not the level at which we end up. We end up at an appropriated \nlevel. And the question becomes: How do different accounts compete \nwithin those appropriation accounts? Who is being successful, who is \nnot? Where are the priorities? Where are the choices being made?\n  The point this chart unalterably makes is that as far as this \nadministration is concerned, the priority is education--a billion \ndollars of new funding for title I every year since this administration \nhas been in office--in fact, $1.5 billion one year, I think, and $1 \nbillion for special education funding every year since this \nadministration has been in office, which compares rather starkly, as I \nmentioned, with the Clinton years in the area of title I, where \nessentially there were very little funding increases. Over 7 years, it \nwas $2.4 billion as compared with $3.9 billion for the Bush \nadministration.\n  The issue of whether or not this is an unfunded mandate is a total \nmisrepresentation relative to No Child Left Behind. The fact is the \nfunding that is flowing into the States to support No Child Left Behind \nis flowing in before the States and the communities have an obligation \nto do things under No Child Left Behind. We are actually prefunding \nmany, if not all, of the obligations which the States are assuming \nunder No Child Left Behind to the extent we ask them to do things.\n  For example, testing regime. In the State of New Hampshire it costs \nabout $300,000 to produce a test. Under No Child Left Behind, we have \nasked that instead of testing three grades, they are going to have to \ntest three more grades, a number of more grades, actually, but they do \nnot have to have those tests up and running for awhile. However, we are \ngiving them the money today to design the tests. Not only are we giving \nthem money, but on the average we are giving New Hampshire at least \n$500,000 to develop new tests. It only costs them $300,000 to do the \ntest. They are making $200,000 per test that they develop, and that is \ntrue across the country.\n  It is also true of the basic funding regime relative to issues, for \nexample, like teachers. We heard a little talk about teachers. The \nPresident's commitment for funding for teachers is up 35 percent over \nwhat the prior administration did, a $726 million increase coming into \nthis year.\n  More importantly, under No Child Left Behind, we no longer put \nstrings behind those dollars. We say to the local school districts, \ninstead of having to use this new money, the 35 percent increase in \nfunding for education for teachers and for teacher support, instead of \nhaving to use that money to hire more teachers, you, the principal, can \nmake the decision to use that money to hire more teachers, if that is \nwhat you need, to pay your best teachers more, if that is what you \nthink is going to get you good teachers to stay there, to give your \nteachers better education by sending them out to schools and getting \nsupplemental education for them, by giving them technology support. You \nhave the choice. You, the school district, are going to get this extra \nmoney. Plus, you are going to get it without strings. You are going to \nhave flexibility as to how to use it so you can make that dollar go \nfurther.\n  So to represent that the teacher side of the No Child Left Behind \nbill has not only been underfunded but is not being adequately managed \nis just inaccurate. The fact is, it has been funded, it has been \nincreased, and it is a dramatically more liberal use of the dollars at \nthe discretion of the local school district. I know they are going to \nget more for the dollars spent.\n  Now I guess we are going to have time later on--I ask the Chair how \nmuch time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. The record on special education is even more dramatic. \nWhere the Clinton administration essentially flatlined special \neducation for 8 years, this administration has increased it, by \nhistoric levels, over a billion dollars a year every year--dramatic \nincreases for special education.\n  We will get into that. We will get into the issue of the Pell grants, \nwhere the numbers are equally stark, where this administration has made \nhuge commitments in comparison to the time when the responsibilities \nfor funding education actually fell into the hands of our colleagues \nacross the aisle. But what we have today, unfortunately, is an attempt \nto use the lack of responsibility to have to produce a budget to throw \nout numbers which are irresponsible and claim that they are \nresponsible.\n  The last budget the Democrats produced on the issue of education was \na blank. That is what they brought to the floor on the issue of \neducation last year, whereas the President of the United States stepped \nup to the plate and increased title I funding by $3.9 billion in 3 \nyears. That is real commitment to the kids of America.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dodd \nbe listed as a cosponsor on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts and \nthen 4 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that the Department of \nEducation's fiscal year 2004 President's budget be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3960]]\n\n\n\n                           DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FISCAL YEAR 2004 PRESIDENT'S BUDGET\n                                            [In thousands of dollars\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                            2003                         2004       Change from\n  Office, account, program and     DIM        2002       President's       2003       President's       2003\n            activity                     appropriation     request    appropriation     request    appropriation\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nContributions (DEOA, section         M            485             0              0             0              0\n 421)...........................\n    Outlays.....................

The fiscal year 2003\n  appropriation has since been enacted and is included in this table. The fiscal year 2004 President's budget\n  remains the same as requested on February 3.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What it shows is the appropriations for 2002, $49 \nbillion; the President's request is $50 billion. They added $400 \nmillion. Then the appropriations went up $3 billion because of the \nactivity on the floor of the Senate. The next year the administration \nasked for $26 million--an increase of 5/100th of one percent. Let us \nlook at the point my good friend, Senator Gregg, left behind. The point \nhe has not disputed is we have 6.2 million children who are left \nbehind. Let's forget what happened to the Republicans, let's forget \nwhat happened to the Democrats, and say let's accept the Murray \namendment that will include 3 million more children. Let's not argue \nabout the past. Let's argue about the future.\n  This amendment will increase by 3 million the number of children who \nwill be covered. We have a chance to do that tonight. We have a chance \nto do that at 5 o'clock. That is what we are asking the Senate to do, \ninstead of having additional tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals \nin this country.\n  Put the children first. That is what the Murray amendment would do.\n  I hope my good friend from New Hampshire will join us hand in hand \ntogether and support the Murray amendment, and we will cut in half the \nnumber of children being left behind.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator from Oklahoma yield a couple of minutes \nto respond?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield 4 minutes to my colleague.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Massachusetts argued it might have \ncredibility and might have legs were it not for the fact there is \npresently--because of the huge amount of money the President of the \nUnited States, George Bush, has put into this account--there is \npresently unspent title I dollars representing billions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. Is this a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. The Senator is not surprised on that because they \nalways commit that money in July of the next year. You can use all the \ncharts you want; it is committed and it is expended in July. Everyone \nunderstands that.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the Senator's question, and I am sure it was \na question, although I never really actually heard the question.\n  But I make the point this is 2001 money, 2 years ago; August has \nalready come and gone for 2001; and 2002 is fast approaching.\n  The fact is, we are putting so much money in the pipeline so fast \nbecause we are prefunding this issue, as we should be, that we are not \ncreating an unfunded mandate. We are actually creating a situation \nwhere many States are, for at least the moment, not making money but \nseeing a significant surplus in the amount of money coming in \nrelationship to the amount of money they are having to spend to reach \nthe goals of No Child Left Behind, which, as we all know, is to give \nlow-income kids a better shot at the American dream by educating them \nproperly.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me speak for the 4 minutes I was \nallocated by the Senator from Washington to support the amendment \nSenator Murray and Senator Kennedy have put forward. I compliment them \non the leadership they provide on education issues and this amendment \nin particular.\n  I heard my colleague from New Hampshire talk about how we cannot just \nincrease funding ad infinitum, that what this amendment would do is \nthrow out numbers that are irresponsible. That was one of his phrases.\n  As I understand the amendment, and the reason I am cosponsoring the \namendment, this amendment proposes to fully fund the No Child Left \nBehind Act. All it is saying is we made an agreement on a bipartisan \nbasis. The President participated in that agreement. We told the people \nof our States and our school districts that we were going to provide a \ncertain level of support to help them implement the No Child Left \nBehind Act. The budget before the Senate does not do that.\n  The suggestion is made that the reason it has not done that is \nbecause there is surplus money that has come into the State and we \nprefunded things and they have not been able to spend the money in the \npipeline. This is news to the school districts in my State and to the \npeople involved with trying to educate the children in my State. In \nfact, when I go home, what I hear from people in my State is that we \nhave these new requirements, we need assistance, we need resources. If \nyou want us to train teachers' aides, which we want to do, if you want \nus to raise the level of qualifications of our teachers, which we want \nto do, please help. Please come through with the resources that were \ncommitted in the No Child Left Behind Act. That is exactly what this \namendment tries to do.\n  The other comment I heard was we cannot fully fund every bill that is \nauthorized in this Congress. That is not what the Senator from \nWashington and the Senator from Massachusetts are proposing. They are \nsaying, let's just fully fund this bill. Let's take education and \nrecognize that it needs to be a priority.\n  In this budget resolution, we have over $1.3 trillion in tax cuts. \nNow, is it too much to say that $8.9 billion of additional funds should \ngo into education? I don't think that is an unreasonable request. I \nthink, clearly, the priorities of the American people would be with us, \nand they would agree, let's fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act \nbefore we start cutting taxes.\n  We all know we have enormous other expenses that are coming at us as \na result of the war that is imminent in Iraq. I certainly intend to \nsupport those expenditures, but to suggest that we do not have enough \nmoney left to pursue our education funding, to keep the promise we made \nto the American people at the time the No Child Left Behind Act was \nsigned into law, is very unfortunate.\n\n[[Page S3961]]\n\n  I participated with the Secretary of Education when he came to my \nState and had something of a rally in Albuquerque to talk about No \nChild Left Behind and what a wonderful thing it was for the State. I \nsupported that legislation. I supported it all the way through. I \nworked with my colleagues to try to be sure it made good sense and fit \nthe circumstances of our State. But I did so always on the assumption \nthat we would then come along and provide the Federal support to the \nStates for local school districts to implement those improvements.\n  I think it is essential we do that. I think it is essential we adopt \nthe Murray-Kennedy amendment. I hope our colleagues will support this \namendment and keep faith with the young people of our country.\n  Everyone in this body gives speeches talking about how the future \nlies with the children of the country. We need to do right by them and \nadopt this amendment and make education a priority in this budget.\n  The pending budget simply sets the wrong priorities by providing over \n$1.3 trillion in tax benefits to the wealthiest while cutting education \nfunding.\n  This budget abandons the promise to leave no child behind by cutting \nfunding for the No Child Left Behind Act--legislation repeatedly \nembraced by the Administration and passed by a strong bipartisan vote \njust last Congress--by $700 million.\n  Under this budget, Title I--the program targeted on districts and \nschools with large numbers of disadvantaged students--would be \napproximately $5.8 billion short compared to the levels agreed to on a \nbipartisan basis in the No Child Left Behind Act. As a result, over 6 \nmillion poor children will be left behind.\n  In addition, over 500,000 children will lose access to after school \nservices under these funding levels.\n  The budget before us also contemplates eliminating funding for key \neducation programs--again enacted on a bipartisan basis last Congress.\n  For example, the budget contemplates eliminating funding for the \ndropout prevention program, at a time when the pressure is greater than \never to push at risk students out so they do not negatively impact \nschool performance.\n  The budget also contemplates cutting existing programs that provide \nresearch-based strategies for schools to improve academic achievement \nand reduce dropout rates. For example, the smaller communities program \nprovides funds to schools seeking to create personalized learning \nenvironments that research proves will increase student academic \nachievement, reduce dropout rates, and increase school safety. It is \nexactly the type of reform effort that we endorsed and indeed required \nin the No Child Left Behind Act. It is the type of program that we \nshould expand, rather than eliminate.\n  If we truly intend to leave no child behind, education funding--\nparticularly funding for the programs targeted toward the most \ndisadvantaged children--must be our top priority, not our last.\n  The funding provided in this amendment would achieve that goal by \nproviding funding sufficient to serve another 2 million needy children \nunder the Title I program. In addition, every one of the 10,000 schools \ncurrently identified as not meeting the standards provided in the No \nChild Left Behind Act will be able to implement research-based school \nreform models.\n\n  We also will be able to maintain the current level of after-school \nservices while expanding after school programs to another 1.3 million \nlatchkey children.\n  We would be able to make substantial contributions to the quality of \ninstruction by providing enough funding to hire 50,000 fully qualified \nteachers and provide professional development to 200,000 teachers.\n  Finally, we will be able to continue key programs such as the dropout \nprevention program and smaller learning communities programs.\n  This amendment can make a real difference for our states and local \ndistricts.\n  As my colleagues know, State cuts to education caused by ``the most \nominous fiscal crisis since World War II'' make Federal support ever \nmore crucial for local communities. States face a cumulative $80 \nbillion budget deficit, with a dozen States cutting k-12 spending last \nyear and another 11 poised to do so this year.\n  States and communities across the Nation are being forced to cut \nservices due to increased demands and reduced resources. For example, \nin Oregon school districts are carving weeks of instruction off the \nschool year. One thousand teacher positions have been lost in Oregon so \nfar this year. The schools in Arkansas, Louisiana, South Dakota, and \nColorado are cutting back to a four-day week to trim costs. In Alabama, \nthe schools are being forced to raise the class sizes, cut back \nextracurricular activities, and lay off 2,000 teachers and support \nstaff. In Kentucky, 1,000 teacher and support positions have been cut \nand their technology programs have been slashed. In Massachusetts, \ndozens of school nurses have been laid off.\n  As a result, it is not a surprise that a bipartisan poll recently \ndemonstrated that a majority of Americans support increased Federal \nsupport for education and more voters name education as their top \nbudget priority for next year than any other issue. Education ranks \nmore than 10 points higher than the next 2 highest budget priorities--\nhealth care and terrorism/security.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and thank my colleagues \nagain for their leadership.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I express my strong support for the \namendment offered by Senators Murray and Kennedy to increase funds for \nthe No Child Left Behind Act by $8.9 billion, fully funding this \ncritical legislation. The amendment also includes $8.9 billion for \ndeficit reduction. Both the education and deficit reduction funding are \ntaken from the dividend tax cut. It is imperative that Congress sends a \nstrong message in support of education that is accompanied by equally \nstrong funding.\n  The budget resolution we consider today fails to provide sufficient \nfunding for education programs at all levels. Despite the \nAdministration rhetoric that places great importance on improving \neducational opportunities for all Americans, President Bush's budget \nunderfunds a variety of programs--early childhood education, elementary \neducation, vocational education, and higher education--that are \nespecially important to families given the weak economy.\n  States are struggling with budget shortfalls, rising student \nenrollment, and an increasing number of students with limited English \nproficiency. At the same time, States are working to meet the new \nrequirements of the No Child Left Behind Act. I supported the No Child \nLeft Behind Act because I agreed with its principles--all public school \nchildren should be able to achieve and all schools should be held \naccountable when their students fail to do so. I believed the President \nwhen he said education would be a priority. But now we face a budget \nthat does not make education a priority. Instead, we are asked to \nsupport a budget that somehow finds the money to provide a tax cut for \nthe wealthiest individuals, but cannot do so for the education of our \nNation's children.\n  This budget provides only a 2 percent overall increase for education \nprograms, and some increases such as those for both Title I and IDEA, \nare largely paid for with cuts to other valuable education programs. \nFunding for the No Child Left Behind Act is cut by $700 million below \nfiscal year 2003 levels. It shortchanges Title I funding by $5.8 \nbillion below the authorized level. Title I could reach only 40 percent \nof eligible low-income children at this level. This budget also cuts \nfunding for teacher quality programs, after school programs, and \neliminates 46 education initiatives.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act places a variety of new requirements on \nStates and local school districts, including annual standardized \ntesting and increased teacher certification. While we can expect our \neducators to do all within their power to improve our schools, we \ncannot expect this landmark legislation to be effective if they are not \ngiven the resources to implement these programs. If this amendment \npasses, over 2 million additional needy children will be served by \nTitle I, after school opportunities would be extended to an additional \n1.3 million latchkey kids, and 50,000 new teachers could become fully \nqualified.\n\n[[Page S3962]]\n\n  I find it unconscionable that we can consider a tax cut aimed at the \nwealthiest Americans while purporting to be unable to adequately fund \neducation programs. Now is the time to move beyond the rhetoric and \nshow teachers, parents and students that we are sincere in our efforts \nto help them. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Murray-\nKennedy amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of Senator \nMurray's amendment to the budget resolution that will fully fund the No \nChild Left Behind Act. I regret that I will not be present for the \nvote, but if I were present I would vote for the Murray amendment to \nincrease education funding by $8.9 billion.\n  Unfortunately, both the budget resolution that we are debating and \nPresident Bush's proposed fiscal year 2004 budget do not fulfill the \nfunding commitment that Congress made when we passed the No Child Left \nBehind Act into law. In fact, the budget resolution contains a $700 \nmillion cut in funding for the No Child Left Behind Act compared to the \nfiscal year 2003 levels.\n  The budget resolution's title I funding leaves more than 6 million \ndisadvantaged children behind. There is no increase for teacher quality \nfunds, even though nearly 40 percent of title I children are taught by \nteachers without a college degree in their primary instructional field \nand our schools will need to hire 2 million new teachers over the next \ndecade. While 6 million latchkey children currently go without \nafterschool programs, this budget cuts afterschool funding for more \nthan 500,000 children. And it eliminates all funding for rural \neducation, dropout prevention, preparing tomorrow's teachers in \ntechnology, and smaller learning communities among other things.\n  We have said it time and again during debate on No Child Left Behind \nand since it became law: new reforms and stronger accountability \nsystems are not going to work if we don't provide resources to ensure \nthat all children can learn to high standards. That means providing the \nfull authorized amount of title I funding, it means helping schools \nmeet the major new requirements for teacher quality that the law \nimposed, and it means increasing not slashing funding for afterschool \nprograms. I hope all of my colleagues can support this important \namendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would first like to thank Senator Murray \nfor this critical amendment to deliver on the promise we made to the \nNation's children by fully funding the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  It has been over 1 year since the approval of the No Child Left \nBehind Act. But we are not fulfilling the promise made in that law and \nare, in fact, leaving millions of kids behind. The Nation has made \nlittle progress toward improving the quality of our children's \neducation. In fact, we have taken a huge step backward by actually \ncutting funding for the education reform law that was enacted.\n  The Murray amendment will not only alleviate the fiscal crisis in our \nschools so that they can provide a high-quality education for our \nchildren, but it will provide funding to keep our children safe in \nafterschool programs.\n  As the author with Senator Ensign of the bipartisan afterschool \nprogram that President Bush signed into law as part of the No Child \nLeft Behind Act, I want to emphasize how important the Federal \nafterschool program is to children and families across America. Dozens \nof respected, independent studies tell us that afterschool programs \nkeep children safe, reduce crime and drug use, and improve academic \nperformance.\n  However, despite strong evidence that keeping children safe after \nschool can reduce juvenile crime and prevent children from engaging in \nrisky behaviors, the administration's budget for fiscal year 2004 \nslashes Federal funding for afterschool programs by 40 percent.\n  This unprecedented cut would result in over 81,000 children in \nCalifornia and almost 600,000 children nationally being pushed out onto \nthe streets after school. Furthermore, by not fully funding afterschool \nprograms at the level that we promised in the No Child Left Behind Act, \nwe will be leaving over a million more children not just behind, but \nhome alone.\n  We cannot afford to neglect our commitment to our Nation's children. \nThe time for rhetoric has passed and now it is time to act. It is time \nto fully fund afterschool programs and the entire No Child Left Behind \nAct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 10 minutes and \nthe Senator from Washington has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from New \nHampshire and other Senators who have been working hard on the Leave No \nChild Behind legislation.\n  I am a new Senator and was not here when it was done. I watched it \nfrom a distance as a former Education Secretary, to see how the Federal \nGovernment, which contributes about $650 or so out of the $7,000 or so \nwe spend per student in this country on K-12 education, could make a \ndifference.\n  The principles of flexibility and accountability and the addition of \nmore options for parents and significant additional funding have been a \nvery good bipartisan start. The funding, which is the area at issue \ntoday, has been generous.\n  When I look at my own State of Tennessee, for example, we can always \nuse a little more of the Federal dollars to help do what needs to be \ndone, but the amount that has come in has been very helpful. For \nexample, in fiscal year 2000--and this follows to a great extent what \nthe Senator from New Hampshire said--and then in fiscal year 2001, \nPresident Clinton asked for $8 billion and then $8.3 billion. In fiscal \nyear 2000, the Congress appropriated roughly what the President \nrequested, and in fiscal year 2001, it appropriated $8.7 billion. \nTennessee got $137 million in fiscal year 2000 and $141 million in \nfiscal year 2001 for title I funding, the largest federal program that \nhelps low-income children. This is the money that focuses on leaving no \nchild behind.\n  When President Bush came in, he asked for $9 billion and the Congress \nappropriated over $10 billion, and the share of title I funding for \nTennessee went up to $152 million. In the budget we just finished in \nJanuary, the President asked for $11 billion, and Congress provided \n$300 million more, and Tennessee's share went to $164 million. With the \nnewest recommendation from the President, an increase of $1 billion, \nTennessee is up to $174 million. These increases in title I funding are \nmoving more rapidly than other parts of the federal budget.\n  Could it be more? Maybe I will suggest over time we spend more. But \nwe need to recognize these are significant increases in spending to \nfund the new programs from the Federal Government, while staying within \na reasonable budget.\n  In Nashville last week, I picked up an article about teachers, which \nyou do not see that often, that talked about how much they appreciated \nthe additional federal funding for ESL, English as a second language, \nand how it was helping and how the new money for this year, which we \njust finished appropriating a few weeks ago, is making its way into the \nschool system. One of the teachers said this was the first year for \nmajor funding and it should really improve services.\n  So I stand here today to say that I compliment President Bush, and \nthis Senate, and this Congress, for what they have accomplished in the \nlast 2 years--significant increases in funding for title I and the IDEA \nprogram over what was being spent when President Bush took office, even \nin a time when we have a budget under stress and are considering a war. \nEducation funding is growing at a more rapid rate, as it should, I \nbelieve, than virtually any other part of the budget. I am glad to see \nthat.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from the Tennessean be \nprinted in the Record, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Tennessean, Mar. 17, 2003]\n\n        Federal Funding Helps Defray Local Cost of ESL Programs\n\n                          (By Claudette Riley)\n\n       Students with limited English skills who enter Tennessee \n     schools will now find classrooms that are better equipped \n     than ever to meet their needs.\n\n[[Page S3963]]\n\n       This year, the state received more than $2.24 million in \n     federal funding to help public schools meet the needs of \n     students served in English as a Second Language, or ESL, \n     programs.\n       In recent years, local districts have shouldered the cost \n     of providing the required services, with limited help from \n     state funding or grants.\n       ``This is the first year for major funding. It should \n     really improve services,'' said Carol Irwin, ESL coordinator \n     for the state Department of Education. ``It should put more \n     professional development in place, pay for materials and \n     technology, and hire more tutors and translators.''\n       Tennessee and other states with a steady influx of families \n     from other countries are benefiting from a shift in the way \n     federal ESL funds are allocated. National education officials \n     used census data to determine how much each state would \n     receive for this school year.\n       ``It's made a tremendous difference. We went from a teacher \n     and a half to a teacher with two full-time educational \n     assistants,'' said Vivian McCord, director of federal \n     projects for Dickson County schools. ``We meet with the \n     children on a daily basis now, and they are given tutoring.''\n       Of the $2.24 million in federal funds allocated to \n     Tennessee this year, nearly $1.8 million went directly to \n     school districts, $112,000 was pulled out for administrative \n     costs and another 15%--or $336,000--was awarded as grants to \n     the school systems with the highest need.\n       ``It's just encouraging for districts to know they'll have \n     some financial help,'' Irwin said. ``The districts have been \n     struggling to get this done.''\n       Based on existing numbers, the state will get $2.65 million \n     in federal funding for ESL during the 2003--04 school year \n     and nearly $3 million the next year, officials said.\n       ``The numbers keep rising, and so we're getting more \n     money,'' Irwin said.\n       The extra money is welcome news for the state's 138 school \n     districts, many of which have reached deep into their own \n     pockets to put the ESL programs in place.\n       The federal funding is helping us,'' said Sayra Hughes, \n     coordinator of ESL for Metro schools, which received nearly \n     $600,000 from the new funding. ``It's just an added bonus. It \n     has assisted--the local funding is still there.''\n       The federal funding isn't expected to replace local \n     contributions, but school officials said it would help them \n     provide more staff and better services and materials.\n       Tennessee has 15,007 students in ESL programs, and 28.5% of \n     them--4,283--are in Metro schools. The district received the \n     largest chunk of the new federal funds.\n       ``We're been able to purchase a lot of additional \n     materials,'' Hughes said. ``We were able to increase the \n     services provided by the tutor translators.''\n       Jan Lanier, chairwoman of the ESL department at Metro's \n     Glencliff High School, said she would like to eventually put \n     in a language laboratory and provide students struggling to \n     learn English with better research materials and bilingual \n     dictionaries.\n       ``We have some, but we don't have enough for every class to \n     have a full set.''\n       While district officials say the extra federal money is \n     welcome, some note that it won't cover the cost of operating \n     ESL programs.\n       We did have more money this year, but it didn't come close \n     to covering what we spend on staff,'' said Andy Brummett, \n     director of Lebanon Special School District. ``The majority \n     of the money we spend to serve these children is local.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nReed of Rhode Island as a cosponsor, and I yield him 2 minutes of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the choice before us is very clear: Are we \ngoing to devote $8.9 billion to tax cuts, most of them favoring the \nvery rich, or are we going to devote $8.9 billion to the children and \nthe schools of America? The choice is much more clear since the No \nChild Left Behind Act was passed because we made significant \ncommitments to improve the quality of education in the United States \nwhile imposing significant responsibilities on the schools. The schools \nare expecting this money. The suggestion that there is a lot of money \nin the pipeline is interesting, but I would be shocked because that \nsuggests the Department of Education is inept in getting money that is \nthere to the schools that desperately need it.\n  There are 10,000 identified failing schools in this country. There \nare scores of children being taught by teachers without a college \ndegree in their primary field of instruction. All of that needs \nremediation, help, and resources, but instead the budget before us \nprovides billions in tax cuts when our schools desperately need that \nmoney.\n  It is not a question of what we did last year, it is a question of \nwhat we will do this year. It is a question of whether we will meet the \nneeds of the American students and whether we will keep the promises of \nthe No Child Left Behind Act. We are not keeping those promises in the \nbudget that is presented to us by the Budget Committee. We should keep \nthose promises, and by doing so, we will do something I believe every \nAmerican wants more than tax cuts that favor very wealthy Americans. We \nwant to see every child in this country have a decent education, \nsucceed, contribute, and be part of this great country. That is what \nthe Murray amendment does.\n  The choice before us is clear, compelling, emphatic: Put the money \nwith the schools and the children, and our economy will be better, and \nour schools and students will be better. We can afford it because if we \ndo not commit the funding to the children, it will go to tax cuts \nprimarily to upper income Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes for the Senator from Oklahoma, 2 \nminutes for the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, when we marked up our budget, we put in a couple of \nbillion dollars actually over the President's request. I mentioned to \nmy colleagues then: No matter what we put in, there are going to be \namendments on the floor to increase education.\n  I might show our colleagues--Senator Gregg did this far better than \nI--education funding under this President as compared to President \nClinton has exploded. It has gone up dramatically. Title I, which \naddresses the issue we have before us on No Child Left Behind--if you \nlook at the rate of growth we have in title I grants, it is a dramatic \nincrease.\n  The Senator from Washington has an amendment. This might even show it \nbetter. It shows that the spending level basically in the last few \nyears, under this President compared to the previous President, has had \na dramatic increase. As a percentage, I might mention, it went up in \ntitle I percentages of 10.3, 18.1, 12.9, 8.6--big increases.\n  The Senator from Washington has an amendment that says let's do No \nChild Left Behind and let's go from $23 billion--let's add another $8.9 \nbillion, which would be a 38.7 percent increase for 1 year. It says \n$8.9 billion. It doesn't sound like much. Most of the figures we are \ndealing with are over 10 years. This is 1 year. We only increased \nnondefense discretionary spending by $10 billion. This is $9 billion \nfor education, and not all education, just part of education. I \nunderstand there will be amendments later to deal with IDEA, and we put \nin an additional $1 billion for IDEA, we put in an additional $1 \nbillion for title I at the request of the chairman of the HELP \nCommittee, who was a strong leader and made an excellent presentation.\n\n  No matter what we do, no matter how high the percentage increases we \nhave, even if they are double digits, there are amendments that will \nsay let's do more. This amendment says let's do 38.7 percent more. I \nthink it is irresponsible, and I will urge my colleagues at an \nappropriate time to support a motion to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are about to vote on a very important \namendment. Not very long ago, the Members of this body voted to pass a \nbill called No Child Left Behind. The budget that is put forward to us \ntoday will leave thousands of children behind if we do not fulfill the \ncommitment we have made.\n  I have listened to the arguments on the other side. I have seen the \ncharts and graphs. If there is one thing I have learned here in the \nSenate, it is that you can have a chart or graph to show whatever you \nwant it to show. But what I do know is Senator Kennedy showed on the \nchart behind us, 3 million more children in this country, 3 million \nmore children need more funding if they want to meet the obligations of \nNo Child Left Behind; 50,000 fully qualified teachers need to be hired; \nwe need to provide training for 200,000 teachers. The numbers are \nreally clear.\n\n[[Page S3964]]\n\n  If you look at the Republican budget itself, their document shows 46 \nprograms that have been eliminated in their budget: Adult education, \ncommunity technology, dropout prevention, elementary and secondary \nschool counseling, foreign language, physical education, rural \neducation, vocational education. These are programs listed in their \nbudget that they cut.\n  We can put up charts and graphs, but I can tell you one thing: The \nchildren in our schools, the parents who take their children there, the \nteachers who teach there, the community members who work in our schools \nall know when we pass a bill and say we are going to test our kids at \nthe Federal level and we do not provide the resources to make sure \nthose children can learn, we pass on an unfunded mandate that is \nirresponsible to our States that are struggling today.\n  The amendment we are about to vote on fully funds title I. It \ncontinues the effort to hire 100,000 qualified teachers. It helps to \nput high-quality teachers in the classrooms and continues to make sure \nwe fulfill our obligations.\n  Tougher accountability without adequate reform is not reform, it is \npolitics. We know our children need books, they need teachers, they \nneed the programs, and they need the Federal Government to live up to \nits responsibility. That is what this amendment does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. There have been a lot of representations here, but we need \nto go back to the fact that on our side of the aisle we had to produce \na budget--and we did, something that didn't happen last year from the \nother side of the aisle relative to bringing it to the floor.\n  When the other side of the aisle was talking dollars, they were \nwilling to give up on $4 billion relative to children in title I. That \nwas their gap last year in their appropriating bill. For them to come \nforward this year and say suddenly that gap is an unacceptable event \nand inappropriate and inconsistent with everything that is right about \ntaking care of our children in this country is truly a bit of an \ninconsistency, to be kind.\n  The issue of balancing this against a tax cut I find difficult. Tax \ncut for the rich? Sixty percent of the people who get the dividends \ncut, should we actually put it in place, are going to be senior \ncitizens. It is their money. It is their money.\n  The issue is, how do you prioritize spending? The President of the \nUnited States has prioritized spending. He has put education right at \nthe top of his priorities, at a much higher level than President \nClinton put it--in fact, at a level so much higher than President \nClinton put it that it represents a factor of two or three times what \nPresident Clinton did during his time in office.\n  He has done it at the same time as he has limited overall spending of \nthe Federal Government. The spending on education in this bill \nsignificantly exceeds the overall spending of the Federal Government in \nall accounts except possibly defense, because we are at war. That is a \nhard commitment, and it translates into real dollars, $1 billion of \nadditional money every year since he has been President for title I, \nfor IDEA, over $3 billion of new money--$3.9 billion--for title I. \nThose are hard dollars, real dollars, done in a responsible budgeting \nway.\n\n  Mr. President, is my time up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. All time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. 284.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), are \nnecessarily absent. I further announce that, if present and voting, the \nSenator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 50, nays 48, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 60 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--50\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--48\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Edwards\n     Kerry\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, for the information of our colleagues, \nthis is Wednesday night. I ask the Parliamentarian, how many hours are \nleft on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the majority side, there are 10 hours 17 \nminutes remaining. On the minority side, there are 11 hours 42 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. NICKLES. For the information of our colleagues, this is \nWednesday. We are working very aggressively to finish this bill. I have \ntried to see if we could not advance a lot of the major amendments, \nincluding the 350 amendment. I have been trying to get that up all day. \nI have not been successful, but I understand we will have that up \ntomorrow.\n  Several people have been asking about this amendment. This is the \namendment that would reduce the growth package from $725 billion to \n$350 billion. I suspect we will have votes on that tomorrow. It is my \nexpectation tonight, for the information of my colleagues, as long as \nthe majority leader is willing, we will stay in until midnight tonight. \nSeveral people said they did not want to have votes tonight, that they \nhave other things to do.\n  I have consulted with my friend and colleague from North Dakota who \nhas been a pleasure to work with on this resolution, and we both know \nwe have a lot of amendments with which we need to deal. I urge my \ncolleagues to work with us and not surprise us with their amendments, \nshow us their amendments, and we will see if we can agree to them or \nwork out a time agreement on them and see if we can finish this \nresolution in a timely, orderly fashion, in a way we would be proud to \nfunction. Sometimes the Senate does not do that when we handle budgets.\n  It would be my expectation that we would stay in at least until \nmidnight tonight and consider several amendments. I believe we now have \nthree amendments in order. Senator Kyl has an amendment dealing with \nthe death tax; Senator Graham of Florida has an amendment dealing with \nprescription drugs; and Senators Collins and Rockefeller have an \namendment dealing with assistance to States.\n\n[[Page S3965]]\n\n  We are willing to consider all those amendments and additional \namendments tonight. I will yield the floor. It is our expectation there \nwill not be any additional rollcall votes tonight, but that does not \nmean the Senate will not be considering amendments.\n  I urge my colleagues, if they have amendments, please work with \nSenator Conrad and myself to have those amendments timely considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, let me rivet a point that the chairman \nof the budget committee is making. We have three additional amendments \nlined up, but we should do more amendments tonight. If we are serious \nabout avoiding a vote-arama at the end, where we do not have a chance \nto describe amendments, we just have to vote on amendment after \namendment, the way to do that is not to do our work now.\n  I say to some colleagues who have said they have to make a change in \namendments, it is not convenient for them to come tonight, if we are \ngoing to get this done, they have to put aside convenience and get over \nhere and offer their amendments. There is a limited amount of time \nremaining to debate and discuss amendments, and people are going to \nlose their opportunity--let me make that very clear on our side--to \nhave time to debate their amendment. They will get a vote because the \nrules allow that, but they are going to lose their chance to debate and \ndiscuss it. So this is the time, if they want to debate an amendment, \nto get over here and offer the amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If my colleague will yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask my colleague, and perhaps Senator Nickles and the \nmajority leader as well, I fully agree with the notion we need to move \nalong, address these amendments, try to get through this budget \nresolution, but I also understand, as do most of my colleagues, that \nthe potential of military action is imminent--perhaps hours, perhaps a \nday, perhaps two days, I do not know, but my expectation would be when \nmilitary action is commenced and our sons and daughters of America are \nordered to military action and in the field, almost every Senator will \nwant to address and discuss that issue. My hope and expectation would \nbe at that moment, when we see what is the most serious decision faced \nby our country, that is, sending our young men and women to combat, \nthat we would want to leave the budget and have an ample amount of time \nfor every Member of the Senate to address that issue.\n  I inquire of my colleague and others who are managing this bill \nwhether that interval will be made available to Members of the Senate?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I respond to my colleague by saying I hope that would be \nthe case if we find ourselves at war, that there would be an ample \nopportunity for Senators to address that. My own belief is that would \nbe appropriate for the Senate to do, to turn its attention to a state \nof war. My own belief is it would be inappropriate for us to continue \non with business as usual when we have our sons and daughters in harm's \nway.\n  I am very hopeful if it comes to that, during this period while we \nare debating the budget, that it would be set aside for a time so there \nwould be a discussion in the Chamber and the Senators have a chance to \nexpress themselves.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I have a couple of objectives. First and \nforemost will be an appropriate response to military action if our \nwomen and men are engaged in combat. There will be an appropriate \nresponse in terms of support for our Commander in Chief, as well as the \nmilitary personnel, which will be discussed on the floor. There will be \nan opportunity to do that. At this juncture, we do not know when that \nwill occur, if it will occur. In all likelihood, it will occur at some \njuncture. I think the fact we are hearing from both sides of the aisle \nthat it is important to do--yet the time is uncertain--means I need to \ngo back to the first point the chairman and ranking member made, and \nthat is we have a lot of work to do; that the clock is ticking. The \nclock is ticking in terms of the budget process itself, in terms of the \nnumber of hours on both sides of the aisle. It is critically important \nthat Members of this body come to the floor to offer amendments, to \ncome up with specific language, to debate it and discuss it. That is \nthe reason we are going to be here for the next 6 hours to give that \nopportunity to Members. We will start in the morning at an early hour \nin order to fulfill our responsibilities in terms of the budget. That \nis the plan.\n\n  We will finish the budget this week. It may be tomorrow or tomorrow \nnight. It may be Friday morning, it may be Friday afternoon, it may be \nFriday night, but we will finish this budget this week.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the majority yield for one question?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I, of course, think the response by the \nmajority leader is perfectly appropriate. We do want to finish this \nbill. We ought to make progress and try and get it done. My only \ninquiry was if there is military action and if, in fact, our soldiers \nare in the field in hostile action, I agree with my colleague, Senator \nConrad, that I would not want us to be going through a vote-arama for \n6, 8, 10, 12 hours with business as usual. I would very much want us, \nand I think most Members of the Senate would want us, to move off what \nwe are doing and recognize that this Senate will want to express itself \non these issues, not to be critical but I think to be supportive, \nsupportive of our troops and supportive of this country's interests. We \nwant this to go well and we want to express ourselves on it.\n  I am satisfied with the majority leader's response. I wanted to say I \nfeel strongly, as do many others in this Chamber, about the desire to \naddress our support for those troops who are ordered to action, if that \nis the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. As we talked about this morning, a resolution of support \nfor President Bush, and the men and women, our troops, who will be in \nthe field, is being developed in concert with the minority leader, \nmyself, and others. We are working on that language, as the Senator \nwell knows, as we speak.\n  If and when military action occurs, that will be brought to the floor \nin short order, with an opportunity to express that very important \nsupport.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to yield to my friend for a question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Let me ask a question on process. A lot of us would like \nto offer amendments. This thing gets plugged up and goes on hour after \nhour. If the Senator wants to be in until midnight, that is fine. I \nhave an amendment I would like to offer, but should I offer it at 8, 9, \n10, 11, or 12? I would like some idea of where I am going to be in the \nqueue, but just to say come and offer amendments is not very conducive \nto an orderly process. So if there is some kind of queue, will there be \ntime limits put on these amendments so we have some idea of when we \nshould come over to offer our amendments? Since we are not going to \nhave any votes, it would be nice to have some idea of when we could \ncome over and offer our amendments.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to respond. Most of the amendments have \nbeen offered on the minority side, and we are happy to consider \namendments. I have been urging people to offer amendments dealing with \nthe growth package. We need to find out if the growth package is going \nto be zero, if it is going to be 350, if it is going to be 725. So I \nwould encourage those amendments. We had those amendments in committee. \nWe ought to have them on the floor. If we are going to have them, let \nus have them.\n  I have also encouraged other amendments. Members can work with our \ncolleague, Senator Conrad, as far as trying to prioritize which \namendments might be next on the minority side. I think that would be \nthe likely outcome.\n  Colleagues on this side have been consulting me as far as who would \nbe next on our side, and so at that point I think we might be better \nserved to\n\n[[Page S3966]]\n\nbegin considering amendments. Right now we have three amendments in the \nqueue. I believe Senator Kyl's amendment will not be debated too long \ntonight, maybe 30 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. At most.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Thirty minutes for his. I believe Senator Graham of \nFlorida is going to discuss the prescription drug amendment. That is a \npretty big amendment, a couple hundred billion dollars, I believe, and \nso that may take a little longer discussion. Then I believe there is \nalso a resolution to be offered by Senator Rockefeller and Senator \nCollins. That may take maybe an hour, maybe less than an hour. We will \nbe available for consideration of additional amendments. We may set \naside a lot of amendments tonight and stack those amendments that \nrequire a rollcall vote. Maybe most of these will not require a \nrollcall vote, but we are willing to stack some of these for votes for \nthe convenience of all Members.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the chairman yield on that very point?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Be happy to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. When does the chairman intend to vote on the amendments \nthat are going to be offered and considered this evening?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would expect that will be tomorrow afternoon. I will \nmake that decision after consulting both the majority leader and the \nranking member of the Budget Committee.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Presumably, then, if it is tomorrow afternoon, there \nwould be added to the list other amendments that will be offered \ntomorrow morning, is that the procedure?\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is correct. I say to my colleagues, for their \ninformation, I did consult with Senator Breaux and Senator Snowe, and I \nbelieve they are planning on offering the 350 amendment in the morning. \nThat is a very significant amendment, just so people will know that \nwill also be in the queue tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Oklahoma, has anyone suggested a \ntime limit on the debate on each of these amendments of no more than \nhalf an hour so more amendments can be debated? We know where we are \nheaded. We are going to run out of time and some of the amendments will \nnot even have 1 minute of debate if we are not careful.\n  Is it possible we could have a unanimous consent request to limit the \ndebate to no more than half an hour on each amendment?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Responding to my colleague, it depends on the amendment. \nI don't know if we can agree to a half an hour agreement on an \namendment that would increase spending on prescription drugs by $200 \nbillion. That does not fit for a 30-minute discussion. Possibly other \namendments might. So we will have to do an amendment-by-amendment \nbasis.\n  The resolution says each amendment would have up to 2 hours. I am \nhappy to shorten that when appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I wonder if, on the next three amendments, we might \narrive at a time agreement for the convenience of our colleagues. The \nSenator from Arizona has been very generous. He has said we can have 30 \nminutes equally divided, something like that. Would that be \nappropriate?\n  Mr. NICKLES. We are not prepared to enter into that on that amendment \nyet, nor on the Graham amendment. Possibly on the Rockefeller-Collins \nand possibly after Senator Collins' amendment we might agree to some of \nthese. But I don't think we are ready just yet.\n  Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Arizona for the purpose \nof introduction of an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 288\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 288.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide financial security to family farm and small \n  business owners by ending the unfair practice of taxing someone at \n                                 death)\n\n       On page 3, line 9, decrease the amount by $200,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 10, decrease the amount by $5,200,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 11, decrease the amount by $10,200,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 12, decrease the amount by $34,600,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 13, decrease the amount by $31,600,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 14, decrease the amount by $34,100,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 15, decrease the amount by $36,600,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 16, decrease the amount by $31,100,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 17, decrease the amount by $33,700,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 18, decrease the amount by $58,100,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 19, decrease the amount by $63,900,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 23, decrease the amount by $200,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 1, decrease the amount by $5,200,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 2, decrease the amount by $10,200,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 3, decrease the amount by $34,600,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 4, decrease the amount by $31,600,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 5, decrease the amount by $34,100,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 6, decrease the amount by $36,600,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 7, decrease the amount by $31,100,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 8, decrease the amount by $33,700,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 9, decrease the amount by $58,100,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 10, decrease the amount by $63,900,000,000.\n       On page 41, line 22, decrease the amount by $85,000,000.\n       On page 41, line 23, decrease the amount by $85,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 2, decrease the amount by $4,692,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 3, decrease the amount by $4,692,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 6, decrease the amount by $9,406,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 7, decrease the amount by $9,406,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 10, decrease the amount by \n     $33,617,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 11, decrease the amount by \n     $33,617,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 14, decrease the amount by \n     $30,324,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 15, decrease the amount by \n     $30,324,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 18, decrease the amount by \n     $32,408,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 19, decrease the amount by \n     $32,408,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 22, decrease the amount by \n     $35,018,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 23, decrease the amount by \n     $35,018,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 2, decreased the amount by \n     $28,750,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 3, decreased the amount by \n     $28,750,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 6, decreased the amount by $2,515,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 7, decreased the amount by $2,515,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 10, decreased the amount by $336,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 11, decreased the amount by $336,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 14, decreased the amount by $347,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 15, decreased the amount by $347,000,000.\n\n  Mr. KYL. In the spirit of the day, I was going to take 30 minutes. I \nwill take exactly half that time, 15 minutes, and perhaps later we can \nagree to a time limitation. We certainly should not need a great deal \nof time on this amendment.\n  This amendment is very simple. It simply moves forward 1 year the \ntime for repeal of the estate tax or what is known as the death tax. As \nmy colleagues know, we repealed the death tax permanently in the year \neffective January 1, 2010. This amendment moves that to January 1, \n2009.\n  The reason for this is we can establish the proposition with this \namendment that we do need to permanently repeal the estate tax. The \nbudget that has been crafted by Senator Nickles and his committee has \naccounted for 3 years of permanent repeal. So that is already accounted \nfor in this budget. This amendment would bring that forward 1 more \nyear, so we would have a total of 4 years of repeal of the estate tax \naccounted for in our budget.\n  We would still have to accomplish this, of course, by amendment or \nlegislation. We cannot do it as part of the budget itself. This would \ncreate the opportunity for us to do that. That is the reason for my \namendment.\n  Now, there are a lot of reasons we decided to repeal the estate tax, \nand I\n\n[[Page S3967]]\n\ndon't think we need to repeat all of those tonight. The majority of \nthis body supports repeal of the estate tax. We have passed repeal of \nthe estate tax. There were good reasons for doing so, primarily because \nit is an unfair tax.\n  In addition to that, it hurts small business. If you have a business \nof, say, 25 employees and you have to sell your assets, your equipment, \nin order to pay your estate taxes, not only have you had to disband \nyour business but you have also put 25 people out of work.\n  At this time in our economy where we are concerned about joblessness, \nwhere we want to create more jobs, not see more jobs disappear, knowing \nthe estate tax is going to be permanently repealed even sooner than we \nanticipated will help businesses stay alive to provide the jobs and the \neconomic growth we need.\n  We know by far and away the vast majority of the jobs in this country \nare created by small business.\n  There were a number of sponsors of our original repeal. I anticipate \nwe will have a number of sponsors of this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent Senator Sessions be added as an original \ncosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Rather than restating all the arguments for repeal, since we \nhave already voted to do that, I will bring my colleagues up to date on \nsome current research about what the American people believe about the \nestate tax.\n  A poll was conducted early this year between January 16 and 21. It \nwas a poll of about three times as many people as are ordinarily \ninterviewed. Over 2,500 registered voters were interviewed for this \nsurvey by a research company. Its findings ought to be of significant \ninterest to my colleagues.\n  The bottom line is with respect to the estate tax. The conclusion of \nthe poll is that the American people simply oppose, on principle, the \nconcept of anyone being taxed on the death of their parents or their \nspouse.\n  I thought I would share just four specific results from this survey. \nWhen it comes to stimulating the economy, the poll confirmed that \nAmericans overwhelmingly believe tax relief is more effective than \nincreases in Government spending. This goes to the general proposition \nthat is being debated between those who believe we should spend more to \nhelp our economy and those who believe we should provide tax relief.\n  The question was, Which is better for the Federal Government to \nstimulate the economy, increase economic growth, and create new jobs? \nAnd they were given two choices. One was the tax cut option, and the \nother was the spending option. Fully 68 percent chose the tax cut \noption, whereas only 20 percent said increased Government spending was \nthe best for economic growth and the creation of new jobs.\n  Two of the subgroups are particularly fascinating. Among Democrats \nsurveyed, the ratio in favor of tax cuts over increased spending is a \nhealthy 2 to 1, 57 percent to 28 percent. I do not have it broken down \nby State, but among Democrats, if it is 2 to 1, I daresay among \nRepublicans it is even more than that.\n  Among those with incomes below $30,000, 65 percent back the tax cut \napproach to improving the economy, while only 19 percent prefer \nincreased Government spending. This is a significant finding in the \nsurvey.\n  If there is going to be a tax cut, the question is, Should everyone \nget something back or should we wait until we have a budget surplus? In \nother words, what of this argument that will be contributing to the \ndeficit?\n  When given a choice of three options, even with the debate about the \nballooning deficit, just one in four Americans, 24 percent, believe \nthere should be no tax cuts for anyone until we have a budget surplus. \nLet me restate that. Only 24 percent of Americans believe it is \nimproper to cut taxes while we have a deficit.\n  For those who believe the majority of Americans do not want to cut \ntaxes until we are in a surplus situation, this survey demonstrates \nthat is incorrect. Only 24 percent of Americans believe that.\n  To the third point, tax fairness. This is where we get into the death \ntax repeal specifically, but it relates to other taxes, too. As a \ngeneral proposition, one expects people tend to favor taxes on someone \nelse and to oppose taxes that affect them directly. And that is, as a \ngeneral proposition, true. But what this survey of over 2,500 Americans \njust a couple of months ago confirms is that there is a very strong \nconsensus that there are a couple of taxes that are absolutely unfair \nand it does not make any difference what demographic category you are \nin. Whether you are rich or poor, the overwhelming majority believes \nthere are two taxes that are absolutely unfair, and there is an \noverwhelming consensus they should be repealed.\n  What are those two taxes? These are the two at the top of the list to \nthe question, What tax do you think is completely unfair or completely \nfair? The two taxes people would repeal with the biggest majority are \nthe Social Security benefit tax and the death tax.\n  Remember the tax that was imposed in the early Clinton years to \nactually tax Social Security benefits? That is very unpopular. Five \npercent of the people think it is completely fair; 62 percent think it \nis completely unfair.\n  With the death tax, 7 percent think it is completely fair and 62 \npercent also think that tax is completely unfair. Sixty-two percent of \nall Americans think it is completely unfair to have a death tax, and \nonly 7 percent think it is completely fair.\n  All other taxes--marriage penalty tax, long distance phone tax, \nsavings account tax, all the way down to stock dividends, payroll \nincome tax, property tax, gas tax, sales tax, right down the list, and \nthey get increasingly popular. The marriage penalty, 60 percent of \nAmericans think that is completely unfair. We are doing away with that \nin the tax package we will present as part of the budget. Long distance \nphone tax, 38 percent of the people think that is unfair. Capital gains \ntax, 23 percent think it is unfair. Stock dividend, more think it is \ncompletely unfair than completely fair, 23 to 21, the payroll tax, and \nso on. You finally get down to an alcohol and beer tax. That is pretty \nunpopular. Only 8 percent think that is a bad deal; 57 percent think it \nis fine. It is pretty much the same number for the cigarette tax.\n\n  The bottom line is in this very recent extraordinarily large survey \nwhat we find is the two taxes the American people would repeal first \nand foremost are the tax on Social Security benefits and the estate \ntax. Fully 62 percent of the American people believe that tax to be \ncompletely unfair.\n  With regard to the death tax in particular, you would think that this \nwould be a tax that rich people would really like to get rid of and \npoor people would like to keep. After all, by its very nature, if you \nhave a business or family farm or have some wealth to pass on to your \nheirs, repealing this tax would benefit you more than someone who has \nabsolutely nothing. What does the survey show?\n  Fully 65 percent of those with incomes below $30,000 believe the \ndeath tax is completely unfair. By comparison, a very interesting \nstatistic, only 59 percent of individuals with incomes above $60,000 \nlabel the death tax unfair.\n  Ironically, more people at the lower end of the economic spectrum \nview this tax as completely unfair than when you get to be higher in \nthe economic spectrum. The fact is, another poll, a Gallup poll, \ndemonstrated the same phenomenon. Even though most people understood \nthat repeal of the death tax would not benefit them personally, an \noverwhelming majority still favored repeal of the death tax. Why? \nBecause they understand it is unfair.\n  One of the great things about this country and the American people is \nthey have an innate sense of fairness. Even if something doesn't \nbenefit them directly, they understand if it is wrong they are willing \nto support its repeal.\n  There are some other interesting survey results in terms of arguments \nagainst the death tax. I thought some of these were fun, and then I \nwill close this out. If you ask certain questions about the death tax, \nfor example, if you remind people that the highest rate of taxation for \nthe death tax is 50 percent, then 79 percent of the people agree that \nis unfair and the tax should be repealed.\n  When you remind people that the inheritance tax represents double and \ntriple taxation, again 79 percent believe it should be repealed.\n\n[[Page S3968]]\n\n  With some of the arguments that are actual statements of fact with \nrespect to the inheritance or estate tax, when reminded of that, the \nAmerican people are even more strongly in support of its repeal than if \nthey are not reminded of that. Also, when you remind people that the \ntax is unfair because it singles out those who save and invest, for no \nreason other than the fact that they became successful and then died--\nof course, the exact thing we try to teach people, save your money, \ninvest it, try to pass it along to your kids. It is the American dream \nto make the next generation better off than your generation; if you \nlive the American dream, you get punished. If you are broke, you don't \nget punished. Of course the American people, when reminded of that, are \neven stronger in favor of repeal.\n  The bottom line is every subgroup and fully 58 percent of the \nelectorate as a whole, including, as I said, a majority of every \nsubgroup, would vote for a candidate who advocates repeal of the death \ntax. Only 32 percent would vote for the candidate who supported \nmaintaining the death tax.\n  The bottom line of all this research is it seems to me we would not \nbe keeping faith with the American people unless we are willing to move \nforward the date that the death tax is repealed.\n  In the interim period of time, we are reducing the rate and we are \nalso increasing the amount of income that is exempted from the \ninheritance tax. Both are good. But it seems to me, given this fact, \nthat it is not too much to ask my colleagues to accelerate by 1 year \nthe date that the tax is actually repealed. There will be some who say \nwe cannot afford an immediate repeal today. To that I say, if that is \nyour view, fine. That is not what we are doing here. I would prefer to \ndo that.\n  I think we can compromise and agree that moving the repeal date \nforward 1 year is both something that is affordable and something that \nshould be done.\n  This amendment is very straightforward. That is the long and short of \nit. I think I pointed out the American people would support this. I \nhope since the Senate has already gone on record by repealing the \nestate tax in the year 2010, that we would not be bashful about moving \nthat forward by 1 year, to 2009.\n  I guess my question to the body when we finally bring this to a vote \nis, Did you mean it when you said we should repeal the estate tax? If \nso, let's move that repeal date forward by 1 year.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, might I ask the author of this amendment \nwhat the cost is?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will try to get the exact number here in \njust a moment. I am informed that the estimated cost is $46 billion.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is $46 billion?\n  Mr. KYL. Correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say to my colleague--\n  Mr. KYL. Might I add one more thing, that, in our amendment, is \naccounted for within the budget because the money is taken from another \naccount so it is not added on to the expense of the budget.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That was going to be my next question, if I could, to the \nSenator. What is the way the Senator pays for this $46 billion?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I tell my colleague the function in the \nbudget is No. 920. That is the source of the funding for this \namendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Could the Senator tell us what constitutes 920?\n  Mr. KYL. That is a general fund for Finance Committee action at some \nspecified date in the future.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would say to my colleagues and the Senator from \nArizona, it strikes me as ill-timed to come before the body and ask for \nanother $46 billion when we are already deep in debt. We now know we \nare going to be facing deficits this year of $500 billion; the deficits \nas defined by law of over $300 billion every year for the next 10 \nyears. We are going to be taking virtually every penny of the Social \nSecurity surplus under the chairman's mark. Now the Senator offers $46 \nbillion, which he funds by reducing function 920. Function 920, of \ncourse, is a general governmental function, which is a popular place to \nreduce around here.\n  I say to my colleagues, it seems to me that a wiser course than full \nrepeal, which costs, combined with this amendment, $207 billion over \nthe period of this budget, when we are already running deficits under \nthe chairman's mark of $1.7 trillion, that a wiser course would be, \ninstead of waiting until 2009 to have an elimination of the estate tax, \nto have people waiting all of that time between now and then and having \nan exemption of $1 million currently, instead of that, we could go to a \n$3 million exemption per person, $6 million per couple, have it take \neffect now, and only cost $33 billion for the whole thing, a fraction \nof the cost of complete repeal. We would continue to have a functioning \nestate tax but fundamentally reform it: Change it, don't end it. Change \nit to say an individual would have $3 million completely sheltered; a \nfamily would have $6 million completely sheltered. With planning, they \ncould do substantially more than that and have that effective now, have \nthat effective in the first part of the budget year that we are \ndiscussing. That would have a cost of $33 billion instead of the cost \nof permanent repeal of $207 billion, especially given the fact we are \nalready in deep deficit.\n  At some point I hope colleagues will begin to consider alternatives, \nto reform the estate tax, to change it, to make it more fair, and to \nfundamentally buttress the economic security of the country by not \ncompounding these record deficits we already have.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield to my colleague for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say to my colleague, Senator Conrad, I am unfamiliar \nwith this notion of a tax on death. My colleague from Arizona spoke at \nlength about the death tax.\n  I am wondering, would it not be true that should a Member of the \nSenate, perhaps a married Member of the Senate, die, God forbid, in the \ncoming week or so, that the spouse of that Member of the Senate would \ninherit, would have all of their property immediately with the spousal \nexemption, so that death would incur no tax, there would be no tax?\n  So if there is a death in which there is no tax--which is the case \nwith respect to the spouses, a 100-percent exemption--and all the \nproperty goes to the spouse, with no tax consequence, then exactly what \nis the death tax the Senator from Arizona is referring to? Is it, in \nfact, the tax on inherited wealth that exists in our law?\n  And if it is on inherited wealth, of course, that is a different \ndiscussion which we should have. But if it is the death tax--which is a \nterm that was created by pollsters to evoke a certain response--is it \nnot the case that there is not a tax on death, that many deaths in this \ncountry means the estate is probated, and all of the assets of that \nestate go immediately to the spouse, with no tax under any \ncircumstances? Is that not the case?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is the case. In fact, there is no death tax in \nAmerica. That is a good rhetorical line, but there is no tax at death \nin America. Only 2 percent of estates currently are taxed, and they are \ntaxed because they have amounts of value in the estate of over $1 \nmillion.\n  Now, under current law, in 2009, only three-tenths of 1 percent of \nestates will be subject to tax. That would mean 99.7 percent of estates \nwould not be taxed.\n  I might say, under the proposal I am suggesting tonight, we could go \nto that level next year. Why wait to have estate tax reform? Why not go \nto a $3 million exemption per person, $6 million per couple, and not \nwait until 2009?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I want to complete my thought and complete my exchange \nwith my colleague. Then I will be happy to yield.\n  The thing that strikes me is we have gotten off on a debate here that \nreally is detached from reality. It is detached from reality because \nthe cost of full repeal in the next 10 years is $207 billion. How is \nthat going to be financed? It is going to be financed by borrowing the \nmoney. It is going to be financed by taking it out of the Social \nSecurity trust fund surpluses. That is how it is going to be financed.\n  Now, does that make any sense? I would say no. I would say to borrow\n\n[[Page S3969]]\n\nthe money to give a big tax cut to the wealthiest Americans really does \nnot make a whole lot of sense.\n  Does that mean the current estate tax ought to be retained? No, it \nshould not. It ought to be reformed, not repealed. It ought to be \naltered, as I suggest, so that a couple could exempt $6 million \ndollars. That costs a fraction of repeal and would give immediate \nrelief.\n  I am happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield further for a question, is it \nnot the case that the majority last year passed a tax plan that had the \nfollowing rather comical circumstance: It said we will sequentially \nincrease the exemption on the estate tax to the point where in 2010 it \nis repealed, but in the year 2011 it actually comes back again?\n\n  And if that is the case--I believe it is--I think historians will \nlook back at this and say, well, who on Earth could have thought of \nthat? Well, they thought of it, all right. That is what they put in the \ntax bill.\n  Now, if that is the case, isn't it also the case that the amendment \nbeing offered today says let's make it even more farcical: Let's decide \nwe will increase the exemption up until 2009, and we will have a 2-year \nrepeal of the estate tax, to have it come back in 2011?\n  We laughed a little last year about estate planning. There are going \nto be a lot of people on life support in 2009 because they have to wait \nuntil 2010 to die to get the total exemption, total repeal that was \noffered by the majority party.\n  Now they are going to offer a 2-year window for death, apparently, \nand then the estate tax comes back in 2011. It is the most Byzantine, \npreposterous amount of nonsense. You would not put 10 people in a room \nwith a six-pack of beer and come out with a worse result than they came \nout with last year on this estate tax issue.\n  But to get back on the final point, it was passed as a repeal of the \ndeath tax when, in fact, there is no tax on death. There is a tax on \ninherited wealth.\n  I ask my colleague, isn't the remaining question for this Senate, do \nwe want to have some basic taxation on the largest estates--on the \nlargest estates--of $1 billion, $10 billion, $20 billion, many of which \nhave never been subjected to any kind of a tax because they were built \nwith inside buildup and built with growth appreciation and have never \nbeen subjected to tax?\n  Is the final argument, final debate, and final question, do we want \nto retain at least some basis of an estate tax for the very largest \nestates?\n  Mr. CONRAD. It would seem to me really almost self-evident that the \nwiser course here would be immediate reform of the estate tax. Let's go \nto $3 million for an individual, $6 million for a couple. It would cost \n$33 billion over the next decade, but that is a fraction of the over \n$200 billion it would cost to fully repeal it.\n  My colleague is quite correct, in estates of over $10 million, fully \n56 percent of the value of those estates has never been taxed. This is \naccording to a study by Poterba and Weisbenner, that finds that is as a \nresult of unrealized capital gains and as a result of buildup of \nproperty values never subjected to tax at all.\n  So the question is, what is going to be the way we share the tax \nburden in this country? What is the most fair and equitable way to do \nthat?\n  I would suggest completely eliminating the estate tax for very \nwealthy individuals, which is of necessity going to force others--\nmiddle-class people, lower-middle-class people--to pay more in order to \nfoot the bill, is not fair. It is not equitable.\n  It would really make more sense to fundamentally change the estate \ntax, to give a much larger exemption than we currently have. Currently, \nit is $1 million. Instead, we should raise that to $3 million for an \nindividual, $6 million for a couple, and do it immediately. It costs a \nfraction of repealing it all. We would still have wealthy individuals \nin this country who would have an opportunity to contribute and not \nshift that tax burden onto middle-income taxpayers.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friend and colleague.\n  I heard your proposal that would increase the exemption. I did not \nhear you address rates. Would you leave the rates at the present 50-\npercent rate for estates that would be taxed?\n  Mr. CONRAD. What I just described, I say to the Senator, I don't know \nif you had a chance to hear.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to look at it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is to have a reform of estate tax. Instead of the $1 \nmillion exemption currently, to go to $3 million for an individual, $6 \nmillion for a couple. In this calculation, it costs $33 billion. I \ndon't----\n  Mr. NICKLES. What is the tax rate?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I was going to get to that.\n  I think this is at the 50-percent rate. I would certainly be open to \nan adjustment of that rate as well in order to try to arrive at a \nconclusion that was equitable and that is not as costly as full repeal.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from North Dakota yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I have been sitting here listening to this debate. Under \nthe proposal offered by the distinguished Senator from Arizona, it is \nmy understanding that Warren Buffet, who is worth $38 billion, I was \ntold----\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much?\n  Mr. REID. Worth $38 billion.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is real money.\n  Mr. REID. If he passed away, under this amendment offered by my \nfriend from Arizona, he would pay no estate taxes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct. He would pay no estate tax.\n  Mr. REID. What would happen to his accumulated wealth?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, it would go as directed under his will. I am not \nprivy to what distributions he has determined to make.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from North Dakota yield for another \nquestion?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I wanted to confirm that the Senator from North Dakota has \nlistened to Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Sr., and George Soros. I have \nheard those three people state that they think it is ridiculous, \nsenseless to have them pay no estate tax. Have you heard these three \nvery wealthy men say this?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have. In fact, I have heard all three of those \ngentlemen and other wealthy individuals--George Soros, of course, who \nis a multibillionaire; Mr. Buffett, a multibillionaire; Mr. Gates, Sr., \nI don't think he himself is a multibillionaire, although he is \nobviously a very wealthy individual--say they believe it is un-American \nnot to have an estate tax; that an estate tax was put in place first of \nall to raise revenue during a war, interestingly enough. That is how we \ninitially got the estate tax, was to help pay for a war.\n  Here we are on the brink of another war, and instead of figuring out \nhow to pay for it, we are trying to figure out how to have trillions of \ndollars of additional tax cuts going primarily to the wealthiest among \nus. It really is kind of baffling. We are asking young men and women to \nbe prepared to sacrifice everything, and we are prepared to sacrifice \nnothing, apparently.\n  There are many wealthy individuals who believe the estate tax ought \nto be modified. I would strongly support that. I don't think a million-\ndollar exemption anymore is realistic or very relevant in light of the \neconomy today. I believe it ought to be dramatically increased. I think \nwe ought to go to $3 million for an individual, $6 million for a \ncouple, and we ought to do it now. I would also be open to a reduction \nin rates. I think 50 percent is too high. But repealing it all is \nunaffordable, it is unfair, and it is fundamentally a long-term \nmistake. Why? Because I think it will lead to the concentration of \nwealth in the hands of fewer and fewer people.\n  If you look back to the establishment of the estate tax, one of the \nforemost advocates was a Republican President, Theodore Roosevelt. \nTheodore Roosevelt said it is a profound social mistake to allow wealth \nto accumulate in the hands of a handful of people who, by inheritance, \nbecome enormously powerful; that our society is a society based on \nmerit and a society based on what an individual achieves, not what they \ninherit; and that if we want to become like Europe and have inherited \nwealth assume a greater and greater\n\n[[Page S3970]]\n\nrole in society, then eliminate the estate tax, because in very short \norder you will have enormous wealth and power accumulate in the hands \nof a few.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. In my previous question to the Senator from North Dakota, I \ntalked about three very successful men, all of whom are senior \ncitizens. I want to relate to the Senator from North Dakota that about \n2 months ago I had dinner in Las Vegas with a man I had never met \nbefore. His name is Pierre Omidyar. Pierre is the founder of eBay. As a \nyoung man, he had this idea and on his computer developed eBay which is \nnow a fantastically significant part of our economy. It is his. He, in \nspite of the stock market dropping, is worth $3 or $4 billion. He is 34 \nyears old.\n  The whole purpose of his dinner with me, just the two of us, was to \nexplain to me how he hoped I would work as hard as I could to make sure \nthe estate tax is not repealed. Here is a man who is happily married, \nhas two little children, and is one of the wealthiest men in America. \nHe is not an old man; he is a very young man. And he believes, as does \nthe Senator from North Dakota, that acquired wealth in large amounts is \nnot good for America.\n\n  I don't think I have given this story to the Senator from North \nDakota, have I?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No.\n  Mr. REID. But if we have these very successful people talking about \nwhy they believe it is bad--I have been present when Mr. Gates, Mr. \nBuffett, and Mr. Soros all talked about their belief that by a roll of \nthe dice, a roulette wheel, they were born in America. They said they \ncould have their entrepreneur genius--those are words I am using, not \ntheirs--and if they were born anyplace but in the United States, it \nwouldn't amount to much. They believe as a result of their having been \nborn in America, they owe that to America.\n  The Senator has heard those statements, has he not?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator agree that those three older men and the \nyoung man have a concept of what the Senator from North Dakota is \nsaying: Change the estate tax, raise it if it is appropriate. I believe \nit is appropriate. Would the Senator agree that we have tried to do \nthat? We have asked unanimous consent. We have offered amendments that \nhave been defeated. I want the Senator from North Dakota to see if he \nagrees with me. I think people want the political issue more than they \nwant to change the estate tax. Would the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I hope that is not the case. We have an opportunity now \nto resolve the estate tax for a long time. If we would reform it \nwithout repealing it, we would do something that is important and \nvaluable. At $1 million, the estate tax is biting at much too low a \nlevel. Most of us in this Chamber would certainly degree with that \nstatement. The economy has changed. The world has changed. We have not \nmade a significant enough adjustment in the estate tax. We have not \nmodernized the estate tax in a way that makes any sense.\n  One million, it has been raised to that, but that has not kept pace \nwith what has happened in the real world. As a result, it is putting \ntoo much pressure on small farmers and small business people. We could \ndo something right now. We could raise that exemption to $3 million for \nan individual and $6 million for a couple. With planning, it could be \nsubstantially more than that. That would shield the vast majority of \nsmall businesses, the vast majority of individuals. At the same time, \nwe would not have the extraordinary cost associated with repeal.\n  We have to have current events inform our decisions. The hard reality \nis, we are in record deficit. We have deficits as far as the eye can \nsee. And the situation is going to get worse when the baby boomers \nretire. From where is the money going to come? If you repeal the estate \ntax, that burden is going to have to shift somewhere else. It is going \nto raise taxes on middle-income people. That is where most of the taxes \nare paid. I don't think that is the appropriate outcome.\n  I do think we ought to reform it. We ought to raise this. I would \neven be open to what the chairman of the committee has referenced as \nthe tax rate itself, which at 50 percent seems unreasonably high as \nwell. Perhaps in the time remaining here we might get together and come \nup with something that would really be a contribution to the country \nand a valuable change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as I understand it, the Senator from \nArizona had offered an amendment. We had discussed, prior to his \noffering the amendment, that Senator Graham, I, and Senator Stabenow \nwould offer an amendment on prescription drugs. I would ask the manager \nabout the circumstances. Do we need to set aside the amendment that is \nnow pending in order to offer the amendment on prescription drugs for \nSenator Graham, myself, and Senator Stabenow?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is correct. We need to set it aside. I think \na couple of us want to speak on the amendment that is pending before we \nset it aside.\n  I think the debate has been on the one side for the last 25 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand. We were told that the presentation of that \nwas going to be 5 minutes, and we were going to move to that amendment. \nThat has not quite happened. I wonder when we might expect to move to \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to go through \nthe Chair for parliamentary procedure. I didn't make that point, but I \nthink it is important.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator is finished with his inquiry, I yield to \nthe Senator from Alabama 10 minutes. Would that be sufficient?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That would be sufficient.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Kyl, which he failed to file earlier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, is the Senator proceeding on a modified \namendment?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. My understanding is that it has been agreed to \npreviously.\n  Mr. CONRAD. There has been no request to modify the amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I withdraw that request at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama has the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, there is a death tax. I had in my office \n2 days ago Professor Harold Apolinsky, from the University of Alabama. \nHe is indeed a brilliant professor. He has dedicated his life to the \nelimination of the death tax. He says it is an immoral tax. He feels so \nstrongly about it that he has given an incredible amount of his time \nand effort and resources into seeking its elimination.\n  I recall just how much of an impact it can have. A lady I know told \nme the story of her grandfather. President Reagan had been in office in \n1981, and they passed an amendment that changed the death tax a little \nbit.\n  Do you know what it was then when they changed it? The rate was 70 \npercent on estates over $175,000. Four Members in this body voted to \nkeep it at that rate. They reduced it to 55 percent. Big deal.\n  They were home for Christmas and the family was gathered. He had \ncancer and he was dying, fading fast. She told the story that every \nmorning he asked what day it was. He died at 10 a.m. on January 1, the \nday the law took effect--his last great act for his family to protect a \nlittle bit more of the farm that he had built up over all those years.\n  I believe we are in agreement on the modification now; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama has the floor.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 288, As Modified\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I reoffer the modification on behalf of \nSenator Kyl. I think maybe we have an understanding now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, and we will not object, we \nare happy to have the amendment modified\n\n[[Page S3971]]\n\nso that Senator Kyl's actual intention is embodied in the amendment. We \nare happy to allow that modification to be made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 3, line 9, increase the amount by $115,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 10, increase the amount by $508,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 11, increase the amount by $595,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 12, increase the amount by $783,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 13, increase the amount by $1,076,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 14, decrease the amount by $3,909,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 15, decrease the amount by $12,218,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 16, decrease the amount by $28,750,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 17, decrease the amount by $2,515,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 18, decrease the amount by $336,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 19, decrease the amount by $347,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 23, increase the amount by $115,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 1, increase the amount by $508,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 2, increase the amount by $595,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 3, increase the amount by $783,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 4, increase the amount by $1,076,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 5, decrease the amount by $3,909,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 6, decrease the amount by $12,218,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 7, decrease the amount by $28,750,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 8, decrease the amount by $2,515,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 9, decrease the amount by $336,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 10, decrease the amount by $347,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 14, increase the amount by $115,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 15, increase the amount by $508,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 16, increase the amount by $595,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 17, increase the amount by $783,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 18, increase the amount by $1,076,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 19, decrease the amount by $3,909,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 20, decrease the amount by $12,218,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 21, decrease the amount by $28,750,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 22, decrease the amount by $2,515,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 23, decrease the amount by $336,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 24, decrease the amount by $347,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 4, increase the amount by $115,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 5, increase the amount by $508,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 6, increase the amount by $595,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, increase the amount by $783,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, increase the amount by $1,076,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 9, decrease the amount by $3,909,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, decrease the amount by $12,218,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, decrease the amount by $28,750,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 12, decrease the amount by $2,515,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 13, decrease the amount by $336,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 14, decrease the amount by $347,000,000.\n       On page 41, line 22, increase the amount by $115,000,000.\n       On page 41, line 23, increase the amount by $115,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 2, increase the amount by $508,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 3, increase the amount by $508,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 6, increase the amount by $595,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 7, increase the amount by $595,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 10, increase the amount by $783,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 11, increase the amount by $783,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 14, increase the amount by $1,076,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 15, increase the amount by $1,076,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 18, decrease the amount by $3,909,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 19, decrease the amount by $3,909,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 22, decrease the amount by \n     $12,218,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 23, decrease the amount by \n     $12,218,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 2, decrease the amount by $28,750,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 3, decrease the amount by $28,750,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 6, decrease the amount by $2,515,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 7, decrease the amount by $2,515,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 10, decrease the amount by $336,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 11, decrease the amount by $336,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 14, decrease the amount by $347,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 15, decrease the amount by $347,000,000.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this is a big deal in real life. We are \ntalking about taking half of somebody's accumulated estate. That is a \nlot. It does happen when people die, and there are professionals out \nthere who do this business, and they try to manipulate and avoid and \ndelay, and sometimes they are successful, sometimes they are not. I \nwant to talk about it in a little bit different vein tonight.\n  I want to talk about what I think is a major problem in America. I \nknow Senator Conrad is concerned about it. It is a collapse of smaller \nbusinesses and a trend toward larger and larger consolidation of \nbusiness.\n  I know an individual in Alabama--I met him at a town hall meeting. He \nand his father spoke to me. They told me they are paying $5,000 a month \nfor life insurance on their father's life. They own three motels. They \nwould like to expand motels. That $5,000 a month would probably help \nthem buy a fourth motel. But they have to pay it for no other reason \nthan if something happens to their father, they would have to pay an \nestate tax, and it would come out of their small business and they \nwould lose it.\n  Remember, this little chain of three motels is competing against \nRamada, Holiday Inn, Marriott, and they are getting savaged every \ngeneration by a 50-percent tax on what the value of that family's \nestate is. That tax is not paid by the broadly held corporations, the \ninternational corporations. They never pay this tax. Think about it. It \nis a tax that falls on small businesses and individuals. It does not \nfall on big businesses.\n  I know an individual who owns several thousand acres of land. He is \nvery fortunate and very generous with ball teams and schools and \ncharitable organizations and is a wonderful person. Some might say he \nis wealthy. But the big paper companies own millions of acres of land. \nThey don't ever pay a death tax. He is competing, really, with them.\n  I know International Paper owns 2 million acres of land. They are \nnever impacted by the death tax.\n  Ask yourself, why is it that banks in towns all over America are \nclosing? In Mobile, AL, we had four local banks. They are all gone \ntoday. One or two came back, but all of them were sold out to the big \nones. Why? Because the people who owned them got up in years and they \nwere facing a confiscatory tax on what they had accumulated. They \ndidn't have the cash to pay it. Everything they owned was in the bank, \nthe business they built up. They had to get out and get liquid and \ncreate a situation in which they could avoid some taxes, perhaps, and \nhave the cash to pay the tax because if they had to sell off the \nbusiness all at once to pay the tax, it would collapse.\n  I am saying, with absolute confidence, this death tax is a driving \nforce behind the collapse of small businesses. Think about funeral \nhomes. I know the occupant of the chair, who is from Tennessee, knows \nthat the people running those funeral homes are usually good business \npeople. As the population grew and more people came to the end of their \nlife, they have done well in their business, but they are then facing \nthe death tax. Maybe they have stock or bought some property, and they \nmay have a home that has appreciated in value. All of a sudden they are \nlooking at a big hit.\n  Now funeral homes are being brought up by chains--broadly held \ncorporations now have these funeral homes. They will never pay the \ndeath tax. It will never impact them.\n  How do you with a $3 million company compete with Holiday Inn? We \nwant to encourage $50 million companies, $100 million companies, and \n$200 million companies to compete against billion-dollar companies. We \nare chopping them off.\n  A vision I have is that you go out in the woods and there is a little \npine tree trying to grow and compete with the taller trees. But just as \nit breaks in and gets sunlight, somebody comes in and chops the top off \nand takes half of it. It will never be able to compete.\n  We are putting them at a disadvantage. It cannot be overcome. I \nbelieve\n\n[[Page S3972]]\n\nit is unhealthy. If we care about small business, about encouraging \ninnovation and competition and growth in America, we need to think \nabout this. So I think there are a lot of reasons we ought to consider \nthe elimination of this tax. It is certainly an unfair tax. People have \npaid their taxes, and then at the time of their death, they are taxed \nagain in a way that savages the ability of a business to remain \ncompetitive.\n\n  I note that the taxes are only a percent or two of the income to this \nGovernment. It is not critical to our revenue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We voted to eliminate the death tax once before. It is \ntime to complete the job. I support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I know there are colleagues who want to \noffer the prescription drug amendment. I will make a few comments on \nelimination of the death tax.\n  A couple of people said there is no tax on death. I disagree. I can \nsay that from experience. My father died, and there was a significant \ndeath tax. His death was a taxable event. If he had not died, there \nwould not have been a taxable event. To say there is no death tax--\nmaybe it is something the pollsters came up with--is something about \nwhich I totally disagree.\n  Under current law, if you die, if your estate is above a certain \namount, your survivors will have to pay a tax. I call that a death tax. \nIt can be called an inheritance tax, an estate tax, whatever one wants \nto call it.\n  We did pass an exemption in 1981 that exempted surviving spouses from \nthe death tax. I was one of the principal sponsors of that legislation \nin 1981. I worked to put that in the big bill. That was one of the big \ntax bills. I was a freshman Senator and I really wanted to put that in \nthe bill because I learned the hard way.\n  My father passed away. My mother had five kids, and she inherited a \nbusiness. The Government came in and said: We want about half of the \nbusiness. We negotiated, struggled, and agonized. I say we, I was a \nchild. My mother struggled for years over what the size of this company \nwas, how much of it the Government was entitled to--were they entitled \nto half of it, a third of it. Eventually, something was settled but she \nhad to pay the Government. I guess I did, too. Survivors who wanted to \nkeep the business had to pay a lot of tax. Why? Because my father died. \nSo if somebody says there is not a death tax, I disagree.\n  They say: We exempt spouses. That does not make any difference. If \nyou want to pass your business on to your son, the Government says: We \nwant half.\n  Somebody said it only applies to 1 percent or 2 percent of the \nestates. What tax rate is right? Fifty percent? I appreciate the fact \nthat my colleague from North Dakota said the rate is too high. It is \ntoo high. Why would we tax estates, a death tax, in excess of the \npersonal tax rate? The maximum personal tax rate hopefully will soon be \n35 percent. The maximum corporate rate is 35 percent. Why should a \ntaxable event caused by death be as much as 50 percent?\n  Frankly, if we do not extend the law, it could go back to 55 and 60 \npercent. In present law, the maximum is 50 percent. But if the 2001 law \nexpires--if we go back before we made the changes in 2001, then the \nmaximum tax rate returns to 55 percent, and on a taxable estate between \n$10 million and $17 million, there is an additional 5 percent \nsurcharge. It will go back to 60 percent.\n  I hear some colleagues say: We should exempt not just $1 million, but \nmaybe $2 million or $3 million, maybe twice that amount for spouses. \nBut above that, we still would have a rate of 50 percent. That is way \ntoo high. Why is that? Why in the world if somebody passes away should \nthe Government take half? If somebody builds a business and let's say \nthey build up the business, and maybe they are employing thousands of \npeople, should the Government come in and take half? Whoever inherited \nthe business has to sell it and pay taxes. The Government wins and the \nemployees lose--they lose their jobs.\n\n  What about George Soros? He is a billionaire. Or Mr. Buffett? My \nguess is--I do not know--my guess is they have foundations, they have \ngreat tax accountants, and they were able to set up foundations that do \nnot pay tax, period.\n  They do not pay tax on their earnings. They are tax exempt, and they \ndo not pay death taxes. They built up these enormous foundations. \nGreat, I am proud of them.\n  There are a whole lot of people who own family farms and businesses \nthat they are trying to grow and expand, and they are not big enough to \nhire attorneys and have foundations, and they are liable for a death \ntax. That hangs as a heavy cloud over a lot of businesses that decide \nnot to grow because they know if they grow, the Government is going to \nget half.\n  We did work in 2001 to bring that down. We gradually brought it down \nto, I think, 45 percent. It goes to zero in the year 2010, and then \npresumably if we do not pass a bill to change it, by 2011, it will pop \nback up to 55, maybe even as much as 60 percent.\n  Senator Kyl says let's expand that zero bracket. The resolution \nbefore us presumes--presumes--that Congress will extend the provisions \nin the 2001 tax bill, so it would extend the repeal of the death tax \nfor the year not only 2010, but also 2011 and 2012. Senator Kyl's \namendment says it should be for the year 2009. That will be 4 years \nwith a zero tax on the taxable event of death.\n  If somebody says they pay no tax, they do not understand Senator \nKyl's amendment. They do not understand the law we passed. Senator \nKyl's amendment and the present law says a taxable event is moved from \ndeath to the sale of the property. What does the sale of the property \nmean? It means capital gains. What is the tax rate on capital gains? It \nis 20 percent.\n  Also in that provision we passed in 2001, it says we eliminate or \nstop the step-up in basis over a certain amount. What does that mean? \nIt means if George Soros has a net worth of $38 billion and he passed \naway, if he has not paid capital gains on that net worth and there is \nno step-up in basis and the initial investment was much less than that, \nthen he would be taxed at 20 percent on that incremental value.\n  Maybe if he had initial investment of, let's say, $18 billion--I \ndoubt it would be that much; maybe a lot less--he would pay 20 percent \non the incremental difference between the carry-over basis and what it \nwas at the time of sale. If somebody in his company did not sell the \nbusiness, there would not be a tax.\n  I like to think of this more in the vernacular of a small business. \nIf a small business wants to pass it on to their kids and the kids do \nnot sell the business, they do not pay a tax. But when and if they do \nsell, they pay a tax. There would be capital gains on a carried-over \nbasis.\n  It is interesting, the people who have scored some of these \namendments, Joint Tax, sort of forgot to account the offsetting \nadditional income that would be generated from the sale of operations, \nthe capital gains that would be measured.\n\n  The law we passed in 2001 says: Let's change the taxable event from \ndeath to when the property is sold. If someone receives property as a \nresult of someone's death and they sell it, then they pay capital \ngains. If they do not sell it, then there is no capital gains. The \ntaxable event would no longer be death; it would be when the property \nis sold. It makes eminent good sense.\n  There are other ways of doing this, but the present law in taxing \nestates and taxing inherited property or taxing a business or a farm or \na ranch just makes no sense whatsoever. The big boys are able to figure \nout ways to get around it through fancy accountants and foundations, \nand they do not pay the tax. A lot of middle-income people and smaller \nbusinesses pay a lot of tax. It really does inhibit their growth.\n  I compliment my colleague from Arizona for his amendment. I am \nintrigued by the interest of my colleagues from North Dakota and Nevada \nin maybe trying to do something. I think we can do something, and we \nhave the opportunity to do it. It will not be done in this bill. We did \nnot put in a reconciliation instruction dealing with this provision, \nbut it is something we can deal with and this Congress ought to deal \nwith. There is some money on the table\n\n[[Page S3973]]\n\nto make that available. We should have a tax rate on a taxable estate \nor inherited property in the neighborhood of 20 percent. You might \ngenerate some money.\n  Right now this tax is counterproductive in so many ways. I will give \none example. Our business did not grow because we were thinking at that \ntime that the Government would take so much, so why would anybody \nexpand if the Government is going to come in and take it? And how could \nyou pass property on from one generation to another generation to \nanother generation if the Government wanted to come in and take half \nevery time? It just does not work. It is very difficult for a privately \nheld business, if they want to pass it on from the second and third \ngeneration, to do so if the Government is going to take half. That \nbusiness may be more than $3 million. That business may be $20 million. \nIt may be $100 million. Think of some great companies that might be \nprivately held. If the owners pass away, should the Government take \nhalf? I do not think so. I would hope not.\n  I am intrigued by the ideas that different colleagues have.\n  I encourage an open dialogue. I think my colleague from Arizona is to \nbe complimented for his work in this field. I am intrigued and \nencouraged by some of the debate I am hearing. I would love to see us \ncome up with a bipartisan, permanent resolution on how to address the \nestate tax. The present law is not satisfactory. It needs to be \namended. It needs to be addressed, and I would love to see this \nCongress this year pass something we could all be proud of that would \nbe a significant and positive reform for businesses and individuals all \nacross the country.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator, the manager of the bill for the \nmajority, on the next amendment which will be offered, which will be \nprescription drugs, allow a time of 40 minutes on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I cannot agree to a 40 minute time limit----\n  Mr. REID. I withdraw the request.\n  Mr. NICKLES. On an amendment that deals with $200 billion. That would \nbe so many billion dollars per minute. That might be a little \nexpensive. I will be happy to work with my colleagues.\n  If no other Senators wish to speak on the underlying amendment, I ask \nunanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment so an amendment \noffered by the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from Florida \ncan be offered at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 294\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senator Graham of Florida, and Senator Stabenow, and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Graham of Florida, and Ms. Stabenow, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 294.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I will describe the general direction of \nthis amendment. I will be followed by my colleague, Senator Graham of \nFlorida, who will talk in greater specifics about the particular \napproach dealing with a prescription drug benefit in Medicare. \nFollowing that, my colleague from Michigan will also speak.\n  This amendment would increase the amount of money available to put a \nprescription drug benefit in the Medicare Program. I think we are long \npast the point where the question is whether we should put a \nprescription drug benefit in the Medicare Program. The question is no \nlonger whether. I think almost all Members of the Congress agree we \nought to do that. The question is how. How do we do it? What kind of a \nprescription drug benefit do we put in the Medicare Program?\n  Senior citizens are 12 percent of the population in our country, yet \nthey consume one-third of all prescription drugs. That is important to \nunderstand. As people grow older, they have more health challenges. \nThey are able to access these miracle drugs, the new miracle drugs that \nextend life in so many areas, but miracle drugs produce no miracles if \none cannot afford them.\n  At an age in life when people reach retirement and have diminished \nincome, they discover that they cannot afford to buy the miracle drugs \nthey need, the drugs their doctor prescribes, for someone who may have \nheart disease, diabetes, and several other maladies. We hear senior \ncitizens say over and over again that they go to the grocery store with \na pharmacy in the back, and they have to go to the pharmacy first to \nfind out how much they are going to have left for food because they \ncannot afford all of their medicine and food.\n  If we had created Medicare last year, there is no question that we \nwould have included in that Medicare Program a prescription drug \nbenefit. Instead, Congress created it in the 1960s. Most of us were not \nhere then. So there was no prescription drug benefit put in the \nMedicare Program because most of the lifesaving drugs that are now \navailable were not then in existence. They are now, and senior citizens \nare living longer and better lives. Part of it is because we have these \nprescription drugs that can extend life.\n  So the question is, How do we now modify the Medicare Program to add \na benefit for prescription drugs, to help so many senior citizens who \nsimply cannot afford them?\n  I had a hearing in Dickinson, ND, one evening on the issue of \nprescription drugs in Medicare. An oncologist told me about his cancer \npatient, a woman on Medicare who had a mastectomy because of breast \ncancer. He prescribed a prescription drug for her. He said: You need to \ntake this prescription drug in order to reduce the chances of \nrecurrence of this breast cancer. She said: What will it cost? He told \nher the cost of the drugs. She said: Doctor, I cannot possibly buy that \nprescription drug. I have no money. I will just take my chances.\n  We do not have to do that. Our amendment is very simple. The \nunderlying budget proposed $400 billion for a Medicare prescription \ndrug plan. We propose that the portion of the tax cut in this budget \namendment dealing with the tax cut for dividends be used instead of \ncutting taxes for dividends in the following manner: That $219 billion \nbe provided in this amendment in order to increase above the $400 \nbillion, so we would have then $619 billion for a prescription drug \nplan in the Medicare Program. The additional $251 billion in savings \ngenerated by this amendment would be used to reduce the Federal budget \ndeficit.\n\n  We are doing two things: Making more money available so a decent \nprescription drug plan can be offered, and my colleague from Florida \nwill more adequately describe exactly what kind of a program can be \noffered for that, and then in addition, reducing the Federal budget \ndeficit.\n  I will make a couple of additional points. Our amendment also \nestablishes a very important principle for a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit. Medicare beneficiaries who choose to remain in traditional \nfee-for-service Medicare should receive the same level of benefit for \nprescription drugs as do others. The President has proposed something \nthat says we will provide a prescription drug benefit but we will do it \nonly if someone leaves their fee-for-service type of care and goes to \nan HMO. That is not fair. That is not the right thing to do. Senior \ncitizens ought to be able to go to the doctor of their choice and get \nthe health care they need from the doctor they have always been seeing \nfor their problems. Yet that will not be the case under the President's \nproposal.\n  So we say let's increase the amount of money so we can have a \nreasonable and a good prescription drug benefit in the Medicare \nProgram. Let's do that at the same time we reduce the Federal budget \ndeficit with the other money that we save from this tax change, and \nlet's also establish the principle, as we do in this amendment, that \nall Medicare beneficiaries ought to have the availability of this \nprescription drug benefit, even if they choose to stay in a fee-for-\nservice program. That is a very important issue.\n  Let me make one final point. As is always the case when we debate the \nbudget in the Senate, we are confronted with a series of choices, \ndifficult choices sometimes but nonetheless choices. We can make a \ndecision about that. We can decide that it is far more important, as \nsome have done in the Senate, to exempt dividends from taxation than it \nis to have a good prescription drug benefit in the Medicare\n\n[[Page S3975]]\n\nProgram. I do not happen to share that choice. I think that is a \nterrible choice. That is a horrible choice to make in terms of \npriorities. So with this amendment we make a different choice. We \nbelieve that this is one of those circumstances that demands and \ncertainly deserves the attention of the Senate. I think every Senator \nis on record as saying we ought to do something about this issue of \nprescription drugs in Medicare, but we have had difficulty trying to \nfind the right approach.\n  We have all kinds of different plans. What we propose with this \namendment is to have sufficient money, $619 billion, to put together a \nplan of which we can be proud, to put together a plan that works, one \nthat really helps senior citizens and one that does not force them all \ninto managed care or HMO organizations as a price for them to be able \nto access prescription drugs that they need to continue to lead a good \nlife. That is all this amendment is about. It is a simple choice. It is \na lot of money, but it is a simple choice. Let's choose the right \nthing. Let's choose to do what all of us have said we want to do, and \nthat is to put a good prescription drug plan in the Medicare Program.\n  My colleague, Senator Graham from Florida, is going to describe in \nmore detail exactly what that program could look like and how that \nprogram would work for senior citizens. I am very pleased to have \nworked with him, as well as the Senator from Michigan, on this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I offer this amendment with my \ncolleagues from North Dakota and Michigan so that when we come to \ndebate the specifics of a prescription drug benefit for Medicare, we \nwill be able to provide a real benefit, a real benefit with no \ngimmicks, no gaps, no hidden ``gotchas.''\n\n  Last year, 52 Senators voted for a plan that provides all Medicare \nbeneficiaries with an affordable, comprehensive, and universal drug \nbenefit delivered through Medicare. The proposal offered last year \nreceived 52 votes and was very direct. It provided that seniors would \npay a $25 per month voluntary premium. This program is not mandatory; \nseniors will decide for themselves whether they want to participate. \nThere would be no deductible. Seniors would pay no more than a $10 \ncopayment for generic medications and $40 for medically necessary \nbrand-name medications. After $4,000 was paid by the senior out of \npocket, Medicare would pay the remaining expenses under a catastrophic \nposition. Special consideration was provided for the lowest income non-\nMedicaid elderly by picking up all, or a portion of, their monthly \npremiums and copayments.\n  The plan we offered last year that received 52 votes, with the \ninflation and with the change in the demographics of the elderly \npopulation, would cost, over the next 10 years, $619 billion. The \nbudget resolution which is before the Senate today would limit the \nexpenditure for a prescription drug benefit to no more than $400 \nbillion. Removed from the $400 billion would be the cost of any other \nchanges to the Medicare system.\n  Our colleagues on the Budget Committee have adopted the $400 billion \nfrom the President's framework for adding a prescription drug benefit \nto Medicare. It is unclear precisely what we would be buying with $400 \nbillion, but let's talk about what we know of some of the principles of \nthe President's prescription drug plan.\n  He would provide, for those Medicare beneficiaries in the traditional \nfee-for-service program, that there would be coverage of prescription \ndrugs for the lowest income--the question mark as to what that \ndemarcation would be. They would receive up to $600 a year for their \nprescription drug benefits. I point out to the Presiding Officer and my \ncolleagues, the average Medicare beneficiary last year paid $2,100 for \ntheir prescription drugs.\n  Other than the lowest income, there would be no ongoing benefit and \nthere would be a catastrophic benefit at a yet to be specified level. \nThat is what 89 percent of the Medicare beneficiaries--those who have \nelected to stay in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare--would have \navailable.\n  Mr. President, 11 percent of the 40 million Medicare beneficiaries \nare in some form of managed care. Under the President's plan, they \nwould receive a prescription drug benefit, maybe one very similar to \nthe one that 52 Senators voted for last year. We do not have the \ndetails to have a clear understanding of what that 11 percent would \nreceive.\n  The only way you can fit an affordable, comprehensive, universal \nprescription drug benefit is by not making it universal, not covering \nseniors who are in the traditional Medicare Program unless they either \nhave very low incomes or very high drug costs. For instance, if the \ncatastrophic level were to be set at $5,000, less than 3 percent of the \nMedicare beneficiaries would spend that much and therefore be eligible \nto participate in the catastrophic provisions of the President's plan.\n  The President's proposal buys a drug benefit for $400 billion by \nproviding a benefit--even that is undefined--only for those seniors who \nwill enroll in some form of managed care. This has been referred to as \na plan to herd seniors into managed care because their needs for a \nprescription drug benefit are so desperate. No one can argue a benefit \nlike the one proposed by President Bush meets the goals of an \naffordable, universal, comprehensive drug benefit which is what \nAmerica's seniors need.\n\n  The most fundamental reform we can make in the Medicare Program is to \noffer to all Medicare beneficiaries, including the 89 percent who have \nelected to enroll in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare, all \nbeneficiaries--those as well as the 11 percent who have currently \nelected to participate in a managed care program--a universal, \ncomprehensive, affordable prescription drug benefit. Why is this so \nimportant? In my opinion, it is so important because it is the \nfundamental reform which Medicare must make.\n  Medicare is a program of the 1960s. It is appropriately described as \na sickness program. If you are ill enough to require a physician's \nattention or, even more, require hospitalization, Medicare will pay a \nsubstantial proportion of your costs. What Medicare will not pay is the \ncost to keep you out of the doctor's office and out of the hospital. \nWhy? Because almost every preventive care program has as one of its key \nelements the use of prescription drugs. These are the modern miracles \nof medicine. They are almost always required if we are to be able to \nmanage a condition before it becomes critical.\n  Thus, to have a Medicare Program which makes that fundamental reform \nfrom a sickness system to a system that promotes the highest level of \nhealth, it must have a prescription drug benefit. Certainly some \nseniors under the President's proposal will have no choice but to move \nfrom their current preference for traditional fee-for-service, where \nthey have the maximum number of choices, into a managed care system, \nwhere their choices can be severely restricted.\n  As my colleague from North Dakota has already said, this debate is \nabout priorities. Is the statement the Senate wants to make that we \ngive greater importance to an oversized tax cut than we do to a real, \naffordable, comprehensive, and universal drug benefit for all seniors? \nI think the answer is clear.\n  In addition to providing adequate funding for a prescription drug \nbenefit, this amendment will also provide $177 billion over the next 10 \nyears for deficit reduction, which would, in fact, become $251 billion \nfor deficit reduction by including the interest cost which we will have \nto pay for $177 billion over the next 10 years. This is a needed remedy \nfor the rapidly increasing deficits that we have experienced, almost as \nurgent as the needed benefit of prescription drugs for older Americans.\n  We are suggesting these two elements, a $219 billion addition to the \nMedicare account in order to be able to fund an affordable, \ncomprehensive, and universal prescription drug benefit, and $177 \nbillion for deficit reductions--we are suggesting it be paid by a \nreduction in the provision for tax reductions of $396 billion. That \nnumber was not just chosen by accident. That is the amount\n\n[[Page S3976]]\n\nthe President has proposed for his dividend tax cut, making dividends \nno longer taxable.\n  I believe the dividend tax cut should be reduced, first because it \nwill do very little to stimulate our sluggish economy, and specifically \nbecause it will do very little to benefit America's seniors. I heard \nearlier today the argument made in support of the elimination of \ntaxation of dividends, that it was a critical matter for America's \nseniors. Most American seniors will not benefit at all, and the average \ntax reduction for America's seniors, by eliminating the taxation on \ndividends, is estimated to be $118 per year.\n  Contrast that minimal savings for seniors with the savings that \nseniors will secure through a comprehensive, universal, and affordable \nprescription drug benefit.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. This amendment will \nnot only affect our seniors and our ability to provide them with a \nreasonable prescription drug benefit, it will also provide Congress the \ndirection required to assure responsible spending of the taxpayers' \nmoney. This is a goal, not just for seniors, it is a goal which all \nAmericans deserve.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Conrad, I yield one-\nhalf hour to the Senator from Michigan, Ms. Stabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I first commend my friend and colleague \nfrom Florida for his ongoing leadership on the issue of Medicare \nprescription drug coverage. I am very hopeful we will be able to put \ninto place the bill he has described so eloquently that would greatly \nbenefit all older Americans and the disabled. It is my pleasure to join \nwith him and with my distinguished colleague from North Dakota, Mr. \nDorgan, as well, who has also been an outspoken leader both on Medicare \nprescription drugs and also on issues relating to containing costs, \nopening the borders to Canada, and other issues that would lower \nprices.\n  It is my pleasure to join with both of them in what I believe to be \none of the most important, if not the most important, amendment we will \nbe addressing to the budget resolution.\n  As my colleagues have said, the budget resolution is about American \npriorities and values. We lay out for the year and then project for 10 \nyears what our most important priorities are, just as a family does in \ntheir own budget. We on this side of the aisle have argued that, of \ncourse, safety and security is critical. Education and the opportunity \nfor young people and adults to have skills and be able to be successful \nin our society is critically important. Also, health care, the ability \nto have health care for your family, and the ability for every senior \nand every disabled person to know that, in fact, Medicare will be \nstrong and will be there for them when they retire when they are \neligible, and that it will reflect the way health care is provided \ntoday is also important.\n  We all know today prescription drug coverage is the primary way to \nprovide health care, both for prevention, to be able to stop disease, \nand be able to monitor and keep us from having to have an operation or \nbe in the hospital. Outpatient prescription drugs are a critical part \nof the way health care is provided today.\n  Medicare, which is a great American success story, simply needs to be \nupdated in order to cover prescription drugs. That is what this \namendment does. It says that as a value for our families and a priority \nfor Americans, we choose to set aside dollars for a comprehensive, \naffordable prescription drug benefit for all seniors. We want to do \nthat through Medicare, through strengthening, protecting, and \npreserving Medicare. It also says when we have to make choices, if we \nhave to choose--as we always have to do in our own budget, in the \nFederal budget--between another tax cut for those earning millions of \ndollars a year, or putting dollars in the pockets of our seniors to \nhelp pay for their prescription drugs, their medicine, we choose \nprescription drug coverage for our seniors. We also choose paying down \nthe debt to protect Social Security and Medicare for the future.\n  This amendment does two very important things: It guarantees that we \nwill have enough resources to do a comprehensive Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit. It also says the debt that is being accumulated by this \ncountry is absolutely unacceptable, and we need to be putting money \naside to pay down that debt in order to make sure we can keep interest \nrates low to spur the economy so our families can buy homes and cars \nand send their children to college and not experience double-digit \ninterest rates. We need to keep that debt down. That also allows us to \nprotect Social Security and Medicare funds for the future for the trust \nfunds. That priority, and a prescription drug coverage priority, is \nabsolutely essential.\n  We also say something else that is very important. We need to make \nsure that traditional Medicare that has been there is there regardless \nof where you live. My great State is a huge State geographically, 9 \nmillion people plus. We need to make sure the seniors in Detroit or \nMarquette or Ironwood or Three Rivers or Benton Harbor or my home in \nLansing all have the same ability and the same dependability in terms \nof Medicare prescription drugs. They will know the premiums are the \nsame, their cost, their ability to choose their own doctor, their \nability to choose their own medicines, to go to their own local \npharmacy--that should be available regardless of where you live.\n  One of my great concerns is we have seen, unfortunately, more and \nmore talk about reforming Medicare, which I believe is a code word for \nprivatizing Medicare. All we are seeing leads us to believe that the \nadministration wants to privatize Medicare and require seniors, if they \nare going to get real health care coverage that includes prescription \ndrugs, to go into private insurance systems; to go into an HMO or \nanother kind of system.\n  The administration has indicated, if they stay in traditional \nMedicare where the overwhelming majority of seniors are, they are \nwilling to offer a discount card that the GAO tells us would be about \n$3.31 savings on a prescription. That is not very much if you are \nsomeone who is paying $100 or $150 or $200 for a simple 30-day \nprescription.\n\n  Then they have said: If you accumulate thousands of dollars--we don't \nknow exactly what the number would be, but have catastrophic needs--you \nwould be able to get some kind of help. We don't know at what point \nthey would designate that, but if you want to get real help with \nprescription drugs, if you want to be covered for prescription drugs, \nthen you would have to go to the private sector to be covered.\n  That is absolutely unacceptable. Seniors of this country have already \nchosen between Medicare and going into the private sector. We have that \nnow. We have traditional Medicare and we have something called \nMedicare+Choice that is a private sector HMO approach. It is your \nchoice as a senior.\n  In fact, my mother chose to go into an HMO herself in Michigan, and \nhad a good experience, but the Medicare beneficiaries were dropped from \nthat HMO because they decided not to cover them anymore. And that has \nhappened to over 41,000 people just in Michigan.\n  What we have seen is that when seniors are being given a choice \nbetween traditional Medicare and the HMO system, they have already \nchosen: They have chosen Medicare, traditional Medicare. But for the \nsmall percent who chose to go into the private sector, they found it \nwas not dependable. For my own mother, who chose to do that, she found \nshe could not count on it. It was not ultimately available to her. And \nnow, in Michigan, only 2 percent of people who are on Medicare can even \nqualify, can even find a private insurer that will cover them, and they \nall are in the eastern part of our State. So if you live in Lansing or \nFlint or Saginaw or Grand Rapids or on up in Traverse City or on up in \nthe upper peninsula, you don't even have that choice because there is \nnothing available.\n  So what we have said in this amendment is that seniors need to know \nthe prescription drug benefit that everybody is talking about should \nnot just be available if you choose a private insurance policy, private \ninsurance model through Medicare; you should have the right to have a \nchoice of traditional Medicare and have the very same prescription drug \ncoverage.\n  That is what this amendment says. If we want to offer seniors choice, \nthen\n\n[[Page S3977]]\n\nwe need to make sure we offer them a real choice: the choice of \nMedicare as they know it, Medicare as they have been able to depend \nupon, as well as the other private sector models that have been \nproposed by the President and our colleagues.\n  This amendment, I believe, is exactly what the seniors of America are \nasking us to do: simply update Medicare, strengthen the system they \ncount on, and make sure they have affordable prescription drug \ncoverage. I strongly support this amendment. I am proud to be \ncosponsoring this amendment with my colleagues. The dual goal of having \nMedicare prescription drug coverage and a major payment on the debt is \nvery important.\n  When we look at who the beneficiaries of Medicare are--our seniors--\nthe majority of them are women. So I speak as one of the women of the \nSenate to say that the women of this country are counting on Medicare \nas well as Social Security. This is very real for the older women of \nour country. They are counting on us to fulfill the real promise of \nMedicare.\n  Mr. President, our seniors, as well as everyone who is involved with \nprescription drugs, are counting on us to do one other thing. I wish to \nspeak to that for a moment. It relates to another amendment I will be \noffering later on in this debate that needs to be coupled with this \namendment, and that is the question of lowering the price of \nprescription drugs.\n\n  We need to update Medicare to cover prescriptions. But at the same \ntime, we need to lower the price through more competition, so that we \ncan afford that coverage and be able to make it available to as many \npeople as possible.\n  Along with my colleagues, Senator Dorgan and Senator Schumer, I am \ngoing to be offering an amendment the purpose of which is to reduce \nprescription drug prices for everyone, with the passage of legislation \nsimilar to S. 812, which passed overwhelmingly by the Senate last \nsummer, a bill that contained provisions relating to generic drug \nreform, reimportation of prescription drugs from Canada--in other \nwords, opening the border to Canada for our citizens--and State \nauthority with respect to Medicaid drug rebate agreements. What that \nmeans is supporting our States that are being creative in finding ways \nto use their authority to lower the prices of prescription drugs for \ntheir citizens.\n  This amendment would take the approximately $7.4 billion minimal of \nsavings through the generic drug reform we passed last summer coupled \nwith any savings--and as yet they have not been able to calculate the \nsavings--that we know would be there from opening the border to Canada, \nand dropping prices in half. But we would take those dollars and put it \ninto a fund that is already in the budget resolution--a $50 billion \nfund for the uninsured--and we would add those budget savings to that \nfund for programs that help individuals and small businesses obtain \nhealth insurance.\n  We know the majority of those without insurance--in fact, we are told \nthat 75 percent of the people who do not have health insurance are \nworking, and they are working for small businesses. So this issue of \nlowering prices is very important for all businesses, but I would say \nparticularly small businesses, that have seen their premiums--at least \nin Michigan, we know, according to Michigan Blue Cross and Blue Shield, \nthat premiums for small businesses have doubled, at least, in the last \n5 years. And we know, when we look behind those prices, as well as the \nprices for the Big Three automakers, and for other major employers, \nthat the major reason the price of health care is going up is because \nof the explosion in the price of prescription drugs. The average retail \nprescription drug increase for brand names is three times the rate of \ninflation--three times the rate of inflation. So we have seen an \nexplosion.\n  By the way, this relates back to Medicare coverage because a majority \nof those who are uninsured who are paying those prices are our senior \ncitizens. In fact, the people who pay the highest prices in the world \ntoday are Americans, predominantly our seniors, who do not have \ninsurance and walk into the local pharmacy and need to buy their \nmedicine. So there is an important partnership here of both Medicare \nprescription drug coverage and lowering prices for everyone.\n  Last year, on a bipartisan vote, I was very proud of this body, my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, who joined together to, first of \nall, tighten up the rules and eliminate loopholes in relation to \nunadvertised brands, what we call generic drugs, that are supposed to \nbe available when a patent runs out on a brand name. The formulas are \nsupposed to be available so they can be manufactured at a much cheaper \nprice, oftentimes 50 percent, sometimes as much as 70 percent less. We \nknow by having more use of unadvertised brands, and they being more \navailable on the market, we can drop insurance rates, we can drop \nprescription drug prices for our seniors and for everyone.\n  We also know if we simply open the border to Canada--I find this \nwhole issue so amazing because we trade with Canada on everything \nexcept prescription drugs. In fact, in my great State of Michigan, \nright now we are seeing truckloads of trash coming in from Canada that \nwe are told we cannot stop from going into Michigan landfills because \nwe have open trade laws. So we can't stop the trash, but we can't bring \nin prescription drugs that would help our seniors and help our families \nbe able to lower their costs, by bringing in American-made, American-\nsubsidized prescriptions, that are sold in Canada at reduced prices.\n  That was the second part of what we did last summer, to pass a bill \nthat opened the border. And we know that by doing that, licensed \npharmacists could develop business relationships. Whether it is a \npharmacist at the hospital, a pharmacist at the local pharmacy, a \npharmacist working with health clinics or at a university, they could \nbring these back and make prescription drugs available. We ought to be \ndoing that. It is very perplexing and frustrating that that is not \nhappening.\n  In fact, to add insult to injury, the FDA has just informed us in the \nlast week based on pressure from the pharmaceutical industry that not \nonly are they not going to open the border, but they are going to begin \nenforcing the law against those who help our seniors. Whether it is an \ninsurance company paying for reimbursement, whether it is others \nhelping our seniors to go across the border to get their prescriptions \nat a lower price, working through a Canadian doctor and pharmacy, the \nFDA now says they will clamp down on that rather than working with us \nto open the borders in a safe way. This is the second part of how we \nlower prices.\n  The third way we lower prices is by supporting States that have been \nworking to use their group purchasing power to negotiate with the \npharmaceutical companies that do business with them on Medicaid, to \nnegotiate with them to provide rebates and discounts for the uninsured \nin their State. A number of States have done that, and they have all \nbeen challenged, unfortunately, by the pharmaceutical industry. We want \nto make it clear that States have the ability on behalf of their \ncitizens to advocate and to negotiate lower prices. That is the second \namendment we will be offering.\n  Again, we will be offering an amendment that says we will reduce \nprescription drug prices. We will save dollars for the Federal \nGovernment, and then those dollars will be redirected into a fund and \nput aside to support small businesses to provide health care coverage \nfor their employees.\n  The budget resolution is about priorities. We all know that. It is \nabout values. It is about who we are as Americans. When I talk with \npeople in Michigan, there is not a higher priority now than health \ncare: Families struggling with the cost of medicine; seniors not having \naccess to prescription drug coverage; businesses trying to figure out \nhow to pay the bill; employees being told their pay will be frozen so \ntheir employer can pay the health care costs; those who are losing \ntheir jobs finding themselves in a situation where they are losing \ntheir health care. We even know that our reservists and members of the \nNational Guard currently serving us in the gulf may find themselves not \nhaving health insurance for themselves and their families.\n  This is an issue that touches each and every one of us. Every year we \ntalk about it. Every session we talk about it. It is complicated. It \ninvolves setting priorities on funding. Too much of the time, we set it \naside to go on to something else. I hope we will not do that\n\n[[Page S3978]]\n\nthis time, that we will make it clear, through this budget, that \nMedicare prescription drug coverage, that health care for small \nbusinesses and their employees, that lowering the prices of \nprescription drugs will be a top American priority. We can say, we will \nwait until next year, we will wait until the next budget resolution, \nbut we can't say, we will wait until next year to get sick, to get \ncancer, or that a family will wait until next year until grandma or \ngrandpa need a nursing home or their children get sick.\n  Health care for American families is an urgent matter. It is an \nurgent matter for everyone. It needs to be an urgent matter for all of \nus here in the Senate.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment on Medicare \nprescription drug coverage, and I urge my colleagues as well to join \nwith us in the amendment to reduce the price of prescription drugs and \nsupport our small businesses that are struggling to provide health care \nfor their employees.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, acting as the leader, I yield myself 7 \nminutes, with the understanding that following me, the Senator from \nIowa will be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have listened to the debate and wanted \nto make a few observations. I understand the Senator from Iowa is \nprepared to perhaps be a little more erudite than I. But I have heard \npersonal references, and I must come share a few personal references, \nnot specifically on this amendment but on the subject of Medicare.\n  The statement has been made that Medicare is a great success story. \nMedicare is a disaster. Everybody who deals with it understands that \nexcept the Congress. We have to understand that Medicare, in order to \nwork properly, is going to have to be overhauled from top to bottom as \nquickly as possible. Taking the assumption that the present Medicare \nsystem is working well and all we need to do is add a little here and \nadd a little there will further compound the disaster.\n  Let me give two examples that I hope will help illustrate this. The \nfirst is a town meeting where a woman came to me and said: Can you do \nsomething to fix Medicare?\n  I said: Well, tell me what the problem is.\n  She said: I am a professional woman. I am a college graduate. I think \nI am fairly intelligent. I handle my mother's affairs. My mother is in \nher eighties. She is on Medicare. I have finally figured out how to \ndeal with Medicare. I throw away everything unopened, and at the end of \nthe month I call the Salt Lake clinic and say: How much do I owe you \nfor my mother? Trying to wade through the paperwork is so daunting, I \ncan't even begin to understand anything they send to me. The assumption \nthat my 85-year-old mother would be able to handle any of it is absurd. \nI tried. I struggled. I got the manuals. Finally, I discovered the way \nto deal with Medicare is to throw away everything unopened and once a \nmonth call the Salt Lake clinic and say: How much do I owe you for my \nmother?\n  This is a family and a circumstance where money is not a problem. \nSimply coping with the paperwork is overwhelming.\n  Second example: I have a daughter of whom I am enormously proud. She \ngraduated with her master's degree from George Washington University \nafter her bachelor's at Boston University. She got a job in a nursing \nhome. She is a speech therapist. She is also a very enthusiastic young \nlady. She called me after about 4 days on the job.\n  Dad, she said--exploding over the telephone--you are a Senator. You \nhave to fix Medicare.\n  I said: Now calm down. Tell me what your problem is.\n  She said: Medicare is a disaster. Medicare is terrible. Let me tell \nyou my experiences.\n  And she began describing some of the problems she had in giving \nproper care to the people in this nursing home and always being told, \nno, you can't do that until you check to see whether or not Medicare \nwill cover it.\n  She said: I thought that would be a fairly simple thing to find out. \nSo I go down the hall and say: Will Medicare cover this procedure? It \ntakes days to get an answer to that question.\n  Then she said: Dad, do you know who the highest paid person in this \nfacility is--with a salary higher than the administrator, higher salary \nthan the doctors, higher salary than the nurses, higher salary than any \nof the health professionals? It is the woman who understands \nMedicare. She gets paid more than anybody here because that skill is in \ngreater demand and shorter supply than professional medical skills.\n\n  She called me back sometime later and said:\n\n       I have had patients die while we waited to get an answer as \n     to whether or not Medicare would cover it. Their family said, \n     ``Don't touch my grandmother; don't do anything until we find \n     out whether Medicare would cover it.''\n\n  It was so arcane and difficult to work through all of the paperwork \nand come up with the answer--well, maybe they would have died anyway; \nthey were old and in a nursing home. People die in nursing homes. But \nthis was a very traumatic experience for my daughter, who was convinced \nthat the kind of therapy she was trained to provide, she was prepared \nto provide, which could have extended the life of that particular \npatient.\n  So as we get carried away with the rhetoric around here about what we \nhave to protect and not protect about Medicare, let us begin to \nunderstand the truth about Medicare. Medicare is the best Blue Cross/\nBlue Shield fee-for-service indemnity plan of the 1960s--frozen in \ntime. We don't practice medicine the way medicine was practiced in the \n1960s when Medicare was created. We don't even come close anymore.\n  Yes, we need a prescription drug benefit because prescription drugs \ndo things now that they had nothing to do with in the 1960s. But \ninstead of pasting it on to the existing circumstance and creating a \nnew set of forms and eligibilities and more demand for that highest \npaid person in the nursing home, let us as a Congress face the fact \nthat we need to start from a clean sheet of paper, all over again, with \nall of the money we are putting into it--which is sizable--and say \nlet's create a whole new system. This budget doesn't do that, but this \namendment that is being offered will make things worse in that regard.\n  I only hope that somewhere along the line we can begin to face the \nfact that Medicare is 40 years old, whereas the practice of medicine is \nchanging so constantly that we could say it is only 40 months old. \nLet's start with a clean sheet of paper. Let's not try this Band-Aid \napproach. Let's not just put this here, and put that there, and tell \nour constituents we are giving them something when, in fact, we are \nperpetuating an existing problem and ultimately making it worse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume. For the benefit of the people who are waiting to speak, I \ndon't think I will take long on this subject.\n  I rise because I want to urge my colleagues to vote against the \nDorgan amendment when the vote comes up tomorrow. I don't see anything \nwrong with the issue of Medicare being discussed because it is one of \ntwo or three of the most important issues this Congress will deal with. \nSo it is very appropriate to have Medicare very much at the top of the \nagenda. It is very appropriate to have prescription drugs for seniors, \nas a part of strengthening and improving Medicare, be very high on the \nagenda. And it is very high on the agenda.\n  It is just a question, as it relates to the Dorgan amendment, of \nwhether or not crafting a Medicare prescription drug program ought to \nbe an issue on the budget, or whether you ought to let the will of \nCongress work and do that through the Senate Finance Committee.\n  We know Medicare is going to be a very important issue this year, not \nonly because it has been very much an issue in the last election, but \nbecause the Senate majority leader has a long-time interest in Medicare \nand prescription drugs. He told me, as Chairman of\n\n[[Page S3979]]\n\nthe Senate Finance Committee, that he would like to have the Senate \nFinance Committee put it very high on its agenda and have legislation \nprepared early for this summer's debate.\n  The Senate Finance Committee is going to meet that deadline. I hope \nSenator Frist will be able to keep his own calendar and bring it up at \nthat particular time. What we are talking about on this issue is \nwhether or not the $400 billion for prescription drugs in the budget \nresolution is enough and whether or not an extension beyond that $400 \nbillion is needed at this particular time.\n  I am here to say it is not needed at this particular time for two \nreasons. One, I think I can show that $400 billion is an ample amount \nof money to present to the Senate a good prescription drug program; and \ntwo, taking money away from tax relief for working men and women, which \nthis amendment does, to spend on Medicare is the wrong thing to do for \nthe long-term benefit of Medicare. Because as the trustees of the \nMedicare and Social Security Program pointed out in their annual \nreport, you see Medicare in a little worse situation this year than \nlast year because there is less payroll tax coming in because the \neconomy is not doing quite as well as it should be. If we want to \npreserve the long-term viability of the Medicare trust fund, obviously, \nthe best thing we can do is create jobs. That is what the growth \npackage, the jobs package, that we are going to be working on this \nspring--tax reduction for working men and women--is all about--the \ncreation of jobs, to have the economy grow, so more payroll taxes will \nbe coming into the Medicare fund.\n  Let me explain to my colleagues why we should vote this amendment \ndown. I start with the premise that it is long past time for Congress \nto strengthen and improve the Medicare Program, and the No. 1 way in \nwhich we can improve and strengthen Medicare is the enactment of a \nprescription drug benefit for our Nation's seniors.\n  We all know that adding prescription drug coverage to the Medicare \nProgram is an expensive endeavor. Given the rapidly rising costs of \nMedicare and the present challenge we have just to meet our current \nobligations in the program, adding prescription drug coverage must be \ndone carefully and responsibly. You don't do it by just pulling a \nfigure out of the air, reducing the tax relief package, and putting it \nover here in the Medicare trust fund.\n  As I have said, the Medicare trustees reported last year that the \nprogram already faces substantial challenges in the not-too-distant \nfuture. The Medicare trust fund will begin to run cash deficits in 2013 \nthat grow larger and larger until the fund is bankrupt in the year \n2026.\n  While we are working on adding a drug benefit to Medicare, \nprescription drug spending has grown an average of almost 15 percent \nannually from 1995 to the year 2000. And the Congressional Budget \nOffice predicts that Medicare beneficiaries will spend about $1.8 \ntrillion on prescription drugs over the 10-year budget window.\n  Now, is the $400 billion in the budget resolution before us enough to \nspend on improving Medicare and adding a prescription drug benefit? \nWell, first of all, we have to recognize that Congress has come a long \nway in how much it has allocated to a Medicare drug benefit. For \nexample, in fiscal year 2001, the budget resolution had $40 billion \nover 5 years for a drug benefit. This budget, as I have said, proposes \n$400 billion over 10 years and is yet $100 billion more than we had in \nthe last budget resolution, which was for fiscal year 2002, and had \n$300 billion for prescription drugs over the 10 years.\n  I say to people on the other side of the aisle that we had a lot of \nsupport in arguing for a $300 billion budget figure for prescription \ndrugs in that fiscal year 2002 budget. Many of my friends on the other \nside of the aisle spoke in favor of that proposal on the Senate floor. \nThese Senators believed then that $300 billion would provide a good \ndrug benefit for seniors and be affordable for taxpayers. Now we are \nproposing $400 billion for Medicare and for a drug benefit. This amount \nis certainly adequate for developing a good Medicare drug benefit for \nour Nation's seniors.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the $400 billion in funding for \nMedicare and vote against amendments such as the Dorgan amendment to \ndramatically increase the cost of that drug benefit.\n  I ask those very same Senators on the other side of the aisle who may \nwant to support their colleague that if they thought 2 years ago $300 \nbillion was a good figure and they helped us get that passed, then they \nwould think that $400 billion is adequate as we start down this road, a \nroad that is going to lead us to the successful passage of a drug \nbenefit program for seniors.\n  As for a comparable prescription drug benefit, one of the directions \nthat the Dorgan amendment would give the Committee on Finance--a \nrequirement that traditional Medicare and whatever enhancement of \nMedicare we develop for seniors which would give them the right to \nchoose between more than one benefit plan would have comparable \nprescription drug benefits--I want my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle to know I will work with other members of the Finance \nCommittee to make sure Medicare beneficiaries in traditional Medicare \nhave a good prescription drug benefit, as well as those who may choose \nto go to a new, enhanced plan.\n  This amendment wants to tie the hands of the members of the Senate \nFinance Committee. The budget bill is not the place to craft a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. That is the jurisdiction of the Senate \nFinance Committee. The committee will have its opportunity to function \nunder my chairmanship, at the direction of Senator Frist, our majority \nleader, who said he did not want to make the mistake of last year when \nthen-majority leader Senator Daschle brought the issue right to the \nfloor, bypassing the committee.\n  We can in this body develop bipartisanship not on the floor of the \nSenate but in the committees of the Senate. That is no more true than \nin the Senate Finance Committee which has such a reputation for \nbipartisanship.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment and let the Finance \nCommittee do its work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Who yields to the Senator?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much how much time is the Senator \nseeking?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. There will be, I say to the Senator from North \nDakota, three Senators speaking on behalf of the amendment. Forty-five \nminutes would be an outside number.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time would the Senator from West Virginia like?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Eight, nine minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask, through the Chair, the Senator from \nMaine, it is my understanding she has permission from the manager of \nthe bill to have the pending amendment set aside to offer this \namendment.\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I should think that is what should be done now. Does the \nDemocratic manager agree with that?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That will be the appropriate action to take at this \npoint, if the Senator from Maine will make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia, on behalf \nof the Senator from Maine, the Senator from Oregon, the Senator from \nNebraska, and several cosponsors, is sending an amendment to the desk \nto ask for its consideration. I ask that the pending amendment be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 275\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 275 which is \nalready at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller], for \n     himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Smith, Mr. \n     Schumer, Mr. Edwards, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \n     Bingaman, Mr. Corzine, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n     Sarbanes, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. \n     Coleman, proposes an amendment numbered 275.\n\n\n[[Page S3980]]\n\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate concerning \n     State fiscal relief)\n         At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING STATE FISCAL RELIEF.\n\n         (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n         (1) States are experiencing the most severe fiscal crisis \n     since World War II.\n         (2) States are instituting severe cuts to a variety of \n     vital programs such as health care, child care, education, \n     and other essential services.\n         (3) According to the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and \n     the Uninsured, 49 States already have taken actions or plan \n     to cut medicaid before or during the current fiscal year \n     2003. Medicaid budget proposals in many States would \n     eliminate or curtail health benefits for eligible families \n     and substantially reduce or freeze provider reimbursement \n     rates.\n         (4) In 2002, at least 13 States reported decreased State \n     investments in their child care assistance programs.\n         (5) According to a forthcoming analysis of 22 States, at \n     least 1,700,000 people are now at risk of losing their health \n     care coverage under cuts that have already been implemented \n     or proposed.\n         (6) Fiscal relief would help avoid adding even more \n     Americans to the ranks of the uninsured while preserving the \n     safety net when it is most needed during an economic \n     downturn.\n         (7) Curtailing the States' need to cut spending and \n     increase taxes is essential for true economic growth.\n         (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals in this resolution assume that any \n     legislation enacted to provide economic growth for the United \n     States should include not less than $30,000,000,000 for State \n     fiscal relief over the next 18 months (of which at least half \n     should be provided through a temporary increase in the \n     Federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP)).\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Senators be added as cosponsors. Cosponsors already are \nmyself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Smith, Mr. Schumer, \nMr. Edwards, and Mrs. Clinton. I ask unanimous consent to add Mrs. \nHutchison, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Corzine, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \nKerry, Mr. Sarbanes, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. DeWine, and the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer, Mr. Coleman, as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I will not talk long, although this \nis an extraordinarily important subject particularly affecting the \nstimulus package and affecting a lot of people in all of our States.\n  The sense-of-the-Senate amendment which we put before the Senate \nnow--and it is that, a sense of the Senate--we did the same thing this \npast July in the form of an amendment, and it received some 75 votes. \nIt was very bipartisan. But this is a sense of the Senate. It is not an \namendment per se.\n  What we are wanting to do is to add no less than $30 billion over the \nnext 12 months for the State stimulus relief package that should be \nincluded in any stimulus package. In fact, I would argue it makes no \nsense to do this without including the amendment which will then find \nits way to the Finance Committee where we will work with it.\n  It is interesting, in fact, that there are many who say the primary \nproblem for our economy at this particular point is not the impending \nwar with Iraq, but is, in fact, the plight of our State governments and \nour Federal Government--the deficits and debt, in the case of the \nFederal Government, and the deficits, in the case of the States. We \nhave to address the State budget shortfalls in order for any growth \npackage to be at all meaningful. It is not as colorful and does not \nhave as much pizzazz, but it affects incredible numbers of people.\n  States obviously have to balance their budgets. Senator Nelson from \nNebraska will be speaking shortly. He was a Governor, as was I. Nearly \nevery State, if not every State, faces deficits. They are likely to \ngrow in the upcoming year. The deficits are now $70 billion to $85 \nbillion projected for 2004. This is on top of the $50 billion in \ndeficits that the States already have for 2003.\n  This constitutes a real crisis for them. They cannot print money, and \nthey cannot do what we can do in the Senate: simply go into deficit and \ngo on. They have to take action to close the deficit. Herein is the \nproblem that affects the stimulus package, States, and people.\n  They have to cut programs or they have to increase revenues--neither \nimportant--but one of the difficulties and responsibilities of being a \nGovernor is that you have to make those decisions--either raise \nrevenues, cut programs, or you do both, which is why Governors often \nare not terribly popular at the end of 8 years.\n  It is about $1 out of every $8 of expenditures in the budget that \nthese deficits represent. So it is a very large amount of money. Some \n38 States, three out of four States, either cut spending in 2002, are \nprojecting to cut spending in 2003, or do both. That is, raise revenues \nand cut spending.\n  One cannot talk about stimulating the States' economies without \ntalking about Medicaid. Medicaid and Medicare--Medicare which we have \njust been discussing--between those two programs, which are both \nlocated in the same Government agency, it is a substantially greater \namount of money than resides in the Department of Defense. People have \nto understand this, it is an enormous amount of money in Medicaid and \nMedicare.\n  Families USA, which is well respected, recently did a study on the \neconomic impact of Medicaid. I am not talking yet about people. This is \nthe economic impact of Medicaid. One of their key findings was that in \nthe year 2001, which was the last year their research could cover, \nStates spent almost $98 billion on Medicaid. But that was not the whole \npoint. The point was that the Medicaid amount that they spent generated \na threefold increase in the economic impact on the 50 States to the \ntune of $279 billion.\n  I submit that is called fiscal stimulus of a large magnitude, because \nit gets into goods and services, increased business activities, and I \ndo not think I have to go on. I am very happy to say that West Virginia \nwas among the 10 States with the highest rate of return for every \ndollar spent on Medicaid. So for the State that this Senator \nrepresents, it was very meaningful.\n  This amendment specifies that no less than one-half of the amount; \nthat is, $30 billion, allotted for State fiscal relief must be devoted \nto a temporary increase in the Federal medical assistance percentage, \nor FMAP. That is what we voted on in July of last year. That is what \npassed 75 to 24--tremendously bipartisan.\n  This is a similar structure to the legislation that Senator Collins, \nSenator Nelson of Nebraska, and I introduced recently involving $20 \nbillion. It was a temporary increase in the Federal Medicaid matching \nrate, as well as increasing funding for the Social Security block \ngrant.\n  As I indicated, the legislation is very bipartisan. It puts money \ninto Medicaid, but it also puts money into the Social Security block \ngrant, which, quite frankly, is very good because in the Finance \nCommittee we have been discussing welfare reform. We all know there is \na shortage of childcare. Governors have the discretion to take that \nmoney and spend it on local projects or on childcare or however they \nmight wish. Obviously, there are restrictions.\n  This is strongly supported by providers and by--well, I will not go \ninto that, but it is strongly supported. It did get 75 votes, and the \nNational Governors Association wants this more than anything else the \nCongress can provide, with the exception of homeland security. This \nwill then go on to the Finance Committee.\n  The stimulus that Medicaid provides to the States--aside from the \nstimulus, there are now 1,700,000 people who will lose their Medicaid \nif we do nothing about this problem, if we do not increase FMAP, the \nMedicaid match matter. There is nothing they can do about it. They will \nsimply have to cut more people. I say to my colleagues, they should \nknow that States have already cut a million people off of Medicaid.\n  Up until this point, if we do nothing they will then cut \nan additional 1.7 million people off Medicaid. When one does that, one \nunderstands that there are about 47 million people on Medicaid in this \ncountry and they are people\n\n[[Page S3981]]\n\nwho are vulnerable. It is the second largest item in most States' \nbudgets. It is always, therefore, a target for cuts. It cannot be \notherwise, and Governors have to do that.\n\n  What I need to say more than anything, and more poignantly hopefully, \nis that Medicaid is an extraordinary safety net which was set up years \nago for our most vulnerable Americans, which includes not only our low-\nincome children and working families but also our disabled and our \nelderly.\n  This strikes me as an extraordinarily reasonable amendment. Some may \nargue that the Federal Government is already spending too much on \nMedicaid and the States need to do a better job, and I would come back \nvociferously and say that the States are doing a superb job. In fact, \nthey have done as well or better than the private sector on this matter \nindeed, as Medicare only spends 2 to 3 percent for overhead costs in \nthe administration of the program, in spite of all the fraud and abuse \ncharges that are thrown at it.\n  Costs are rising in Medicaid because of prescription drugs and long-\nterm care costs. Those are the two fastest growing items in health \ncare. They both reside in Medicaid at this point. Medicaid has \nprescription drugs. Medicare does not. And so people seek it out.\n  In conclusion, this is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. No less than \n$30 billion of State fiscal relief should be included in anything which \nwe call a fiscal stimulus or an economic growth package. This is the \nmost important action we could take, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment.\n  I yield whatever time she may consume to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maine, Ms. Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from West Virginia \nfor his comments. It has been such a pleasure to work with him. He is \nan eloquent and compassionate advocate for health care for low-income \nfamilies. I am delighted to be his partner in this regard.\n  I also acknowledge the hard work of Mr. Nelson, the Senator from \nNebraska, and Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon. The four of us have \nworked very hard on this initiative for over a year. We are also \ndelighted to have the Presiding Officer's critical support in this \ninitiative.\n  States from Maine to Nebraska, from West Virginia to Oregon, are \nfacing the most serious budget shortfalls in 50 years. The bipartisan \namendment that we are offering tonight takes the first step toward \nproviding States with a measure of much needed fiscal relief.\n  Regardless of the size of the tax cut, we believe it is imperative \nthat the economic growth package include a significant amount for State \nfiscal relief. Therefore, our amendment expresses the sense of the \nSenate that at least $30 billion of the economic growth package be \ntargeted to State fiscal relief over the next 18 months to help our \nStates cope with an aggregate budget shortfall that is nearly four \ntimes that size.\n  This bipartisan amendment has been drafted in a way that is both \nbudget and deficit neutral, and I stress that for the information of my \ncolleagues. It neither increases nor decreases the amount provided for \nreconciliation in the budget resolution. Therefore, our amendment does \nnot add to the deficit. It does not change the spending caps that are \nincluded in this resolution.\n  The attacks of September 11 on our Nation, coupled with the \nsubsequent recession and resulting unemployment, have placed tremendous \nand unanticipated strains on Government services and resources. At the \nsame time, the States, which are after all our partners in providing \nhealth care, education, and other essential services, are facing a \ndramatic and unexpected decline in Government revenues at precisely the \ntime when the demand for Government services is the greatest because of \nthe lagging economy.\n  State budgets are under siege. The combination of increasing demands \nfor services and resources, coupled with the dramatic drop in revenues, \nis causing a fiscal crisis for States from coast to coast.\n  The State of Maine, for example, faces a budget shortfall over the \nnext 2 years of approximately $1.2 billion. Let me put that in \nperspective. The entire budget for Maine is only $5.3 billion, which \nmeans it faces a shortfall of more than 20 percent. To put the plight \nof Maine into perspective, I point out if the Federal Government were \nfacing a 20-percent shortfall, it would have to close a $440 billion \nbudget gap, and it would have to do so under its Constitution without \nborrowing a single dime. That is the dilemma facing our States.\n  The States have to balance their budgets. They cannot print more \nmoney. They cannot borrow more money. They have to balance their \nbudgets. States have been using rainy day funds, delaying capital \nprojects, cutting spending, increasing taxes. They are doing whatever \nthey can to balance their budgets.\n  According to a February report by the National Conference on State \nLegislatures, States have been forced to cut a number of critical \nprograms, ranging from education to corrections. Mr. President, 29 \nStates have imposed across-the-board budget cuts, and at least 24 \nStates are considering tax increases to help close those budget gaps.\n  Moreover, at a time when the number of people without health \ninsurance is climbing, 49 States have either already taken action to \ncut their Medicaid Program, or are planning to do so. Medicaid provides \nmedical care for 44 million low-income people nationwide, including \n218,000 individuals in my home State. States are cutting benefits, \nincreasing copays, restricting eligibility, or removing poor families \nfrom the rolls because of soaring costs and plunging revenues. As a \nconsequence, the National Governors Association estimates as many as 2 \nmillion low-income individuals across this country will lose their \nhealth care coverage as a result of the loss of Medicaid coverage.\n  Let me be clear, I am not saying Congress should bail out the States. \nI am not saying States should not have to make hard choices. I am not \nsaying States should not cut their budgets, that they should not \nbalance their budgets. The States do need to tighten their belts during \nthese austere fiscal times, but the nature and the severity of the \nfiscal crisis facing our States has convinced me we simply must help. \nThe consequences are too dire, otherwise, and too many very low-income \nindividuals will suffer if we do not step in and help.\n  That is why I joined in this effort to provide for a temporary \nincrease in the February Medicaid matching rate as well as some \nflexible funds that go to every State. Specifically, our amendment, \nwhich has strong bipartisan support, provides $30 billion to the \nStates, at least half of which would have to be provided through a \ntemporary increase in the Medicaid matching rate.\n  Our amendment is strongly supported by a host of health care patient \nand consumer advocacy groups, including the American Hospital \nAssociation, the American Health Care Association, the Visiting Nurses \nAssociations of America, the American Dental Association, Families USA, \nthe Child Welfare League of America, the Alzheimer's Association, the \nNational Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the Children's Defense Fund, \nthe Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, and many \nother critically important organizations.\n\n  The support our proposal has received underscores how important it is \nwe act now to provide assistance to the States at a time when many are \nlooking toward further cuts in their health care programs to help \nbalance their budgets.\n  We have focused particularly on Medicaid because of our concern about \nthe impact on low-income families in America. But there is another \nreason it makes sense to target this assistance to the Medicaid \nProgram; that is, Medicaid is the fastest growing component of State \nbudgets.\n  While State revenues are stagnant or declining in most States, \nMedicaid costs are increasing at a rate of more than 13 percent a year. \nMy home State of Maine is one of many States that has been forced to \nconsider cuts in its Medicaid Program to compensate for its budget \nshortfalls.\n  Legislation enacted as a consequence of our amendment, I stress \nagain, will not free States from making very painful and difficult \nchoices in crafting their budgets for the year. But it will help \nprevent the most harmful cuts, those that would affect the families who \ncan least afford them, those who\n\n[[Page S3982]]\n\nare already under strain as we see the number of uninsured continue to \nclimb to 41 million Americans without insurance.\n  To Maine, our amendment could mean as much as $190 million over the \nnext 18 months for health care and social services that would help our \nmost needy citizens. In other words, this is about helping those who \nare most vulnerable in our society. In addition, our proposal makes \nsound economic sense. Putting money into the hands of the States is a \ngood way to stimulate economic growth.\n  After all, if we cut taxes in Washington only to have taxes increased \nin State capitals across this country, we will wipe out the good that \nwe do by cutting taxes. We know if we get money into the hands of the \nStates, they will put it directly into the economy, and that is just \nthe kind of stimulus our economy needs.\n  Congress is most effective when it stands arm in arm, not toe to toe, \nwith our partners, the States. Our States face a crisis of vast and \nstill-expanding dimensions. We need to help. This amendment is a \ncritical step forward in doing just that. I hope we will have another \nvery strong bipartisan vote for our proposal so that we can ensure any \nfiscal relief is included in any economic growth package that we \nconsider later this year.\n  I am happy to yield to my colleague from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I ask the Senator from Maine, in the summary before \nthe vote tomorrow, opponents will no doubt ask what is our source of \nfunding. That is a fair question to ask, and it has a very easy answer, \nin this case in a sense-of-the-Senate amendment.\n  Would the Senator from Maine be willing to clear up for our \ncolleagues how we will pay for this?\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senator from West Virginia raises an excellent \nquestion. Again, I stress that what our direction to the Finance \nCommittee would say, when you report an economic growth package, fiscal \nrelief up to at least $30 billion should be part of that package.\n  So our sense-of-the-Senate amendment does not increase the deficit. \nIt does not increase the overall spending in this resolution. It does \nnot increase the budget caps that are in this resolution. All it says \nis, when an economic growth package is reported by the Finance \nCommittee, it should include the $30 billion in State fiscal relief.\n  So this proposal is budget neutral and it is deficit neutral. It does \nnot have the impact that might cause some people otherwise to oppose \nit.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator and ask if she would further \nyield?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. It would be natural, in the nature of this body, for \npeople to come and say--the Senator referred to this in her remarks--\nyou are talking about making available $30 billion to the States; we \nhave enough problems of our own at the Federal Government level. I \npointed out in my remarks the recession we are in right now is more a \nmatter, not of war that we are in, but the State situation and the \nFederal Government situation.\n  So people would say just let the States go ahead and pay for this. If \nthey have to make cuts, they have to make cuts. It is their fault they \nare in this kind of situation.\n  I was wondering how the Senator would reply to that.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I would respond to that concern in two \nways. First of all, the dramatic decline in revenues is not the fault \nof State governments. It is a product of the lagging economy we are in, \nand the lingering effects of the attacks on our Nation of September 11. \nThe States have been prudent, have taken appropriate steps, but when \nyou have 49 States, every single State but Wyoming, struggling to close \nbudget gaps, it is clear it is not the result of profligate spending by \none or two particular States but, rather, reflects our declining \neconomy or our lagging economy.\n  What we have here is a confluence of the impact of September 11 and a \nrecession with declining revenues that have caused these budget gaps in \n49 States.\n  A second point is, despite our best efforts, the States are still \ngoing to have to make some very painful and difficult choices. In the \nState of Maine, we are facing a budget gap of over $1 billion. Under \nour proposal, Maine would get a much welcomed $190 million. There is \nstill a long ways to go.\n  Our proposal will certainly help the States avoid some of the most \nharmful cuts, particularly in health care, which is our greatest \nconcern, but it certainly does not mean States are let off the hook in \nany way.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. If the Senator will further yield, she leads \ndirectly to the question I wanted to ask her. That is, that there are \nmany who have not worked in the bowels of State government, so to \nspeak, who think Medicaid is sort of a gift from the Federal Government \nto the States. They do not understand that there is a very complex \nformula wherein all the States have to contribute, the formula is based \nupon their prosperity, and things of that sort.\n  So the concept that this is somehow the Federal Government turning \nover money to the States and there is no cost to them doesn't make any \nsense, does it?\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senator is absolutely correct. Medicaid is a \npartnership between the Federal Government and our partners, the \nStates, to provide health care to low-income families, the very poor \nindividuals, to those who need it most. Medicaid is the fastest growing \ncomponent in State budgets. So States certainly are contributing to \nthis program. It has been a successful partnership. We are suggesting a \ntemporary increase over the next 18 months. I hope we will grant that.\n  I have several letters which I am going to have printed in the \nRecord, which talk about protecting the States' ability to provide and \ndeliver this health care, and points out, again, that these are health \ncare services to the most vulnerable Americans we serve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the National Association \nfor Home Care and Hospice be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                           Homecare & Hospice,\n\n                                                 January 22, 2003.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the National Association \n     for Home Care & Hospice (NAHC), the nation's largest \n     association representing home care and hospice providers, \n     caregivers and the patients they serve, I am writing to \n     commend you on the introduction of S. 138, the ``State Budget \n     Relief Act of 2003.''\n       As you are well aware, the current economic downturn has \n     resulted in drastically lower state tax revenues. Moreover, \n     the number of uninsured continues to grow as more and more \n     people are forced from the labor market. This has resulted in \n     states being forced to cut their Medicaid budgets at the \n     exact time that there is a growing need for services.\n       Your legislation, by temporarily increasing the Federal \n     Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) as a way to direct \n     additional federal funding to state Medicaid programs, will \n     protect states' health care delivery systems and ensure the \n     continuation of health services for the most vulnerable of \n     our population. Without this assistance, many communities \n     will find themselves with providers that are understaffed, \n     have crumbling infrastructures, lack current medical \n     technology, or have reduced or eliminated certain services.\n       NAHC believes that home health and hospice services remain \n     one of the remedies to the widespread concern over growing \n     health care costs. In recent years, state Medicaid programs \n     have increased their utilization of home and community-based \n     long-term care services in lieu of institutional care through \n     the use of waivers. In fact, the Centers for Medicare and \n     Medicaid Services (CMS) recently reported that Medicaid \n     spending growth levels for home care services more than \n     doubled between 2000 and 2001--from 8,6 percent to 17.3 \n     percent. Some of this trend reflects the growing desire to \n     implement the Supreme Court's Olmstead decision to provide \n     disabled individuals care in the least restrictive setting \n     possible and the Administration's goals as set forth in its \n     ``New Freedom Initiative.'' This desirable trend is at risk \n     of falling victim to the widespread cuts to the Medicaid \n     program that states are being forced to implement due to \n     budget shortfalls.\n       Once again, thank you for your leadership on this issue. \n     Let me know if there is anything my staff or I can do to \n     ensure the passage of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Val J. Halamandaris,\n                                                        President.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator from Maine.\n\n[[Page S3983]]\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this sense of \nthe Senate amendment to provide funding for State fiscal relief.\n  States are suffering their worst fiscal crisis in over half a \ncentury.\n  Forty one million Americans live, work, and go to school without \nhealth insurance, and that number grows every single day.\n  I have been a strong supporter of State fiscal relief since the \neconomy began to slow several years ago. Since then, the situation has \nonly gotten worse. This is the third consecutive year of nationwide \nbudget problems for the States.\n  According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 49 States and the District \nof Columbia have taken Medicaid cost-containment action this fiscal \nyear; additional cuts are expected next year as States struggle to fill \nbudget shortfalls of billions of dollars.\n  States are reducing or freezing provider payments, establishing or \nstrengthening prescription drug cost controls, reducing benefits, \nincreasing co-payments for Medicaid beneficiaries, and most \nsignificantly, States are increasing restrictions on eligibility for \nMedicaid.\n  What does this mean? Let me be clear: it means that the number of \nuninsured Americans will continue to grow.\n  According to the CDC, Medicaid and SCHIP provided coverage for 2 \nmillion children and 1 million adults who lost their health coverage \nlast year. In addition to those who did qualify for these programs, \nmany more did not; they joined the ranks of the uninsured. In 2001, 1.4 \nmillion people became uninsured, and this number is likely to be even \nhigher for 2002 and 2003.\n  While we need to strengthen our economy in the long run, it is \nimperative that we address the immediate economic problems, \nparticularly the state fiscal crisis. State fiscal relief is one of the \nmost effective policies the Congress could and should enact as part of \nthe economic stimulus/growth package.\n  There is no question that States will spend any additional Federal \nfunds they receive quickly, putting money directly into the economy \nrather than curtailing economic activity. As many economists have \nnoted, we need to increase demand in the economy--but State budget \nactions to balance their budgets right now are reducing demand \nsignificantly.\n  This is precisely the wrong medicine at the wrong time for our \neconomy.\n  Last year, 75 Senators voted to provide State fiscal relief by \nboosting FMAP payments to States, but in the end, the legislation was \nnot signed into law and State fiscal relief--needed now more than last \nyear--has still not been delivered.\n  The magnitude of the State fiscal crisis is growing steadily worse. \nOregon alone is facing a budget deficit of at least $1 billion in the \nupcoming fiscal year. Already, one in four Medicaid recipients in \nOregon is experiencing service cuts, and more reductions are on the \nway. Districts in my State have the shortest school year of any schools \nin the country. Some teachers in my State have even agreed to work for \nfree in order to keep the schools open! And things are so bad for \nOregon schools that recently the Doonesbury comic strip dedicated a \nwhole week of comics to the sad state of Oregon school funding.\n  This proposal would bring almost $331 million to Oregon over the next \n18 months, which would go a long way to maintain the fragile health \ncare safety net for vulnerable Oregonians. Bipartisan support for our \nFMAP proposal has grown steadily. It is supported by groups \nrepresenting the States, the elderly, the disabled, children, and \nOregon's governor Kulongoski, among many, many others. It has support \nbecause it is a sound proposal. It provides temporary assistance to \nStates in a very timely and efficient manner.\n  Several weeks ago, I was in Oregon for a series of town hall meetings \nwith my colleague Ron Wyden. At every stop, we spoke to people who were \nbeing affected by the first round of budget cuts. I can tell you, as we \nlistened to these good people tell their stories, there wasn't a dry \neye in the house.\n  The pain is real. We have to do something and we have to do it now, \nand I urge my colleagues to support this fiscal relief amendment to the \nbudget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Does the Senator from West \nVirginia yield time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. How much time, might I ask the Senator, does he \nrequire?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I estimate 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Senator is welcome to that.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to join with \nmy colleague from the State of Maine. We have been working for a long \ntime to bring about help for the States in the area of Medicaid and in \nthe area of welfare reform and social services.\n  Our amendment makes it clear that the Senate recognizes the \npartnership between the Federal Government and the States, and is \ncommitted to helping the States see their way out of their dire budget \nsituation.\n  How bad is this budget shortfall? The States are currently \nexperiencing the worst fiscal crisis since World War II. States have \naccumulated $26 billion in deficits this year on top of $50 billion in \ndeficits from last year. Even greater gaps, reaching upwards of $70 to \n$85 billion in deficits, are projected for the next fiscal year. It is, \nin fact, a crisis.\n  But the budget crisis is more than just numbers and dollars. This is \nabout real people. And the people of our States have been hit hard by \nthe tough economic times. Nearly every State is required to have a \nbalanced budget, even during a recession. The rainy day funds have run \ndry and funding for programs as critical as Medicaid have been cut to \nthe bone. The only option left for many States is to cut critical \nprograms even further or raise taxes.\n  Just last year, Nebraska reduced the number of low-income working \nfamilies that were eligible for assistance with childcare. More than \n2,000 Nebraska families have lost childcare assistance as a result of \nthis change. Those hardest hit are families that have managed to stay \noff welfare for more than 2 years. These families who have slowly but \nsteadily made progress to self-sufficiency may soon find themselves \nstruggling to pay their childcare bills and returning to the welfare \nrolls. Childcare assistance is integral to any effort to move families \nfrom welfare to work and to keeping low-income parents employed. State \nfiscal relief will protect the progress we have made in welfare reform \nover the past decade from being undone.\n  Many of the other cuts are being considered in the areas of \neducation, health care, social services, and corrections.\n  My office recently received a call from Sharon Walters of Omaha, NE. \nThe message she relayed is a good illustration of how these proposed \ncuts are affecting real people. She wanted to make sure I know the \nimportance of my efforts to provide State fiscal relief. She represents \nBethphage, an organization that provides community-based services for \npeople with disabilities. She was worried because much of their funding \ncomes from Medicaid. Because of so many proposed cuts to the Medicaid \nprogram, Bethphage and other programs like theirs, may soon be forced \nto limit the good work they do if State budgets do not see some relief \nsoon.\n  State fiscal relief is not only needed to protect education, health \ncare, Medicaid and other social service programs, it is needed to \nstimulate our economy.\n  In discussing various jobs and growth proposals with my colleagues \nthis year, I have repeatedly asked them to ``Show me the Stimulus'' and \ndemonstrate how proposed tax cuts or spending will get our economy back \non track.\n  Although economists differ on the stimulative effect of the varying \ntax cut proposals, I think there is little question that providing \nStates with fiscal relief would be a boost to the economy. In fact, \nState fiscal relief may provide more ``bang for the buck'' than many of \nthe other stimulus proposals being discussed. According to a recent \nstudy done by Mark Zandi at economy.com every dollar spent in State \nfiscal relief will create $1.24 in demand the following year.\n  At a time when we are trying to get the economy back on track, it \nwould be irresponsible for the Senate to turn its back on this \nnationwide crisis and do nothing.\n  It doesn't make much sense to cut taxes in Washington while States \nare\n\n[[Page S3984]]\n\nforced to raise them in Lincoln, Des Moines, Topeka, Pierre, Saint \nPaul, or wherever and other State capitals throughout the United \nStates. State fiscal relief is a commonsense approach to getting our \neconomy back on track. As well, it is the right thing to do. Not only \nwill State fiscal relief shield the people of our States from some of \nthe tough economic times, to some extent, it will also stimulate our \neconomy and return individuals and States alike to financial security.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues--Senators Collins and Rockefeller--for \ntheir work on this important effort and urge my colleagues to join us \nin supporting this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank my colleagues and thank the Presiding \nOfficer for this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Conrad, I yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland 20 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. At most.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I intend to speak to an amendment which \nwill be offered tomorrow. I take this approach because I am joined in \nsponsoring this amendment by Senator Jeffords, Senator Mikulski, and \nSenator Bob Graham of Florida. And they will, presumably, be able to \naddress the amendment as well on that occasion.\n  The amendment that we will offer will boost Federal funding for the \nClean Water and Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Funds from the \nlevel that is recommended in the budget resolution, which is $2.2 \nbillion, to $5.2 billion; $3.2 billion of this for the Clean Water \nState Revolving Fund and $2 billion for the Safe Drinking Water State \nRevolving Fund.\n  Regrettably, the President's budget for fiscal 2004 and the budget \nresolution severely shortchange the funds needed by State and local \ngovernments to upgrade their aging wastewater and drinking water \ninfrastructure.\n  The President's budget provides only $1.7 billion for both State \nRevolving Funds, equally split. The budget resolution recommends a \nsomewhat higher figure, a little over $2 billion for both funds, but \nthat is still far short of what is needed.\n  Despite progress over the last three decades, EPA reports that more \nthan 40 percent of our Nation's lakes, rivers, and streams are still \ntoo impaired for fishing or swimming. Discharges from aging and failing \nsewage systems, urban storm water, and other sources continue to pose \nserious threats to our Nation's waters, endangering public health and \nboth the fishing and recreational industries.\n  Of course, as we all realize, population growth and development are \nplacing additional stress on the Nation's water infrastructure and our \nability to make sustainable gains in water quality.\n  Across the Nation, our wastewater and drinking water systems are \naging. And, in some cases, systems currently in use were built more \nthan a century ago and have outlived their useful life.\n  For many communities, current treatment is not sufficient to meet \nwater quality goals. Recent EPA modeling indicates that municipal \nwastewater treatment facilities in my own State will have to reduce \nnitrogen discharges by nearly 75 percent to restore the Chesapeake Bay \nand its tributaries to health.\n  In April of 2000, the Water Infrastructure Network, a broad coalition \nof locally elected officials, drinking water and wastewater service \nproviders, State environmental and health administrators, engineers, \nand environmentalists released a report, ``Clean and Safe Water for the \n21st Century.'' This report documented a $23 billion a year shortfall \nin funding needed to meet national environmental and public health \npriorities in the Clean Water Act and in the Safe Drinking Water Act. \nAnd all of the studies have substantiated this gap. For example, in May \nof 2002--less than a year ago--the Congressional Budget Office released \na report showing very large gaps for clean water needs and drinking \nwater needs over the next 20 years.\n  The need for additional investment in wastewater and drinking water \ninfrastructure is clearly documented. But States, localities, and \nprivate sources cannot meet the funding gap alone. Local communities \nalready pay almost 90 percent of the total cost, or about $60 billion a \nyear, to build, operate, and maintain their drinking water and \nwastewater systems.\n\n  But as Administrator Whitman recently pointed out:\n\n       The magnitude of the challenge America faces is clearly \n     beyond the ability of any one entity to address.\n\n  States are currently facing the worst fiscal crisis in 50 years and \ncannot afford to make new investments in clean water and drinking water \ninfrastructure.\n  Clearly, water pollution is an interstate problem that requires, in \npart, a Federal response. In our own case, in Maryland, water flows \ninto the Chesapeake Bay from six States. Other States need to make \ninvestments as well in order to clean up the watershed. It is vital \nthat the Federal Government maintain a strong partnership with States \nand local governments in order to address this major environmental \nchallenge.\n  The increases provided for in this amendment are the first step \nnecessary to deal with this pressing problem. It represents an \ninvestment in the health of Americans and a clean environment, and is, \nI believe, an investment that will pay substantial dividends.\n  Wastewater treatment plants not only prevent billions of tons of \npollutants from reaching our rivers, lakes, streams, and coasts, they \nalso help prevent waterborne diseases and make waters safe for swimming \nand fishing. In fact, the Water Infrastructure Network says that clean \nwater supports $50 billion a year in the water-based recreation \nindustry, at least $300 billion a year in coastal tourism, $45 billion \nannually in commercial fishing and shellfishing, and hundreds of \nbillions of dollars a year in basic manufacturing that relies on clean \nwater.\n  According to the Water Infrastructure Network, clean rivers, lakes, \nand coastlines attract investment in local communities and increase \nland values on or near the water, and that, in turn, creates jobs, adds \nto the tax base, and improves revenues for local, State, and Federal \ngovernments. Some 54,000 community drinking-water systems provide \ndrinking water to more than 250 million Americans. By keeping water \nsupplies free of contaminants that cause disease, these water systems \nreduce sickness and related health care costs. They reduce absenteeism \nin the workforce. And they, obviously, add to our quality of life.\n  Investment in the infrastructure we are talking about here--sewer and \nwater improvements--would also create substantial numbers of jobs \nthrough construction. It would provide an impetus to our economy at a \ntime when it needs an impetus.\n  There is strong support for increased investment in infrastructure. \nColleagues on both sides of the aisle have taken a lead on this issue \nover the years.\n  The case for the amendment is compelling. Maintaining clean, safe \nwater remains one of our leading national challenges. This budget \nresolution should not and need not come at the expense of human health \nor a clean environment. I strongly urge my colleagues, when the \namendment is presented, to support it and to begin to address this \nlarge funding gap that looms into the future with respect to this very \nimportant aspect of our domestic agenda. This is both good \nenvironmental policy and good economic policy. Support for this \namendment will offer an opportunity to continue to make progress on \nclean water and safe drinking water. I commend the amendment to my \ncolleagues when it is brought before them at the appropriate time.\n  Mr. President, I have a number of letters from organizations in \nsupport of the amendment. I ask unanimous consent to print them in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             National Association of Counties,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 2003.\n     Subject: Support for the Jeffords/Sarbanes/Mikulski/Graham \n         SFR amendment.\n\n       Dear Senator: The National Association of Counties (NACO) \n     supports the Jeffords/Sarbanes/Mikulski/Graham amendment to \n     boost funding for the Clean Water and Safe\n\n[[Page S3985]]\n\n     Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (SRF) from the Fiscal \n     2003 enacted level of $2.19 billion to $5.2 billion.\n       Despite progress over the past 30 years, the Environmental \n     Protection Agency reports that more than 40 percent of our \n     nation's lakes, rivers, and streams are still too impaired to \n     be utilized for their intended use. And, discharges from \n     aging and failing sewage systems, urban storm water and other \n     sources continue to pose serious threats to our nation's \n     waters. Population growth and development only place more \n     stress on the nation's water infrastructure and its ability \n     to maintain current standards.\n       On September 30, 2002, the EPA released a Clean Water and \n     Drinking Water Infrastructure Gap Analysis. This report \n     discovered a $535 billion gap between current spending and \n     projected water and wastewater infrastructure needs over the \n     next 20 years if additional investments are not made.\n       It is vital that the Federal government work with the state \n     and local governments to prevent this massive projected \n     funding gap and share the burden of maintaining and improving \n     the nation's water infrastructure. An increase in funding for \n     the Clean Water SRF to $2 billion in fiscal year 2004 is the \n     first step necessary to meet these funding requirements.\n       Additionally, each billion dollars invested in water \n     infrastructure creates an estimated 40,000 jobs. So this \n     amendment is both pro-environmental policy and pro-economic \n     policy. Thank you for offering this timely and important \n     amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Larry Naake,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                    National League of Cities,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of the National League of \n     Cities and the 18,000 cities and towns across the nation we \n     represent, we would like to express our support for your \n     efforts, along with those of Senators Mikulski, Graham and \n     Jeffords, to increase funding for the Clean Water and \n     Drinking Water State Revolving Funds.\n       As you know, our cities and towns are facing a $23 billion \n     funding gap annually to repair and replace aging \n     infrastructure for these critical, but unseen, services, \n     despite annual local expenditures of more than $60 billion \n     for wastewater and drinking water. We also agree that \n     investments in our water and wastewater infrastructure can \n     serve as a job creation component of an economic stimulus \n     initiative.\n       We applaud and appreciate your efforts and offer any \n     assistance we can to help you attain your objective.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Don Borut,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                    Association of\n\n\n                                  Metropolitan Water Agencies,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of the nation's largest \n     public water suppliers, thank you for your efforts to \n     increase funding for the drinking water and clean water state \n     revolving funds (SRFs) to $5.2 billion in fiscal year 2004. \n     If this increase is appropriated, the benefits will be safer \n     water supplies, cleaner rivers and streams, and a stronger \n     economy.\n       The Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies represents \n     the nation's largest publicly owned drinking water providers. \n     ANWA's members serve safe drinking water to more than 110 \n     million Americans.\n       Sources including the Water Infrastructure Network, EPA, \n     GAO and the CBO confirm that water systems face multi-\n     billion-dollar gaps in funding, as water facilities, \n     particularly underground distribution systems, reach the end \n     of their useful lives. According to WIN, the gap between what \n     utilities currently invest and what they will need to invest \n     over the next 20 years is $23 billion per year. Water systems \n     themselves pay the majority of infrastructure costs, but \n     federal help is needed, especially for metropolitan systems.\n       Twenty-one States provided no assistance to systems serving \n     100,000 or more people between 1996-2002. Thirteen more \n     States provided assistance to only one or two of these \n     systems. Only a substantial boost in funding will provide the \n     opportunity to better help our nation's largest public water \n     systems.\n       Thank you for supporting drinking water and wastewater \n     infrastructure funding.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Diane VanDe Hei,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                 Water Environment Federation,\n\n                                                   March 19, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes (D-MD),\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: It is our understanding that you and \n     other Senators plan to offer an amendment during \n     consideration of the FY 2004 Budget Resolution that would \n     substantially increase funds available for the Clean Water \n     and Safe Drinking Water state revolving funds (SRFs). The \n     Water Environment Federation, an organization whose members \n     are directly involved in the implementation of clean water \n     programs, strongly supports this amendment.\n       The need for increased investment in water infrastructure \n     is well documented. In September 2002, the Environmental \n     Protection Agency released a Clean Water and Safe Drinking \n     Water Infrastructure Gap Analysis which found that there will \n     be a $535 billion gap between current spending and projected \n     needs for water and wastewater infrastructure over the next \n     20 years if additional investments are not made. In May 2002, \n     the Congressional Budget Office released a report that \n     estimated a spending gap for drinking water between $132 \n     billion and $388 billion over 20 years and the spending gap \n     for drinking water needs at between $70 billion and $362 \n     billion over 20 years.\n       WEF, founded in 1928, is a not-for-profit technical and \n     educational organization with members from varied disciplines \n     who work toward the WEF vision of preservation and \n     enhancement of the global water environment. The WEF network \n     includes more than 100,000 water quality professionals from \n     79 Member Associations in 32 countries.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Tim Williams,\n\n                                                Managing Director,\n     Government and Public Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Association of\n\n\n                               Metropolitan Sewerage Agencies,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 2003.\n     Hon.

Barbara Mikulski,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: On behalf of the nearly 300 publicly owned \n     wastewater treatment agency members who provide treatment to \n     a majority of Americans, the Association of Metropolitan \n     Sewerage Agencies (AMSA) offers its support for your \n     amendment to the Fiscal 2004 Budget Resolution. Your \n     amendment would boost funding for the Clean Water State \n     Revolving Fund (CWSRF) from its current funding level of \n     $1.35 billion to $3.5 billion in fiscal year 2004, an \n     increase which AMSA believes would mark an important first \n     step toward developing a long-term, sustainable solution for \n     the wastewater infrastructure funding gap.\n       As your March 14 Dear Colleague letter aptly states, ``It \n     is vital that the Federal government maintain a strong \n     partnership with states and local governments in averting \n     this massive projected funding gap and share in the burden of \n     maintaining and improving the nation's water \n     infrastructure,'' Your amendment demonstrates that water \n     quality remains a high priority for the 108th Congress and \n     helps bring the significant goal of overcoming the clean \n     water funding gap within reach.\n       AMSA's overarching goal is to ensure America's clean water \n     progress. Once again, we thank you for your support of the \n     nation's publicly owned treatment works and for your help in \n     meeting this critical national objective. AMSA looks forward \n     to working with you on a long-term, sustainable funding \n     solution for the nation's core wastewater infrastructure. If \n     you have any questions, please contact me at 202/833-2672.\n            Sincerely,\n                                                         Ken Kirk,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Association of\n\n\n                                     California Water Agencies\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Jim Jeffords,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Barbara Mikulski,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: The Association of California Water Agencies \n     (ACWA) strongly supports your proposed amendment to the \n     fiscal year 2004 Budget Resolution to increase funding for \n     the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Funds \n     (SRFs).\n       Throughout the United States, these programs provide \n     indispensable resources to rural areas and municipalities \n     alike for projects that enable compliance with drinking water \n     standards, protection of waterways, sanitation, environmental \n     preservation and more. The SRFs are the backbone of our water \n     infrastruce, and with increasingly severe demands on water \n     supplies, the Funds\n\n[[Page S3986]]\n\n     will become more important in the years ahead.\n       Last year the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n     acknowledged a multi-billion dollar need for reinvestment in \n     our water infrastructure, and this ``funding gap'' is the \n     ongoing subject of bipartisan legislation.\n       ACWA represents 440 public water agencies in California \n     collectively responsible for more than 90 percent of the \n     water delivered for residential and agricultural use.\n       Thank you for your efforts to increase funding for water \n     infrastructure in the 2004 budget, and we look forward to \n     working with you to advance this worthwhile goal.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                David L.

Paul Sarbanes,\n     Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: I am writing on behalf of the \n     130,000 members of the American Society of Civil Engineers \n     (ASCE) to support passage of your amendment to increase \n     funding for the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act \n     State Revolving Loan Fund (SRF) programs for fiscal year \n     2004.\n       Two years ago ASCE released its 2001 Report Card for \n     America's Infrastructure. At that time, we found that the \n     nation's aging wastewater and drinking-water systems received \n     an overall grade of D. These systems are quintessential \n     examples of aged systems that need to be updated. For \n     example, some sewer systems are 100 years old. Many older \n     drinking-water systems are structurally obsolete.\n       The annual funding shortfall of $11 billion for drinking-\n     water and $12 billion for wastewater only accounts for \n     improvements to the current system and do not even take into \n     consideration the demands of a growing population.\n       The amendment that you propose would help make an important \n     down payment on the necessary investment in our long-\n     neglected water systems.\n       If ASCE can be of any assistance in this important \n     endeavor, please do not hesitate to contact Brian Pallasch at \n     202-326-5140 or Michael Charles at 202-326-5126.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                          Thomas L.

James M. Jeffords,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Barbara A. Mikulski,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Jeffords, Mikulski, Sarbanes, and Graham: I \n     am writing on behalf of the more than 2,000 members of the \n     Construction Management Association of America (CMAA) to \n     express our strong support for the proposed amendment you \n     plan to offer today during consideration of the FY 2004 \n     Budget Resolution, which would increase funding for the Clean \n     Water and Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (SRF) \n     from the Fiscal 2003 enacted level of $2.2 billion to $5.2 \n     billion.\n       CMAA is an industry association of firms and professionals \n     who provide program and construction management services to \n     owners in the planning, design and construction of capital \n     projects of all types. CMAA's mission is to ``promote \n     professionalism and excellence in the management of the \n     construction process.''\n       As you are well aware, America's water infrastructure \n     systems are aging, deteriorating and demanding attention. \n     Reports show that municipal sewer systems overflow some \n     40,000 times annually. In addition, approximately 42 million \n     Americans are served by old sewer systems that don't even \n     separate storm water from waste. The need for improvement is \n     clear, and growing.\n       According to a 2001 report published by The Water \n     Infrastructure Network (WIN), of which CMAA is a member, \n     wastewater systems faced a daunting capital investment \n     shortfall of approximately $12 billion each year over the \n     next two decades. A similar report by the Congressional \n     Budget Office (CBO) concluded in 2002 that ``costs to \n     construct, operate, and maintain the nation's water \n     infrastructure can be expected to rise significantly in the \n     future.'' The CBO conservatively estimated that the needs \n     would be $13 billion annually for wasterwater systems over \n     the next 20 years.\n       An increase in funding for the Clean Water SRF to $3.2 \n     billion and for the Safe Drinking Water SRF to $2 billion in \n     fiscal year 2004, as proposed in your amendment, would help \n     address this massive water infrastructure funding gap.\n       Once again, CMAA offers its strongest support for this \n     important amendment and commends you for your leadership in \n     helping to address our nation's water infrastructure funding \n     gap. Should you have any questions or comments, please do not \n     hesitate to contact Elizabeth Aronson, our Director of \n     Government Affairs, at 703/216-3248.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Bruce D'Agostino,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            The Associated General\n\n\n                                       Contractors of America,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, March 18, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: As you consider the Fiscal Year 2004 \n     Budget Resolution, the Associated General Contractors of \n     America (AGC) urges you to support the Jeffords-Sarbanes-\n     Mikulski-Graham amendment to boost funding for the Clean and \n     Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Funds. The amendment \n     would increase funding from the Fiscal Year 2003 enacted \n     level of $2.19 billion to $5.2 billion.\n       AGC is proud of the role the construction industry has \n     played in improving water quality. However, the needs facing \n     our nation's wastewater and drinking water systems are \n     tremendous. The EPA reports that more than 40 percent of our \n     nation's lakes, rivers, and streams are still too impaired \n     for fishing or swimming. Discharges from aging and failing \n     sewage systems, urban storm water and other sources continue \n     to pose serious threats to our nation's waters, endangering \n     not only public health, but also fishing and recreation \n     industries. Population growth and development have placed \n     additional stress on the nation's water infrastructure and \n     its ability to sustain the water quality gains realized since \n     the inception of the Clean Water Act. Today, maintaining \n     clean, safe water remains one of our greatest national and \n     global challenges.\n       In May 2002, the Congressional Budget Office released a \n     report that estimated the spending gap for clean water needs \n     between $132 billion and $388 billion over 20 years and the \n     spending gap for drinking water needs at between $70 billion \n     and $362 billion over 20 years. In September 2002, the EPA \n     released the Clean Water and Drinking Water Infrastructure \n     Gap Analysis which found that there will be a $535 billion \n     gap between current spending and projected needs for water \n     and wastewater infrastructure (combined) over the next 20 \n     years if additional investments are not made. When the \n     analysis was released Administrator Whitman pointed out, ``. \n     . .the magnitude of the challenge America faces is clearly \n     beyond the ability of any one entity to address.''\n       The funding included in this amendment will improve our \n     water systems, the environment, and also create tens of \n     thousands of jobs. Please support the Jeffords-Sarbanes-\n     Mikulski-Graham amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Stephen E. Sandherr,\n                                          Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I missed the opening part of his comments. Can the \nSenator tell me how much money is involved and over what period of \ntime?\n  Mr. SARBANES. The amendment has another $3 billion for these \npurposes, both for the Clean Water and the Safe Drinking Water State \nRevolving Funds. These are the moneys that go into the State Revolving \nFunds. Then, of course, they have to be matched by the States and often \nthe localities. So the amount of money is leveraged significantly \nbeyond what the Federal contribution would be.\n  Mr. NICKLES. So there would be a total of $3 billion over the 10-year \nperiod of time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Another $3 billion, that is right.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friend. Am I correct it would be offset, \nreducing the tax reductions that are in the proposal?\n  Mr. SARBANES. The bill has room in it for $726 billion worth of tax \ncuts. Obviously, this raises the question of priorities. Is it more \nimportant to give these particular tax cuts, which, of course, I \nbelieve strongly are heavily weighted towards the wealthy, as opposed \nto making some investment in programs of this sort? We have to connect \nthe two. I am willing to look at doing reasonable tax cuts, but I think \nwhat is in the resolution, as the chairman knows from my statements in \ncommittee, is far too excessive. If it were up to me, I would reduce \nthat amount. I would use a limited portion of it to fund some of these \npriority programs. I would use the remainder of it to hold down the \ndeficit so we are not projecting such large deficits out into the \nfuture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for offering his \namendment. We will consider the amendment tomorrow. We have already had \nthree or four amendments that are in the queue tomorrow. I understand \nthere\n\n[[Page S3987]]\n\nwill be others. We have asked other Senators to come forward tonight to \noffer their amendments. The Senator from Maryland is doing that and \nexplained it. I appreciate his explanation of the amendment. I am sure \nwe will try to get that in the queue. I know Senator Crapo has an \ninterest on this issue as well.\n  It is 8:45, and we have requested colleagues if they had amendments \nto bring those to the floor. I am concerned about having a vote-arama \nor having so many people saying: Wait a minute, I didn't have a chance \nto offer my amendment.\n  We have been saying all along that we would be in session very late \ntonight to receive amendments. We will be in session very late tomorrow \ntonight to dispose of amendments. I would like to see if we can't work \nout some amendments, accept some amendments, voice vote some \namendments, and work toward completing this bill and avoid the crash at \nthe end, the vote-arama where we have votes on amendments without \nhaving the slightest idea what is in them. We have done that in the \npast. That is not a good way to legislate. I would like to avoid that \nif possible.\n  I thank my colleague from Maryland for coming late tonight and \noffering the amendment. I wish more Senators would have. I look forward \nto working with him tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4 p.m. on \nThursday, the Senate proceed to a series of votes in relation to the \nfollowing amendments: Kyl amendment No. 288; Dorgan amendment No. 294; \nRockefeller-Collins amendment No. 275. I further ask unanimous consent \nthat no second-degree amendments be in order to any of the preceding \namendments prior to the vote, and that there be 2 minutes for debate \nequally divided prior to each vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask if the Senator will modify his \nunanimous consent request that there be 10 minutes between the second \nand third votes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to limit the time \non the last two amendments to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/19/senate-section/article/S3987-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred on September \n12, 2001, in New York, NY. Five teenagers attacked an Arab-American \ncandy store owner. The teenagers stopped in front of the small store \nand asked the owner, who stood in the doorway, ``Do you feel sorry for \nAmerica?'' Without waiting for a response, one teen punched the owner, \nsending him reeling backwards onto the floor, bleeding heavily. The \nassailants were able to flee from the scene before witnesses could \ncatch them.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance.

I knew and admired Prime Minister Djindjic from our meetings in \nWashington, and I want to express my deepest sympathy to his family and \nto the Serbian people.\n  Zoran Djindjic was a charismatic and courageous leader who recognized \nthat Serbia's best hope, after years of nationalist-inspired ethnic \nhatred and war destroyed Yugoslavia and caused the deaths of hundreds \nof thousands of innocent people, was to follow the path of democracy \nand the rule of law. This was not an easy choice, as it required \nconfronting the forces of corruption and evil which, despite the \noverthrow of Slobodan Milosevic, have sought to preserve the status \nquo.\n  It was Prime Minister Djindjic who, at considerable personal risk, \nobtained Milosevic's arrest, after President Kostunica refused to \ncooperate with the Hague tribunal. Turning over Milosevic was a key \nstep, but Mr. Djindjic understood that it was only the first step \ntoward a formal break with the failed policies of the past.\n  For the past 3 years, the Congress has provided substantial aid to \nsupport economic and political reform in Serbia. However, we have also \nmade clear in legislation and in discussions with Serb officials, that \ncontinued cooperation with the Hague prosecutor is essential for \ncontinued United States aid to Serbia. There were times in our \ndiscussions when Serb officials complained bitterly that the United \nStates and the Hague prosecutor were pressuring them too hard to \napprehend and transfer suspected war criminals. In fact, they did so \neven before the arrest of Milosevic. We responded that while we did not \nexpect them to apprehend all the indictees in Serbia overnight, the \nUnited States cannot provide millions of dollars in aid unconditionally \nto a government that harbors indicted war criminals.\n  Since the arrest of Milosevic, the Serb Government's cooperation with \nthe Hague tribunal has been sporadic. Mr. Djindjic wanted to move \nfaster, while Mr. Kostunica stood in the way. While some indictees have \nbeen turned over, 18 remain at liberty and access to witnesses and \ndocuments necessary to the prosecution of these cases has been \nunsatisfactory. Moreover, there has often been no cooperation until \njust weeks or days before the deadline in U.S. law for the cutoff of \naid.\n  I mention this because immediately after Prime Minister Djindjic was \ngunned down some Serb officials blamed his assassination on the \npressure exerted on Serbia by the United States and the war crimes \nprosecutor. I understand that reaction. It is convenient to blame \nothers rather than to acknowledge the difficult but essential task at \nhand--to remove from the security forces those Milosevic loyalists \ninvolved with and protecting organized crime figures and war crimes \nsuspects. But I believe that had the Serb Government moved faster, and \nmore aggressively--as Prime Minister Djindjic urged for the benefit of \nthe Serbian people and the survival of democracy--to arrest those who \nmade no secret of their efforts to thwart reform, this tragedy might \nhave been avoided.\n  Zoran Djindjic's death has kindled an outpouring of sympathy. \nMillions of Serbs have taken to the streets to express their support \nfor the policies he fought for. Let us hope that just as millions of \nSerbs joined together three years ago to oust Milosevic from power, \nZoran Djindjic's death will be the catalyst for a renewed and \nunrelenting effort to destroy the remaining vestiges of the Milosevic \nera. The United States stands ready to strongly support that effort. \nThere is no alternative, if Serbia is to take its place in today's \ndemocratic Europe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/19/senate-section/article/S3987-4", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3987-S3988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING AMERICAN SOLDIERS\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise to honor our brave soldiers fighting \nin the global war on terrorism. We recently passed the first \nanniversary of Operation Anaconda, a critical seven-day\n\n[[Page S3988]]\n\nmilitary effort within Operation Enduring Freedom that helped break the \nback of the Taliban and al-Qaida in Afghanistan. It is fitting to take \ntime to remember the sacrifice of the participants in that noble \nundertaking in the mountains of Afghanistan, and to ask Americans to \npray for those who gave their lives. Let us also pause to recall the \ncontinuing efforts of our armed forces and civilian national security \nemployees in Operation Enduring Freedom, and in the global war on \nterrorism. We are profoundly grateful for the sacrifices of all, and \noffer our prayers and deep gratitude to them and to their families.\n  On March 1, 2002, Americans went into battle near Gardez, \nAfghanistan, with Afghan and other allies, to attack al-Qaida and \nTaliban forces in eastern Afghanistan. Over the course of seven days, \nour forces engaged and defeated determined terrorist forces throughout \nmountains and rough terrain, at elevations as high as 12,000 feet, and \nin temperatures that dropped to 15 degrees Fahrenheit at night.\n  During Operation Anaconda, American Special Operations Forces \ncombined with elements of the 101st Airborne Division, the 10th \nMountain Division, and other aviation and ground units representing \nseveral allied nationalities to bring the war begun on September 11, \n2001, directly to the terrorists and their supporters.\n  On March 4, 2002, a small American force came under night attack at a \ndesolate mountain base at Takur Ghar. As a result of the ensuing \nengagement, seven Americans died. They gave their lives while trying to \nhelp each other, in a remote and forbidding place where their duty and \ntheir devotion to one another and their families had taken them. These \nseven Americans--like all Americans, civilian and uniformed, now \nengaged in the noble effort to end the terrorist threat to our Nation--\nwere volunteers. They didn't have to be on Takur Ghar, but when called \nthey did not hesitate to step forward and say ``send me.'' As a \ntestament to their heroism, at least eight Silver Stars, the Nation's \nsecond highest medal for valor, were awarded to participants in the \nbattle along with almost thirty Bronze stars and numerous other awards.\n  Mr. President, Americans and their allies gave their lives during \nOperation Anaconda and elsewhere in Afghanistan. Americans and their \nallies have given their lives in other engagements in Operation \nEnduring Freedom.\n  Let us take a moment to reflect upon the sacrifices of those who died \non Takur Ghar, and on other remote battlefields in the war on \nterrorism. Let us rededicate ourselves to ensuring the safety of home \nand hearth for their families, and for ours. Finally, let the Senate \nand all Americans show deep gratitude for their unselfish decisions to \nstep forward and say ``send me.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/19/senate-section/article/S3988-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                TRIBUTE TO NEW HAMPSHIRE POSTAL WORKERS\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, contrary to popular belief, this \nmotto, which appears on a number of postal buildings, is not the \nofficial motto of the United States Postal Service. But it certainly \ncould have been this past winter in the Granite State, where we \nsuffered through some of the coldest temperatures and heaviest \nsnowfalls in recent memory.\n  In spite of these challenges, Postal Services employees in New \nHampshire have achieved record performance. On-time First-Class \novernight mail service is at all-time record levels, and customer \nsatisfaction is at 98 percent. In addition, New Hampshire's Postal \nemployees re the safest in the Northeast and among the safest in the \nnation. Under ordinary working conditions, these achievements would be \nimpressive. When you consider the bone chilling cold and seemingly \nrelentless snows of these past few months, these achievements are even \nmore remarkable and indicative of the dedication and commitment of New \nHampshire's Postal employees.\n  While the New Hampshire District of the United States Postal Service \nhas always been among the national leaders in serving and satisfying \ntheir customers, I want to publicly thank each of New Hampshire's 4,000 \nPostal employees for their tireless efforts, especially over these past \nfew months: the employees are the processing and distribution plants \nwho made sure that the mail was ready for timely dispatch despite the \nconcelled flights and closed roads caused by the inclement weather, the \nmaintenance people who kept the sorting machines running efficiently as \nwell as the employees who maintained the vehicles so that mail could be \ntransported safely and on time; letter carriers that withstood the \ncold, brutal weather and traversed through mountains of snow to provide \ndelivery to their customers; and the clerks in the post offices who \ncheerfully greeted customers and gladly handed over mail rendered \nundeliverable in areas with impassible roads.\n  I also would like to give a well-deserved thank you to the postal \ncustomers in our great state who worked so hard to maintain safe access \nto their mail receptacles. Clearly, mail service this past winter was a \nteam effort requiring patience and cooperation among and between Postal \nemployees and New Hampshire's Postal customers. Once again, New \nHampshire's hardy residents and Postal employees delivered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/19/senate-section/article/S3988-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING THE LOUISVILLE BALLET\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I have the privilege and honor of \nrising today to recognize the Louisville Ballet, the State Ballet of \nKentucky. Last week, this organization celebrated its 50th anniversary \nin the performing arts. This occasion was marked by special \nperformances and educational events throughout the week.\n  This company originally started as a civic ballet company, performing \non a production-by-production basis. It was not until 1975, when eight \ndancers were hired as an ensemble company, that the company achieved \nprofessional recognition and status. Now, 50 years later, the \nLouisville Ballet employs over 30 dancers, occupies the award-winning \nLouisville Ballet Center, administers the Louisville Ballet School, and \nreaches over 100,000 people every year. Their reputation for excellence \nin the arts drew the world-famous dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov to perform \nwith the company for two seasons during the late seventies.\n  In addition to bringing excellence in performing arts to thousands of \nballet fans, the company takes immense pride in its educational \noutreach programs offered to students. Through in-school, in-theater, \nand in-studio programs, students gain a behind-the-scenes glimpse of \nthe ballet world, from early production planning basics to viewing a \nlive performance. More importantly, these programs emphasize the \nimportance of physical activity and positive self-esteem.\n  I appreciate the tradition of excellence created by the Louisville \nBallet Company and their efforts to reach out to communities. Please \njoin me in congratulating artistic director Mr. Bruce Simpson and the \nLouisville Ballet Company and wishing them another wonderful 50 years \nand beyond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/19/senate-section/article/S3988-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3988-S3989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MATTHEW R. DUKSA, SR.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the life \nof Matthew R. Duksa, Sr., a Connecticut businessman who passed away on \nNovember 28, 2002. Mr. Duksa, known as ``Mattie'' to many of his \nfriends, was born and raised on Oak Bluff Farm, his family's dairy farm \nin Southington, CT. He graduated from Lewis High School and then \nattended the Cheshire Academy and the Connecticut College of Commerce \nin New Haven. Later, he graduated Magna Cum Laude from the McAllister \nSchool of Embalming in New York.\n  In 1949, Mattie opened the Borawski-Duksa Funeral Home in New \nBritain, CT and began a career providing comfort to families in their \ndarkest hours. In 1952, he established the Newington Memorial Funeral \nHome in Newington, CT. He served as president of both firms until his \ndeath this past November.\n  Too often we think of community service as some immediate, \nextraordinary act or some heroic event. But communities are shaped by \nthe daily routines and simple acts of kindness and respect that \ncitizens display each\n\n[[Page S3989]]\n\nday. Men like Mattie Duksa--who do difficult jobs that need to be \ndone--help to define and reinforce the values of our communities. The \nbusinesses they run and the lives they lead affect us all for the \nbetter.\n  Outside his business, Mattie had a well-developed sense of civic \nduty. He was a Newington volunteer firefighter for 16 years. He served \nas Director of the Newington Volunteer Ambulance Company. He was \nChairman of West Meadow Cemetery Expansion and Building Committee. And \nhe was a proud member of the Organization of Polish Businessmen.\n  The communities he served came to rely on Mattie's gentle \nunderstanding and his spirit. In 1997, the Newington Chamber of \nCommerce named Mattie ``Business Person of the Year.'' In 2002, the \nfuneral homes he founded were honored as ``Family Business of the \nYear'' by the University of Connecticut Family Business Program.\n  Mattie and his lifetime of service to his community will be missed, \nbut remembered fondly by those who knew him and benefitted from his \nmany contributions. I extend my sympathies to his wife Dottie, his son \nMatthew, his daughter Diana Duksa-Kurz, and his grandchildren James, \nKristy, Johanna, and Jacqueline.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/19/senate-section/article/S3989-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING MSGT KATHERINE BARTON\n\n Mr. BURNS.

She \nrecently retired from the Wilford Hall Medical Center at Lackland Air \nForce Base, in San Antonio, TX.\n  Katherine Barton grew up on air force bases all over the country, \nmoving every few years as her father, Lt. Col. William C. Flannigan, \nwas promoted and reassigned. She enlisted in the Air Force in 1979 and \nbegan her distinguished Air Force career as a police officer. In \nsubsequent years she became a supervisor in medical administration, \nwhere she continued to perform her duties in an outstanding manner, as \nwell as earning her bachelor's degree in History from the University of \nHouston.\n  MSgt. Katherine Barton's service includes Active Duty assignments in \nNew York and Texas, National Guard assignments in Vermont and Texas, \nand Air Force Reserve assignments in Louisiana and Texas.\n  MSgt. Katherine Barton and her husband, Keith, are the proud parents \nof three sons. Like most military families, Keith's support has been \ninstrumental in Katherine's service to her country.\n  While in the Reserves, MSgt. Katherine Barton has been activated in \ntime of war, not once, but twice; in January 1991 for the gulf war and \nagain in October 2001 for the war on terror. When she was needed most, \nMSgt. Katherine Barton left her job as a teacher, the comforts of her \nhome, and the arms of a loving family to serve her country.\n  Madam President, I congratulate MSgt. Katherine Barton for her 20 \nyears of service to our great Nation. Her contributions to the U.S. Air \nForce and to all Americans she protected will not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/19/senate-section/article/S3989-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3989-S3990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DAIMLERCHRYSLER\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I wanted to share with my colleagues \nthe text of a speech delivered by Jurgen E. Schrempp, chairman of the \nBoard of Management DaimlerChrysler AG, on December 2, 2002, at an \nevent sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \nI had the honor and privilege of introducing Mr. Schrempp at this \nevent, and I hope his insights about the automotive industry and about \ninternational trade will be helpful as we, as a nation, work to \nstrengthen our economy.\n  The speech follows.\n\n                     The Transatlantic Partnership\n\n       1. Introduction--Senator Lugar, Excellencies, Honored \n     guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, Thank you for your warm \n     welcome. Senator, may I offer my special thanks for your \n     thoughtful and gracious introduction. Your remarks are deeply \n     appreciated, coming as they do from a world leader in the \n     field of foreign affairs. I would also like to thank the good \n     people from the Center for Strategic and International \n     Studies--and specifically Simon Serfaty--for their hard work \n     in making this conference such a success. The value of the \n     CSIS in facilitating dialogue about what route Europe and \n     America should follow, to fulfill their joint destiny, is \n     immeasurable. It's a great pleasure--and a privilege--for me \n     to be with you today. It is also an opportunity to talk about \n     an important, visceral part of my life. That is the \n     relationship between Europe and the United States.\n       2. A personal view of the United States--I have a very \n     personal view of this connection. My first real contact with \n     America came during the early eighties. I had been appointed \n     chief executive of Euclid, a Daimler-Benz subsidiary \n     operating out of Cleveland, Ohio. The company produced really \n     heavy-duty trucks. And it was my first really heavy-duty job \n     with Daimler-Benz. In this two-year period: I discovered the \n     bottomless hospitality of the American people. I discovered \n     the extent to which my body could produce adrenaline. I came \n     to grips with the reality of America's leadership in world \n     affairs. And I became very aware of our crucial transatlantic \n     links! Links in which DaimlerChrysler now has an extremely \n     healthy self-interest! DaimlerChrysler is, after all, the \n     most significant German-American company.\n       3. America's role in Europe--From my perspective, the \n     positive impact of American actions on Europe is central in \n     much of what we, as Europeans, have become. One of the \n     highest points I can recall was the role played by the 41st \n     President of the United States, and his team, in unifying \n     Germany. And, of course, ending the Cold War. Never forget: \n     It was the Americans who stood in the vanguard against \n     European communism. From thousands of kilometers away across \n     the Atlantic! I was certainly not surprised. America's warmth \n     and friendship has been a given for a long time. America \n     helped to establish the Berlin relief-corridor after the war. \n     It put in place the Marshall Plan to rehabilitate Europe. And \n     its contribution to the wider freedoms now enjoyed by \n     Europeans has been enormous.\n       4. The high stakes of alienating the EU from the US--Ladies \n     and Gentlemen, Stakes are high in the complex areas of \n     business and political diplomacy. Especially for the United \n     States and Europe. More than anything, our priority must be \n     to establish truths about one another and build on these. One \n     such truth is that we are totally wedded to the cause of \n     democracy. We are also inextricably bound together by the \n     cause of those freedoms that define our civilization. These \n     are the values that mark us as prime custodians of the free \n     world. These are the values for which we are prepared to \n     fight!\n       5. Commercial interdependence is the key--But it is not \n     only these strong emotional ties that underpin the \n     transatlantic bridge. Our commercial interdependence is a \n     vital part of that bridge's structure. The United States and \n     the European Union enjoy the world's most significant \n     commercial relationship. They are, quite simply, each other's \n     largest trade and investment partners. Together the United \n     States and the EU account for 40 percent of world GDP as well \n     as 80 percent of global foreign direct investment. It \n     requires very little analysis to establish that this joint \n     relationship is essential. Yet we now need to face a sudden \n     and strange reality. The exceptional goodwill characterizing \n     our historic links is being tested. Quite seriously, I might \n     add.\n       6. The DaimlerChrysler example of excellent US/European \n     relations--In this regard I have a real sense of deja vu. \n     Mainly because of my experience at DaimlerChrysler! This \n     merger offers the best example of outstanding transatlantic \n     relations I can think of. Why do I say this? Well, shortly \n     after the deal, global automotive markets began to \n     deteriorate. The highly acclaimed ``Merger of the Century'' \n     was suddenly under fire. But we stayed calm. We were patient. \n     We held our course. Above all, we believed in ourselves. We \n     had an unshakable sense that we should not meet operational \n     challenges by changing our well-defined strategy. And, by the \n     way, why should we have done so? Mercedes-Benz, the most \n     valuable automotive brand in the world, remains the ultimate \n     benchmark in the luxury segment. Our Commercial Vehicle \n     Division was--and is--by some margin, the world's market \n     leader in trucks, vans and buses. Therefore, we were able to \n     focus on our main operational challenge. That was to \n     implement our turnaround plan at Chrysler. Since then our \n     phenomenal team in Auburn Hills has made outstanding \n     progress. As a result, Chrysler Group earnings for the full-\n     year 2002 will reflect a real turnaround. And on this score, \n     I believe the empowering union of German and American \n     interests was a critical factor. It prevented a deeper \n     financial crisis--similar to those experienced at Chrysler in \n     1979 and 1991--from occurring. And Chrysler now enjoys the \n     same access to credit markets as the rest of our group. \n     Bearing in mind what happened before, I'm sure many Americans \n     have recently breathed a huge sigh of relief!\n       7. The practical results of amalgamating Daimler-Benz and \n     Chrysler--You may ask how we turned the corner. Firstly, we \n     combined the very best of our American and German heritages. \n     Then we unlocked the vast potential of our joint experience \n     by working with extraordinary commitment--and loyalty--to one \n     another! I can say with considerable pride that since the \n     merger we have built an enterprise in which America and \n     Germany can have great confidence. We have harmonized \n     processes. We have exchanged components, engines and \n     transmissions and other commodities. For example, we decided\n\n[[Page S3990]]\n\n     that state-of-the-art five-speed automatic Mercedes-Benz \n     transmission units would be manufactured in Kokomo, Indiana--\n     Senator Lugar's home state! It was also decided that, for the \n     benefit of our customers, these units would go into Chrysler \n     vehicles. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. This \n     investment is only part of a 30 to 40 billion dollar, five-\n     year investment plan for North America. It's a plan that will \n     offer optimal security for more than 100,000 employees, well \n     into the future! I should add that, very selectively, we \n     already share expertise and technology for different \n     products. The new Chrysler Crossfire will be the first highly \n     visible result of this policy. It is a breathtaking coupe. \n     With great American design and Mercedes components. The \n     Crossfire will hit the markets next year. At the point \n     where--as we like to say--Route 66 meets the Autobahn. But \n     what we have built together also has substantial global \n     implications. We are now able to develop crucial interests in \n     Asia. Our significant Japanese investment in Mitsubishi \n     Motors and our stake in Hyundai of South Korea are such \n     interests. So is the dynamic commercial vehicle business \n     we are building in the region. Yet this is not all. China \n     has moved into the frame as well. Soon we will have a \n     meaningful, viable operation there. Which is why we can \n     say with pride that ours is a truly global company.\n       8. Lessons from the DCX experience--Ladies and gentlemen, I \n     would like to share with you what tough times have taught our \n     great company. We have learned one of life's fundamental \n     truths. That success and happiness depend to a great degree \n     on an ability to confront and solve problems. Or challenges, \n     as I prefer to call them. Another fact is absolutely clear to \n     me. Today's positive results have come because Americans and \n     Europeans resolved to capitalize on their differences. We did \n     not succumb to them. We learned a third important lesson \n     during the recovery process. Successful relationships need \n     time for constant review and reaffirmation. Right now, I \n     believe this is of wider and special significance. And, in \n     this context, I feel a strong need for a constructive ``time \n     out'' in the debate on relations between the US and Europe. \n     There is currently far too much heat and far too little light \n     on the subject! We need to regroup!\n       9. Potential points of dispute--Before we can do that, \n     however, we have to concede that differences have arisen. The \n     first area of conflict concerns trade. We are predominantly a \n     transatlantic company. But trade restrictions imposed on \n     either side of the Atlantic sometimes have really negative \n     results! I think, for example, of US steel tariffs, and EU \n     penalties in response to the FSC decision. We are simply \n     caught in the crossfire. And our customers as well as \n     employees pay the price. But my purpose in mentioning this is \n     not to apportion blame. It is simply to note that trade \n     restrictions do more harm than good. I therefore agree with \n     the recent statement by President Bush that there is a need \n     to remove tariffs. And non-tariff-based trade barriers. I \n     hasten to add. Let's hope the leaders in charge of trade \n     issues go down this road! There is a second front on which \n     policy differences are always aired. The conflicting views of \n     Europe and the US on global environmental matters have \n     developed into a hot topic. Finally, geopolitical issues have \n     arisen around national security and defense commitments. \n     These discordant views are not restricted to partisan \n     arguments. There are also internal disagreements--on both \n     sides of the Atlantic. And, once again, most differences tend \n     to be about procedure and the degree to which action is \n     implemented. Fundamental objectives are seldom in dispute.\n       10. The need for openness and honesty--However, the problem \n     seems to be systemic. And in the process, concerns that \n     originate from fear have also emerged. Fear that unilateral \n     rather than multi-lateral action could be taken to secure \n     world peace. I think particularly of polarized policies on \n     Iraq. But I don't want to go into detail on that. I simply \n     want to make one point. Among great friends, such as the US \n     and Europe, we are able to discuss differing views with \n     complete honesty. In the same vein, however, we should do \n     this face-to-face, and privately.\n       11. Call to intensify result-driven dialogue between the \n     two continents--On the public front there is plenty of talk. \n     Talk about how to revive transatlantic initiatives. But there \n     is nothing that remotely resembles implementation. Let's get \n     past the pussy footing! It's time for meaningful engagement \n     and visible, tangible results. However, this will only come \n     from blunt, hard-nosed implementation! In 1998, I found \n     myself chairing the European section of the Transatlantic \n     Business Dialogue. The TABD was the brainchild of the late \n     Secretary of Commerce, Ron Brown and the former European \n     Commissioner, Martin Bangemann. Founded in 1995, it was \n     initially accepted by CEOs on both sides of the Atlantic with \n     some enthusiasm. I'm even able to say that we achieved some \n     encouraging results. But this organization, in its present \n     form, has been allowed to stagnate. What we now need is \n     dynamic interchange between the two continents. And such a \n     process must take place with mutual commitment and \n     enthusiasm from its transatlantic participants. \n     Particularly herby on the political side. I undertake \n     today that DaimlerChrysler will pursue any initiative \n     along these lines. Provided it leads to sensible, \n     intensified and result-driven work between us.\n       12. To keep the TABD or introduce a new process--At the \n     very least, we need to reinvent the TABD. Or it may be \n     preferable to start afresh. One thing is certain, however. We \n     need to engage a dynamic group of leaders who should \n     represent politics and business. They must select and tackle \n     important as well as relevant issues. And they must be \n     totally committed to the process of implementation. People \n     who are prepared to roll up their sleeves and get stuck into \n     things! People with a can-do attitude! People not afraid of \n     breaking new ground! People of passion!\n       13. The need for a highly principled, organized mission--\n     Such a body would be the best platform from which to proceed. \n     And build on what the U.S. and Europe have thus far \n     accomplished together. Which is an extraordinary amount! Take \n     the multilateral institutions that have served us so well \n     over the last 50 years. NATO, the IMF, the World Bank, the \n     World Trade Organization, and the United Nations are among \n     them! Quite clearly, their historic achievements signify an \n     important reality. Now, with the Cold War consigned \n     permanently to the deep freeze, some argue that we no longer \n     have a really big issue to unite us. That instead we hassle \n     over petty details. So I believe we have to find a new, \n     highly principled mission. One that binds our two regions \n     even more closely together! A mission that captures our \n     imagination! Along with the hearts and minds of our global \n     constituencies! In this connection, there are highly complex \n     tasks ahead of us.\n       14. The priorities of corporations and governments--I refer \n     to the finding of effective solutions for what Kofi Annan \n     calls ``problems without passports.'' This will demand \n     unusual levels of organization! It will also require great \n     determination--and dedicated focus. For instance, we have to \n     find common cause in the war against terror. But this should \n     primarily be directed at preventive action. Never again can \n     the infamy of September 11 be repeated. Joint intelligence \n     sharing and cooperation on the gathering of financial \n     intelligence would be a good start. Another constructive step \n     would be close cooperation on important initiatives like the \n     Nunn-Lugar program. This program is crucial. It offers \n     safeguards against nuclear and scientific material in the \n     former Soviet Union falling into the wrong hands. We \n     generally need to create fresh initiatives to neutralize any \n     other nuclear, biological and chemical agents of destruction. \n     But we need to step up investment in such programs, as well. \n     A second goal must be to bring democracy and economic \n     development to regions that have known too little of both. We \n     need sustainable development to lift people out of poverty \n     and abject subsistence. After all, half the world lives on $2 \n     dollars a day--or less!\n       15. The need to safeguard and, where necessary, to rebuild \n     civil society--Last year I called for a concerted \n     international effort to rebuild civil society in broken \n     countries like Afghanistan. I repeat that call today. And I \n     do so because dysfunctional countries are much more of a \n     drain on global resources than those that operate \n     efficiently. We must therefore heed the lessons of the past. \n     The investment made in rebuilding Europe has been more than \n     repaid. In hard currency. In the fruits of stability. And--\n     together with the United States--in the development of the \n     most powerful alliance of nations the world has seen. Only \n     through this alliance will we be able to deal with problems \n     that threaten mankind.\n       16. Problems that endanger the human race--One such \n     diabolical problem is the spread of the HI Virus and AIDS. \n     More than 45 million people worldwide are currently infected \n     with the virus and face a painful, degrading death. In my \n     beloved South Africa this involves 25 percent of the \n     population! At DaimlerChrysler, combating the AIDS pandemic \n     is a priority. It's a priority recognized by the Global \n     Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS. In June this year, at a \n     function in New York, they acknowledged our tremendous South \n     African HIV/AIDS program. And when Kofi Annan handed me their \n     much-coveted award--for Excellence in the Workplace--I was \n     very proud indeed. At the same time I was appointed Chairman \n     of the Global Business Coalition. I welcomed this assignment \n     with a sense of humility--and urgency. For fighting this \n     dread disease--and dealing with the other problems I have \n     mentioned--represent the real challenges of humanity. It's \n     therefore high time to stop playing in the shallow end of our \n     global pool. We need to dive deep! But it is patently obvious \n     that the partnership, between the U.S. and EU is pivotal to \n     any prospect of real success. Together, we hold the key to \n     the health and wealth of the global economy. And that, Ladies \n     and Gentlemen, is an awesome responsibility.\n       17. Conclusion--We may, realistically, not be able to do \n     everything. But over the past 50 years, Europe and the U.S. \n     have changed the face of the planet. Very much for the \n     better! As partners, I'd back us as winners all over again. \n     Our common ground is solid and fertile. The challenges are \n     irresistible. The need for unity is more essential than ever. \n     The urgency that demands immediate engagement between us is \n     white-hot. And the time for a solemn pledge of trust in one \n     another is precisely right. I thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/19/senate-section/article/S3990-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3990-S3991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WALLY CONERLY DAY\n\n Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto recognize and honor an outstanding citizen of Mississippi. On March \n5, 2003, Governor Ronnie Musgrove signed a proclamation declaring March \n19, 2003 to be\n\n[[Page S3991]]\n\nofficially known as Wally Conerly Day in the State of Mississippi.\n  Dr. A. Wallace Conerly recently retired from the positions of Vice \nChancellor for Health Affairs and Dean of the School of Medicine at the \nUniversity of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson.\n  I have worked closely with Dr. Conerly since he was appointed Dean of \nthe School of Medicine, and I am both proud and grateful that \nMississippians can claim Dr. Conerly as one of our own.\n  While I could spend hours going over Dr. Conerly's record of service \nand accomplishments in detail, I would like to take a few moments to \ntouch on some of the highlights that are most impressive to me. Dr. \nConerly has served as a faculty member of the University of Mississippi \nMedical Center for the past 30 years. He assumed an appointment as \nAssistant Vice Chancellor for Health Affairs in 1981 before being \nappointed as Vice Chancellor for Health Affairs and Dean of the School \nof Medicine in 1994.\n  As the chief executive officer of the State's only academic health \nsciences center, he leads an institution that employs more than 7200 \npeople and has an annual budget of more than $610 million. He is also \nthe chief architect of the Medical Center's ongoing expansion program, \nthe largest in the history of Mississippi higher education. Phase I, \ncompleted in 1999 and totaling $211 million, included a new children's \nhospital, a new women and infant's hospital, a building for the School \nof Health-Related Professions, an addition to the School of Nursing, a \nstudent union, two parking garages and an imaging center. A second $124 \nmillion construction phase is currently underway and includes a \ncritical care hospital, a new adult hospital, a classroom addition, a \nchildren's hospital addition, and an expansion to the Arthur C. Guyton \nResearch Complex. It has been my honor to work with Dr. Conerly in \nsupport of this ambitious endeavor.\n  Dr. Conerly has served not only the medical community of Mississippi \nhonorably, but also the United States Air Force. For his service, he \nwas the recipient of the United States Air Force Flight Surgeon of the \nYear Award in 1962 and the United States Air Force Commendation Medal \nin 1963. He was honorably discharged in 1966 at the rank of major.\n  As you might imagine, Dr. Conerly is also active in the Jackson \ncommunity. He has served on the Board of Directors of the American Red \nCross, Mississippi Chapter, and the Capital Area United Way. He has \nbeen President of the Rotary Club of Jackson and Chairman of the Board \nof Governors of the University Club. In 2001 the Mississippi Division \nof the Multiple Sclerosis Society honored Dr. Conerly and the Medical \nCenter with its 2001 Hope Award, an award given annually for \noutstanding community contributions. He also received Millsaps \nCollege's ``Alumnus of the Year'' award in 2002, and he and his wife \nwere recognized as the 2002 People of Vision by Preserve Sight \nMississippi.\n  As I am sure you can see, Dr. Conerly has distinguished himself both \npersonally and professionally, and he has been a valued asset to \nMississippi. His record of service is not only a testament to his \nprofessional skill, but also to the quality of his personal character. \nHe is most deserving of having this day named in honor of him, and I \nfelt it was appropriate that I share this brief record of his \ncontributions to Mississippi with all of you here today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/19/senate-section/article/S3991-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/19/senate-section/article/S3991-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/19/senate-section/article/S3991-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PERIODIC REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO NATIONAL \n    UNION FOR THE TOTAL INDEPENDENCE OF ANGOLA (UNITA) DECLARED IN \n           EXECUTIVE ORDER 12865 OF SEPTEMBER 26, 1993--PM 25\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), I am providing a 6-month report \nprepared by my Administration on the national emergency with respect to \nthe National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) that \nwas declared in Executive Order 12865 of September 26, 1993.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to provide for \nDepartment of Defense funding of continuation of health benefits plan \ncoverage for certain Reserves called or ordered to active duty and \ntheir dependents, and for other purposes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to close an \nunfortunate loophole in health insurance coverage for families of \nreserve and guard members who are called up for active duty.\n  As we face the likelihood of war with Iraq, one hundred and fifty \nthousand members of the National Guard and the Reserves have been \nmobilized for service. These soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen are \nstanding by their country in a time of national emergency. But unless \nthe Congress takes immediate action, too many of the spouses and \nchildren of these brave men and women may find the quality of their \nhealth care reduced.\n  Today's military relies more heavily than ever before on the reserve \nand guard. Currently, over 150,000 National Guard and reserve soldiers, \nsailors, Marines and airmen have been mobilized. They are spending an \naverage of thirteen times longer on active duty today than compared to \na decade ago.\n  Our men and women in uniform are working and training hard for the \nserious challenges before them. They are living in the desert, enduring \nharsh conditions, and contemplating the horrors of the approaching war. \nAt the same time, they must put their lives on hold, dealing with \nfamily crises by phone and email. We must do our best to take care of \nthose they have left at home.\n  During the Vietnam War, only 20 percent of all Army personnel were \nmarried. Today over 50 percent of the active military are married. \nThese numbers are even higher in the guard and reserves. This service \nplaces heavy strain on the families who are left behind to worry and \ncope with the sudden new demands of running a household alone.\n  For the guard and reservists' families, a recall to active duty \nbrings new bureaucratic challenges. Employers are not required to keep \npaying the health insurance for reservists while they are deployed. \nMany guardsmen and reservists may not be able to afford to pay for \nhealth care for their families while they are away.\n  If a guardsman or reservist is activated for more than thirty days, \ntheir family is eligible to enroll in the TRICARE program. However, \nduring that first month, the family may not have any health insurance. \nIn addition, if their family doctor does not participate in TRICARE, \nthe family must find a new doctor while coping with all the other \ndemands of the service member's absence. A family with a sick child and \na father or mother sent off to war should not have to cope with the \nadded burden of giving up the family doctor they trust.\n  The bill I am introducing will assure continuity of health insurance \ncoverage for families of reservists and National Guard personnel called \nto active duty. Under this bill, these families retain the option of \nprivate health insurance coverage during the period of active duty, \nrather than enrolling in TRICARE.\n  The bill amends the COBRA coverage rules to specify that loss of \nemployment-based coverage due to active-duty allows them to use the \nCOBRA mechanism to retain their health care coverage. The Federal \nGovernment will pay the cost of premiums not covered by employers. This \nassistance will relieve some of the financial burden on families when \nthe service member leaves a more lucrative private sector job to serve \nin the military. The Federal Government will also pay the cost of \ncontinuing family coverage purchased in the individual insurance \nmarket, for those who do not have employment-based coverage.\n  The cost of this modest additional help for the families of our \nservicemen will be small, since spouses and children who continue to \nuse their private insurance policies will not be using TRICARE medical \nservices that would otherwise be the government's responsibility.\n  This bill will not change the health care coverage for service \nmembers who will continue to receive health care\n\n[[Page S3996]]\n\nthrough the military medical system. Nor will it change the health care \ncoverage for active duty family members who retain TRICARE eligibility \nand receive health care either through the direct care system or \nTRICARE network.\n  When reservists and members of the National Guard are called to \nactive duty in time of international crisis, they are asked to put \ntheir lives on the line for their country. The least we can do for them \nis assure that their families can continue to receive quality health \ncare without interruption during their absence.\n  I urge my colleagues to move promptly to enact this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 647\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to extend the authority for Energy Savings Performance \nContracts and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will ensure the continuation of a program that has provided a \nflexible and cost-effective way to reduce the Federal Government's \nenergy bills.\n  Since the 1970's Federal Government agencies have been required by \nlaw or Executive Order to steadily improve the energy efficiency of \nFederal buildings. For example, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 set a \ngoal of reducing energy use per square foot by 20 percent in FY 2000 \ncompared to FY 1985. Preliminary data from the Department of Energy \nindicates that agencies exceeded this goal by 2.7 percent and spent \n$2.3 billion less for energy in FY 2000 than in FY 1985.\n  One of the reasons the Federal Government was successful was the \navailability of an innovative financing method for energy efficiency \nimprovements. In the 1992 Energy Policy Act, Congress created Energy \nSavings Performance Contracting ESPC, which offered a way to invest in \nenergy savings improvements at no capital cost to the government by \nleveraging private sector capital.\n  Under the ESPC authority, private sector companies enter into \ncontracts with Federal agencies to install energy savings equipment and \nmake operational or maintenance changes to improve building efficiency. \nThe companies pay the up-front costs of the energy efficiency \nimprovements and guarantee the agency a fixed amount of cost savings \nthrough the life of the contract. The energy service company recoups \nits investment over time from the energy cost savings. Since 1992, \nnearly $1.1 billion in private sector capital has been invested in \nFederal energy improvement projects under ESPCs resulting in hundreds \nof millions of dollars in permanent savings to the US taxpayer.\n  Unfortunately the authority for this successful program expires at \nthe end of September 2003. Congress must act quickly to continue ESPC \nauthority.\n  Our legislation would extend the authority for the ESPC program \npermanently. The bill also makes several changes designed to improve \nand expand the program. It adds ``water cost savings'' as an allowable \nmeasure for Energy Savings Performance Contracting for civilian \nagencies, as they have been for Department of Defense facilities for \nseveral years.\n  The legislation also addresses the problem of improving energy \nefficiency in a building that has long since passed its useful life and \nis in constant need of maintenance and repair. To prevent this waste of \nfunds, the legislation\n\n[[Page S3997]]\n\nwould allow Energy Savings Performance Contracting to include the \nsavings anticipated from operation and maintenance efficiencies of a \nreplacement facility. The Department of Energy conducted a feasibility \nstudy for replacing a complex of 50 year old army barracks in my \nState--now used as DOE's Albuquerque operations office. The study \ndemonstrated that the costs savings created by energy, operations and \nmaintenance efficiencies of a new replacement building can pay for the \nnew facility.\n  These provisions were agreed to last fall by the House and Senate \nconference committee on the Energy Policy Act of 2002. They are good \npolicy for energy efficiency and for the Federal taxpayer.\n  In addition, our bill would authorize a pilot program to determine \nwhether the ESPC concept can be applied to non-building projects. About \n60 percent of the Federal Government's energy consumption occurs in \ngovernment vehicles, cars, trucks, ships and air craft. Another 7 \npercent occurs in energy intensive operations such as irrigation, \nmanufacturing and research activities. Increased efficiency for these \nactivities could yield tremendous savings.

A bill to prohibit civil liability actions from being brought \nor continued against manufacturers, distributors, dealers, or importers \nof firearms or ammunition for damages resulting from the misuse of \ntheir products by others; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Baucus in \nintroducing the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, on behalf of \nourselves and more than half of our colleagues in the United States \nSenate: Senators Alexander, Allard, Allen, Bennett, Bond, Breaux, \nBrownback, Bunning, Burns, Campbell, Chambliss, Cochran, Coleman, \nCollins, Cornyn, Crapo, Dole, Domenici, Dorgan, Ensign, Enzi, Frist, \nGraham of South Carolina, Grassley, Gregg, Hagel, Hatch, Hutchison, \nInhofe, Johnson, Kyl, Landrieu, Lincoln, Lott, McConnell, Miller, \nMurkowski, Nelson of Nebraska, Nickles, Reid, Roberts, Santorum, \nSessions, Shelby, Smith, Specter, Stevens, Sununu, Talent, and Thomas.\n  This is an extraordinary showing of support for a bill, and I believe \nit is a testament to the gravity of the threat addressed by the \nlegislation: the abuse of our courts through lawsuits filed to force \nlaw-abiding businesses to pay for criminal acts by individuals beyond \ntheir control.\n  The businesses I am talking about are collectively known as the U.S. \nfirearms industry. The lawsuits in question claim that even though \nthese businesses comply with all laws and sell a legitimate product, \nthey should be responsible for the misuse or illegal use of the firearm \nby a criminal. These actions are pursued with the intent of driving \nthis industry out of business, regardless of the thousands of jobs that \nwould be lost in the process and the impact on citizens across the \nNation who would never contemplate committing a crime with a gun.\n  Let me be clear about this. These lawsuits are not brought by \nindividuals seeking relief for injuries done to them by anyone in the \nindustry. Instead, this is a politically-inspired initiative trying to \nforce social goals through an end-run around the Congress and state \nlegislatures.\n  The theory on which these lawsuits are based would be laughable, if \nit weren't so dangerous: to pin the responsibility for a criminal act \non an innocent party who wasn't there and had nothing to do with it. \nThey argue that merely by virtue of the fact that a gun was present, \nthose who were part of the commercial distribution chain should be held \nresponsible for the gun's misuse.\n  This isn't a legal theory--it's just the latest twist in the gun \ncontrollers' notion that it's the gun, and not the criminal, that \ncauses crime.\n  The truth of the matter is that there are millions of firearms in \nthis country today, yet only a tiny fraction of them have ever been \nused in the commission of a crime. The truth of the matter is that \nagain and again, law-abiding firearm owners are using their guns, often \nwithout even firing a shot, to defend life and property. The truth of \nthe matter is that the intent of the user, not the gun, is what \ndetermines whether that gun will be used in a crime. The trend of \nabusive litigation targeting the firearms industry not only defies \ncommon sense and concepts of fundamental fairness, but it would do \nnothing to curb criminal gun violence. Furthermore, the burdens it \nseeks to impose would jeopardize Americans' constitutionally-protected \naccess to firearms for self defense and other lawful uses.\n  The bill that more than half of the United States Senate has already \nendorsed is a measured response that would put a stop to this abusive \ntrend without endangering legitimate claims for relief. Let me \nemphasize that it does not insulate the firearms industry from all \nlawsuits or deprive legitimate victims of their day in court, as some \ncritics have charged. Indeed, it specifically provides that actions \nbased on the wrongful conduct of those involved in the business of \nmanufacturing and selling firearms--breaches of contract, defects in \nfirearms, negligent entrustment, criminal behavior--would not be \naffected by this legislation. It is solely directed at stopping \nfrivolous, politically-driven litigation against law-abiding \nindividuals for the misbehavior of criminals over whom they had no \ncontrol.\n  The courts of our Nation are supposed to be forums for resolving \ncontroversies between citizens and providing relief where warranted, \nnot a mechanism for achieving political ends that are rejected by the \npeople's representatives in Congress and the state legislatures. I hope \nall our colleagues will join us in taking a measured, principled stand \nagainst this abusive litigation by supporting the Protection of Lawful \nCommerce In Arms Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 659\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n        This Act may be cited as the ``Protection of Lawful \n     Commerce in Arms Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Citizens have a right, protected by the Second \n     Amendment to the United States Constitution, to keep and bear \n     arms.\n       (2) Lawsuits have been commenced against manufacturers, \n     distributors, dealers, and importers of firearms that operate \n     as designed and intended, which seek money damages and other \n     relief for the harm caused by the misuse of firearms by third \n     parties, including criminals.\n       (3) The manufacture, importation, possession, sale, and use \n     of firearms and ammunition in the United States are heavily \n     regulated by Federal, State, and local laws. Such Federal \n     laws include the Gun Control Act of 1968, the National \n     Firearms Act, and the Arms Export Control Act.\n       (4) Businesses in the United States that are engaged in \n     interstate and foreign commerce through the lawful design, \n     manufacture, marketing, distribution, importation, or sale to \n     the public of firearms or ammunition that has been shipped or \n     transported in interstate or foreign commerce are not, and \n     should not, be liable for the harm caused by those who \n     criminally or unlawfully misuse firearm products or \n     ammunition products that function as designed and intended.\n       (5) The possibility of imposing liability on an entire \n     industry for harm that is solely caused by others is an abuse \n     of the legal system, erodes public confidence in our Nation's \n     laws, threatens the diminution of a basic constitutional \n     right and civil liberty, invites the disassembly and \n     destabilization of other industries and economic sectors \n     lawfully competing in the free enterprise system of the \n     United States, and constitutes an unreasonable burden on \n     interstate and foreign commerce of the United States.\n       (6) The liability actions commenced or contemplated by the \n     Federal Government, States, municipalities, and private \n     interest groups are based on theories without foundation in \n     hundreds of years of the common law and jurisprudence of the \n     United States and do not represent a bona fide expansion of \n     the common law. The possible sustaining of these actions by a \n     maverick judicial officer or petit jury would expand civil \n     liability in a manner never contemplated by the framers of \n     the Constitution, by Congress, or by the legislatures of the \n     several States. Such an expansion of liability would \n     constitute a deprivation of the rights, privileges, and \n     immunities guaranteed to a citizen of the United States under \n     the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To prohibit causes of action against manufacturers, \n     distributors, dealers, and importers of firearms or \n     ammunition products for the harm caused by the criminal or \n     unlawful misuse of firearm products or ammunition products by \n     others when the product functioned as designed and intended.\n       (2) To preserve a citizen's access to a supply of firearms \n     and ammunition for all lawful purposes, including hunting, \n     self-defense, collecting, and competitive or recreational \n     shooting.\n       (3) To guarantee a citizen's rights, privileges, and \n     immunities, as applied to the States, under the Fourteenth \n     Amendment to the United States Constitution, pursuant to \n     section 5 of that Amendment.\n\n[[Page S3999]]\n\n       (4) To prevent the use of such lawsuits to impose \n     unreasonable burdens on interstate and foreign commerce.\n       (5) To protect the right, under the First Amendment to the \n     Constitution, of manufacturers, distributors, dealers, and \n     importers of firearms or ammunition products, and trade \n     associations, to speak freely, to assemble peaceably, and to \n     petition the Government for a redress of their grievances.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON BRINGING OF QUALIFIED CIVIL LIABILITY \n                   ACTIONS IN FEDERAL OR STATE COURT.\n\n       (a) In General.--A qualified civil liability action may not \n     be brought in any Federal or State court.\n       (b) Dismissal of Pending Actions.--A qualified civil \n     liability action that is pending on the date of enactment of \n     this Act shall be immediately dismissed by the court in which \n     the action was brought.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nin introducing the Commuter Benefits Equity Act of 2003. This measure \nis another important step forward in our efforts to make transit \nservices more accessible and improve the quality of life for commuters \nthroughout the Nation.\n  All across the Nation, congestion and gridlock are taking their toll \nin terms of economic loss, environmental impacts, and personal \nfrustration. According to the Texas Transportation Institute, in 2000, \nAmericans in 75 urban areas spent 3.6 billion hours stuck in traffic, \nwith an estimated cost to the Nation of $67.5 billion in lost time and \nwasted fuel, and the problem is growing. One way in which Federal, \nState, and local governments are responding to this problem is by \npromoting greater use of transit as a commuting option. The American \nPublic Transportation Association estimates that last year, Americans \ntook over 9.5 billion trips on transit, the highest level in more than \n40 years. But we need to do more to encourage people to get out of \ntheir cars and onto public transportation.\n  The Internal Revenue Code currently allows employers to provide a \ntax-free transit benefit to their employees. Under this ``Commuter \nChoice'' program, employers can set aside up to $100 per month of an \nemployee's pre-tax income to pay for the cost of commuting by public \ntransportation or vanpool. Alternatively, an employer can choose to \noffer the same amount as a tax-free benefit in addition to an \nemployee's salary. This program is designed to encourage Americans to \nleave their cars behind when commuting to work.\n  By all accounts, this program is working. In the Washington area, for \nexample, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority estimates \nthat over 200,000 commuters take advantage of transit pass programs \noffered by their employers. That means fewer cars on our congested \nstreets and highways.\n  Employees of the federal government account for a large percentage of \nthose benefitting from this program in the\n\n[[Page S4000]]\n\nWashington area. Under an Executive Order, all Federal agencies in the \nNational Capital Region, which includes Montgomery, Prince George's, \nand Frederick Counties, Maryland, as well as several counties in \nNorthern Virginia, are required to offer this transit benefit to their \nemployees. The Commuter Choice program is now being used by an \nestimated 130,000 Washington-area Federal employees who are choosing to \ntake transit to work.\n  However, despite the success of the Commuter Choice program, our tax \nlaws still reflect a bias toward driving. The Internal Revenue Code \nallows employers to offer a tax-free parking benefit to their employees \nof up to $190 per month. The striking disparity between the amount \nallowed for parking--$190 per month--and the amount allowed for \ntransit--$100 per month--undermines our commitment to supporting public \ntransportation use.\n  The Commuter Benefits Equity Act would address this discrepancy by \nraising the maximum monthly transit benefit to $190, equal to the \nparking benefit, and providing that the benefits will be adjusted \nupward together in future years. The Federal Government should not \nreward those who drive to work more richly than those who take public \ntransportation. Indeed, since the passage of the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act of 1991, Federal transportation policy \nhas endeavored to create a level playing field between highways and \ntransit, favoring neither mode above the other. The Commuter Benefits \nEquity Act would ensure that our tax laws reflect this balanced \napproach.\n  In addition, the Commuter Benefits Equity Act would remedy another \ninconsistency in current law. Private-sector employers can offer their \nemployees the transit benefit in tandem with the parking benefit, to \nhelp employees pay for the costs of parking at transit facilities, \ncommuter rail stations, or other locations which serve public \ntransportation or vanpool commuters. However, under current law, \nFederal agencies cannot offer a parking benefit to their employees who \nuse park-and-ride lots or other remote parking locations. The Commuter \nBenefits Equity Act would remove this restriction, allowing Federal \nemployees access to the same benefits enjoyed by their private-sector \ncounterparts.\n  The Washington Metropolitan Region is home to thousands of Federal \nemployees. It is also one of the Nation's most highly congested areas, \nranking fourth in per capita congestion. This area has the third \nlongest average commute time in the country. It is clearly in our \ninterest to support programs which encourage Federal employees to make \ngreater use of public transportation for their commuting needs.\n  The simple change made by the Commuter Benefits Equity Act would \nprovide a significant benefit to those Federal employees whose commute \nto work includes parking at a transit facility. For example, a commuter \nwho rides the Metrorail to work and parks at the Rockville park-and-\nride lot pays about $45 monthly for parking, on top of the cost of \nriding the train. A private-sector employee whose employer provides the \nparking benefit in addition to salary could receive $540 a year tax \nfree to help pay these parking costs. Federal government employees \nshould be allowed the same benefit.\n  I support the Commuter Benefits Equity Act because it creates \nparity--parity in the tax code between the parking and transit \nbenefits, and parity for Federal employees with their private-sector \ncounterparts. Both of these improvements will aid our efforts to fight \ncongestion and pollution by supporting public transportation. I \nencourage my colleagues to join me in supporting the Commuter Benefits \nEquity Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 662. A bill to extend to Nepal certain preferential treatment with \nrespect to apparel articles; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto grant garment imports from Nepal duty free status in the United \nStates for two years. We have an opportunity the help one of the \nworld's most impoverished countries sustain a vital export industry and \npromote political and economic stability after years of conflict.\n  My interest in Nepal goes back over 25 years and I have had the \npleasure to travel there and visit with friends on many occasions. The \nwarmth and friendliness of the people and the vitality and richness of \nthe culture are only matched by the beauty of the breathtaking \nlandscape.\n  Nevertheless, Nepal faces some serious challenges in the years ahead \nas it attempt to build a prosperous economy and raise the living \nstandards of its people.\n  It ranks as the 12th poorest country in the world, with a per capita \nincome of $240. Approximately 42 percent of the 24 million people live \nin poverty. Unemployment stands at 47 percent.\n  On top of this, Nepal has had to confront a Maoist insurgency which \nhas claimed the lives of more than 7,200 people since 1996 with two \nthirds of the deaths occurring since November 2001. Estimated to \ninclude between 5,000 and 10,000 armed soldiers, the Maoists control \nbetween one-quarter and one-half of the country.\n  As a result of the political instability, for the first time in \ntwenty years Nepal's economy contracted in 2002 by 0.6 percent and \ntourism, one of the main sources of income, fell by 27 percent. The \nsituation became so dire last year that one advisor to Nepal's king \nnoted that ``Nepal is on the verge of becoming a failed state.''\n  Yet there is reason for hope. On January 29, 2003 the Government of \nNepal and the Maoist rebels reached a cease-fire agreement, opening the \ndoor for negotiations for a permanent end to the conflict. I am hopeful \nthey will be successful. We now have the opportunity to build on the \nhopes of a peaceful solution to conflict and really make a difference \nin the lives of the Nepalese people.\n  Humanitarian and development assistance should be an important part \nof that effort. But we should also help the Nepalese help themselves \nand open the U.S. market to a critical export industry. In the end, \neconomic growth and prosperity can best be achieved when Nepal is given \nthe chance to compete and grow in a free and open global marketplace.\n  Success in that marketplace will lead to a lesser dependence on \nforeign aid and encourage Nepal to develop other viable export \nindustries.\n  Since the mid-1980s, garments have emerged as a key part of Nepal's \nmanufacturing sector. The garment industry in Nepal is entirely export \noriented and accounts for 40 percent of the foreign exchange earnings. \nIt employs over 100,000 workers half of them women and sustains the \nlivelihood of over 350,000 people. The United States is the largest \nmarket for Nepalese garments and accounts for 80-90 percent of Nepal's \ntotal exports every year.\n  Yet, despite Nepal's poverty and the importance of the garment \nindustry and the U.S. market, Nepalese garments are subject to U.S. \ntariffs of 17-35 percent. This is simply not acceptable and does harm \nto a country that can least afford it.\n  I might point out that this tariff rate is in contrast to the \nEuropean Union, Canada, and Australia which allow or will soon allow \nNepalese garments into their markets duty free.\n  The United States can make a real difference now to sustain the \ngarment industry in Nepal and promote economic growth and higher living \nstandards. My bill is simple and straightforward. It grants duty free \nstatus to imports of Nepalese garments and textiles for a two year \nperiod. This is the same status granted to participating lesser \ndeveloped countries under the African Growth and Opportunity Act.\n  For those of my colleagues who are concerned about the impact that \nduty free status for Nepalese garments and textiles would have on the \ndomestic industry, it is worth noting that Nepalese garments, at their \nhighest level, accounted for 0.1 percent of all garment and textile \nimports in the United States generating $29.5 million in revenue.\n  Nepal is, and will continue to be, a small player in the U.S. garment \nmarket, but the importance of the garment industry in Nepal compels us \nto action.\n  Let us not miss this chance to help Nepal build a better future for \nits people and demonstrate to them and the rest of the world the desire \nof the United States to see developing nations rise from poverty to \neconomic prosperity. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n[[Page S4001]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 662\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TREATMENT OF CERTAIN TEXTILES AND APPAREL.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     preferential treatment extended to apparel articles under \n     section 112(b)(3)(B) of the African Growth and Opportunity \n     Act (19 U.S.C. 3721(b)(3)(B)) shall also apply to apparel \n     articles that are imported directly into the customs \n     territory of the United States from Nepal in accordance with \n     the provisions set forth in such section as if such articles \n     were articles of a lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan \n     African country, if Nepal has satisfied the requirements set \n     forth in section 113 of such Act (19 U.S.C. 3722), except \n     that--\n       (1) any reference in section 112(b) or section 113 of the \n     African Growth and Opportunity Act to a lesser developed \n     beneficiary sub-Saharan African country or countries) shall \n     be treated as a reference to Nepal; and\n       (2) such preferential treatment shall apply to apparel \n     articles imported into the customs territory of the United \n     States during the period beginning on October 1, 2003, and \n     ending on September 30, 2005.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 663. A bill for the relief of the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada for \nsettlement of certain claims against the United States; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, almost eight years ago, I stood before you \nto introduce a bill ``to provide an opportunity for the Pottawatomi \nNation in Canada to have the merits of their claims against the United \nStates determined by the United States Court of Federal Claims.''\n  That bill was introduced as Senate Resolution 223, which referred the \nPottawatomi's claim to the Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Federal \nClaims and required the Chief Judge to report back to the Senate and \nprovide sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law to enable \nthe Congress to determine whether the claim of the Pottawatomi Nation \nin Canada is legal or equitable in nature, and the amount of damages, \nif any, which may be legally or equitably due from the United States.\n  Last year, the Chief Judge of the Court of Federal Claims reported \nback that the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada has a legitimate and \ncredible legal claim. Thereafter, by settlement stipulation, the United \nStates has taken the position that it would be ``fair, just and \nequitable'' to settle the claims of the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada \nfor the sum of $1,830,000. This settlement amount was reached by the \nparties after seven years of extensive, fact-intensive litigation. \nIndependently, the court concluded that the settlement amount is ``not \na gratuity'' and that the ``settlement was predicated on a credible \nlegal claim.'' Pottawatomi Nation in Canada, et al. v. United States, \nCong. Ref. 94-1037X at 28 (Ct. Fed. Cl., September 15, 2000) (Report of \nHearing Officer).\n  The bill I introduce today is to authorize the appropriation of those \nfunds that the United States has concluded would be ``fair, just \nand equitable'' to satisfy this legal claim. If enacted, this bill will \nfinally achieve a measure of justice for a tribal nation that has for \nfar too long been denied.\n\n  For the information of our colleagues, this is the historical \nbackground that informs the underlying legal claim of the Canadian \nPottawatomi.\n  The members of the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada are one of the \ndescendant groups--successors-in-interest--of the historical \nPottawatomi Nation and their claim originates in the latter part of the \n18th Century. The historical Pottawatomi Nation was aboriginal to the \nUnited States. They occupied and possessed a vast expanse in what is \nnow the States of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin. \nFrom 1795 to 1833, the United States annexed most of the traditional \nland of the Pottawatomi Nation through a series of treaties of \ncession--many of these cessions were made under extreme duress and the \nthreat of military action. In exchange, the Pottawatomis were \nrepeatedly made promises that the remainder of their lands would be \nsecure and, in addition, that the United States would pay certain \nannuities to the Pottawatomi.\n  In 1829, the United States formally adopted a Federal policy of \nremoval--an effort to remove all Indian tribes from their traditional \nlands east of the Mississippi River to the west. As part of that \neffort, the government increasingly pressured the Pottawatomis to cede \nthe remainder of their traditional lands--some five million acres in \nand around the city of Chicago and remove themselves west. For years, \nthe Pottawatomis steadfastly refused to cede the remainder of their \ntribal territory. Then in 1833, the United States, pressed by settlers \nseeking more land, sent a Treaty Commission to the Pottawatomi with \norders to extract a cession of the remaining lands. The Treaty \nCommissioners spent two weeks using extraordinarily coercive tactics--\nincluding threats of war--in an attempt to get the Pottawatomis to \nagree to cede their territory. Finally, those Pottawatomis who were \npresent relented and on September 26, 1933, they ceded their remaining \ntribal estate through what would be known as the Treaty of Chicago. \nSeventy-seven members of the Pottawatomi Nation signed the Treaty of \nChicago. Members of the ``Wisconsin Band'' were not present and did not \nassent to the cession.\n  In exchange for their land, the Treaty of Chicago provided that the \nUnited States would give to the Pottawatomis five million acres of \ncomparable land in what is now Missouri. The Pottawatomi were familiar \nwith the Missouri land, aware that it was similar to their homeland. \nBut the Senate refused to ratify that negotiated agreement and \nunilaterally switched the land to five million acres in Iowa. The \nTreaty Commissioners were sent back to acquire Pottawatomi assent to \nthe Iowa land. All but seven of the original 77 signatories refused to \naccept the change even with promises that if they were dissatisfied \n``justice would be done.'' Treaty of Chicago, as amended, Article 4. \nNevertheless, the Treaty of Chicago was ratified as amended by the \nSenate in 1834. Subsequently, the Pottawatomis sent a delegation to \nevaluate the land in Iowa. The delegation reported back that the land \nwas ``not fit for snakes to live on.''\n\n  While some Pottawatomis removed westward, many of the Pottawatomis--\nparticularly the Wisconsin Bank, whose leaders never agreed to the \nTreaty--refused to do so. By 1836, the United States began to \nforcefully remove Pottawatomis who remained in the east--with \ndevastating consequences. As is true with many other American Indian \ntribes, the forced removal westward came at great human cost. Many of \nthe Pottawatomi were forcefully removed by mercenaries who were paid on \na per capita basis government contract. Over one-half of the Indians \nremoved by these means died en route. Those who reached Iowa were \nalmost immediately removed further to inhospitable parts of Kansas \nagainst their will and without their consent.\n  Knowing of these conditions, many of the Pottawatomis including most \nof those in the Wisconsin Bank vigorously resisted forced removal. To \navoid Federal troops and mercenaries, much of the Wisconsin Bank \nultimately found it necessary to flee to Canada. They were often \npursued to the border by government troops, government-paid mercenaries \nor both. Official files of the Canadian and United States governments \ndisclose that many Pottawatomis were forced to leave their homes \nwithout their horses or any of their possessions other than the clothes \non their backs.\n  By the late 1830s, the government refused payment of annuities to any \nPottawatomi groups that had not removed west. In the 1860s, members of \nthe Wisconsin Band--those still in their traditional territory and \nthose forced to flee to Canada--petitioned Congress for the payment of \ntheir treaty annuities promised under the Treaty of Chicago and all \nother cession treaties. By the Act of June 25, 1864, 13 Stat. 172, the \nCongress declared that the Wisconsin Band did not forfeit their \nannuities by not removing and directed that the share of the \nPottawatomi Indians who had refused to relocate to the west should be \nretained for their use in the United States Treasury. H.R. Rep. No. \n470, 64th Cong., p. 5, as quoted on page 3 of\n\n[[Page S4002]]\n\nmemo dated October 7, 1949. Nevertheless, much of the money was never \npaid to the Wisconsin Band.\n\n  In 1903, the Wisconsin Band--most of whom now resided in three areas, \nthe States of Michigan and Wisconsin and the Province of Ontario--\npetitioned the Senate once again to pay them their fair portion of \nannuities as required by the law and treaties. Sen. Doc. No. 185, 57th \nCong., 2d Sess. By the Act of June 21, 1906, 34 Stat. 380, the Congress \ndirected the Secretary of the Interior to investigate claims made by \nthe Wisconsin Band and establish a roll of the Wisconsin Band \nPottawatomis that still remained in the East. In addition, the Congress \nordered the Secretary to determine ``the[] [Wisconsin Bands] \nproportionate shares of the annuities, trust funds, and other moneys \npaid to or expended for the tribe to which they belong in which the \nclaimant Indians have not shared, [and] the amount of such monies \nretained in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the \nclamant Indians as directed the provisions of the Act of June 25, \n1864.''\n  In order to carry out the 1906 Act, the Secretary of Interior \ndirected Dr. W.M. Wooster to conduct an enumeration of Wisconsin Band \nPottawatomi in both the United States and Canada. Dr. Wooster \ndocumented 2007 Wisconsin Pottawatomis: 457 in Wisconsin and Michigan \nand 1550 in Canada. He also concluded that the proportionate share of \nannuities for the Pottawatomis in Wisconsin and Michigan was $477,339 \nand the proportionate share of annuities due the Pottawatomi Nation in \nCanada was $1,517,226. The Congress thereafter enacted a series of \nappropriation Acts from June 30, 1913 to May 29, 1928 to satisfy most \nof money owed to those Wisconsin Band Pottawatomis residing in the \nUnited States. However, the Wisconsin Band Pottawatomis who resided in \nCanada were never paid their share of the tribal funds.\n  Since that time, the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada has diligently and \ncontinuously sought to enforce their treaty rights, although until this \ncongressional reference, they had never been provided their day in \ncourt. In 1910, the United States and Great Britian entered into an \nagreement for the purpose of dealing with claims between both \ncountries, including claims of Indian tribes within their respective \njurisdictions, by creating the Pecuniary Claims Tribunal. From 1910 to \n1938, the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada diligently sought to have their \nclaim heard in this international forum. Overlooked for more pressing \ninternational matters of the period, including the intervention of \nWorld War I, the Pottawatomis then came to the U.S. Congress for \nredress of their claim.\n\n  In 1946, the Congress waived its sovereign immunity and established \nthe Indian Claims Commission for the purpose of granting tribes their \nlong-delayed day in court. The Indian Claims Commission Act (ICCA) \ngranted the Commission jurisdiction over claims such as the type \ninvolved here. In 1948, the Wisconsin Band Pottawatomis from both sides \nof the border--brought suit together in the Indian Claims Commission \nfor recovery of damages. Hannahville Indian Community v. U.S., No. 28 \n(Ind. C1. Comm. Filed May 4, 1948). Unfortunately, the Indian Claims \nCommission dismissed Pottawatomi Nation in Canada's part of the claim \nruling that the Commission had no jurisdiction to consider claims of \nIndians living outside territorial limits of the United States. \nHannahville Indian Community v. U.S., 115 Ct. C1. 823 (1950). The claim \nof the Wisconsin band residing in the United States that was filed in \nthe Indian Claims Commission was finally decided in favor of the \nWisconsin Band by the U.S. Claims court in 1983. Hannahville Indian \nCommunity v. United States, 4 Ct. C1. 445 (1983). The Court of Claims \nconcluded that the Wisconsin Band was owed a member's proportionate \nshare of unpaid annuities from 1838 through 1907 due under various \ntreaties, including the Treaty of Chicago and entered judgment for the \nAmerican Wisconsin band Pottawatomis for any monies not paid. Still the \nPottawatomi Nation in Canada was excluded because of the jurisdictional \nlimits of the ICCA.\n  Undaunted, the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada came to the Senate and \nafter careful consideration, we finally gave them their long-awaited \nday in court through the congressional reference process. The court has \nnow reported back to us that their claim is meritorious and that the \npayment that this bill would make constitutes a ``fair, just and \nequitable'' resolution to this claim.\n  The Pottawatomi Nation in Canada has sought justice for over 150 \nyears. They have done all that we asked in order to establish their \nclaim. Now it is time for us to finally live up to the promise our \ngovernment made so many years ago. It will not correct all the wrongs \nof the past, but it is a demonstration that this government is willing \nto admit when it has left unfulfilled an obligation and that the United \nStates is willing to do what we can to see that justice--so long \ndelayed--is not now denied.\n\n  Finally, I would just note that the claim of the Pottawatomi Nation \nin Canada is supported through specific resolutions by the National \nCongress of American Indians, the oldest, largest and most-\nrepresentative tribal organization here in the United States, the \nAssembly of First Nations, which includes all recognized tribal \nentities in Canada, and each and every one of the Pottawatomi tribal \ngroups that remain in the United States today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 663\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npermanently extend the research credit, to increase the rates of the \nalternative incremental credit, and to provide an alternative \nsimplified credit for qualified research expenses; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with my friend \nand colleague Senator Baucus and a majority of our Finance Committee \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle today in introducing \nlegislation that would permanently extend and improve the research tax \ncredit.\n  The 1990s were a great period in American economic history because \nAmerican workers became more productive. This increase in productivity \nallowed the economy to continue to grow faster than almost anyone \nthought possible. Throughout the 1990s, doomsayers said that we had \nreached the economy's speed limit, but we just kept growing. How did \nthis happen?\n  The Congressional Budget Office, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \nGreenspan, and dozens of leading economists have all heralded the \nincrease in our\n\n[[Page S4003]]\n\nproductivity as a key to those economic good times. A major reason for \nthis increase in productivity, is the flowering of new ideas through \nresearch and development. Restoring and increasing that growth is what \nour bill today is all about.\n  But why do we need a research tax credit? Are not profitable new \nideas their own reward? Is not the promise of future profits from new \ndrug discoveries and new manufacturing techniques its own incentive? \nWill not companies do large amounts of R on their own, without any \nspecial tax incentives?\n  Yes, of course, they will. But they clearly will not do enough. This \nis because cutting-edge research and development has spillover effects \nthat reach far beyond the company that makes the investment. When \ncompanies invent new ideas and new production techniques, those \ninventions last forever, and help people in the United States and \nthroughout the world. But the company that invests in R will only be \nable to make a sizable profit on its invention for a few years at most. \nThat is because either the patent will expire, or other companies will \nimitate the new technique and cut the inventor's hoped-for profits.\n  Now, I am all in favor of vigorous competition--it keeps our \ncompanies strong and efficient. But we have to recognize that \ncompetition means that innovators will receive only a fraction of the \nbenefits of their innovation. Once the imitators pop up and competition \nincreases, we know that profits will fall, prices will fall, and the \nbenefits of innovation, thankfully, will get passed on to consumers. We \nneed innovation, and fortunately, we have a strong, proven tax \nincentive that can encourage that innovation. The benefits of \ninnovation reach far beyond the company that invents them. That is why \nwe need to give companies incentives to do more innovation.\n  I believe the best way to ensure that private-sector investment in \nresearch and development continues at the healthy rate needed to fuel \nproductivity gains in the future is to improve and permanently extend \nthe research credit. This tax provision is a proven and a cost-\neffective incentive to increase private-sector R spending.\n  Studies have shown that the research tax credit significantly \nincreases research and development expenditures. The marginal effect of \none dollar of the research credit creates approximately one dollar of \nadditional private research and development spending over the short-run \nand as much as two dollars of extra R spending over the long-run. \nThat, is a good deal for the American taxpayer.\n  One of the greatest strengths of the research credit has always been \nthat it gave good incentives for more innovation. This year's proposal \nto extend the credit is no exception. This year, we have added a third \nway to qualify for the credit, an elective ``alternative simplified \ncredit.'' We propose to base this new alternative credit on how much a \ncompany has increased its R spending compared to the last three \nyears. Companies will average their R spending over the previous \nthree years, and cut that number in half. For every dollar they spend \nover that amount, they get a 12 percent tax credit. If they spend less \nthan that amount, they get no credit at all. This is why this credit is \nso effective--it gives benefits to companies that do more, and gives no \nbenefits to companies that do less. That is good tax policy, and good \ngrowth policy.\n  Once again, I want to ask my colleagues to make this credit \npermanent. I think we all know that this credit is going to be \nextended, again and again, every few years. It takes time and energy \nfor my colleagues to revisit this issue every few years. Can we not \njust, once and for all, make this provision permanent? We know this is \ngood policy, and it is one of the most effective tax incentives in the \ncode. As I stated earlier, even under today's permanently temporary \ncredit, every dollar of tax credit is estimated to increase R \nspending by one dollar in the short run and by up to two dollars in the \nlong run. And if we make this permanent, those incentives will only \nimprove.\n  As it stands, companies have to take account of the fact that \nCongress could allow the credit lapse for a few months, as it did a \nnumber of years ago. So companies hedge their bets, they spend a little \nless on R, and our economy suffers as a result. By contrast, \npermanence helps planning. The sooner we make this permanent, the \nsooner companies can begin to enlarge and expand their research and \ndevelopment units, and the sooner their innovations will strengthen \neconomic growth.\n  A permanent extension of this credit may seem costly in terms of lost \nrevenue. However, when you consider the value that this investment will \ncreate for our economy, it is a bargain. In fact, one study estimates \nthat a permanent research credit would result in our Gross Domestic \nProduct increasing by $10 billion after five years and by $31 billion \nafter 20 years.\n  By making our workers more productive, this credit will also increase \nwages. That is because study after study shows an iron-clad link \nbetween worker productivity and worker wages. Findings from a study \nconducted by Coopers & Lybrand show that workers in every state will \nbenefit from higher wages if the research tax credit is made permanent. \nPayroll increases as a result of gains in productivity stemming from \nthe credit have been estimated to exceed $60 billion over the next 12 \nyears.\n  My home State of Utah is a good example of how State economies \nbenefit from the research tax credit. Utah is home to a large number of \nfirms that invest a high percentage of their revenue on research and \ndevelopment.\n  In Utah, five percent of the workers--51,000 people--work in the \nresearch-intensive high technology sector. That includes over 10,000 \npeople working just to design computer systems, and over 6,000 \nproducing medical equipment. And there is a lot of R taking place \noutside of Utah's high tech sector.\n  Just to give one example, more than 7,000 people work in Utah's \nchemical industry, and workers in that industry benefit from research \nand development taking place in Utah and throughout the country. \nAerospace and the drug and pharmaceutical industries are two more \nexamples of big Utah employer groups that reap the benefits of R And \neven in the midst of my state's currently weak job market, two \nindustries that increased employment in 2002 were the medical equipment \nand the scientific research and development services industries.\n  So, the point I want to make is not that Utah needs to do all of the \nresearch in order to reap the benefits of that research. Instead, the \npoint I want to make is that workers in my state will become more \nproductive and earn higher wages both when they invent new ideas, and \nwhen they use new ideas, wherever those new ideas come from.\n  I want Utah companies to be able to buy better manufacturing \nequipment, more reliable electronics, and have access to more efficient \nquality control techniques. The workers who use new inventions will get \njust as many benefits as workers who create those new inventions. And \nthe evidence clearly shows, that the research credit will increase \ncreation.\n  In short, there are tens of thousands of employees working in Utah's \nthousands of technology based companies, with tens of thousands more \nworking in other sectors that engage in R Beyond that, practically \nall of Utah's hundreds of thousands of workers benefit from higher \nproductivity coming from the innovations that researchers both inside \nand outside of Utah produce. Research and development is clearly the \nlifeblood of our economy.\n  During the ten times in the past 20 years that Congress has extended \nthe research credit for a short time, the ostensible reason has been a \nlack of revenue. The excuse we give to constituents is that we didn't \nhave the money to extend the bill permanently. Ironically, it costs at \nleast as much in terms of lost revenue, in the long run, to enact \nshort-term extensions as it does to extend it permanently.\n  A permanent research credit has wide support in both the Senate and \nthe House. A few years ago, this body passed by a vote of 98-1 an \namendment that would have permanently extended the credit. \nUnfortunately, all amendments were ultimately stripped from the \nunderlying bill. Moreover, the permanent extension of the credit is a \nmajor provision in President Bush's tax plan, and was supported by both \nformer President Clinton and by Al\n\n[[Page S4004]]\n\nGore. Again in 2001, this body voted to include a permanent research \ncredit in the President's tax plan.\n  In conclusion, making the research tax credit permanent will increase \nthe growth rate of our economy. It will mean more and better jobs for \nAmerican workers. Making the tax credit permanent will speed economic \ngrowth. And new technology resulting from American research and \ndevelopment will continue to improve the standard of living for every \nperson in the U.S. and around the world. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues on the Finance Committee and in the Senate as a whole to \ncreate a permanent, improved research and development tax credit.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 664\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to again join with my friend, \nSenator Hatch, and my other colleagues, in introducing legislation to \nmake a permanent commitment to research-intensive businesses in the \nUnited States. This legislation is bipartisan and bicameral. A \ncompanion bill was introduced in January in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congresswoman Nancy Johnson and Congressman Robert \nMatsui.\n  Every morning we here news of some new product or discovery that \npromises to make our jobs easier or our lives better. Many of these \ninnovations started with a business decision to hire needed researchers \nand finance the expensive and long process of research and \nexperimentation. Since 1981, when the R tax credit was first enacted, \nthe federal government was a partner in that business endeavor because \nof the potential spillover benefits to society overall from additional \nresearch spending.\n  Research has shown that a tax credit is a cost-effective way to \npromote R The General Accounting Office, the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, the National Bureau of Economic Research, and others have \nall found significant evidence that a tax credit stimulates additional \ndomestic R spending by U.S. companies. A reported by the \nCongressional Research Service, CRS, indicates that economists \ngenerally agree that, without government support, firm investment in \nR would fall short of the socially optimal amount and thus CRS \nadvocates government policies to boost private sector R\n  R is linked to broader economic and labor benefits. R lays the \nfoundation for technological innovation, which, in turn, is an \nimportant driving force in long-term economic growth--mainly through \nits impact on the productivity of capital and labor. We have many times \nheard testimony from economists, including Federal Research Board Alan \nGreenspan, that the reason our economy grew at such breakneck speed \nduring the 1990s stemmed from the productivity growth we realized \nthanks to technological innovations.\n  There has been a belief that companies would continue to increase \ntheir research spending and that the benefits of these investments on \nthe economy and labor markets would continue without end. \nUnfortunately, that is not the case. New data compiled by Battelle \nMemorial Institute and R Magazine project that for 2003, U.S. company \nspending on research will be mostly flat for the second year in a row. \nAccording to this report, companies plan a 0.1 percent increase in R \nspending in 2003. Spending in 2002 rose a mere 0.3 percent over 2001 \nlevels. This compares to 2001 when R spending grew by 5 percent over \nthe previous year. Those numbers should be a wake up call for all of \nus. As research spending falls, so too will the level of future \neconomic growth.\n  It is also important to recognize that many of our foreign \ncompetitors are offering permanent and generous incentives to firms \nthat attract research dollars to those countries. A 2001 study by the \nOrganization of Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, ranked the \nU.S. ninth behind other nations in terms of its incentives for business \nR spending. Countries that provide more generous R incentives \ninclude Spain, Canada, Portugal, Austria, Australia, Netherlands, \nFrance, and Korea. The United Kingdom was added to this list in 2002 \nwhen it further expanded its existing R incentives program. The \ncontinued absence of a long-term U.S. government R policy that \nencourages U.S.-based R will undermine the ability of American \ncompanies to remain competitive in U.S. and foreign markets. This \ndisparity could limit U.S. competitiveness relative to its trading \npartners in the long-run.\n  Also, U.S. workers who are engaged in R activities currently \nbenefit\n\n[[Page S4005]]\n\nfrom some of the most intellectually stimulating, high-paying, high-\nskilled jobs in the economy. My own State of Montana is an excellent \nexample of this economic activity. During the 1990s, about 400 \nestablishments provided high-technology services, at an average wage of \nabout $35,000 per year. These jobs paid nearly 80 percent more than the \naverage private sector wage of less than $20,000 per year during the \nsame year. Many of these jobs would never have been created without the \nassistance of the R credit. While there may not be an immediate rush \nto move all projects and jobs offshore, there has been movement at the \nmargins on those projects that are most cost-sensitive. Once those \nprojects and jobs are gone, it will be many years before companies will \nhave any incentive to bring them back to the United States.\n  We continue to grapple with the need to stimulate economic growth and \nadvance policies that represent solid long-term investments that will \nreap benefits for many years to come. Senator Hatch and I repeatedly \nhave pointed to the R tax credit as a measure that gives us a good \n``bang for our buck.'' I hope this year we can enact a permanent tax \ncredit that is effective and more widely available. I encourage my \ncolleagues to join us in this effort.\n  As we have in years past, our proposal would make the current \nresearch and experimentation tax credit permanent and increase the \nAlternative Incremental Research Credit, AIRC, rates. This year we take \none additional but necessary step.\n  We propose a new alternative simplified credit that will allow \ntaxpayers to elect to calculate the R credit under new computational \nrules that will eliminate the present-law distortions caused by gross \nreceipts.\n  There is no good policy reason to make research more expensive for \nsome industries than for others. While the regular R tax credit works \nvery well for many companies, as the credit's base period recedes and \nbusiness cycles change, the current credit is out of reach for some \nother firms that still incur significant research expenditures. To help \nsolve part of this problem Congress enacted the AIRC in 1996 and now we \npropose a way to address the rest of that problem.\n  Under current law, both the regular credit and the AIRC are \ncalculated by reference to a taxpayer's gross receipts, a benchmark \nthat can produce inequities and anomalous results. For example, many \ntaxpayers are no longer able to qualify for the regular credit, despite \nsubstantial R investments, because their R spending relative to \ngross receipts has not kept pace with the ratio set in the 1984-88 base \nperiod, which governs calculation of the regular credit. This can \nhappen, for example, simply where a company's sales increase \nsignificantly in the intervening years, where a company enters into an \nadditional line of business that generates additional gross receipts \nbut involves little R, or where a company becomes more efficient in \nits R processes.\n  Our proposal would correct this by allowing taxpayers a \nstraightforward alternative research credit election. Taxpayers could \nelect, in lieu of the regular credit or the AIRC, a credit that would \nequal 12 percent of the excess of the taxpayer's current year qualified \nresearch expenditures, ``QREs'', over 50 percent of the taxpayer's \naverage QREs for the 3 preceding years. Unlike the regular credit and \nthe AIRC, this credit calculation does not involve gross receipts.\n  The R tax credit has proven it can be an effective incentive. We \nneed to act to make it a permanent part of the tax code that U.S. \nbusinesses can rely on. The best thing we can do for our long-term \neconomic well-being is to stoke the engine of growth--technology, high-\nwage jobs and productivity. I look forward to working with Sen. Hatch \nand all my colleagues on this important issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \n        Brownback, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Burns, Mr. Craig, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \n        Fitzgerald, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Miller, Mr. Dorgan, and \n        Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 665. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax relief for farmers and fishermen, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with my \ngood friend, Senator Baucus, to introduce the Tax Empowerment and \nRelief for Farmers and Fishermen Act, which I will refer to as the \n``TERFF Act.'' I am pleased that Senators Roberts, Brownback, Lincoln, \nBurns, Craig, Crapo, Fitzgerald, Hagel, and Dorgan are joining Senator \nBaucus and me as cosponsors of this important legislation.\n  I am a farmer, like my father was before me. I understand farming and \nhow policy decisions from Washington impact hardworking farmers, like \nmy son Robin. Before I ran for elected office and after I leave, God \nwilling, I'll still be farming. There is little that I feel more \nstrongly about than providing the agriculture community with the \npotential to survive and to thrive. As far as I'm concerned, \nagriculture is my ``turf'' and as long as I'm in this town, I'll do all \nI can to serve my friends and neighbors in the agriculture community.\n  This legislation has already been adopted by the Senate multiple \ntimes. In the midst of a serious downturn in the agriculture economy, \nit seems to me we ought to be doing everything we can to help farmers, \nand this would provide significant assistance.\n  First, this legislation includes Farm, Fish, and Ranch Risk \nManagement Accounts. These farmer saving accounts would allow farmers \nto contribute up to 20 percent of their income in an account, and \ndeduct it in the same year. Farm accounts would be a very important \nrisk management tool that will help farmers put away money when there's \nactual income, so that, in the bad times, there will be a safety net. \nThis measure has strong bipartisan support and was actually sent to \nPresident Clinton, who vetoed it.\n  In addition, this legislation would exempt Conservation Reserve \nProgram payments from self-employment tax. Under current law, farmers \nwho participate in the CRP are unnecessarily struggling during tax \nseason because of a case pushed by the IRS. The latest 6th Circuit \ncourt's ruling treats CRP payments as farm income subject to the \nadditional self-employment tax rate of 15 percent.\n  Senator Brownback has taken the lead on fixing this problem. This \nunfair tax not only ignores the intent of Congress in creating the CRP, \nit discourages farmers from using environmentally pro-active measures. \nAt a time when farmers are struggling to regain their footing \neconomically and do the right thing environmentally, it's important \nthat Congress support them by upholding its promise on CRP.\n  In addition, Senator Lugar has led the effort to expand the current \nprogram that allows companies to donate to food banks, so that farmers \nand restaurants can also donate surplus food directly to needy food \nbanks. This will be a win for the farmers and a big win for people who \ndepend on food bank assistance.\n  In addition, when we passed income averaging for farmers a few years \nago, we neglected to take into account the problem of running into the \nalternative minimum tax, which many farmers are facing now. My bill \nwill fix this growing problem.\n  My bill also expands opportunities for beginning farmers who are in \nneed of low interest rate loans for capital purchases of farmland and \nequipment.\n  Current law permits State authorities to issue tax exempt bonds and \nto lend the proceeds from the sale of the bonds to beginning farmers \nand ranchers to finance the cost of acquiring land, buildings and \nequipment used in a farm or ranch operation.\n  Unfortunately, aggie bonds are subject to a volume cap and must \ncompete with big industrial projects for bond allocation. Aggie bonds \nshare few similarities to industrial revenue bonds and should not be \nsubject to the volume cap established for industrial revenue bonds.\n  Insufficient allocation of funding due to the volume cap limits the \neffectiveness of this program. We can't stand by and allow the next \ngeneration of farmers to lose an opportunity to participate in farming \nbecause of competition with industry for reduced interest loan rates.\n\n[[Page S4006]]\n\n  In addition, the IRS recently determined that some cooperatives \nshould be exposed to a regular corporate tax due to the fact that they \nare using organic value-added practices rather than manufactured value-\nadded practices. This is unfair, and needs to be fixed.\n  It is also imperative that we not neglect the difficulties many \nproducers are facing in light of persistent drought conditions. Under \ncurrent law, a producer who loses livestock, or is forced to sell \nlivestock, or is forced to sell livestock, is required to replace that \nlivestock within two years. However, some parts of the country have \nalready experienced two years of drought with no end in sight.\n  It goes against common sense for these producers to replace livestock \nuntil conditions improve. My legislation would extend the 2-year \ndeadline to 4 years.\n  And of course my package wouldn't be complete without a provision \nleveling the playing field for ethanol producers.\n  The Small Ethanol Producer Credit will allow small cooperative \nproducers of ethanol to be able to receive the same tax benefits as \nlarge companies. This provision provides cooperatives the ability to \nelect to pass through small ethanol producer credits to its patron.\n  The ``TERFF'' package will do more to reform taxes for the American \nfarmer than any other measure in recent memory. I urge my colleagues to \nstrongly support this measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 665\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Chairman Grassley in \nintroducing the Tax Empowerment and Relief for Farmers and Fishermen \nAct.\n  Rural America has been experiencing some hard times. Drought, low \nprices, and an economic downturn have left agricultural producers in \ndire straits and have left rural economies reeling. Farmers and \nranchers are the life blood to rural economies, and when agriculture is \nhurting, rural America hurts. Small towns are dying, stores on Main \nStreet are closing and farmers are leaving their land.\n  Congress has worked hard to help our nation's agricultural producers, \nbut with this bill, we are giving them the tools to help themselves. \nThis package includes Farm, Fish, and Ranch Risk Management Accounts, \notherwise known as FFARRM Accounts. These farmer savings accounts would \nallow farmers to contribute up to 20 percent of their income to a \nsavings account, and deduct it in the same year. FFARRM accounts would \nbe a very important risk management tool to help farmers put away money \nwhen there's actual income, so that in the really bad times there would \nbe a safety net.\n  This legislation also reverses unfair IRS decisions on self-\nemployment tax for farmers. Farmers who participate in the Conservation \nReserve Program are unnecessarily struggling during tax season because \nof a case pursued by the IRS. The latest 6th-Circuit Court ruling \ntreats CRP as farm income subject to the additional self-employment tax \nrate of 15 percent. This unfair tax not only ignores the intent of \nCongress in creating the CRP, but it also discourages farmers from \nusing environmentally pro-active measures. The bill also includes a \nprovision to reverse an IRS attempt to apply the self-employment tax on \nfarmers' cash rental income.\n  Also included in the package is a provision to hold farmers harmless \nfrom the Alternative Minimum Tax when they use income averaging. When \nCongress passed income averaging for farmers a few years ago, it \nneglected to take into account the problem of running into the \nalternative minimum tax, which many farmers are facing now. This \nlegislation will fix this growing problem.\n  It also contains an expansion of first-time farmer loans, or Aggie \nBonds. This expands opportunities for beginning farmers who need low-\ninterest rate loans for purchases of farmland and equipment. Current \nlaw permits state authorities to issue tax-exempt bonds and to lend the \nproceeds from the sale of the bonds to beginning farmers and ranchers \nto finance the cost of acquiring land, buildings and equipment used in \na farm or ranch operation. Unfortunately, Aggie Bonds are subjected to \na volume cap and must compete with big industrial projects for bond \nallocation. Aggie Bonds share few similarities to Industrial Revenue \nBonds and should not be subjected to the volume cap established for \nIRBs. Insufficient allocation of funding due to the volume cap limits \nthe effectiveness of this program.\n  Farmer co-op initiatives are also included. Recently the IRS \ndetermined that some cooperatives should be exposed to a regular \ncorporate tax due to the fact that they are using organic value-added \npractices rather than manufactured value-added practices. The bill also \nwould permit small cooperative producers of ethanol to receive the same \ntax benefits as large companies.\n  Another important provision provides tax relief for ranchers that are \nforced to sell their livestock on account of drought. The bill gives \nproducers the time they need to reinvest proceeds tax-free when drought \nmakes it impossible to feed their herds.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this crucial \npiece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 666. A bill to provide incentives to increase research by private \nsector entities to develop antivirals, antibiotics and other drugs, \nvaccines, microbicides, detection, and diagnostic technologies to \nprevent and treat illnesses associated with a biological, chemical, or \nradiological weapons attack; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, America has a major flaw in its \ndefenses against bioterrorism. Hearings I chaired in the Government \nAffairs Committee on bioterrorism demonstrated that America has not \nmade a national commitment to research and development of treatments \nand cures for those who might be exposed to or infected by a biological \nagent, chemical toxin, or radiological material. Correcting this \ncritical gap is the purpose of legislation we are introducing today.\n  This legislation is a refined and upgraded version of legislation I \nintroduced last year, S. 1764, December 4, 2001, and S. 3148, October \n17, 2002, and I am delighted that Senator Hatch has joined me as the \nlead cosponsor of the new bill.\n  Obviously, our first priority must be to attempt to prevent the use \nof these agents and toxins by terrorists, quickly assess when an attack \nhas occurred, take appropriate public health steps to contain the \nexposure, stop the spread of contagion, and then detoxify the site. \nThese are all critical functions, but in the end we must recognize that \nsome individuals may be exposed or infected. Then the critical issue is \nwhether we can treat and cure them and prevent death and disability.\n  In short, we need a diversified portfolio of medicines. In cases \nwhere we have ample advance warning of an attack and specific \ninformation about the agent, toxin, or material, we may be able to \nvaccinate the vulnerable population in advance. In other cases, even if \nwe have a vaccine, we might well prefer to use medicines that would \nquickly stop the progression of the disease or the toxic effects. We \nalso need a powerful capacity quickly to develop new countermeasures \nwhere we face a new agent, toxin, or material.\n  Unfortunately, we are woefully short of vaccines and medicines to \ntreat individuals who are exposed or infected. We have antibiotics that \nseem to work for most of those infected in the current anthrax attack, \nbut these have not prevented five deaths. We have no effective vaccines \nor medicines for most other biological agents and chemical toxins we \nmight confront. We have very limited capacity to respond medically to a \nradiological attack. In some cases we have vaccines to prevent, but no \nmedicines to treat, an agent. We have limited capacity to speed the \ndevelopment of vaccines and medicines to prevent or treat novel agents \nand toxins not currently known to us.\n  We have provided, and should continue to provide, direct Federal \nfunding for research and development of new\n\n[[Page S4010]]\n\nmedicines, however, this funding is unlikely to be sufficient. Even \nwith ample Federal funding, many private companies will be reluctant to \nenter into agreements with government agencies to conduct this \nresearch. Other companies would be willing to conduct the research with \ntheir own capital and at their own risk but are not able to secure the \nfunding from investors.\n  The legislation we introduce today would provide incentives for \nprivate biotechnology companies to form capital to develop \ncountermeasures--medicines--to prevent, treat and cure victims of \nbioterror, chemical and radiological attacks. This will enable this \nindustry to become a vital part of the national defense infrastructure \nand do so for business reasons that make sense for their investors on \nthe bottom line.\n  Enactment of these incentives is necessary because most biotech \ncompanies have no approved products or revenue from product sales to \nfund research. They rely on investors and equity capital markets to \nfund the research. They must necessarily focus on research that will \nlead to product sales and revenue and, thus, to an end to their \ndependence on investor capital. There is no established or predictable \nmarket for countermeasures. These concerns are shared by pharmaceutical \nfirms. Investors are justifiably reluctant to fund this research, which \nwill present challenges similar in complexity to AIDS. Investors need \nassurances that research on countermeasures has the potential to \nprovide a rate of return commensurate with the risk, complexity and \ncost of the research, a rate of return comparable to that which may \narise from a treatment for cancer, MS, Cystic Fibrosis and other major \ndiseases.\n  It is in our national interest to enlist these companies in the \ndevelopment of countermeasures as biotech companies tend to be \ninnovative and nimble and intently focused on the intractable diseases \nfor which no effective medical treatments are available.\n  The incentives we have proposed are innovative and some may be \ncontroversial. We invite everyone who has an interest and a stake in \nthis research to enter into a dialogue about the issue and about the \nnature and terms of the appropriate incentives. We have attempted to \nanticipate the many complicated technical and policy issues that this \nlegislation raises. The key focus of our debate should be how, not \nwhether, we address this critical gap in our public health \ninfrastructure and the role that the private sector should play. \nMillions of Americans will be at risk if we fail to enact legislation \nto meet this need.\n  On November 26 of 2001, the Centers for Disease Control issued its \ninterim working draft plan for responding to an outbreak of smallpox. \nThe plan does not call for mass vaccination in advance of a smallpox \noutbreak because the risk of side effects from the vaccine outweighs \nthe risks of someone actually being exposed to the smallpox virus. At \nthe heart of the plan is a strategy sometimes called ``search and \ncontainment.''\n  This strategy involves identifying infected individual or individuals \nwith confirmed smallpox, identifying and locating those people who come \nin contact with that person, and vaccinating those people in outward \nrings of contact. The goal is to produce a buffer of immune individuals \nand was shown to prevent smallpox and to ultimately eradicate the \noutbreak. Priorities would be set on who is vaccinated, perhaps \nfocusing on the outward rings before those at the center of the \noutbreak. The plan assumes that the smallpox vaccination is effective \nfor persons who have been exposed to the disease as long as the disease \nhas not taken hold.\n  In practice it may be necessary to set a wide perimeter for these \nareas because smallpox is highly contagious before it might be \ndiagnosed. There may be many areas subject to search and containment \nbecause people in our society travel frequently and widely. Terrorists \nmight trigger attacks in a wide range of locations to multiply the \nconfusion and panic. The most common form of smallpox has a 30 percent \nmortality rate, but terrorists might be able to obtain supplies of \n``flat-type'' smallpox with a mortality rate of 96 percent and \nhemorrhagic-type smallpox, which is almost always fatal. For these \nreasons, the CDC plan accepts the possibility that whole cities or \nother geographic areas could be cordoned off, letting no one in or \nout--a quarantine enforced by police or troops.\n  The plan focuses on enforcement authority through police or National \nGuard, isolation and quarantine, mandatory medical examinations, and \nrationing of medicines. It includes a discussion of ``population-wide \nquarantine measures which restrict activities or limit movement of \nindividuals [including] suspension of large public gatherings, closing \nof public places, restriction on travel [air, rail, water, motor \nvehicle, and pedestrian], and/or `cordon sanitaire' [literally a \n`sanitary cord' or line around a quarantined area guarded to prevent \nspread of disease by restricting passage into or out of the area].'' \nThe CDC recommends that states update their laws to provide authority \nfor ``enforcing quarantine measures'' and it recommends that States in \n``pre-event planning'' identify ``personnel who can enforce these \nisolation and quarantine measures, if necessary.'' Guide C--Isolation \nand Quarantine, page 17.\n  On October 23, 2001, the CDC published a ``Model State Emergency \nHealth Powers Act.'' It was prepared by the Center for Law and the \nPublic's Health at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities, in \nconjunction with the National Governors Association, National \nConference of State Legislatures, Association of State and Territorial \nHealth Officials, National Association of City and County Health \nOfficers, and National Association of Attorneys General. A copy of the \nmodel law is printed at www.publichealthlaw.net. The law would provide \npowers to enforce the ``compulsory physical separation (including the \nrestriction of movement or confinement) of individuals and/or groups \nbelieved to have been exposed to or known to have been infected with a \ncontagious disease from individuals who are believed not to have been \nexposed or infected, in order to prevent or limit the transmission of \nthe disease to others.'' Federal law on this subject is very strong and \nthe Administration can always rely on the President's Constitution \nauthority as Commander in Chief.\n  Let us try to imagine, however, what it would be like if a quarantine \nis imposed. Let us assume that there is not enough smallpox vaccine \navailable for use in a large outbreak, that the priority is to \nvaccinate those in the outward rings of the containment area first, \nthat the available vaccines cannot be quickly deployed inside the \nquarantined area, that it is not possible to quickly trace and identify \nall of the individuals who might have been exposed, and/or that public \nhealth workers themselves might be infected. We know that there is no \nmedicine to treat those who do become infected. We know the mortality \nrates. It is not hard to imagine how much force might be necessary to \nenforce the quarantine. It would be quite unacceptable to permit \nindividuals to leave the quarantined area no matter how much panic had \ntaken hold.\n  Think about how different this scenario would be if we had medicines \nthat could effectively treat and cure those who become infected by \nsmallpox. We still might implement the CDC plan but a major element of \nthe strategy would be to persuade people to visit their local clinic or \nhospital to be dispenses their supply of medicine. We could trust that \nthere would be a very high degree of voluntary compliance. This would \ngive us more time, give us options if the containment is not \nsuccessful, give us options to treat those in the containment area who \nare infected, and enable us to quell the public panic.\n  Because we have no medicine to treat those infected by smallpox, we \nhave to be prepared to implement a plan like the one CDC has proposed. \nTheirs is the only option because our options are so limited. We need \nto expand our range of options.\n  We should not be lulled by the apparent successes with Cipro and the \nstrains of anthrax we have seen in the recent attacks. We have not been \nable to prevent death in some of the patients with late-stage \ninhalation anthrax and Robert Stevens, Thomas Morris Jr., Joseph \nCurseen, Kathy Nguyen, and Ottilie Lundgren died. This legislation is \nnamed in honor of\n\n[[Page S4011]]\n\nthem. What we needed for them, and did not have, is a drug or vaccine \nthat would treat late stage inhalation anthrax.\n  As I have said, we need an effective treatment for those who become \ninfected with smallpox. We have a vaccine that effectively prevents \nsmallpox infection, and administering this vaccine within four days of \nfirst exposure has been shown to offer some protections against \nacquiring infection and significant protection against a fatal outcome. \nThe problem is that administering the vaccine in this time frame to all \nthose who might have been exposed may be exceedingly difficult. And \nonce infection has occurred, we have no effective treatment options.\n  In the last century 500 million people have died of smallpox--more \nthan have from any other infectious diseases--as compared to 320 \nmillion deaths in all the wars of the twentieth century. Smallpox was \none of the diseases that nearly wiped out the entire Native American \npopulation in this hemisphere. The last naturally acquired case of \nsmallpox occurred in Somalia in 1977 and the last case from laboratory \nexposure was in 1978.\n  Smallpox is a nasty pathogen, carried in microscopic airborne \ndroplets inhaled by its victims. The first signs are headache, fever, \nnausea and backache, sometimes convulsions and delirium. Soon, the skin \nturns scarlet. When the fever lets up, the telltale rash appears--flat \nred spots that turn into pimples, then big yellow pustules, then scabs. \nSmallpox also affects the throat and eyes, and inflames the heart, \nlungs, liver, intestines and other internal organs. Death often came \nfrom internal bleeding, or from the organs simply being overwhelmed by \nthe virus. Survivors were left covered with pockmarks--if they were \nlucky. The unlucky ones were left blind, their eyes permanently clouded \nover. Nearly one in four victims died. The infection rate is estimated \nto be 25-40 percent for those who are unvaccinated and a single case \ncan cause 20 or more additional infections.\n  During the 16th Century, 3.5 million Aztecs--more than half the \npopulation died of smallpox during a two-year span after the Spanish \narmy brought the disease to Mexico. Two centuries later, the virus \nravaged George Washington's troops at Valley Forge. And it cut a deadly \npath through the Crow, Dakota, Sioux, Blackfoot, Apache, Comanche and \nother American Indian tribes, helping to clear the way for white \nsettlers to lay claim to the western plains. The epidemics began to \nsubside with one of medicine's most famous discoveries: the finding by \nBritish physician Edward Jenner in 1796 that English milkmaids who were \nexposed to cowpox, a mild second cousin to smallpox that afflicts \ncattle, seemed to be protected against the more deadly disease. \nJenner's work led to the development of the first vaccine in Western \nmedicine. While later vaccines used either a killed or inactivated form \nof the virus they were intended to combat, the smallpox vaccine worked \nin a different way. It relied on a separate, albeit related virus: \nfirst cowpox and the vaccinia, a virus of mysterious origins that is \nbelieved to be a cowpox derivative. The last American was vaccinated \nback in the 1970s and half of the US population has never been \nvaccinated. It is not known how long these vaccines provide protection, \nbut it is estimated that the term is 3 to 5 years.\n  In an elaborate smallpox biowarfare scenario enacted in February 1999 \nby the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies, it was \nprojected that within two months 15,000 people had died, epidemics were \nout of control in fourteen countries, all supplies of smallpox vaccine \nwere depleted, the global economy was on the verge of collapse, and \nmilitary control and quarantines were in place. Within twelve months it \nwas projected that eighty million people worldwide had died.\n  A single case of smallpox today would become a global public health \nthreat and it has been estimated that a single smallpox bioterror \nattack on a single American city would necessitate the vaccination of \n30 to 40 million people.\n  The US government is now in the process of purchasing substantial \nstocks of the smallpox vaccine. We then face a very difficult decision \non deploying the vaccine. We know that some individuals will have an \nadverse reaction to this vaccine. No one in the United States has been \nvaccinated against smallpox in twenty-five years. Those that were \nvaccinated back then may not be protected against the disease today. If \nwe had an effective treatment for those who might become infected by \nsmallpox, we would face much less pressure regarding deploying the \nvaccine. If we face a smallpox epidemic from a bioterrorism attack, we \nwill have no Cipro to reassure the public and we will be facing a \nhighly contagious disease and epidemic. To be blunt, it will make the \ncurrent anthrax attack look benign by comparison.\n  Smallpox is not the only threat. We have seen other epidemics in this \ncentury. The 1918 influenza epidemic provides a sobering admonition \nabout the need for research to develop medicines. In two years, a fifth \nof the world's population was infected. In the United States the 1918 \nepidemic killed more than 650,000 people in a short period of time and \nleft 20 million seriously ill, one fourth of the entire population. The \naverage lifespan in the US was depressed by ten years. In just one \nyear, the epidemic killed 21 million human beings worldwide--well over \ntwice the number of combat deaths in the whole of World War I. The flu \nwas exceptionally virulent to begin with and it then underwent several \nsudden and dramatic mutations in its structure. Such mutations can turn \nflu into a killer because its victims' immune systems have no \nantibodies to fight off the altered virus. Fatal pneumonia can rapidly \ndevelop.\n  Another deadly toxin, ricin toxin, was of interest to the al-Qaeda \nterrorist network. At an al-Qaeda safehouse in Saraq Panza, Kabul \nreporters found instructions for making ricin. The instructions make \nchilling reading. ``A certain amount, equal to a strong dose, will be \nable to kill an adult, and a dose equal to seven seeds will kill a \nchild,'' one page reads. Another page says: ``Gloves and face mask are \nessential for the preparation of ricin. Period of death varies from 3 \nto 5 days minimum, 4 to 14 days maximum.'' The instructions listed the \nsymptoms of ricin as vomiting, stomach cramps, extreme thirst, bloody \ndiarrhea, throat irritation, respiratory collapse and death.\n  No specific treatment or vaccine for ricin toxin exists. Ricin is \nproduced easily and inexpensively, highly toxic, and stable in \naerosolized form. A large amount of ricin is necessary to infect whole \npopulations--the amount of ricin necessary to cover a 100-km\\2\\ area \nand cause 50 percent lethality, assuming aerosol toxicity of 3 mcg/kg \nand optimum dispersal conditions, is approximately 4 metric tons, \nwhereas only 1 kg of Bacillus anthracis is required. But it can be used \nto terrorize a large population with great effect because it is so \nlethal.\n  Use of ricin as a terror weapon is not theoretical. In 1991 in \nMinnesota, 4 members of the Patriots Council, an extremist group that \nheld antigovernment and antitax ideals and advocated the overthrow of \nthe US government, were arrested for plotting to kill a US marshal with \nricin. The ricin was produced in a home laboratory. They planned to mix \nthe ricin with the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO, and then smear it \non the door handles of the marshal's vehicle. The plan was discovered, \nand the 4 men were convicted. In 1995, a man entered Canada from Alaska \non his way to North Carolina. Canadian custom officials stopped the man \nand found him in possession of several guns, $98,000, and a container \nof white powder, which was identified as ricin. In 1997, a man shot his \nstepson in the face. Investigators discovered a makeshift laboratory in \nhis basement and found agents such as ricin and nicotine sulfate. And, \nricin was used by the Bulgarian secret police when they killed Georgi \nMarkov by stabbing him with a poison umbrella as he crossed Waterloo \nBridge in 1978.\n  Going beyond smallpox, influenza, and ricin, we do not have an \neffective vaccine or treatment for dozens of other deadly and disabling \nagents and toxins. Here is a partial list of some of the other \nbiological agents and chemical toxins for which we have no effective \ntreatments: clostridium botulinum toxin, botulism, francisella \ntularensis, tularaemia, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Marbug hemorrhagic \nfever, Lassa fever, Julin, Argentine\n\n[[Page S4012]]\n\nhemorrhagic fever, Coxiella burnetti, Q fever, brucella species, \nbrucellosis, burkholderia mallei, glanders, Venezuelan \nencephalomyelitis, eastern and western equine encephalomyelitis, \nepsilon toxin of clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus entretoxin B, \nsalmonella species, shigella dysenteriae, escherichia coli O157:H7, \nvibrio cholerae, cryptosporidium parvum, nipah virus, hantaviruses, \ntickborne hemorrhagic fever viruses, tickborne encephalitis virus, \nyellow fever, nerve agents, tabun, sarin, soman, GF, and VX, blood \nagents, hydrogen cyanide and cyanogens chloride, blister agents, \nlewisite, nitrogenadn sulfur mustards, and phosgene oxime, heavy \nmetals, arsenic, lead, and mercury, and volatile toxins, benzene, \nchloroform, trihalomethanes, pulmonary agents, Phosgene, chlorine, \nvinly chloride, and incapacitating agents, BZ.\n  The naturally occurring forms of these agents and toxins are enough \nto cause concern, but we also know that during the 1980s and 1990s the \nSoviet Union conducted bioweapons research at forty-seven laboratories \nand testing sites, employed nearly fifty thousand scientists in the \nwork, and that they developed genetically modified versions of some of \nthese agents and toxins. The goal was to develop an agent or toxin that \nwas particularly virulent or not vulnerable to available antibiotics.\n  The United States has publicly stated that five countries are \ndeveloping biological weapons in violation of the Biological Weapons \nconvention, North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Libya, and stated that \nadditional countries not yet named, possibly including Russia, China, \nIsrael, Sudan and Egypt, are also doing so as well.\n  What is so insidious about biological weapons is that in many cases \nthe symptoms resulting from a biological weapons attack would likely \ntake time to develop, so an act of bioterrorism may go undetected for \ndays or weeks. Affected individuals would seek medical attention not \nfrom special emergency response teams but in a variety of civilian \nsettings at scattered locations. This means we will need medicines that \ncan treat a late stage of the disease, long after the infection has \ntaken hold.\n  We must recognize that the distinctive characteristic of biological \nweapons is that they are living micro-organisms and are thus the only \nweapons that can continue to proliferate without further assistance \nonce released in a suitable environment.\n  The lethality of these agents and toxins, and the panic they can \ncause, is quite frightening. The capacity for terror is nearly beyond \ncomprehension. We do not believe it is necessary to describe the facts \nhere. Our point is simple: we need more than military intelligence, \nsurveillance, and public health capacity. We also need effective \nmedicines. We also need more powerful research tools that will enable \nus to quickly develop treatments for agents and toxins not on this or \nany other list.\n  We need to do whatever it takes to be able to reassure the American \npeople that hospitals and doctors have powerful medicines to treat them \nif they are exposed to biological agents or toxins, that we can contain \nan outbreak of an infectious agent, and that there is little to fear. \nTo achieve this objective, we need to rely on the entrepreneurship of \nthe biotechnology industry.\n  In the summer of 200_, the Defense Science Board completed a study of \nthe countermeasures we have available. It focused on countermeasures--\ndiagnostics, vaccines, and drugs--for the top nineteen bioterror \nthreats, and estimated what we have available today, what we might have \navailable in five years and what we might have available in ten years.\n  If one assumes that we need diagnostics, vaccines, and drugs for all \nnineteen of these bioterror threats, we need fifty-seven \ncountermeasures (19 times 3). It found that today we have only one of \nthese fifty-seven countermeasures, a drug for Chlamydia psittaci. It \nfound that in five years we might have twenty of the fifty-seven \ncountermeasures and in ten years we might have thirty-four of the \nfifty-seven. These are optimistic assessments.\n  It set reasonable criteria for what constitutes an effective \ncountermeasure. For diagnostics, it said that we are unprepared if our \ndiagnostic takes more than 24 hours, requires confirmatory testing and \nthe patient must be symptomatic. If said we are somewhat prepared if \nthe diagnostic takes 12 to 24 hours, requires confirmatory testing, and \nworks in some cases where the patient is asymptomatic. It said we are \nonly truly prepared if the test takes less than 12 hours, requires no \nconfirmatory testing, and detects the disease when the patient is \nasymptomatic. It found that we have no diagnostics today that meet the \ntop standard and might have diagnostics for seventeen of the nineteen \nterror threats in five years and eighteen of the nineteen in ten years.\n  For vaccines it found that we are unprepared if we have no vaccine. \nWe are partially prepared if we have a vaccine but have production or \nuse limitations. And we are fully prepared if we have a vaccine \ngenerally available. It found that we have no vaccines today that meet \nthe top standard and might have vaccines for two of the terror threats \nin five years and nine in ten years.\n  For therapeutics it found that we are unprepared if we have no \napproved treatment. We are partially prepared if we have a treatment \navailable but have production or use limitations. And we are fully \nprepared if we have a treatment available. It found that we have one \ntreatment that meets the top standard and might have treatments for the \nsame agent in five years and seven treatments in ten years.\n  Obviously, we are woefully unprepared. The Defense Science Board only \nfocused on the top nineteen threats, and there are many others for \nwhich we are also unprepared.\n  My proposal would supplement direct Federal Government funding of \nresearch with incentives that make it possible for private companies to \nform the capital to conduct this research on their own initiative, \nutilizing their own capital, and at their own risk--all for good \nbusiness reasons going to their bottom line.\n  The U.S. biotechnology industry, approximately 1,300 companies, spent \n$13.8 billion on research last year. Only 350 of these companies have \nmanaged to go public. The industry employs 124,000, Ernest & Young \ndata, people. The top five companies spent an average of $89,000 per \nemployee on research, making it the most research-intensive industry in \nthe world. The industry has 350 products in human clinical trials \ntargeting more than 200 diseases. Losses for the industry were $5.8 \nbillion in 2001, $5.6 billion in 2000, $4.4 billion in 1999, $4.1 \nbillion in 1998, $4.5 billion in 1997, $4.6 billion in 1996, and \nsimilar amounts before that. In 2000 fully 38 percent of the public \nbiotech companies had less than 2 years of funding for their research. \nOnly one quarter of the biotech companies in the United States are \npublicly traded and they tend to be the best funded.\n  There is a broad range of research that could be undertaken under \nthis legislation. Vaccines could be developed to prevent infection or \ntreat an infection from a bioterror attack. Broad-spectrum antibiotics \nare needed. Also, promising research has been undertaken on antitoxins \nthat could neutralize the toxins that are released, for example, by \nanthrax. With anthrax it is the toxins, not the bacteria itself, that \ncause death. An antitoxin could act like a decoy, attaching itself to \nsites on cells where active anthrax toxin binds and then combining with \nnormal active forms of the toxin and inactivating them. An antitoxin \ncould block the production of the toxin.\n  We can rely on the innovativeness of the biotech industry, working in \ncollaboration with academic medical centers, to explore a broad range \nof innovative approaches. This mobilizes the entire biotechnology \nindustry as a vital component of our national defense against bioterror \nweapons.\n  The legislation takes a comprehensive approach to the challenges the \nbiotechnology industry faces in forming capital to conduct research on \ncountermeasures. It includes capital formation tax incentives, \nguaranteed purchase funds, patent protections, and liability \nprotections. We believe we will have to include each of these types of \nincentives to ensure that we mobilize the biotechnology industry for \nthis urgent national defense research.\n  Some of the tax incentives in this legislation, and both of the two \npatent incentives I have proposed, may be controversial. In our view, \nwe can debate tax or patent policy as long as you\n\n[[Page S4013]]\n\nwant, but let's not lose track of the issue here--development of \ncountermeasures to treat people infected or exposed to lethal and \ndisabling bioterror weapons.\n  We know that incentives can spur research. In 1983 we enacted the \nOrphan Drug Act to provide incentives for companies to develop \ntreatments for rare diseases with small potential markets deemed to be \nunprofitable by the industry. In the decade before this legislation was \nenacted, fewer than 10 drugs for orphan diseases were developed and \nthese were mostly chance discoveries. Since the Act became law, 218 \norphan drugs have been approved and 800 more are in the pipeline. The \nAct provides 7 years of market exclusivity and a tax credit covering \nsome research costs. The effectiveness of the incentives we have \nenacted for orphan disease research show us how much we can accomplish \nwhen we set a national priority for certain types of research.\n  The incentives we have proposed differ from those set by the Orphan \nDrug Act. We need to maintain the effectiveness of the Orphan Drug Act \nand not undermine it by adding many other disease research targets. In \naddition, the tax credits for research for orphan drug research have no \nvalue for most biotechnology companies because few of them have tax \nliability with respect to which to claim the credit. This explains why \nwe have not proposed to utilize tax credits to spur countermeasures \nresearch. It is also clear that the market for countermeasures is even \nmore speculative than the market for orphan drugs and we need to enact \na broader and deeper package of incentives.\n  The government determines which research is covered by the \nlegislation and which companies qualify for the incentives for this \nresearch. No company is entitled to utilize the incentives until the \ngovernment certifies its eligibility.\n  These decisions are vested in the Secretary, Department of Homeland \nSecurity. In S. 1764, the decisions were vested in the White House \nOffice of Homeland Security, but it is now likely that a Department \nwill be created. I have strongly endorsed that concept and led the \neffort to enact the legislation forming the new Department.\n  The legislation confers on the Secretary, in consultation with the \nSecretary of Defense and Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nauthority to set the list of agents and toxins with respect to which \nthe legislation and incentives applies.\n  The Secretary determines which agents and toxins present a threat and \nwhether the countermeasures are ``more likely'' to be developed with \nthe application of the incentives in the legislation. The Secretary may \ndetermine that an agent or toxin does not present a threat or that \ncountermeasures are not more likely to be developed with the \nincentives. It may determine that the government itself should fund the \nresearch and development effort and not rely on private companies. The \nDepartment is required to consider the status of existing research, the \navailability of non-countermeasure markets for the research, and the \nmost effective strategy for ensuring that the research goes forward. \nThe legislation includes an illustrative, non-binding list of fifty-\nfour agents and toxins that might be included on the Secretary's list. \nThe decisions of the Secretary are final and are not subject to \njudicial review.\n  The Department then must provide information to potential \nmanufacturers of these countermeasures in sufficient detail to permit \nthem to conduct the research and determine when they have developed the \nneeded countermeasure. It may exempt from publication such information \nas it deems to be sensitive.\n  The Department also must specify the government market that will be \navailable when a countermeasure is successfully developed, including \nthe minimum number of dosages that will be purchased, the minimum price \nper dose, and the timing and number of years projected for such \npurchases. Authority is provided for the Department to make advance, \npartial, progress, milestone, or other payments to the manufacturers.\n  The Department is responsible for determining when a manufacturer \nhas, in fact, successfully developed the needed countermeasure. It must \nprovide information in sufficient detail so that manufacturers and the \ngovernment may determine when the manufacturer has successfully \ndeveloped the countermeasure the government needs. If and when the \nmanufacturer has successfully developed the countermeasure, it becomes \nentitled to the procurement, patent, and liability incentives in the \nlegislation.\n  Once the list of agents and toxins is set, companies may register \nwith the Department their intent to undertake research and development \nof a countermeasure to prevent or treat the agent or toxin. This \nregistration is required only for companies that seek to be eligible \nfor the tax, purchase, patent, and liability provisions of the \nlegislation. The registration requirement gives the Department vital \ninformation about the research effort and the personnel involved with \nthe research, authorizes inspections and other review of the research \neffort, and the filing of reports by the company.\n  The Secretary then may certify that the company is eligible for the \ntax, purchase, patent, and liability incentives in the legislation. It \nbases this certification on the qualifications of the company to \nconduct the countermeasure research. Eligibility for the purchase fund, \npatent and liability incentives is contingent on successful development \nof a countermeasure according to the standards set in the legislation, \nas determined by the Secretary.\n  The legislation contemplates that a company might well register and \nseek certification with respect to more than one research project and \nbecome eligible for the tax, purchase, patent, and liability incentives \nfor each. There is no policy rationale for limiting a company to one \nregistration and one certification.\n  This process is similar to the current registration process for \nresearch on orphan, rare, diseases. In that case, companies that are \ncertified by the FDA become eligible for both tax and market \nexclusivity incentives. This process gives the government complete \ncontrol on the number of registrations and certifications. This gives \nthe government control over the cost and impact of the legislation on \nprivate sector research.\n  The registration and certification process applies to research to \ndevelop diagnostics and research tools, not just drugs and vaccines.\n  Diagnostics are vital because healthcare professionals need to know \nwhich agent or toxin has been used in an attack. This enables them to \ndetermine which treatment strategy is likely to be most effective. We \nneed quickly to determine which individuals have been exposed or \ninfected, and to separate them from the ``worried well.'' It is likely \nin an attack that large numbers of individuals who have not been \nexposed or infected will flood into healthcare facilities seeking \ntreatment. We need to be able to focus on those individuals who are at \nrisk and reassure those who are not at risk.\n  In terms of research tools, it is possible that we will face \nbiological agents and chemical agents we have never seen before. As \nI've mentioned, the Soviet Union bioterror research focused in part on \nuse of genetic modification technology to develop agents and toxins \nthat currently-available antibiotics can not treat. Australian \nresearchers accidentally created a modified mousepox virus, which does \nnot affect humans, but it was 100 percent lethal to the mice. Their \nresearch focused on trying to make a mouse contraceptive vaccine for \npest control. The surprise was that it totally suppressed the ``cell-\nmediated response''--the arm of the immune system that combats viral \ninfection. To make matters worse, the engineered virus also appears \nunnaturally resistant to attempts to vaccinate the mice. A vaccine that \nwould normally protect mouse strains that are susceptible to the virus \nonly worked in half the mice exposed to the killer version. If \nbioterrorists created a human version of the virus, vaccination \nprograms would be of limited use. This highlights the drawback of \nworking on vaccines against bioweapons rather than treatments.\n  With the advances in gene sequencing--genomics--we will know the \nexact genetic structure of a biological agent. This information in the \nwrong hands could easily be manipulated to design and possibly grow a \nlethal new bacterial and viral strains not found in nature. A scientist \nmight be able to mix\n\n[[Page S4014]]\n\nand match traits from different microorganisms--called recombinant \ntechnology--to take a gene that makes a deadly toxin from one strain of \nbacteria and introduce it into other bacterial strains. Dangerous \npathogens or infectious agents could be made more deadly, and \nrelatively benign agents could be designed as major public health \nproblems. Bacteria that cause diseases such as anthrax could be altered \nin such a way that would make current vaccines or antibiotics against \nthem ineffective. It is even possible that a scientist could develop an \norganism that develops resistance to antibiotics at an accelerated \nrate.\n  This means we need to develop technology--research tools--that will \nenable us to quickly develop a tailor-made, specific countermeasure to \na previously unknown organism or agent. These research tools will \nenable us to develop a tailor-made vaccine or drug to deploy as a \ncountermeasure against a new threat. The legislation authorizes \ncompanies to register and receive a certification making them eligible \nfor the incentives in the bill for this vital research.\n  The legislation includes four tax incentives to enable biotechnology \nand pharmaceutical companies to form capital to fund research and \ndevelopment of countermeasures. Companies must irrevocably elect only \none of the incentives with regard to the countermeasure research.\n  Four different tax incentives are available so that companies have \nflexibility in forming capital to fund the research. Each of the \noptions comes with advantages and limitations that may make it \nappropriate or inappropriate for a given company or research project. \nWe do not now know fully how investors and capital markets will respond \nto the different options, but we assume that companies will consult \nwith the investor community about which option will work best for a \ngiven research project. Capital markets are diverse and investors have \ndifferent needs and expectations. Over time these markets and investor \nexpectations evolve. If companies register for more than one research \nproject, they may well utilize different tax incentives for the \ndifferent projects.\n  Companies are permitted to undertake a series of discrete and \nseparate research projects and make this election with respect to each \nproject. They may only utilize one of the options with respect to each \nof these research projects.\n  The first option is for the company to establish an R Limited \nPartnership to conduct the research. The partnership passes through all \nbusiness deductions and credits to the partners. For example, under \nthis arrangement, the research and development tax credits and \ndepreciation deductions for the company may be passed by the \ncorporation through to its partners to be used to offset their \nindividual tax liability. These deductions and credits are then lost to \nthe corporation. This alternative is available only to companies with \nless than $750,000,000 in paid-in capital.\n  The second option is for the company to issue a special class of \nstock for the entity to conduct the research. The investors would be \nentitled to a zero capital gains tax rate on any gains realized on the \nstock held for at least three years. This is a modification of the \ncurrent Section 1202 where only 50 percent of the gains are not taxed. \nThis provision is adapted from legislation I have introduced, S. 1134, \nand introduced in the House by Representatives Dunn and Matsui, H.R. \n2383. A similar bill has been introduced by Senator Collins, S. 455. \nThis option also is available to small companies.\n  The third and fourth options grant special tax credits to the company \nfor the research. The first credit is for research conducted by the \ncompany and the other for research conducted at a teaching hospital or \nsimilar institution. Tax credits are available to any company, but they \nonly are useful to a company with tax liability against which to claim \nthe credit. Very few biotechnology companies receive revenue from \nproduct sales and therefore have no tax liability. Companies with \nrevenue may be able to fund the research from retained earnings rather \nthan secure funding from investors.\n  A company that elects to utilize one of these incentives is not \neligible to receive benefits of the Orphan Drug Tax Credit. Companies \nthat can utilize tax credits--companies with taxable income and tax \nliability--might find the Orphan Credit more valuable. The legislation \nincludes an amendment to the Orphan Credit to correct a defect in the \ncurrent credit. The amendment has been introduced in the Senate as S. \n1341 by Senators Hatch, Kennedy and Jeffords. The amendment simply \nstates that the Credit is available starting the day an application for \norphan drug status is filed, not the date the FDA finally acts on it. \nThe amendment was one of many initiatives championed by Lisa J. Raines, \nwho died on September 11 in the plane that hit the Pentagon, and the \namendment is named in her honor. As we go forward in the legislative \nprocess, I hope we will have an opportunity to speak in more detail \nabout the service of Ms. Raines on behalf of medical research, \nparticularly on rare diseases.\n  The guaranteed purchase fund, and the patent protections, and \nliability provisions described below provide an additional incentive \nfor investors and companies to fund the research.\n  The market for countermeasures is speculative and small. This means \nthat if a company successfully develops a countermeasure, it may not \nreceive sufficient revenue on sales to justify the risk and expense of \nthe research. This is why the legislation establishes a countermeasures \npurchase fund that will define the market for the products with some \nspecificity before the research begins.\n  The Secretary will set standards for which countermeasures it will \npurchase and define the financial terms of the purchase commitment. \nThis will enable companies to evaluate the market potential of its \nresearch before it launches into the project. The specifications will \nneed to be set with sufficient specificity so that the company--and its \ninvestors--can evaluate the market and with enough flexibility so that \nit does not inhibit the innovativeness of the researchers. This \napproach is akin to setting a performance standard for a new military \naircraft.\n  The legislation provides that the Secretary will determine whether \nthe government will purchase more than one product per class. It might \nmake sense--as an incentive--for the government to commit to purchasing \nmore than one product so that many more than one company conducts the \nresearch. A winner-take-all system may well intimidate some companies \nand we may end up without a countermeasure to be purchased. It is also \npossible that we will find that we need more than one countermeasure \nbecause different products are useful for different patients. We may \nalso find that the first product developed is not the most effective.\n  The purchase commitment for countermeasures is available to any \ncompany irrespective of its paid-in capital.\n  Intellectual property protection of research is essential to \nbiotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for one simple reason: they \nneed to know that if they successfully develop a medical product \nanother company cannot expropriate it. It's a simple matter of \nincentives.\n  The patent system has its basis in the U.S. Constitution where the \nfederal government is given the mandate to ``promote the Progress of \nScience and the Useful Arts by securing for a limited time to Authors \nand Inventors the exclusive right to their respective Writings and \nDiscoveries.'' In exchange for full disclosure of the terms of their \ninventions, inventors are granted the right to exclude others from \nmaking, using, or selling their inventions for a limited period of \ntime. This quid pro quo provides investors with the incentive to \ninvent. In the absence of the patent law, discoverable inventions would \nbe freely available to anyone who wanted to use them and inventors \nwould not be able to capture the value of their inventions or secure a \nreturn on their investments.\n  The patent system strikes a balance. Companies receive limited \nprotection of their inventions if they are willing to publish the terms \nof their invention for all to see. At the end of the term of the \npatent, anyone can practice the invention without any threat of an \ninfringement action. During the term of the patent, competitors can \nlearn from the published description of the invention and may well find \na new and distinct patentable invention.\n  The legislation provides two types of intellectual property \nprotection. The\n\n[[Page S4015]]\n\nfirst simply provides that the term of the patent on the countermeasure \nwill be the term of the patent granted by the Patent and Trademark \nOffice without any erosion due to delays in approval of the product by \nthe Food and Drug Administration. The second provides that a company \nthat successfully develops a countermeasure will receive a bonus of two \nyears on the term of any patent held by that company. Companies must \nelect one of these two protections, but only small biotechnology \ncompanies may elect the second protection. Large, profitable \npharmaceutical companies may elect only the first of the two options.\n  The first protection against erosion of the term of the patent is an \nissue that is partially addressed in current law, the Hatch-Waxman \nPatent Term Restoration Act. That act provides partial protection \nagainst erosion of the term, length, of a patent when there are delays \nat the FDA in approving a product. The erosion occurs when the PTO \nissues a patent before the product is approved by the FDA. In these \ncases, the term of the patent is running but the company cannot market \nthe product. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides some protections against \nerosion of the term of the patent, but the protections are incomplete. \nAs a result, many companies end up with a patent with a reduced term, \nsometimes substantially reduced.\n  The issue of patent term erosion has become more serious due to \nchanges at the PTO in the patent system. The term of a patent used to \nbe fixed at 17 years from the date the patent was granted by the PTO. \nIt made no difference how long it took for the PTO to process the \npatent application and sometimes the processing took years, even \ndecades. Under this system, there were cases where the patent would \nissue before final action at the FDA, but there were other cases where \nthe FDA acted to approve a product before the patent was issued. \nErosion was an issue, but it did not occur in many cases.\n  Since 1995 the term of a patent has been set at 20 years from the \ndate of application for the patent. This means that the processing time \nby the PTO of the application all came while the term of the patent is \nrunning. This gives companies a profound incentive to rush the patent \nthrough the PTO. Under the old system, companies had the opposite \nincentive. With patents being issued earlier by the PTO, the issue of \nerosion of patent term due to delays at the FDA is becoming more \nserious and more common.\n  The provision in the legislation simply states that in the case of \nbioterrorism countermeasures, no erosion in the term of the patent will \noccur. The term of the patent at the date of FDA approval will be the \nsame as the term of the patent when it was issued by the PTO. There is \nno extension of the patent, simply protections against erosion. Under \nthe new 20 year term, patents might be more or less than 17 years \ndepending on the processing time at the PTO, and all this legislation \nsays is that whatever term is set by the PTO will govern irrespective \nof the delays at the FDA. This option is available to any company that \nsuccessfully develops a countermeasure eligible to be purchased by the \nfund.\n  The second option, the bonus patent term, is only available to small \ncompanies with less than $750,000,000 in paid-in capital. It provides \nthat a company that successfully develops a countermeasure is entitled \nto a two-year extension of any patent in its portfolio. This does not \napply to any patent of another company bought or transferred in to the \ncountermeasure research company.\n  I am well aware that this bonus patent term provision will be \ncontroversial with some. A company would tend to utilize this option if \nit owned the patent on a product that still had, or might have, market \nvalue at the end of the term of the patent. Because this option is only \navailable to small biotechnology companies, most of whom have no \nproduct on the market, in most cases they would be speculating about \nthe value of a product at the end of its patent. The company might \napply this provision to a patent that otherwise would be eroded due to \nFDA delays or it might apply it to a patent that was not eroded. The \nresult might be a patent term that is no longer than the patent term \nissued by the PTO. It all depends on which companies elect this option \nand which patent they select. In some cases, the effect of this \nprovision might be to delay the entry onto the market of lower priced \ngenerics. This would tend to shift some of the cost of the incentive to \ndevelop a countermeasure to insurance companies and patients with an \nunrelated disease.\n  My rationale for including the patent bonus in the legislation is \nsimple: I want this legislation to say emphatically that we mean \nbusiness, we are serious, and we want biotechnology companies to \nreconfigure their research portfolios to focus in part on development \nof countermeasures. The other provisions in the legislation are \npowerful, but they may not be sufficient.\n  This proposal protects companies willing to take the risks of \nproducing anti-terrorism products for the American public from \npotential losses incurred from lawsuits alleging adverse reactions to \nthese products. It also preserves the right for plaintiffs to seek \nrecourse for alleged adverse reactions in Federal District Court, with \nprocedural and monetary limitations.\n  Under the plan, the Secretary of HHS is required to indemnify and \ndefend entities engaged in qualified countermeasure research through \nexecution of ``indemnification and defense agreements.'' This \nprotection is only available for countermeasures purchased under the \nlegislation or to use of such countermeasures as recommended by the \nSurgeon General in the event of a public health emergency.\n  The legislation contains a series of provisions designed to enhance \ncountermeasure research.\n  The legislation provides for accelerated approval by the FDA of \ncountermeasures developed under the legislation. In most cases, the \nproducts would clearly qualify for accelerated approval, but the \nlegislation ensures that they will be reviewed under this process.\n  It provides a statutory basis for the FDA approving countermeasures \nwhere human clinical trials are not appropriate or ethical. Rules \nregarding such products have been promulgated by the FDA.\n  It grants a limited antitrust exemption for certain cooperative \nresearch and development of countermeasures.\n  It provides incentives for the construction of biologics \nmanufacturing facilities and research to increase the efficiency of \ncurrent biologics manufacturing facilities.\n  It enhances the synergy between our for-profit and not for profit \nbiomedical research entities. The Bayh-Dole Act and Stevenson-Wydler \nAct form the legal framework for mutually beneficially partnerships \nbetween academia and industry. My legislation strengthens this synergy \nand these relationships with two provisions, one to upgrade the basic \nresearch infrastructure available to conduct research on \ncountermeasures and the other to increase cooperation between the \nNational Institutes of Health and private companies.\n  Research on countermeasures necessitates the use of special \nfacilities where biological agents can be handled safely without \nexposing researchers and the public to danger. Very few academic \ninstitutions or private companies can justify or capitalize the \nconstruction of these special facilities. The Federal government can \nfacilitate research and development of countermeasures by financing the \nconstruction of these facilities for use on a fee-for-service basis. \nThe legislation authorizes appropriations for grants to non-profit and \nfor-profit institutions to construct, maintain, and manage up to ten \nBiosafety Level 3-4 facilities, or their equivalent, in different \nregions of the country for use in research to develop countermeasures. \nBSL 3-4 facilities are ones used for research on indigenous, exotic or \ndangerous agents with potential for aerosol transmission of disease \nthat may have serious or lethal consequences or where the agents pose \nhigh risk of life-threatening disease, aerosol-transmitted lab \ninfections, or related agents with unknown risk of transmission. The \nDirector of the Office and NIH shall issue regulations regarding the \nqualifications of the researchers who may utilize the facilities. \nCompanies that have registered with and been certified by the \nDirector--to develop countermeasures under Section 5 (d) of the \nlegislation--shall\n\n[[Page S4016]]\n\nbe given priority in the use of the facilities.\n  The legislation also reauthorizes a very successful NIH-industry \npartnership program launched in FY 2000 in Public Law 106-113. The \nfunding is for partnership challenge grants to promote joint ventures \nbetween NIH and its grantees and for-profit biotechnology, \npharmaceutical and medical device industries with regard to the \ndevelopment of countermeasures, as defined in Section 3 of the bill, \nand research tools, as defined in Section 4(d)(3) of the bill. Such \ngrants shall be awarded on a one-for-one matching basis. So far the \nmatching grants have focused on development of medicines to treat \nmalaria, tuberculosis, emerging and resistant infections, and \ntherapeutics for emerging threats. My proposal should be matched by \nreauthorization of the challenge grant program for these deadly \ndiseases.\n  The legislation also sets incentives for the development of adjuvents \nto enhance the potency, and efficacy of antigens in responding to a \nbiological agent.\n  It requires the new Department to issue annual reports on the \neffectiveness of this legislation and these incentives, and directs it \nto host an international conference each year on countermeasure \nresearch.\n  This legislation is carefully calibrated to provide incentives only \nwhere they are needed. This accounts for the choices in the legislation \nabout which provisions are available to small biotechnology companies \nand large pharmaceutical companies.\n  The legislation makes choices. It sets the priorities. It provides a \ndose of incentives and seeks a response in the private sector. We are \nattempting here to do something that has not been done before. This is \nuncharted territory. And it also an urgent mission.\n  There may be cases where a countermeasure developed to treat a \nbiological toxin or chemical agent will have applications beyond this \nuse. A broad-spectrum antibiotic capable of treating many different \nbiological agents may well have the capacity to treat naturally \noccurring diseases.\n  This same issue arises with the Orphan Drug Act, which provides both \ntax and FDA approval incentives for companies that develop medicines to \ntreat rare diseases. In some cases these treatments can also be used \nfor larger disease populations. There are few who object to this \nsituation. We have come to the judgment that the urgency of this \nresearch is worth the possible additional benefits that might accrue to \na company.\n  In the context of research to develop countermeasures, I do not \nconsider it a problem that a company might find a broader commercial \nmarket for a countermeasure. Indeed, it may well be the combination of \nthe incentives in this legislation and these broader markets that \ndrives the successful development of a countermeasure. If our intense \nfocus on developing countermeasures, and research tools, provides \nbenefits for mankind going well beyond terror weapons, we should \nrejoice. If this research helps us to develop an effective vaccine or \ntreatment for AIDS, we should give the company the Nobel Prize for \nMedicine. If we do not develop a vaccine or treatment for AIDS, we may \nsee 100 million people die of AIDS. We also have 400 million people \ninfected with malaria and more than a million annual deaths. Millions \nof children die of diarrhea, cholera and other deadly and disabling \ndiseases. Countermeasures research may deepen our understanding of the \nimmune system and speed development of treatments for cancer and \nautoimmune diseases. That is not the central purpose of this \nlegislation, but it is an additional rationale for it.\n  The issue raised by my legislation is very simple: do we want the \nFederal government to fund and supervise much of the research to \ndevelop countermeasures or should we also provide incentives that make \nit possible for the private sector, at its own expense, and at its own \nrisk, to undertake this research for good business reasons. The Frist-\nKennedy law focuses effectively on direct Federal funding and \ncoordination issues, but it does not include sufficient incentives for \nthe private sector to undertake this research on its own initiative. \nThat law and my legislation are perfectly complimentary. We need to \nenact both to ensure that we are prepared for bioterror attacks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nBiological, Chemical and Radiological Weapons Countermeasures Research \n                              Act of 2003\n\n\n senators Lieberman and Hatch, Congressmen Tom Davis, Cal Dooley, Curt \n                         Weldon, and Norm Dicks\n\n       The legislation proposes incentives that will enable \n     biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to take the \n     initiative--for good business reasons--to conduct research to \n     develop countermeasures, including diagnostics, therapeutics, \n     and vaccines, to treat those who might be exposed to or \n     infected by biological, chemical or radiological agents and \n     materials in a terror attack.\n       The premise of this legislation is that direct government \n     funding of this research is likely to be much more expensive \n     and risky to the government and less likely to produce the \n     countermeasures we need to defend America. Shifting some of \n     the expense and risk of this research to entrepreneurial \n     private sector firms is likely to be less expensive and much \n     more likely to produce the countermeasures we need to protect \n     ourselves in the event of an attack.\n       For biotechnology companies, incentives for capital \n     formation are needed because most such companies have no \n     approved products or revenue from product sales to fund \n     research. They rely on investors and equity capital markets \n     to fund the research. These companies must focus on research \n     that will lead to product sales and revenue and end their \n     dependence on investor capital. When they are able to form \n     the capital to fund research, biotech companies tend to be \n     innovative and nimble and focused on the intractable diseases \n     for which no effective medical treatments are available. \n     Special research credits for pharmaceutical companies are \n     also needed.\n       For both biotech and pharmaceutical companies, there is no \n     established or predictable market for these countermeasures. \n     Investors and companies are justifiably reluctant to fund \n     this research, which will present technical challenges \n     similar in complexity to development of effective treatments \n     for AIDS. Investors and companies need assurances that \n     research on countermeasures has the potential to provide a \n     rate of return commensurate with the risk complexity and cost \n     of the research, a rate of return comparable to that which \n     may arise from a treatment for cancer, MS, Cystic Fibrosis \n     and other major diseases or from other investments.\n       President Bush's BioShield initiative is designed to \n     establish and predictable market for these countermeasures. \n     This legislation provides a template for implementation of \n     BioShield and supplements it with additional incentives to \n     ensure that the industry is enthusiastically engaged in this \n     vital research.\n       The legislation provides tax incentives to enable companies \n     to form capital to conduct the research and tax credits \n     usable by larger companies with tax liability with respect to \n     which to claim the credits. It provides a guaranteed and pre-\n     determined market for the countermeasures and special \n     intellectual property protections to serve as a substitute \n     for a market. Finally, it establishes liability protections \n     for the countermeasures that are developed.\n       Section 3 of the legislation is drafted as an amendment to \n     the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (HSA)(P.L. 107-296). \n     Section 2 sets forth findings and sections 4-9 are drafted as \n     amendments to other statutes.\n       1. Setting Research Priorities (Section 1811 of HSA): The \n     Department of Homeland Security sets the countermeasure \n     research priorities in advance. It focuses the priorities on \n     threats for which countermeasures are needed, and with regard \n     to which the incentives make it ``more likely'' that the \n     private sector will conduct the research to develop \n     countermeasures. It is required to consider the status of \n     existing research, the availability of non-countermeasure \n     markets for the research, and the most effective strategy for \n     ensuring that the research goes forward. The Department then \n     provides information to potential manufacturers of these \n     countermeasures in sufficient detail to permit them to \n     conduct the research and determine when they have developed \n     the needed countermeasure. The Department is responsible for \n     determining when a manufacturer has, in fact, successfully \n     developed the needed countermeasure.\n       2. Registration of Companies (Section 1812 of HSA): \n     Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies register with the \n     Department to become eligible for the incentives in the \n     legislation. They are obligated to provide reports to the \n     Department as requested and be open to inspections. The \n     Department certifies which companies are eligible for the \n     incentives.\n       Once a company is certified as eligible for the incentives, \n     it becomes eligible for the tax incentives for capital \n     formation, and if it successfully develops a countermeasure \n     that meets the specifications of the Department, it becomes \n     eligible for the procurement, patent, and liability \n     provisions.\n       3. Diagnostics (Sections 1813 and 1814 of HSA): The \n     incentives apply to development of detection systems and \n     diagnostics, as well as drugs, vaccines and other needed \n     countermeasures.\n\n[[Page S4017]]\n\n       4. Research Tools (Section 1815 of HSA): A company is also \n     eligible for certification for the tax and patent provisions \n     if it seeks to develop a research tool that will make it \n     possible to quickly develop a countermeasure to a previously \n     unknown agent or toxin, or an agent or toxin not targeted by \n     the Department for research.\n       5. Capital Formation for Countermeasures Research (Section \n     1821 of HSA; also section 4 of the legislation): The \n     legislation provides that a company seeking to fund research \n     is eligible to elect from among four tax incentives. The \n     companies are eligible to:\n       (a). Establish an R Limited Partnership to conduct the \n     research. The partnership passes through all business \n     deductions and credits to the partners.\n       (b). Issue a special class of stock for the entity to \n     conduct the research. The investors would be entitled to a \n     zero capital gains tax rate on any gains realized on the \n     stock.\n       (c). Receive a special tax credit to help fund the \n     research.\n       (d). Receive a special tax credit for research conducted at \n     a non-profit and academic research institution.\n       A company must elect only one of these incentives and, if \n     it elects one of these incentives, it is then not eligible to \n     receive benefits under the Orphan Drug Act. The legislation \n     includes amendments (Section 9 of this legislation) to the \n     Orphan Drug Act championed by Senators Hatch, Kennedy and \n     Jeffords (S. 1341). The amendments make the Credit available \n     from the date of the application for Orphan Drug status, not \n     the date the application is approved as provided under \n     current law.\n       6. Countermeasure Purchase Fund (Section 1822 of HSA): The \n     legislation provides that a company that successfully \n     develops a countermeasure--through FDA approval--is eligible \n     to sell the product to the Federal government at a pre-\n     established price and in a pre-determined amount. The company \n     is given notice of the terms of the sale before it commences \n     the research.\n       7. Intellectual Property Incentives (Section 1823 of HSA; \n     also section 5 of this legislation): The legislation provides \n     that a company that successfully develops a countermeasure is \n     eligible to elect one of two patent incentives. The two \n     alternatives are as follows:\n       (a). The company is eligible to receive a patent for its \n     invention with a term as long as the term of the patent when \n     it was issued by the Patent and Trademark Office, without any \n     erosion due to delays in the FDA approval process. This \n     alternative is available to any company that successfully \n     develops a countermeasure irrespective of its paid-in \n     capital.\n       (b). The company is eligible to extend the term of any \n     patent owned by the company for two years. The patent may not \n     be one that is acquired by the company from a third party. \n     This is included as a capital formation incentive for small \n     biotechnology companies with less than $750 million in paid-\n     in capital, or, at the discretion of the Department of \n     Homeland Security, to any firm that successfully develops a \n     countermeasure.\n       In addition, a company that successfully develops a \n     countermeasure is eligible for a 10-year period of market \n     exclusivity on the countermeasure.\n       8. Indemnification Protections (Section 1824 of HAS; also \n     Section 10 of the legislation): The legislation provides for \n     indemnifications for liability for the company that \n     successfully develops a countermeasure.\n       9. Accelerated Approval of Countermeasure (Section 1831 of \n     HSA): The countermeasures are considered for approval by the \n     FDA on a ``fast track'' basis.\n       10. Special Approval Standards (Section 6 of this \n     legislation: The countermeasures may be approved in the \n     absence of human clinical trails if such trails are \n     impractical or unethical.\n       11. Limited Antitrust Exemption (Section 7 of this \n     legislation): Companies are granted a limited exemption from \n     the antitrust laws as they seek to expedite research on \n     countermeasures.\n       12. Biologics Manufacturing Capacity and Efficiency \n     (Section 1832 and 1833 of HSA; and section 8 of this \n     legislation): Special incentives are incorporated to ensure \n     that manufacturing capacity is available for countermeasures.\n       13. Strengthening of Biomedical Research Infrastructure \n     (Section 1834 and 1835 of HSA): Authorizes appropriations for \n     grants to construct specialized biosafety containment \n     facilities where biological agents can be handled safely \n     without exposing researchers and the public to danger \n     (Section 216). Also reauthorizes a successful NIH-industry \n     partnership challenge grants to promote joint ventures \n     between NIH and its grantees and for-profit biotechnology, \n     pharmaceutical and medical device industries with regard to \n     the development of countermeasures and research tools \n     (Section 217).\n       14. Annual Report (Section 1841 of HSA): The Department is \n     required to prepare for the Congress an annual report on the \n     implementation of these incentives.\n       15. International Conference (Section 1842 of HSA): The \n     Department is required to organize an annual international \n     conference on countermeasure research.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Johnson, \n        and Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 667. A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to strengthen \npayment limitations for commodity payments and benefits; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the American people recognize the \nimportance of the family farmer to our Nation, and the need to provide \nan adequate safety net for family farmers. In recent years, however, \nassistance to farmers has come under increasing scrutiny.\n  Critics of farm payments have argued that the largest corporate farms \nreap most of the benefits of these payments. The reality is, over 60 \npercent of the payments have gone to only 10 percent of our Nation's \nfarmers.\n  What's more, farm payments that were originally designed to benefit \nsmall and medium-sized family farmers have contributed to their own \ndemise. Unlimited farm payments have placed upward pressure on land \nprices and have contributed to overproduction and lower commodity \nprices, driving many family farmers off the farm.\n  The Senate agreed, by an overwhelming vote of 66 to 31, to a \nbipartisan amendment sponsored by Senators Dorgan and myself to target \nfederal assistance to small and medium-sized family farmers. The \namendment would have limited direct and counter-cyclical payments to \n$75,000. It would have limited gains from marketing loans and LDPs to \n$150,000, and generic certificates would have been included in this \nlimit. That would have limited farm payments to a combined total of \n$275,000.\n  That amendment was critical to family farmers in Iowa. I feel \nstrongly the farm bill failed Iowa when it failed to effectively \naddress the issue of payment limitations. This is our chance to remedy \nthe problem.\n  This bi-partisan legislation provides a limit of $40,000 for direct \npayments, $60,000 for counter-cyclical pavement, and $175,000 for LDPs \nand marketing loan gains.

Mr. President, I rise today to co-sponsor a bill that \nimposes meaningful farm payment limitations.\n  A gentleman from Arkansas is the principal landlord of a 61,000-acre \nfarm. Although he serves as president of a tractor dealership with \nsales over $30 million, this ``farmer'' received $38 million in farm \nsubsidies over 5 years. Stories like these about corporate farmers who \nreceived millions of dollars in Federal agriculture payments undermine \nsupport for the real purpose of our farm program: to help family \nfarmers.\n  What do I mean by family farmers? I am talking about people out there \nliving in a rural community, trying to raise a family and trying to \noperate a family farm and trying to raise enough food to support \nthemselves. They go to town and buy their supplies, keeping small town \nlife not only viable, but also vibrant. I am talking about a network of \nfood producers scattered across this country that represents, in my \njudgment, food security for our country.\n  And this goal of helping family farmers with a safety net in the form \nof farm program payments during tough times is something that has \nbecome much different over a long period of time. It is not the case \nthat we are fighting over farm program payments for family farmers.\n  But regrettably, millions of dollars of farm payments are not going \nto small towns and family farms. They are going to big cities and \ncorporate America. They are going to that millionaire farmer in \nArkansas, to Ted Turner, and city dwellers who visit their farm twice a \nyear. The biggest operations keep getting the bulk of the farm benefits \nwhile the small farmers are getting squeezed out of the rural areas. \nWhen this happens, the family farm operation can't compete with the \nlarger enterprises because of the financial disadvantages.\n  My fear is that if we do not do something about this problem, the \nAmerican people are going to push back on this issue and say, ``This is \nnot why we are paying taxes. We really support family farms. We believe \nfamily farms are important for America. But we don't believe we are \npaying taxes so you can transfer money to the tune of millions, even \nhundreds of millions, to those who need it least and ought not be \ngetting farm payments.''\n  So I am co-sponsoring this legislation. This bill would impose modest \nlimits on the amount of farm payments that any farm operation can \nreceive in one year. These limits would have virtually no impact on \nfamily farms and would strengthen our agriculture program by targeting \nthe payments to these smaller operations.\n  Here are the limitations that my bill would impose: the bill would \nlimit direct payments to producers to $40,000. Limits on counter-\ncyclical payments would be $60,000. The bill limits Marketing Loan \nGains and Loan Deficiency Payments to $175,000. The overall limit for a \nfarm is $275,000. The limits would save the Federal Government more \nthan $1 billion over 10 years.\n  In times of budget deficits, government expenditures need to be \ntargeted to those who need it most. Fortune 500 companies aren't the \nintended targets of farm legislation, family farmers are. Limiting farm \npayments to those who provide the food security of this country ought \nto be the farm policy of this country and this legislation is a step in \nthat direction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kennedy, and Mrs. \n        Murray):\n  S. 668. A bill to amend the Child Care and Development Block Grant \nAct of 1990 to provide incentive grants to improve the quality of child \ncare; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Child Care \nQuality Incentive Act of 2003.\n  This legislation seeks to address low child care payment or \nreimbursement rates. Payment rates determine the level at which States \nwill reimburse child care providers who care for those low-income \nchildren who receive a subsidy.\n  Low payment rates directly affect the kind of care children get and \nwhether families can find quality child care in their communities. Low \npayment rates mean limited parental access to quality child care.\n  Child care providers are also affected when rates are set below the \nmarket rate. Low payment rates force child care providers serving low-\nincome children to cut corners in ways that lower the quality of child \ncare such as reducing staff or decreasing salaries and benefits, \neliminating professional development opportunities, and forgoing books \nand other literacy materials. Providers who avoid this route may simply \nnot accept low-income children with subsidies or may even go out of \nbusiness.\n  These dilemmas can be avoided if we help states set payment rates \nthat keep pace with the marketplace.\n  Currently, the Child Care and Development Block Grant, CCDBG, \nrequires States to ensure that their rates are sufficient to ``ensure \nequal access'' for eligible families to child care services comparable \nto those available to non-eligible families in the private market. \nCCDBG regulations require states to conduct market rate surveys every\n\n[[Page S4019]]\n\nother year, but there is no requirement for states to actually use the \nmarket rate surveys to set payment rates.\n  Unfortunately, more than half of the States do not make payment rates \nbased on the 75th percentile, by which families could access care from \n75 out of 100 local providers, of a current market survey.\n  The need for quality child care has never been greater, as our \nwelfare reform policy directs more of our low-income families to find \nwork and our educational policy demands more of our students and \nschools. Yet, States, due to severe budget crunches, are cutting back \non rates and other quality initiatives and restricting eligibility for \nsubsidies.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Dodd, Kennedy, and Murray in \nonce again introducing the Child Care Quality Incentive Act, which \nseeks to redouble our child care efforts and renew the child care \npartnership with the States by providing incentive funding to increase \npayment rates.\n  Our legislation establishes a new, mandatory pool of funding under \nthe Child Care and Development Block Grant, CCDBG. This new funding, \ncoupled with mandatory, current market rate surveys, will form the \nfoundation for significant increases in state payment rates for the \nprovision of quality child care.\n  We have received overwhelming support for this bill from the child \ncare community, including endorsements from USA Child Care, Children's \nDefense Fund, Catholic Charities of USA, YMCA of USA, the National \nChild Care Association, and a host of organizations and agencies across \nthe country.\n  Children are the hope of America, and they need the best of America. \nWe cannot ask working families to choose between paying the rent, \nbuying food, and being able to afford the quality care their children \nneed. We've made a lot of progress in improving the health, safety, and \nwell-being of children in this country. If we are serious about putting \nparents to work and protecting children, we must invest more in child \ncare help for families.\n  This year, Congress is slated to reauthorize the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant. The time for action on rates is now. I urge my \ncolleagues to join Senators Dodd, Kennedy, Murray, and me in this \nendeavor to improve the quality of child care by cosponsoring the Child \nCare Quality Incentive Act and working to include its provisions in the \nCCDBG reauthorization.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 668\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Care Quality Incentive \n     Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Recent research on early brain development reveals that \n     much of a child's growth is determined by early learning and \n     nurturing care. Research also shows that quality early care \n     and education leads to increased cognitive abilities, \n     positive classroom learning behavior, increased likelihood of \n     long-term school success, and greater likelihood of long-term \n     economic and social self-sufficiency.\n       (2) Each day an estimated 13,000,000 children, including \n     6,000,000 infants and toddlers, spend some part of their day \n     in child care. However, a study in 4 States found that only 1 \n     in 7 child care centers provide care that promotes healthy \n     development, while 1 in 8 child care centers provide care \n     that threatens the safety and health of children.\n       (3) Full-day child care can cost $4,000 to $12,000 per \n     year.\n       (4) Although Federal assistance is available for child \n     care, funding is severely limited. Even with Federal \n     subsidies, many families cannot afford child care. For \n     families with young children and a monthly income under \n     $1,200, the cost of child care typically consumes 25 percent \n     of their income.\n       (5) Payment (or reimbursement) rates, which determine the \n     maximum the State will reimburse a child care provider for \n     the care of a child who receives a subsidy, are too low to \n     ensure that quality care is accessible to all families.\n       (6) Low payment rates directly affect the kind of care \n     children get and whether families can find quality child care \n     in their communities. In many instances, low payment rates \n     force child care providers serving low-income children to cut \n     corners in ways that impact the quality of care for the \n     children, including reducing the number of staff, eliminating \n     professional development opportunities, and cutting enriching \n     educational activities and services.\n       (7) Children in low-quality child care are more likely to \n     have delayed reading and language skills, and display more \n     aggression toward other children and adults.\n       (8) Increased payment rates lead to higher quality child \n     care as child care providers are able to attract and retain \n     qualified staff, provide salary increases and professional \n     training, maintain a safe and healthy environment, and \n     purchase basic supplies, children's literature, and \n     developmentally appropriate educational materials.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to improve the \n     quality of, and access to, child care by increasing child \n     care payment rates.\n\n     SEC. 3.

which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary\n       Whereas, 50 years ago, nearly 1,800,000 Americans answered \n     the call to defend freedom in South Korea and fought the \n     common foe of communism with 21 allied countries under the \n     banner of the United Nations;\n       Whereas the United States suffered casualties of 36,577 \n     killed, 103,284 wounded, and 8,166 still missing in action \n     during the Korean War in some of the most horrific conditions \n     in the history of warfare;\n       Whereas 2003 marks the final year of the United States' \n     50th Anniversary of the Korean War Commemoration;\n       Whereas our Korean War veterans did not receive the proper \n     welcome home, thanks, or recognition for selfless service and \n     sacrifice that had been given to veterans of previous wars;\n       Whereas the bravery and sacrifices of our Korean War \n     veterans and their families and next of kin should be \n     properly honored and recognized, and the American people wish \n     to join in thanking and honoring Korean War veterans and \n     their families;\n       Whereas it is important to include the history of the \n     Korean War in the curricula of our schools so that future \n     generations will learn about and appreciate the sacrifices of \n     our Korean War heroes; and\n       Whereas the final year of the 50th Anniversary of the \n     Korean War Commemoration should be recognized by a national \n     effort of programs and activities to officially thank, honor, \n     and welcome home our Korean War veterans, and to officially \n     thank and honor their families and next of kin: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) shall assemble in the Chamber of the House of \n     Representatives on [__] for the purpose of declaring to the \n     Nation and the world that the American people will never \n     forget our veterans or those who served our Nation on the \n     home front during the Korean War;\n       (2) designates 2003 as the Year of the Korean War Veteran;\n       (3) requests the President to issue a proclamation calling \n     on the people of the United States to observe 2003 with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities to thank, honor, and \n     welcome home our Korean War veterans; and\n       (4) urges the chief executives of the States, and the chief \n     executives of the political subdivisions of the States, to \n     issue a proclamation calling upon the citizens of such State \n     or political subdivision to ``Pause to Remember'' our Korean \n     War veterans and their families and next of kin with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I rise to call attention to an \nimportant milestone in our national history. Fifty-three years ago, \narmed forces from communist North Korea stormed across the 38th \nParallel and brutally invaded South Korea. For the first time in \nhistory, a coalition of 21 nations' forces--most of them Americans--\nrallied under the aegis of the United Nations to join the South Korean \nForces in staving off the communist challenge.\n  In the end, these heroes, fighting courageously under some of the \nmost horrific conditions in the history of warfare, prevailed against \nthe invading forces.\n  An Armistice ending the hostilities in Korea and forever halting the \nspread of international communism was signed fifty years ago on 27 July \n1953.\n  During the Korean War approximately 1.8 million Americans fought in\n\n[[Page S4021]]\n\nplaces like the Naktong Bulge, the Pusan perimeter, Inchon, Kunu-ri, \nthe ``Frozen Chosin'', Pork Chop Hill and Heartbreak Ridge.\n  Nearly 37,000 Americans lost their lives, over 100,000 were wounded, \nand more than 8,000 were taken prisoner or went missing in action. Some \n50 years later, approximately 8166 Americans remain missing in action \nfrom the Korean War.\n  Today, as we face the challenges of a new pending war and \ninternational terrorism we look with pride and respect to our Korean \nWar veterans for their example of absolute dedication and sacrifice to \nthe defense of freedom. Our Korean War veterans faced formidable odds \nand endured harsh and inhumane conditions in furthering our Nation's \nproud heritage of honor and valor in the face of overwhelming \nadversity.\n  As the United States marks the fiftieth Anniversary of the signing of \nthe Armistice that ended the hostilities in South Korea, all Americans \nmust ``Pause to Remember'' our Korean War veterans and their families \nand next of kin.\n  We thank and honor all Korean War veterans with hearts filled with \npride. Today, the Republic of Korea stands as a proud testament to the \nsacrifices of 1.8 million Americans. Today, South Koreans enjoy a \nthriving economy and taste the fruits of a marvelous democracy. During \nthe year 2003, let all Americans thank and honor our Korean War \nveterans for serving Freedom and Democracy with such distinction and \nvalor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/19/senate-section/article/S4021-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 275.

Res. 23, setting forth the \ncongressional budget for the United States Governments for fiscal year \n2004 and including the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal year \n2003 and for fiscal years 2005 through 2013; which was ordered to lie \non the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. POINT OF ORDER REQUIRING THAT THE AMT BE DEALT WITH \n                   BEFORE OR SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH OTHER TAX CUTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The American taxpayers are threatened with a looming \n     crisis which is ignored by the President's budget and the \n     budget resolution before the Senate, namely that a rapidly \n     growing number of middle income taxpayers will be subject to \n     the AMT, up from 2,000,000 currently to an estimated \n     36,000,000 by 2010.\n       (2) This crisis has come about as a result of two factors--\n       (A) that the Federal income tax is indexed for inflation, \n     but the AMT is not; and\n       (B) that President Bush sought and obtained huge new tax \n     cuts in 2001, which he is now seeking to make permanent, \n     without providing for corresponding, permanent adjustments to \n     the AMT.\n       (3) The President and the architects of this budget \n     resolution refuse to address the AMT on a permanent basis \n     because to do so would be costly and might jeopardize their \n     ability to enact additional tax cuts which primarily benefit \n     the wealthiest taxpayers at the expense of the estimated 85 \n     percent of families with two or more children who will \n     otherwise be affected by the AMT by 2010; the 43 percent of \n     taxpayers with annual incomes between $50,000 and $75,000 who \n     will otherwise be affected by the AMT by 2010; and the 80 \n     percent of taxpayers with annual income between $75,000 and \n     $100,000 who will otherwise be affected by the AMT by 2010.\n       (4) Congress must begin to address the issue of permanent \n     AMT reform by creating a point of order against further tax \n     cuts that do not include AMT reform.\n       (b) In General.--It shall not be in order in the Senate to \n     consider any bill or joint resolution, including a \n     reconciliation bill or resolution, or any amendment, motion, \n     or conference report thereto, that would allow tax cuts \n     unless such bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion or \n     conference report thereto contains, or Congress has \n     previously enacted, comprehensive legislation that reforms \n     the alternative minimum tax to protect taxpayers with annual \n     incomes under $100,000.\n       (c) Waiver and Appeal.--This section may be waived or \n     suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of \\3/5\\ \n     of the members, duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative vote of \n     \\3/5\\ of the Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, \n     shall be required in the Senate to sustain an appeal of the \n     ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised under this \n     section.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/19/senate-section/article/S4030-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4030-S4031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                     committee on foreign relations\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, we have agreed to have votes on several \npending amendments. I tell my colleagues, I am disappointed we are \ngoing to go out of session shortly. We stated our intention to stay in \nsession, stay in business, to receive amendments late into the night, \nto work to pass and/or to modify, to accept or to come up with second \ndegree amendments. We did not get as many amendments done as I had \nhoped.\n  We plan on being on this resolution from 9:30 in the morning until \nmidnight tomorrow. So I do not want colleagues coming to me and saying \nthey did not have a chance to offer their amendment. They had a chance \ntonight. They will have a chance tomorrow. I am trying to avoid a \ncalamity towards the end called a ``vote-athon'' that we have had in \nthe past. My colleague from Nevada and I know that is not the way the \nSenate should work, and we should avoid it if we possibly can.\n  We are going to be in on the bill tomorrow morning at 9:30. I urge \nMembers, if they have amendments, please share those amendments with \nus. I have not seen any amendments that are expected to be offered by \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I would like to see \nthem. We would like to review them. We would like to analyze them. We \nwould like to know what we are voting on.\n  I urge our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, if they have \namendments, please share those with us. Likewise, I say to any of my \ncolleagues, if they have amendments, I would like to share them with \nthe managers on the other side so we can cooperatively work and manage \nthis budget. It is very much the leader's intention and my intention to \nfinish this budget this week.\n  As with most budgets in the past, I expect we will have a lot of \nvotes. It needs to be done in a way that we know what we are voting on. \nSo I make those editorial comments. Again, I want to thank my \ncolleagues from Nevada and North Dakota. Both have been a pleasure to \nwork with. I hope we will have greater progress in moving amendments.\n  I mentioned in our unanimous consent request, which has already been \nagreed upon, we have three votes. My expectation would be that we would \nhave several other votes tacked on in addition to those. I hope we will \nhave substantive amendments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/19/senate-section/article/S4041-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, MARCH 20, 2003\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate completes its business today it stand in adjournment until 9:30 \na.m. on Thursday, March 20. I further ask that following the prayer and \nthe pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of \nproceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be \nreserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate resume \nconsideration of S. Con. Res. 23, the concurrent budget resolution; \nprovided further that there be 14\\1/2\\ hours remaining for debate on \nthe resolutions with 6\\1/2\\ hours remaining under the control of the \nchairman of the Budget Committee and 8 hours remaining under the \ncontrol of the ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in response to the earlier statements of my \ndear friend, the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, we have worked \nhard the last few days trying to work our way through this very \ndifficult legislation. It is always this way. It is very difficult. The \nreason we do it this way is it is statutory. We are doing our best.\n  We stand on the brink of a war. The two leaders have met today to \ntalk about the fact that when this does start, there will be a pause of \nsome time to be determined by the leaders so that Members can speak \nabout what is going on in Iraq. I think I speak for the entire Senate \nin this regard, as we leave the Senate tonight, our thoughts and our \nprayers are with the Commander in Chief of the United States military, \nGeorge Bush, and also with the hundreds of thousands of American troops \nwho are standing ready to go do what is appropriate at this time.\n  We recognize there are some who feel this is not the right time, but \nas Americans we always rally around our troops. This time is going to \nbe no different. The minute the first shot is fired, with rare \nexception, all Americans will be recognizing what we feel here tonight \nis that there is a strong sense of urgency to making sure that we do \nthe business of this Nation in the Senate and work to complete whatever \nbusiness is necessary to make sure those people who are fighting for \nus--lives are going to be lost--have everything they need and more.\n  As we retire tonight, I think I speak for the entire Senate when I \nsay our thoughts and prayers are with those who have to make this \nmomentous decision, especially the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friend and colleague from Nevada for his \ncomments in support of the President and the troops. We do wish them \nGodspeed and God's blessing and protection as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/19/senate-section/article/S4041-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
