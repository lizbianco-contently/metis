Mr. President, I will discuss this morning a very \nimportant issue of legal reform that is needed in the United States. I \nhave been a practicing lawyer for most of my adult life and have \nlitigated in quite a number of different forums. I believe in the legal \nsystem. It is critical for America's vitality. There is no doubt in my \nmind the strength of this American democracy, the power of our economy, \nour ability to maintain freedom and progress is directly dependent on \nthe superb legal system of which we are a part.\n  We have a magnificent number of lawyers around this country. Some \nhave been criticized, and rightly so, but for the most part they are \ngood, aggressive attorneys utilizing the laws that are available.\n  This Congress passes laws involving litigation in America. It is \nincumbent upon us as the years and centuries go by to periodically \nreview what is happening in our courts. We ask ourselves, are the \nresults that are occurring effective? Are they furthering our national \npolicy, correcting wrongs, punishing wrongdoers, generating \ncompensation for those who suffer losses in a fair and objective way?\n  Anyone who knows much about the system today knows there are some \nproblems. Lawyers are utilizing principles of law that enhance the \nproblem. There are court decisions that allow them to go further than \nthey have before. As a result, everyone is paying huge amounts of money \nfor insurance. Americans buy a homeowner's policy with an umbrella in \ncase someone sues them. Americans in business review their insurance \nand liability policies on a regular basis, frequently calling insurance \ncompanies and asking for more coverage, more protection. Without even \nasking for more coverage and more protection, the rates are going up \nall over America.\n  One matter we need to talk about and act on is class action lawsuits. \nA bill to reform class action lawsuits has been considered for a number \nof years in this body. It was considered in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee of which I am a member. After several years of\n\n[[Page S12422]]\n\ndiscussion we voted it out this year by a 12-7 vote, a bipartisan vote. \nSeveral Democrats and all Republicans voted for it. It is a bill that \nis responsible. It is restrained. It will do the job in many of the \ncases where abuses are occurring. It is the right thing to do. It can \nhelp balance the scales a bit in litigation. It will help fulfill the \nresponsibility of this Congress to monitor how our laws are working in \nthe real world. As a result, we can fix the problems out there.\n\n  What is a class action? A class action is a litigation filed by a \nplaintiff's attorney on behalf of not just one alleged wrong person, \nbut on a class or a group. The lawyer files the case in a court against \na defendant, or maybe more than one defendant, on behalf of a large \ngroup of plaintiffs who he alleges suffered similar losses and \ntherefore the case should be tried in one forum, a verdict rendered, \nand each plaintiff then told what they ought to get as compensation for \nthe losses they have incurred.\n  A class action is good. Some people have been so upset about class \naction abuses they think we ought to throw the baby out with the bath \nwater. That is not true. A good class action is good for everyone. For \nexample, if a national company made a defective product and shipped it \nall over America and they were negligent in doing so, they ought to be \nresponsible for the damages that product has caused in America. For \nevery person, maybe hundreds of thousands, even millions to file a \nlawsuit in every circuit court in America makes no sense. We have a \nvehicle by which it can be brought in a single court, and it can go \nforward from that point.\n  Where can you file? You can file, amazingly, in almost any venue in \nAmerica. The plaintiff can search this country over to select the \nsingle most favorable forum for his lawsuit and the single most \nfavorable district in America. That is a lot to choose from. That is \none of the problems we have with class actions.\n  There are a number of other problems. Lawyers are alert to this. Some \nspecialize in this kind of litigation. They identify something they \nthink is wrong. Maybe no victim has even complained about it. They \nidentify the victim and talk them into filing the lawsuit. They pay \nlittle attention to the plaintiff they name as the lead plaintiff in a \nlawsuit.\n  I know of one case in Alabama where the defendant died, and was dead \nfor quite some time, and the lawsuit just went right on as if nothing \nhad ever happened. There was not even a named plaintiff living as the \ncentral plaintiff in the lawsuit.\n  But that points out to me that the case becomes, after a period of \ntime, driven by the plaintiff's lawyer and driven by the interests of \nthe defendant. And if it is filed in a smaller rural circuit court, the \njudge could be overwhelmed with a huge amount of litigation and want it \noff his docket.\n  So really the abuse occurs like this: The plaintiff is in a situation \nwhere each victim is only entitled to a little bit of money. I will \ntalk about some of those cases in a little bit as to what kind of \nverdicts get rendered. So they get a little bit for 200,000 plaintiffs, \nand then they get their fee--multimillion-dollar fees.\n  The judge is happy because this case could have gone on for years and \nclogged up his busy circuit court docket in rural Illinois or Alabama \nor Texas. He is glad to have it gone.\n  The defendant wants the case gone. The defendant has no \nresponsibility to the individual plaintiffs in the class. The defendant \nwants the case gone. So what does he do? He will agree to pay the \nattorneys very high fees and the plaintiffs themselves small amounts of \ncompensation to get rid of the case. And it goes off the docket which \nis completely wiped clean.\n  So there are some problems that are out there, and it is not healthy. \nWe have had a string of those cases that have occurred around the \ncountry that have not been becoming of the legal system.\n  The lawyers' primary interest should be to their clients. Courts \nshould have a primary interest in seeing that justice is done. \nDefendants ought to pay for what they are required to pay and the \nlosses that have occurred. But defendants ought not to be intimidated \nor coerced or extorted really by the threat of a major lawsuit going on \nfor years in which their company is abused and abused in court for some \nminor wrong they are willing to pay to correct and willing to \ncompensate the victims for.\n  So they are in court, and they are willing to pay. They want to fix \nit, but, no, no, that is not enough. They want punitive damages and \nmore litigation time. And just to get rid of it, defendants agree to \npay, and they agree to compensate. Oftentimes--and there are quite a \nnumber of cases that show this--the lawyers are the ones who really get \nthe compensation, and not the victims.\n  In many of the cases, the liability is very dubious, but the \ncompanies feel obliged to pay something to get out of the lawsuit, \nanyway. The damages are very speculative. Sometimes damages have never \neven really been proven.\n  I want to mention one more thing about the venue. Let's assume a \nmajor automobile company designed an automobile--and they have had \ncases of this kind--and the seatbelt is defective, and maybe it poses a \nrisk or maybe, when you put it on, it bruises your hand and causes a \nblister or otherwise is designed in a way that is not as fine as it \nshould have been designed.\n  Let's say someone wants to file a lawsuit against one of the major \nmanufacturers in Detroit. They do not have to file that lawsuit in \nDetroit. They can go all over America and find somebody who was damaged \nby that seatbelt. And there will be that kind of vehicle in every \ncounty in America, no doubt about it. They can go to counties in which \nthere is only one sitting circuit judge who they happen to know who \nperhaps is favorable to plaintiffs' cases. They can pick the county in \nAmerica they think has the most favorable jury for these kinds of \ncases, and they can then file their suit there and begin this kind of \naction we have seen here. Not only can they do that, they do that.\n  There is a county, I believe in southern Illinois, where routinely \ncases of this kind are chosen to be filed out of the whole United \nStates because they believe it is favorable. The same has been true--\n``60 Minutes,'' I believe, or one of the shows on television has shown \nthis to have occurred in Mississippi. They named the county and \ninterviewed the people there, and they talked about the verdicts that \nare rendered there. And it is not healthy.\n  They have done it in Alabama, my home State. We passed some tort \nreform, and Alabama laws have improved, but there are still cases being \nfiled there and in other States. They choose the most favorable forum. \nThis is not what our Founders had in mind.\n  Let me read from the Constitution, the part of the Constitution that \nis relevant to this issue. It is article III, section 2, dealing with \nthe courts. It talks about the power of the Federal courts and what \ntheir jurisdiction is. It says:\n\n       The judicial Power [of the United States] shall extend to \n     all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this \n     Constitution, the Laws of the United States, . . .\n\n  And it goes on to say:\n\n     to Controversies to which the United States shall be a \n     Party;--to Controversies between two or more States;--between \n     a State and Citizens of another State;--between Citizens of \n     different States; . . .\n\n  Now our Founding Fathers had thought about this issue, and the issue \nis: If you have a lawsuit filed between a person from Alabama and a \ndefendant from Massachusetts, maybe at the time of the founding of our \ncountry and even to this very day, the person in Massachusetts might \nnot be comfortable having his case tried in Alabama or vice versa. So \nthey say: What do you do if you have a lawsuit between two States? The \nhome-State plaintiff, for example, can choose the forum. He can have a \nfriendly court. Maybe he knows all the jurors on the jury in the jury \nbox. Maybe the judge goes to church with him. Maybe they are best \nfriends and play golf together. And he is going to sue a fellow way off \nthere, who has a lot of money, and he will just have a little friendly \nhelp for his local constituents.\n  That is what the Founding Fathers thought about. In football we call \nit home cooking, or in baseball, if you get adverse opinions by the \numpire against a visiting team. So it is home cooking. They prevented \nthat. They put it in the Constitution. They would go to Federal court \nwhere judges are not elected judges but they are lifetime-appointed\n\n[[Page S12423]]\n\njudges. Any appeal from their ruling goes to the U.S. Supreme Court in \nWashington, DC. Why? Because that would be a more objective, fair \nforum.\n  Now, good and clever plaintiff lawyers have learned if they sue \nGeneral Motors or Ford or Chrysler, who are headquartered maybe in \nDetroit, on behalf of an Alabama or an Illinois citizen--then that case \nis going to be in Federal court, right? That is what the Constitution \nsays--but, no, they will also add the local Ford dealership in Illinois \nor Alabama or Mississippi or Colorado, wherever they file the lawsuit \nthat they choose is the best place. They will name one defendant, at \nleast, who is in that same State, and it breaks diversity under case \nlaw, and the case gets tried in the local State.\n  So the principle there is important. In a case involving a class \naction, in which you are involving hundreds of thousands of plaintiffs \nall over America in every State in America, and the prime defendant, \nthe central, responsible defendant is an out-of-State corporation, our \nFounding Fathers, I have no doubt, believed that should be in Federal \ncourt.\n  So I say to my friends who are concerned about federalizing \nlitigation--and they believe States ought to be able to set their own \nrules for litigation--I really, truly say to you, this is not one of \nthose cases in which the Federal Government is taking over things they \nshould not take over. The Constitution contemplated those kinds of \ncases would be in Federal court, where you have a lifetime-appointed \nFederal judge, whose appeal will be to a court of appeals of a whole \nregion, and whose final appeal will be to the United States Supreme \nCourt, the Court that sits over the entire country.\n  So that is why I think we have had so much success in gaining support \nfor this reform. I believe we can do that. And for a whole lot of \nreasons, under the Federal laws we are able to pass, and under the \nleadership or jurisdiction of a Federal judge, we will have far fewer \nbad verdicts. We will reduce the ability of the plaintiff to choose the \nmost favorable forum in the whole United States in which to file a \nlawsuit.\n  Let me mention to you some of the cases. There are a lot of them that \nhave been out there that caused difficulties and have caused an uproar \nand a concern.\n  The Toshiba case, Shaw versus Toshiba Information Systems, was a \nclass action filed in Texas complaining of an entirely theoretical \ndefect in the floppy disk controllers of Toshiba laptops. They are sold \nall over America. Why did they choose a county in Texas to file a \nlawsuit? They were able to do that in a State court, even though the \nasserted defect had never resulted in injury to any user of the \ndefendant's product. Not a single one of the customers had ever \nreported a problem due to this defect. Facing a potential liability of \n$10 billion, what the plaintiffs claimed, Toshiba felt they needed to \nsettle the claim, and they did.\n  This was the result: The class members received between $200 and \n$400. In cash? No; $200 and $400 off any future purchases they may make \nfrom Toshiba. They received no compensation. The two named plaintiffs \nin the lawsuit, individuals who bought this Toshiba laptop, received \n$25,000 each. And the attorneys, what did they receive? One hundred \nforty-seven point five million dollars. Tell me that is legitimate. Not \nso.\n  Here is one with Blockbuster. A class action suit was filed in \nTexas--another Texas case--which alleged Blockbuster had unfairly \ncharged for overdue movie rentals. They had overcharged people when \nthey were late turning in their video rentals. They were faced with 23 \nlawsuits in 13 other jurisdictions around the country. This was a class \naction lawsuit. They decided they better settle the case. In the \nsettlement, the trial lawyers received $9.25 million in fees and \nexpenses. The individual plaintiffs who were alleged to have been \nwronged received two free movie rentals and $1 off coupons for future \nmovie rentals. They got nothing, no money paid out of pocket directly \nof the $9.25 million. I suspect some of those plaintiffs didn't even \nknow they were being named as a plaintiff in the case. They got a $1 \ncoupon, threw it in the trash can, just like you throw them in the \ntrash can that come out of your newspaper. You don't have time to fool \nwith them.\n  Here is one with Sony Pictures. Typical of how these things can \ndevelop. In advertising for their films, Sony wrongfully created a \nfictional film reviewer. This fictional film reviewer fabricated some \nquotes. Despite Sony's numerous apologies and offer to pay $350,000 to \nsettle the inquiry by a State attorney, a class action was filed. Sony \nwas willing to pay. They knew they had messed up. They were willing to \npay. That is so often the case in these matters. The lawyers then went \nout and found two moviegoers to head the class of plaintiffs. They \nclaimed they were jousted into seeing ``A Knight's Tale,'' the movie, \nby ads quoting this fictional reviewer calling the films lead actor the \nyear's hottest new star.\n  It was all bogus, which most of us know those ads are bogus anyway. \nThe attorney originally sought refunds on the ticket prices but later \ndemanded $4.5 million to settle the case.\n  There is a host of other cases. I could go on.\n  Aetna, a Federal judge awarded $24 million in attorney's fees out of \nan $82 million settlement in a class action against Aetna. There was \none against Golf Digest, Cell Phones. The Bank of Boston case, which \ninvolved my State of Alabama, was pretty egregious also. A class action \nwas filed by a Chicago attorney against the Bank of Boston, and they \ndecided to file it in Mobile County, AL. That is odd, is it not? The \ncase alleged that the bank did not promptly post interest to real \nestate escrow accounts. The settlement limited the maximum recovery for \nthe class members to $9. After the State approved the settlement, the \nbank disbursed more than $8 million to the class action attorney in \nlegal fees, and credited most of the accounts of the victims with \npaltry sums. The legal fees, equal to 5.3 percent of the balance in \neach account, were debited to those accounts. So the attorney's legal \nfees were taken out of the bank accounts of the class victims. A lot of \nthese people did not even know a class action had been filed, let alone \nthat they owed an attorney a fee for the $9 in recovery he had received \nfor them.\n\n  What is even worse is that for a number of accounts, the debit to \ntheir account exceeded the credit they obtained in the settlement, \nmeaning that the attorney's fees that came out of their account \nexceeded the $9 benefit they had received from the class action \nsettlement.\n  For example, Dexter Kamowitz of Maine, who did not initiate the \nlawsuit against the Bank of Boston and probably knew little about it, \nreceived a credit of $2.19 under the class action settlement. At the \nsame time the class action attorney debited his account for $91.33 for \nlegal fees, producing a net loss of $89.14. Such results, as might be \nexpected, produced outrage from class members in other States around \nthe country. Judge Frank Easterbrook, Circuit Judge of the Seventh \nCircuit, asked this question: What right does Alabama have to instruct \nfinancial institutions headquartered in Florida to debit the account of \ncitizens in Maine and other States?\n  That is a good question. How can a circuit court in Alabama order a \nbank headquartered in Florida to debit the account of a victim in \nMaine? That is bizarre. That is the kind of thing we are dealing with.\n  This bill has received great scrutiny. It is not going to end class \nactions. It is going to end the abuses of class actions. It will take \nonly the biggest, clearly interstate cases of class actions. It will \nallow them to be tried before a more neutral forum of a Federal court. \nIt will provide some controls in the way these cases are handled, the \nway attorney's fees are set. It will control the abuses of coupon-type \nsettlements. It will do a lot of things that are very healthy and \nproper and appropriate and overdue.\n  That is what we need to do in this matter. Class actions will \ncontinue. They can continue in State court, if it is primarily a State \nclass. They can continue in Federal court, if it is primarily a Federal \nclass. That is the right thing for us to do.\n  We need to bring it up in the Senate before this session is over. If \nwe do that, we will have served our constituents well. We will have \nmonitored the legal system that we set up, control, and regulate by the \nlaws we pass. We will have responded to abuses and created a system \nthat is fair and more\n\n[[Page S12424]]\n\njust for the plaintiffs, the defendants, and the particular plan.\n\n  I thank the Chair, and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 1689, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1689) making emergency appropriations for Iraq \n     and Afghanistan security and reconstruction for the fiscal \n     year ending September 30, 2004, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Byrd amendment No. 1818, to impose a limitation on the use \n     of sums appropriated for the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction \n     Fund.\n       Byrd/Durbin amendment No. 1819, to prohibit the use of Iraq \n     Relief and Reconstruction Funds for low priority activities \n     that should not be the responsibility of U.S. taxpayers, and \n     shift $600 million from the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction \n     Fund to Defense Operations and Maintenance, Army, for \n     significantly improving efforts to secure and destroy \n     conventional weapons, such as bombs, bomb materials, small \n     arms, rocket propelled grenades, and shoulder-launched \n     missiles, in Iraq.\n       Reid (for Stabenow) amendment No. 1823, to provide \n     emergency relief for veterans healthcare, school \n     construction, healthcare and transportation needs in the \n     United States, and to create 95,000 new jobs.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly. I understand the \nSenator from North Dakota is also going to speak. I want to talk on \nthis piece of legislation but, more importantly, on the overall \napproach we take toward fighting terrorism as a nation.\n  First off, as to this bill, which is obviously an extraordinarily \nexpensive bill--over $80 billion, much of which goes to support our \nforces in Iraq, which is absolutely critical, and some of which goes to \nassisting in the rebuilding of Iraq--many of my colleagues and others \nhave questioned the dollars going to the rebuilding of Iraq and whether \nthat is an appropriate way to spend American tax dollars. I think, \nhowever, we have to look at this issue not from the standpoint of \nwhether it is benefiting Iraq but whether it is benefiting us, the \nAmerican people.\n  I don't think there is any question but that it benefits the American \npeople. Our purpose here is to defeat terrorism. Our purpose here is to \nundermine the capacity of those people who would use violence against \nAmericans and against our system and against our Nation. We learned \nfrom 9/11, regrettably, that there are, unfortunately, groups out there \nwho subscribe to what is known as Muslim fundamentalism, who are \nwilling to pervert the Muslim faith, and who wish to pursue actions of \nviolence against us as a nation, and against Americans as people, \nsimply because we exist. For whatever reasons, they see us as their \nenemies, and there are a variety of reasons, which I will not go into. \nThey obviously have the capacity and have shown their willingness to do \nus damage and harm. We have to respond to that.\n  Fortunately, we have a President who understands this--understands it \nin a way that I think many of us don't fully appreciate. I happen to, \nhowever, greatly admire it. The fact is, in President Bush we have \nsomeone who is very focused on the issue of protecting the United \nStates and all Americans, defeating the threat of terrorism, and \nfinding terrorists and bringing them to justice before they can do us \nharm. As part of that effort, there is a philosophy that I think is \nvery appropriate that we are pursuing as a nation, which is that we \nwill go out and find the terrorists before they can find us. We will \nkick over the rocks under which they hide and bring them to justice in \nwhatever manner is appropriate--before they can get out from underneath \nthe rocks under which they hide and plan to attack us. The basic theory \nis to cause the terrorists to worry about where they are going to sleep \ntonight rather than to be thinking about whom they are going to attack \ntomorrow.\n  It requires an aggressive international policy, but it is a policy \ndirected at protecting us, Americans, across our Nation, giving us a \nbetter opportunity of avoid another 9/11, another attack on our country \non our soil. As part of that effort, we have replaced a dictatorial, \nrepressive, genocidal, maniacal regime in Iraq, a regime which clearly \nrepresented a threat to its neighbors and was a breeding ground for \nterrorists and a potential, if not real, supporter of those who would \ndo us harm in the United States.\n  The strategy of the war was brilliantly executed by our military, our \nmen and women. We have to admire their courage, their expertise, and \nthe manner in which they comported themselves in Iraq. Their success \nmilitarily is in large part due to the fact that we are willing to \nspend our national treasury to support them, and we must continue to \ndo that. That is what this supplemental is about.\n\n  So supporting our troops with the dollars they need and the equipment \nthey require is a given. There is no one in this body who would \nquestion that.\n  The second part is the rebuilding of Iraq. Why is that important to \nus as a nation? Well, if we are going to undermine the fundamentalist \nMuslim terrorist threat, we must undermine their breeding ground, where \nthey are able to recruit, and their philosophy for recruitment.\n  We have been extremely successful as a nation so far, I believe, in \npursuing a tactical war against terrorists, and we can continue this \ntactical war and we will probably have to continue it for years to \ncome. By that I mean finding the terrorists, following the dollars, \ntracking them down, using our expertise, our intelligence capability, \nand our military to neutralize their ability to attack us--whether it \nis in Afghanistan, Iraq, Buffalo, or Seattle--finding them before they \ncan do us harm, eliminating their resources and sources of resources, \nand working an international coalition of law enforcement agencies and \nmilitary forces that is capable of doing them physical harm before they \ncan do us physical harm.\n  That is a tactical approach. It is one that is being pursued with \ngreat aggressiveness at all sorts of different levels--internationally, \nof course, and obviously in Iraq and Iran, but across the globe, such \nas in the Philippines and India and Pakistan, and domestically with the \ncreation of the Homeland Security Department and the restructuring of \nour own domestic law enforcement community.\n  But that is tactical. That means you find the individual or the cell, \nyou find the group of fundamentalist terrorists who are gathered \ntogether, you get the information on where they are, you disrupt them \nand, if you can bring them to justice, you do. That is tactical. That \nis not going to resolve the problem for us because, regrettably, no \nmatter how you look at this, if you are honest about it, there is a \ncultural and a religious issue involved.\n  There are a billion people in this world who subscribe to the Muslim \nfaith. It is a strong and good faith with an incredible history. But if \nonly 1 percent of those billion people are attracted to the perversion \nof that faith and follow a Muslim fundamentalist view of the world--\nterrorist view of the world--that is 10 million people. That is \npotentially 10 million people who want to do us physical harm. \nHopefully, it is not that high.\n  So if we are to pursue a lasting resolution of this issue, a tactical \napproach will keep us, hopefully, safer, but it will not resolve the \nunderlying problem. We need much more of a strategic approach, \nsomething that looks at the forces which create the threat and \nundermines those forces. That is where the issue of addressing the \nreconstruction of Iraq comes in. There are a variety of ways we can \naddress people who are members of the Muslim faith, especially in the \nMiddle East and show them that we, as a nation, are not a threat to \nthem but are actually an avenue of opportunity. But today those options \ndon't really exist in the Middle East.\n\n  If we can prove to people who subscribe to the Muslim faith and might\n\n[[Page S12425]]\n\nbe attracted to a fundamentalist terrorist approach that democracy \nworks and is a great option for them, the market-oriented approach \nworks and there is great opportunity for them, that education that \nencompasses the expansion of the mind relative to not only Western \nvalues, but Eastern values, and the issues of especially science and \nits potentials is of great value, then we will have created an \nopportunity for people to take a different look at what we stand for as \na nation and say: Maybe rather than being a threat, you are an avenue \nof opportunity.\n  That is where Iraq comes in. If we are able to settle Iraq over the \nnext 3 to 5 years in a way which allows it to grow as a democracy, in a \nway which allows it to grow as a market economy, in a way which allows \nits people, especially its children, to attend schools which teach a \nvariety of values and especially the opportunities which come from \nquality education, if we are able to produce such an Iraq, it will be a \nshining light in the middle of the Middle East. It will be a place that \npeople can look to and say, My goodness, democracy does work; market \neconomies do mean more prosperity for my family and me; balanced \neducation is a good thing. We will have set up a natural magnet to \nattract a positive view of these forces which have done so much for us \nas a nation and for the West, specifically democracy, market economies, \nand education.\n  Today that does not exist really in the Middle East, but this is our \nopportunity, an unintended consequence possibly of this war in Iraq, \nbut clearly a potential consequence of significant and positive \nopportunity to create an Iraq, one of the larger nations in the Middle \nEast and one of the wealthier nations in the Middle East, a nation with \nexceptional history and with a people who have historically been \nextraordinarily productive, to create a nation which realizes the \ndreams of freedom, opportunity, economic well-being, and education, \nwhich most people in the world subscribe to and desire, and that is why \nstabilizing Iraq is so important. If we accomplish that, we will \nfundamentally undermine the philosophy of the Muslim fundamentalists \nand their message to the Middle Eastern population, which is that \nAmerica is a threat, an enemy, and that Americans must be destroyed and \nour culture must be attacked.\n  It will benefit us Americans in our country; it will benefit us in \nNew Hampshire; it will benefit us in New York; it will benefit us in \nPennsylvania; it will benefit us in California to have a nation in the \nMiddle East which is a viable option to the threat and the message of \nfundamental Islam that goes to this whole strategic issue.\n  As we pursue our fight against terrorism, we have to have a two-track \napproach, in my mind. One is tactical, which I outlined. That is what \nwe are doing in Afghanistan, obviously, and in Iraq with our military. \nIt is what we are doing in working to break up the money in the \nEuropean countries and to find the cells in the United States, and what \nwe have to continue to pursue aggressively through the Department of \nHomeland Security, the FBI, and the CIA.\n  At the same time, we need to have a strategic track. It has to go \nbeyond just reconstructing an Iraq and making it a democratic nation. \nIt has to go to messaging. It has to go to communication. It has to go \nto education. We need to spend significant thought on planning and \nprobably treasury on the issue of a strategic approach to set up \ndifferent initiatives which will have the effect of undermining the \ncapacity of the Muslim fundamentalists to recruit and to make their \ncase against America by communicating more effectively throughout the \nMiddle East and also across other Muslim nations in the southeast, such \nas the Philippines and Indonesia, and Pakistan, by creating initiatives \nwhich encourage market-oriented approaches, which encourage leaders who \nsubscribe to democracy, which encourage leaders who subscribe to \neducation.\n\n  It has to be more than just a haphazard exercise. It actually has to \nbe a structured exercise. It is much more difficult, much less tangible \nthan a tactical approach, but it needs the same type of attention and \nenergy.\n  We are not doing that right now as a nation. We are certainly not \ndoing that as a government, in my opinion, and we as a Congress should \nbe thinking about how we can do this.\n  As we move down this road, I believe this is something to which we \nhave to pay significant attention, but clearly, one step in this \nexercise of a strategic approach is to assist in the creation of a \ndemocratic, market-oriented nation in the middle of the Middle East, \nspecifically Iraq, which subscribes to the teaching of its young a \nvalue system which is consistent with the beliefs of freedom and \ndemocracy and market forces. That is why it is so imperative that we \nmake this investment in Iraq. It is not about protecting them. It is \nnot about rebuilding Iraq, although that is certainly an outcome of it. \nIt is about creating an opportunity to undermine the sources which \nbreed the fundamentalist Islamic movement and, thus, lessening the \nthreat against Americans and our culture.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota who \nhas an amendment and a longer statement. I ask unanimous consent that \nhe be recognized after me to offer his amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, is there an amendment pending?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Reid-Stabenow amendment is \npending.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent that amendment be temporarily set \naside so that I may offer an amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1825\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Mikulski and ask that it be immediately considered.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for himself and Ms. \n     Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered 1825.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To provide additional VA Medical Care Funds for the \n                    Department of Veterans Affairs)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION MEDICAL \n                                  CARE\n\n       For an additional amount for medical care and related \n     activities under this heading for fiscal year 2004, \n     $1,300,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 2005.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this is an amendment that Senator Mikulski \nand I believe is very important to provide adequate funding for medical \ncare for the Veterans Affairs Department. This amendment provides $1.3 \nbillion in emergency funding for the Department of VA medical care \naccount which truly is an emergency.\n  This amendment addresses the medical care needs of returning \nservicemembers from Iraq and Afghanistan who will require medical care \nservice from the VA.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the VA cannot currently keep up with \nthe demand of the current veteran population, as illustrated by the \ntens of thousands of veterans who have been told to wait at least 6 \nmonths to get an appointment. Even more distressing is the fact that \nmany of them may have to wait up to 2 full years, and that is \nunacceptable. If the VA cannot currently help those who are in the \nsystem, how will they be able to help those veterans returning from \nIraq and Afghanistan?\n  In the legislation before us today, we have provided emergency funds \nfor the Department of Defense to fight these wars and reconstruction \nfunds to ensure that we win the peace, we secure the peace and bring \nour troops home. I support these funds. They are vitally needed. I hope \nwe can get them approved when we return. However, I believe we also \nneed to ensure that when\n\n[[Page S12426]]\n\nour troops do return home, the Government will be there to treat their \nmedical care needs. If we are willing to provide emergency funding to \nfight the wars, we must be willing to provide emergency funding to meet \nthe medical care needs to treat the injuries and the wounds suffered by \nour valiant heroes in the wars. In other words, we must ensure that \nthere is a continuum of care for our service members from basic \ntraining to deployment to discharge.\n  Let me illustrate the current pressing and urgent needs for these \nemergency funds. According to a September 2, 2003, Washington Post \narticle, the number of service members wounded in action in Iraq totals \n1,124 since the war began in March. This Post article states:\n\n       The rising number and quickening pace of soldiers being \n     wounded on the battlefield have been overshadowed by the \n     number of troops killed since President Bush declared an end \n     to major combat operations May 1.\n\n  USA Today, in this past Wednesday's edition, has reported that at \nleast seven times as many men and women have been wounded in battle as \nthose killed in battle. This is a copy of that article, and it is \nentitled ``Trip Home is Just Start of Road Back.''\n  I am not going to offer these articles for the Record but I would \nrefer those publications to my colleagues who are interested. We know \nthe wounded are arriving in Washington every week. I point out these \nnumbers do not include military men and women who are returning from \nAfghanistan and other parts of the world after fighting the war on \nterrorism.\n  According to the VA, some of our returning service men and women are \ncurrently being served through VA-DOD sharing agreements. Others, such \nas PVT Jessica Lynch, of whom we all know a great deal, are being \ndischarged and turning to the VA for specialized services. This level \nof demand for VA services has not been foreseen or anticipated.\n  Further, we know that overall demand for VA medical care is not going \nto lessen. We have already seen the VA medical care system being \noverwhelmed by the staggering increase in demand for its medical \nservices. Since 1996, the VA has seen a 50-percent increase in growth, \nor 2 million patients in total users of the medical care system. \nMoreover, enrollments have increased by some 3.1 million since 1999 \nalone, and the VA projects that its enrollments will grow by another 2 \nmillion patients from a current level of 7 million to 9 million in \n2009. This is a historic and unprecedented increase in the level of \nservice.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to support these emergency funds. At a \ntime of war with thousands of injured troops returning from battle, it \nis clearly an emergency to include these funds. It is our moral \nresponsibility to ensure that we provide adequate resources to the VA \nto meet the vital medical needs of our veterans. If these emergency \nfunds are not included in the bill, the VA will have enormous \ndifficulties in treating veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, \ndue to the current backlog of veterans waiting for care. Without those \nfunds, those waiting veterans will wait longer for medical care and the \nVA will be forced to deny medical care to another 585,000 veterans. I \ncannot accept these outcomes. I do not believe my colleagues will \naccept these outcomes. This is medical care they have earned through \nthe risk of life and limb, and all too often their long-term health.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to think about our service members who have \nalready returned from service, our service members who are continuing \nto serve and those who want to serve. If we do not provide these funds, \nwhat kind of message does this send to those currently fighting \noverseas and those who will be sent overseas?\n  I hope my colleagues agree with me that we want to tell these men and \nwomen that we will not turn our backs on them and that we will keep our \npromises to them.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Missouri if he \nwould add my name as a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. I would be happy to do so. I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Dorgan be added as a cosponsor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I believe there will be others who wish to do so. I thank \nthe Chair and I thank my colleague from North Dakota.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bond-Mikulski amendment. This \namendment is simple and straightforward. It would add $1.3 billion to \nthe Iraq and Afghanistan supplemental for veterans' medical care.\n  Our men and women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan have my steadfast \nsupport, and so do those men and women who fought before them. Our \nveterans need to know that America is with them, and that we owe them a \ndebt of gratitude. Congress should show that gratitude with deeds, not \njust words. That means making our troops and our veterans a priority in \nthe Federal checkbook.\n  As the ranking member on the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, my \nguiding principle for the VA budget is that promises made to our \nveterans must be promises kept. I believe this means no membership fees \nor toll charges on veterans to get health care or prescription drugs, \nand no waiting lines for veterans to get medical care or to get their \nclaims processed.\n  Under a law passed after the Persian Gulf war, VA must give priority \nto returning troops for immediate medical care. The Veterans Programs \nEnhancement Act of 1998 requires VA to provide 2 years of medical care \nbenefits for returning servicemembers. This law was originally passed \nto meet the medical care needs of veterans who served in the first \nPersian Gulf war. The law applies to servicemembers who are in Iraq \nnow.\n  But the VA medical care system is under tremendous stress. During \nAugust, I traveled to VA clinics across Maryland. I saw dedicated staff \nproviding quality medical care. But they are stretched to the limit.\n  Nationally, there are over 100,000 veterans waiting longer than 6 \nmonths to see a VA doctor. Some veterans are waiting as long as 2 \nyears. The wait for specialty care like spinal cord injury care, blind \nrehab, and prosthetics can be even worse. The Blinded Veterans \nAssociation tells us that there are 2,600 veterans waiting up to 1 year \nfor admission into a blind rehab center.\n  Our veterans didn't stand in waiting lines when they were called up \nto serve our country. They shouldn't have to stand in line or pay toll \ncharges to get the medical care they deserve. The Bond-Mikulski \namendment is necessary to keep our promises to our Nation's veterans by \nensuring that soldiers returning from war, and the veterans who fought \nbefore them, will get the medical care they deserve.\n  The President's budget proposed a new $250 annual membership fee for \nveterans, and increased copayments for veterans' prescription drugs and \nvisits to the doctor. Senator Bond and I have worked together on a \nbipartisan basis this year to reject these proposals. This funding will \nensure VA has the resources necessary to meet the needs of our veterans \nand returning troops.\n  I thank Senator Bond and urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Bond-Mikulski amendment described by \nthe Senator from Missouri makes a great deal of sense to me. It seems \nto me that keeping our promise to our veterans is also a part of \nnational security and national defense. We have a very serious problem \nin the VA health care system. It is going to grow worse, not better, \nand we need to add these resources.\n  As we know, the number of people who have been wounded in Iraq and \nare going to come back home and justifiably lay claim to the health \ncare they were promised in our VA system, we must provide the funding \nfor that.\n  I think all of us in this Chamber have had the experience of visiting \nwith veterans with respect to their experience in the VA health care \nsystem. They will tell us of seeing the posters of Uncle Sam pointing \nat them saying, Uncle Sam wants you, and on the bottom of the poster it \nsaid, free health care for life.\n  Many of our veterans have experienced something substantially less\n\n[[Page S12427]]\n\nthan that when they come home from having served our country, and that \nis why I think it is very important for us to provide the funding that \nis needed in the VA health care system.\n  I recall one day being at a town meeting and a man named Thor came up \nto me. He had served in the Air Corps in the Second World War, had \nfought for this country, had done all that his country had asked of \nhim, many years ago. Now he was without much income, in his late \nseventies, and he was having all kinds of health problems, some of it \nrelated to his service in the Second World War. He was not able to get \nthe help he needed.\n  The day he came to the meeting I held, he told me he was having \ntrouble with his teeth and could not eat. He had false teeth. His teeth \ndid not fit. They were cutting his mouth and he could not get new teeth \nfrom the VA system. At age 75 or 80 years of age, having served in the \nSecond World War, done for this country what this country asked him to \ndo, now living in very low-income circumstances, he should not have to \nbeg VA to get new teeth. That ought not be the way it happens.\n  I happened to get him new teeth because I had a friend who was a \ndentist. He talked to some people who run a laboratory and he was able \nto get a new set of teeth. But we ought to take care of these needs \nmore systematically. We ought to fund the VA health care system to \nprovide for the needs of these veterans. It is a promise we have made \nand, in my judgment, a promise we ought to keep. So I am pleased to add \nmy name as a cosponsor to the Bond-Mikulski amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1826\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The pending amendment is laid aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Durbin and Ms. Landrieu, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1826.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To require that Iraqi oil revenues be used to pay for \n                        reconstruction in Iraq)\n\n       Beginning on page 25, strike line 5, and all that follows \n     through page 28, line 15, and insert the following:\n\n                      financing of reconstruction\n\n       The President shall direct the head of the Coalition \n     Provisional Authority in Iraq, in coordination with the \n     Governing Council of Iraq or a successor governing authority \n     in Iraq, to establish an Iraq Reconstruction Finance \n     Authority. The purpose of the Authority shall be to obtain \n     financing for the reconstruction of the infrastructure in \n     Iraq by collateralizing the revenue from future sales of oil \n     extracted in Iraq. The Authority shall obtain financing for \n     the reconstruction of the infrastructure in Iraq through--\n       (1)(A) issuing securities or other financial instruments; \n     or\n       (B) obtaining loans on the open market from private banks \n     or international financial institutions; and\n       (2) to the maximum extent possible, securitizing or \n     collateralizing such securities, instruments, or loans with \n     the revenue from the future sales of oil extracted in Iraq.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I offer this amendment on behalf of myself and Senators \nDurbin and Landrieu. This amendment is identical to that which I \noffered in the Appropriations Committee, and which lost on a 15-to-14 \nvote. It is the identical language. So my colleagues on the \nAppropriations Committee, at least, will be acquainted with the \nprovisions and the specific language of this amendment.\n  My colleague spoke earlier today about the goals we share for Iraq--\nour country's objectives in the Middle East and around the world. We \nall want the Iraqi people to have a better country and to be able to \ncontrol their own destiny. We all want to foster a democracy in Iraq, \nin which the Iraqi people are free to make their own decisions, could \nbuild a model economy with a market system that works, one that \nprovides an expansion of economic opportunity and jobs for the Iraqi \npeople--all of us would aspire to have that happen.\n  Some of my colleagues, however, have said this can only happen if you \ninevitably link the two pieces of the appropriations request sent to us \nby the President, the $87 billion which includes the amount of money \nfor the defense needs, which is some $66 billion, and the $20-plus \nbillion for the reconstruction of Iraq. They say it must remain a \nsingle piece of legislation, inextricably linked, that cannot in any \nway be taken apart because one part makes the other work.\n  I suppose it is like a loose thread on a cheap suit. You pull the \nthread and the arm falls off, so you can't take any part of this and \nadjust it or change it. That is what we are told.\n  I believe there are pieces of this legislation that can be changed, \nand I think changed for the better, in ways that will still accomplish \nthe goals the President and we have for the country of Iraq, but that \nwill also help the American taxpayer.\n  At the outset, let me say that I believe that the portion of the \nrequest relating to our military is important and is urgent, and this \nCongress will enact it very quickly. I don't think America sends its \nsons and daughters to war and then decides it will not fund that which \nis necessary for them to carry out their mission. That would be \nunforgivable. We have a responsibility to do that, and we will do that.\n  The second portion of this request, dealing with the reconstruction \nof Iraq, is a different story. I think there are a couple of aspects to \nremember about that.\n  First, the infrastructure of the country of Iraq was deliberately not \ntargeted by the American military attack. The attack, which was called \nShock and Awe, which most of us saw on television, did not target \nelectric generation facilities, the electric grid, roads, bridges, \ndams. It deliberately did not target those. As a result of that, we do \nnot have a country in which their infrastructure has been devastated by \ncarpet bombing of the type that happened in some places during World \nWar II.\n  Second, many of the reconstruction items in the 20-plus billion \nrequest by the administration are not urgent. I will describe that in \nsome detail.\n  Third, the cost of the reconstruction effort need not, and ought not, \nto be borne by the American taxpayer. If the United States was the only \npossible source of funding for reconstruction, that would be one thing. \nBut that is not the case. The fact is that Iraq has a wealth of oil \nreserves, and Iraq can easily use those resources to finance its own \nreconstruction. My amendment would help construct a mechanism for the \nIraqis to do exactly that.\n  My amendment simply proposes that there be established an Iraq \nReconstruction Finance Authority, in Iraq, by the Governing Council of \nIraq, working with the Coalition Provisional Authority. The Governing \nCouncil of Iraq is made up of Iraqis. They would create an Iraq \nReconstruction Finance Authority. That authority would securitize or \nsell securities against the value of future oil that will be pumped in \nIraq. Iraq has the second largest reserves of oil in the world and has \nsubstantial capability to pump a dramatic amount of oil in order to \nraise ample funds to reconstruct Iraq.\n  Simply, my amendment says let Iraqi oil pay for the reconstruction of \nIraq, not the U.S. taxpayer. And let Iraqis use that Iraqi oil revenue \nto reconstruct Iraq. This has nothing to do with the United States \ngrabbing part of the resources that belong to the people of Iraq. On \nthe contrary, my amendment says that the Iraqi people, through the \nGoverning Council of Iraq, should use Iraqi oil revenue to reconstruct \nthe country of Iraq. It is very simple. It is not hard to understand.\n\n  Some believe that if we followed this approach, we would be accused \nof grabbing Iraqi oil. They will say: You attacked Iraq because you \nwanted their oil.\n  That can't be the case because there is nothing here that would put \nAmerican hands on Iraqi oil. It would be Iraqis in the country of Iraq \nusing Iraqi oil to reconstruct Iraq. It simply relieves the burden of \n$21 billion from the shoulders of the American taxpayers, which is what \nis proposed by the administration for the reconstruction of Iraq. It \nsays instead of having the U.S. taxpayers borrow the money, or the \nFederal Government borrow the money or pay taxes to reconstruct Iraq, \nIraqis can use their oil resources to do that.\n\n[[Page S12428]]\n\n  Ambassador Bremer said that by July of next year, Iraq will be \npumping 3 million barrels of oil per day. That is $160 billion of net \nexport value of oil for the country of Iraq in 10 years. They can \neasily sell securities against that future production of oil and use \nthat to reconstruct Iraq.\n  As I indicated, this is the second largest oil reserve in the world. \nThis is not a small resource. This is liquid gold under the sands of \nIraq. When they pump it and sell it to a world that needs oil, they \nwill have $16 billion a year. And Iraq could obtain immediate funding \nfor reconstruction by selling securities, or obtaining loans, backed by \nthat future revenue stream.\n  The concept of securitizing these oil reserves has been endorsed by a \nnumber of sources and experts. The endorsement comes from a number of \ncorners of thought. The President and Chairman of the Export-Import \nBank, Philip Merrill, has said he supports that concept of using Iraqi \noil for reconstruction. In fact, the Export-Import Bank used a similar \napproach for Russian oil and gas after the fall of the Soviet Union, \nwhich was credited with helping to stabilize the industry's finances \nand restoring Russia's infrastructure in the early 1990s.\n  Mr. Merrill, the head of the Export-Import Bank says: What we want to \ndo is securitize this flow of oil.\n  Now, when Ambassador Bremer appeared before the Appropriation \nCommittee, he said that this approach wouldn't work. Ambassador Bremer \nsaid you can't have Iraq securitize its oil, or use future sales of oil \nto reconstruct Iraq, because Iraq owes a lot of money. It has foreign \ndebt. Ambassador Bremer said the foreign debt was owed to Russia, \nFrance, and Germany.\n  After that hearing, I did a little research. It turns out that the \nlargest foreign debt owed by Saddam's regime was not to Russia, France, \nand Germany.\n  The largest foreign debt of the Saddam regime was owed to the Saudis, \nand the Kuwaitis, and the other Gulf Countries. The two largest single \ncreditors, by far, are Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Saddam's regime also \nowed some money to Russia, Japan, France, and Germany, that is true, \nbut the largest foreign debt was owed to the Saudis and the Kuwaitis.\n  I just don't understand the Ambassador's contention that Iraqi oil \nmust be sold right away in order to pay off the Saudis and the \nKuwaitis. First of all, Saddam Hussein and his henchmen owed this \nmoney. Saddam Hussein ran the country of Iraq, and he engaged in \nstrategies and policies that resulted in these debts. Ambassador Bremer \nsuggested that some successor government in Iraq will inherit the debt. \nMy question is, Why? Why not say to the Saudis and the Kuwaitis: You \nare owed a lot of money by Saddam Hussein and his henchmen. Find them, \nand collect it from them.\n  The Iraqi people ought not have to bear the burden of Saddam \nHussein's debt. It doesn't make any sense to me. This man is gone. His \ngovernment no longer exists. And Iraq is sitting on top of an enormous \noil resource.\n  But we are told now that the American taxpayer should pay to \nreconstruct Iraq, because Iraqi oil revenues need to be immediately \nturned over to the Saudis and the Kuwaitis to settle Saddam's debts.\n  I am sorry. It doesn't add up to me. It doesn't work for me. I don't \nunderstand the perversity of a strategy that says the American taxpayer \nshall bear the burden so that Iraq's assets can be free to pay the \nSaudis and the Kuwaitis past foreign debt.\n  Does this make sense to anybody? If you answer, yes, we think this \nmakes sense, the American taxpayers will pay the bill, and Iraqi oil \nwill pay the Saudis, then I am sorry, you need to go back and do some \nremedial training someplace. You are not thinking straight.\n  Now, there are those who argue that the current Iraqi Governing \nCouncil is not a duly elected government, and has no standing to do \nanything with Iraq's oil.\n  But on Friday, Ambassador Bremer said the following:\n\n       The Iraqis are perfectly ready now to accept a lot of \n     responsibility, and they are doing that. There are Iraqi \n     ministers running all 25 ministries. . . . They are making \n     policy in every ministry. They are responsible for the \n     budgets of their ministry. They've got to spend the money. \n     They can move the money around within their budget. They have \n     great latitude. And they are now operating ministries.\n\n  The Governing Council of Iraq is made up of Iraqis. They are running \nIraq's Oil Ministry, among others. It seems to me that they have the \ncapability to securitize future Iraq oil revenues and pay this \nreconstruction cost.\n  Is the Governing Council of Iraq somehow less legitimate than Saddam \nHussein's government? To anyone who argues that the Governing Council \nof Iraq cannot enter into debt on behalf of Iraq, I ask this: Do you \nthink that Saddam's regime was a duly elected government?\n  In 1995, Saddam ran for President of Iraq unopposed, and he won 99.96 \npercent of the vote. That's right. Less than four one-hundredths of one \npercent of the voters voted against Saddam.\n  In August of 2000, Saddam Hussein ran again for President. He ran \nunopposed. This time, the official reelection count was better. With \n100-percent voter turnout, he received 100 percent of the vote. That \nwas the official result announced by the Iraqi government.\n  In that election, there were no polling booths. Voters were required \nto hold their ballot over their heads as the approached the ballot box, \nso that everybody could see how they voted. When they voted, they had \nto parade past 28 portraits of Saddam Hussein, and they had to hold \nthese ballots over their heads so they could demonstrate how they \nvoted.\n  Was that a duly constituted government? I don't think so. The Iraq \nGoverning Council is much more legitimate than the Saddam regime, in my \nestimation. Why would anyone argue with that? Who wants to come to the \nSenate floor and say that the debts incurred by Saddam's regime are \nlegitimate, but securities that would be issued by the current \nGoverning Council would not be legitimate?\n  I ask that again because I think it is important.\n  Why would anyone argue that the massive debts run up by Saddam \nHussein's government are legitimate and payable, but securities issued \nby the current government of Iraq's Governing Council against future \noil revenues with which they could reconstruct Iraq would somehow not \nbe legitimate? It doesn't make any sense.\n  Until a few months ago, the Administration was telling everyone that \nIraq's oil would allow the Iraqis to pay for their own reconstruction.\n  Let me show what Mr. Ari Fleischer at the White House said about \nthis. He was the President's spokesperson. He said in February of this \nyear:\n\n       And Iraq, unlike Afghanistan, is a rather wealthy country. \n     Iraq has tremendous resources that belong to the Iraqi \n     people. And so there are a variety of means that Iraq has \n     to be able to shoulder much of the burden of their own \n     reconstruction.\n\n  He is, of course, talking about Iraqi oil, the second largest oil \nreserve in the world.\n  Shortly after that time, Mr. Wolfowitz, the Deputy Secretary of \nDefense, said:\n\n       . . . the oil revenues of that country could bring in \n     between $50 and $100 billion over the course of the next two \n     or three. . . . We're dealing with a country that can really \n     finance its own reconstruction, and relatively soon.\n\n  That is the administration speaking. They say Iraq can finance its \nown reconstruction, and relatively soon, because it has massive oil \nresources.\n  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, in March of this year, said:\n\n       I don't believe that the United States has the \n     responsibility for reconstruction, in a sense. . . . And the \n     funds can come from those various sources I mentioned: frozen \n     assets, oil revenues and a variety of other things.\n\n  That is the Secretary of Defense saying the American taxpayer is not \ngoing to have to pay for the reconstruction of Iraq.\n  Vice President Cheney, on national television in March of this year, \nsaid:\n\n       In Iraq we have a nation that's got the second largest oil \n     reserves in the world, second only to Saudi Arabia. It will \n     generate billions of dollars a year in cashflow in the \n     relatively near future, and that flow of resource obviously \n     belongs to the Iraqi people and needs to be put to use by the \n     Iraqi people. And that will be one of our major objectives.\n\n  This administration has said time and time and time again that the \nreconstruction of Iraq will be done with Iraqi oil.\n\n[[Page S12429]]\n\n  Let me describe a ``Nightline'' program with Ted Koppel and Mr. \nNatsios, head of USAID, the lead reconstruction agency in our country.\n\n       Mr. Koppel: I understand that more money is expected to be \n     spent on this than was spent on the entire Marshall plan for \n     the rebuilding of Europe after World War II.\n       Mr. Natsios: No. This doesn't even compare. The Marshall \n     plan was $97 billion. This is $1.7 billion.\n       Mr. Koppel: I mean, you talk about 1.7. You are not \n     suggesting the rebuilding of Iraq is going to be done for \n     $1.7 billion?\n       Mr. Natsios: Well, in terms of the American taxpayers' \n     contribution, I do. This is for the U.S. The rest of the \n     rebuilding of Iraq will be done by other countries that have \n     already made pledges: Britain, Germany, Norway, Canada and \n     Iraqi oil revenues. They are going to get $20 billion in \n     revenues but the American part of this will be $1.7 billion.\n\n  Again, this is the lead person on the reconstruction of Iraq speaking \nlast March.\n\n       Mr. Koppel: I understand. But as far as reconstruction \n     goes, the American taxpayer will not be hit for more than \n     $1.7 billion no matter how long the process takes?\n       Mr. Natsios: That is our plan, and that is our intention.\n\n  Over and over and over again, Mr. Natsios said exactly the same \nthing.\n  It is strange that not many months later all of those folks--\nSecretary Rumsfeld, Vice President Cheney, Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz, \nMr. Natsios--all said the same thing. And now there is this eerie \nsilence from those folks who told the American taxpayer, you won't have \nto pay for this, Iraqi oil will pay for it.\n  Now they send up a $21 billion request to say to the American \ntaxpayer, you will pay for this. And, by the way, you can't change any \nelement of this, because this all fits together like a puzzle; take out \none piece and you destroy the puzzle.\n  Now, in Ambassador Bremer's request, part of the nearly $21 billion \ninvolves items that are clearly not related to any damage caused by our \nmilitary action:\n\n       $1 billion to rehabilitate power distribution networks that \n     were in a highly deteriorated condition before the war.\n\n  This has nothing to do with the war. It is just 20 years of \ndevastation by Saddam Hussein's government.\n\n       $50 million to rectify the actions of the former regime and \n     reconnect the Euphrates River to 30 villages and 100 farms.\n\n\n  That is an irrigation water project and has nothing to do with the \nwar.\n  There is $50 million to restore a marsh and rectify some of the \nenvironmental tragedies ``of the past 25 years''; $50 million for water \nprojects in Basra, a ``long neglected city''; $125 million to restore \nrailroad tracks that suffered from ``severe neglect over time.''\n  There are a whole series of things like that, that on their face are \nnot a result of the war and in many cases not particularly urgent. Here \nis a pretty symbolic item: $1.6 million requested to build museums and \nmemorials. I have never heard of an urgent request for a museum. I have \nheard of important requests for museums, but I have never heard of a \nrequest for a museum that is urgent or an emergency. I am wondering if \nthere is anyone in our country who thinks that the building of a new \nmuseum in Iraq is an emergency.\n  Many have mentioned, and I did in the Appropriations Committee, some \nof the expenditures: For a 4-week business course for executives, \n$10,000 per student. That 1-month catchup course in business is double \nthe monthly cost of going to Harvard Business School.\n  There is $55 million for computer training, $330 a month for half-day \ncourses; $1,500 per student for a 6-month second language English \ncourse; $9 million to study ZIP Codes for the postal service in Iraq; \n$100 million for 2,000 garbage trucks; $4 million to start telephone \narea codes.\n  The fact is, many of these items are not an emergency and not urgent. \nAnd the American taxpayer should not have to pay for any of this, \nbecause Iraq has the resources to pay for its own reconstruction. Yet \nwe have this piece of legislation that we are told is not separable, it \ncomes as one piece; pull a string on the cheap sweater and the arm \ncomes out; take one piece out and it destroys the rest. That is \nnonsense.\n  When you look at the $66 million requested by the Pentagon to support \nour troops, no question: We need to do that, and we need to do that \nnow. But when you look at the $21 billion with respect to \nreconstruction, in my judgment, that can be done by having Iraqis \nsecuritize Iraqi oil, and using that financing for the reconstruction \nof their own country.\n  I said when I started, everyone has the same ultimate objective. I \nwant not just Iraqi people, I want people around this world, to have \nopportunity and hope, to live free, to live in circumstances where they \nhave an economy in their country that expands and produces jobs and \nopportunity.\n  There is a hopelessness and helplessness in many parts of the world. \nOne-half of the population of the world lives on less than $2 a day. \nOne-half have never made a telephone call; 150 million have no access \nto potable water that is healthy and is of good quality; 150 million \nkids are not in school. This is a big, challenging world.\n  We are focused now on the country of Iraq. I want things to go well \nin Iraq. I want our soldiers to be safe. I want them to be able to come \nhome as soon as possible. I want the Iraqi people to come through this \nexperience believing their country has turned a corner and they can \nlive in freedom and have some hope and have the opportunity to make a \ngood future for themselves.\n  But as we do all of that, we have some responsibilities at home. We \nneed to be able to deal with those. We are lucky to be Americans, lucky \nto be alive now and to live in what I think is the greatest country in \nthe world, but we have a lot of challenges. We have huge homeland \nsecurity issues right here at home.\n  The plain fact is, we have had major studies done, most notably the \nHart-Rudman study by two of our former colleagues for the Council of \nForeign Relations. That study says we are dangerously unprepared. In \nfact, that is the title of the study. We have a lot of things to do at \nhome to make sure we are prepared to protect our country against \nanother attack by terrorists. We can't just write a blank check for \nIraq's reconstruction, and say spend whatever you need, let's spend $9 \nmillion for new ZIP Codes and buy pickup trucks and build prison beds \nat $50,000 a bed in Iraq. We have urgent needs here, in this country, \nand we do not have infinite resources.\n  With respect to the country of Iraq, our country ought to be \nsupportive. We ought to be helpful. We ought to aspire to have the same \nkind of future for the folks in Iraq that we want for ourselves; that \nis, a future of hope. But that does not mean the American taxpayer \nought to bear the burden of solving problems created by Saddam Hussein \nwhen he borrowed money from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Russia, France, \nGermany, and others. It does not mean we ought to bear that burden. \nThose debts ought to be forgiven or restructured. Iraqis ought to be \nable to use their oil resource to pay for the reconstruction of Iraq \nright now. Very simple.\n  Sometimes we get so rigid in this political process, we do not hear \neach other; we talk past each other. The discussion about this in the \ncommittee came down to this: the President says it has to be this way \nnow, and therefore it must be this way and we cannot consider another \nway. I offered two amendments in the Appropriations Committee. The \nfirst amendment, identical to the one I am offering today on the Senate \nfloor, was that there should be created an Iraq Reconstruction Finance \nAuthority. They should borrow money against future Iraq oil and \nreconstruct Iraq. It is the burden of Iraqi oil, not the burden of the \nAmerican taxpayer, to reconstruct Iraq.\n  That amendment lost by a vote of 15 to 14, though at least one of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle expressed support for the \nconcept, and said he might consider this approach on the Senate floor.\n  So I offered a second amendment in the Appropriations Committee, \nwhich said that instead of providing a 20 billion-plus dollar grant, we \nshould extend Iraq a loan. That is not something I prefer, because I \nthink Iraqis can finance their reconstruction by securitizing their \noil. But it is a better approach than just extending a grant.\n  I lost that second amendment as well, by a vote of 15 to 14. I \nunderstand that a number of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nare interested in this concept.\n  So we will have these debates in the Senate. I expect that we will \nvote on\n\n[[Page S12430]]\n\nthe amendment I offered today, once we return. My hope is we can find a \nbipartisan way to agree on something that shows common sense.\n  Most of us know little about Iraq. But Iraq is not a desperately \nimpoverished country. Iraq sits on top of the largest reserves \nimaginable. The oil reserves exist under that sand. There is only one \ncountry that has larger reserves. That is Saudi Arabia. Iraq has great \ncapability to invest in itself and build and grow and provide \nopportunity for the Iraqi people.\n  Even as we aspire to have that happen, we had better look inward a \nbit in this country and ask ourselves where we are headed. We are \nfacing record Federal budget deficits. This year, we also had the \nlargest trade deficit in the history of this country, by far.\n\n  The combined budget and trade deficit is very close to $900 billion. \nYet people walk around here as if it is ``Hear no evil, see no evil, \nspeak no evil.'' It is as if none of this exists.\n  All of this money we are talking about today, $87 billion--all of it \nis borrowed against our children's futures. Why?\n  The President wants to have it all: We need tax cuts. We need \nincreased military spending. We need increased homeland security \nspending, and, at the same time, $87 billion now for Iraq, on top of \nthe $79 billion earlier this year.\n  Someone, someday, in some way, pays the cost of that. That cost comes \nwith a lower standard of living in this country if we do not get our \nfundamentals in order. You just cannot keep doing this.\n  Mathematics is taught the same way from Maine to California. There is \nonly one way to add and subtract.\n  What we require, I think, is a bit of backbone from Republicans and \nDemocrats, this President and the Congress, to stand up and take a look \nat what we are facing, our budget deficits, our trade deficits, our \nlong-term future economic health, and decide we have to put things back \non track. That is important for this country.\n  Yes, I care about Iraq, as do my colleagues. Yes, we should be \nconcerned about the reconstruction of Iraq. But that is a burden that \nIraqis can bear, by using their vast oil resources. It is not a burden \nthat ought to be borne by the American taxpayer.\n  The Senate will not be in session next week. But I will seek to have \na vote on this amendment when we return.\n  I thank my colleagues. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n\n                Call for Appointment of Special Counsel\n\n  Mr. President, I take the floor again today, as I said I would do \nevery day, until this matter is resolved, until the individual or \nindividuals who leaked the name of a CIA undercover agent to the press \nare identified and prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\n  So I take the floor again today to again recap what has gone on, and \nalso to ask the President to become more fully engaged in finding out \nwho did this.\n  As I said earlier this week on the floor, President Bush can resolve \nthis matter, literally in an hour, by calling his senior staff members \nin the Oval Office and asking them one by one if they were involved. It \nwould be very simple. Call them in and ask them: Were you involved in \nthis, yes or no?\n\n  Bear in mind, the Washington Post story on Sunday--this is when it \nall came out in the open--reported a senior administration official \nrevealed two other ``senior White House officials'' had leaked the \nundercover CIA agent's identity to six reporters before the so-called \nNovak column ran in July. So again, a whistleblower in the White House \nrevealed--and this is according to the Washington Post--a senior \nadministration official. In the Post on September 28, last Sunday, they \nquoted the senior official who said:\n\n       Clearly, it was meant purely and simply for revenge, the \n     senior official said of the alleged leak.\n\n  It was purely and simply for revenge against Mr. Wilson, obviously. \nSo we know now a whistleblower in the White House, a senior \nadministration official--we don't know who--revealed two other senior \nWhite House officials had leaked the undercover CIA agent's identity to \nsix reporters prior to the Novak column running in July 14. Someone was \npretty busy in the White House calling six reporters. And the senior \nadministration official said it was ``purely and simply for revenge.''\n  Why doesn't Mr. Bush simply call them into the Oval Office and ask \nthem one by one: Were you involved in these leaks? We know at least \nthree of these senior administration officials know the full story. We \nknow now at least three senior administration officials know the full \nstory. The odds are many more know the story as well, that there was \nsome talk around the White House back in July about doing this. I find \nit hard to believe some low-ranking individual called six reporters \nwithout having this cleared at the highest echelons in the Bush \nadministration. Obviously, we know there are three. There may be more.\n  Mr. Bush could resolve this matter literally by lunchtime if he were \nto call the senior officials in the Oval Office, lay down the law, and \nget some answers.\n  I was driving in to work this morning and I heard on the radio that \nthe President is flying to Wisconsin this morning for yet another \nfundraiser. People have their priorities, I guess. I think our priority \nshould be getting to the bottom of this as soon as possible and finding \nout who made these leaks, not flying off for yet another fundraiser in \nWisconsin.\n  Again, instead of a serious, straightforward approach, the President \nnow is trying to make light of the matter. He was joking and laughing \nabout it yesterday with some foreign journalists.\n  I refer to a story that appeared in the Washington Post this morning, \nFriday, October 3. Headline: ``Justice to Begin Leak Interviews Within \nDays.'' I will have more to say about that. I will quote directly from \nthe article in the paper this morning:\n\n       As pressure built on his aides,\n\n--regarding finding who leaked this information--\n\n       Bush joked about the matter. During a roundtable discussion \n     with reporters for African news organizations, he was asked \n     about three reporters in Kenya who were detained this week in \n     what some journalists saw as an effort to intimidate them \n     into revealing sources. The detention drew a condemnation \n     from the International Federation of Journalists which \n     complained that the government has been harassing and \n     brutalizing journalists.\n       \"I'm against leaks,'' Bush said, to laughter. ``I would \n     suggest all governments get to the bottom of every leak of \n     classified information.'' Turning to the reporter who asked \n     the question, Martin Mbugua of the Daily Nation, Kenya's \n     largest daily newspaper, Bush said ``By the way, if you know \n     anything, Martin, would you please bring it forward and help \n     solve the problem.''\n\n  I guess I find this remarkable, a matter as serious as this, \ndisclosing the identity of an undercover agent in the midst of our war \non terrorism, where we have to rely upon good intelligence, we have to \nrely upon the security of these individuals, and to let them know that \nat no time, now or in the future, will they be outed, which could do \nserious harm not only to them but to their sources and to others. \nRather than approaching this in that serious manner, the President is \njoking about the matter as if this is ha-ha, some kind of a \nlighthearted little diversion from his fundraising activities.\n  I will say this: This is not a laughing matter. The President may \ntake it lightly, but I don't believe our intelligence agencies, nor do \nI believe those of us here in the Congress will take it lightly either. \nAnd neither do the American people take it lightly.\n  This is a deadly serious matter of national security. The President \nof the United States should make it his personal business to resolve it \nas soon as possible. In fact, I would suggest the President should \npublicly commend the individual who told the Washington Post last \nSunday about the leak, promise to protect that whistleblower's job, \ngive that person a certificate of merit\n\n[[Page S12431]]\n\nfor being truthful and honest and helping to expose those who may have \nleaked this information, rather than joking about it with foreign \njournalists and asking them if they know anything about it, would they \nplease help him out.\n  I understand from today's news reports that the Justice Department \nhas set a deadline for White House documents related to the matter. \nThat is great. But I still don't understand why it has taken at least 2 \nmonths for them to request this information since exposing the identity \nof an undercover CIA agent is a violation of Federal law punishable \nwith up to 10 years in prison. Also I believe it goes further than just \nreleasing classified information.\n  This is an issue, as I said, about compromising the safety of our \nundercover agents and the investigative efforts to prevent future \nthreats to the United States. Again, let me just go back to this \ntimeline.\n  On July 6, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson's op ed appears in the New \nYork Times, questioning President Bush's assertion that Iraq had sought \nuranium from Niger.\n  On July 14, Robert Novak publishes a column saying ``senior \nadministration officials'' have identified Wilson's wife as ``an agency \noperative of weapons of mass destruction.''\n  On July 24, Senator Schumer calls on the FBI director to open a \ncriminal investigation based on that call.\n  In late July, the FBI notified Senator Schumer they sent an \n``inquiry'' to the CIA.\n  Then it appears that nothing happens for 2 months.\n  On September 23, the Attorney General says he and CIA Director Tenet \nsent a memo to the FBI requesting an investigation.\n  So in July the FBI says they sent an inquiry to the CIA. In September \nthe Attorney General says they sent a memo to the FBI requesting an \ninvestigation. On September 26, the Department of Justice officially \nlaunches its investigation.\n  But interestingly, it took 4 days after that official launch for the \nJustice Department to call White House Counsel Gonzales and notify him \nof the official investigation and to tell them to preserve documents, \nphone logs, et cetera.\n  Today, October 3, according to the newspaper, we understand the \nAttorney General wants to quickly move the investigation along. Again, \nI don't understand why it took President Bush and Attorney General \nAshcroft so long to get moving on this investigation, when they \nappeared to move so quickly in wanting to question our congressional \nIntelligence Committees last year for allegedly leaking ``classified \ninformation.'' In fact, the FBI was coming down, as Senator Durbin said \non the floor, asking them to take lie detector tests. But now we don't \nseem to be moving very rapidly in trying to get to the bottom of this \nreal--not alleged, but real--leak of classified information.\n  I have other concerns as well, and that has to do with the clear \nconflict of interest Mr. Ashcroft has with this administration.\n  I refer to this chart. There was a story in the newspaper about the \nclose connections Mr. Ashcroft has had with senior White House \nofficials. This chart kinds of shows it. We have Attorney General \nAshcroft, then Mr. Karl Rove, senior assistant to the President, who \nwas a paid consultant for Ashcroft for Governor in 1984. Mr. Rove was a \npaid consultant for Ashcroft for Governor in 1988. Mr. Rove was a paid \nconsultant for Ashcroft for the Senate in 1994. Today, he is political \ndirector and senior advisor to President Bush.\n  Then there is Jack Oliver. He was campaign manager for Mr. Ashcroft \nin 1994. Mr. Oliver was deputy chief of staff in Senator Ashcroft's \noffice in the Senate. Mr. Oliver now is a deputy finance chair for the \nBush-Cheney reelection team for 2004. Now we understand that, with \nthese connections, these people so high up in the administration, such \nas the Attorney General--President Bush is his boss. The Attorney \nGeneral says he can do the investigation. Give me a break. That is why \nwe need a special counsel. That is why the American people see this as \nan inherent conflict of interest, with all of these people so closely \ntied together. That is why we need an appointed special counsel.\n\n  Some argue this is purely politics, that we are blowing this incident \nout of proportion. Well, what makes this so serious is this \nadministration released its classified information for revenge to \npunish those who told the truth at the risk of national security and \nthe safety of others.\n  I have been hearing all of these spins coming out of the White House \nabout Mr. Wilson and politics, and so I was looking at this and I \nwanted to get to the bottom of it. I looked at this and I saw the spin \ncoming out of the White House and the Republican Party. Here is Mr. \nGillespie, RNC chair:\n\n       The fact is that Ambassador Wilson is not only a, you \n     know--a former foreign service officer, former ambassador, he \n     is himself a partisan Democrat who is a contributor and \n     supporter of Senator Kerry's Presidential campaign.\n\n  That is Ed Gillespie, RNC chair, on September 30.\n  Then, here is the former RNC communication director, Cliff May. He \nsaid:\n\n       Wilson is no disinterested career diplomat--he's a pro-\n     Saudi, leftist partisan with an ax to grind. And too many in \n     the media are helping him and allies grind it.\n\n  What are the facts. The fact is we found out Mr. Wilson has given \nmoney to the Presidential campaign of Senator John Kerry. But he also \ncontributed money to George Bush during the 2000 election. GOP \nRepresentative Ed Royce, a Republican from California, received $1,000 \nfrom Wilson between 2000 and 2001. I don't know Mr. Wilson; I never met \nhim in my life, but it looks as though he is one of those independents \nwho gives to both sides depending on who he thinks is best qualified. \nThe fact is former President Bush--the first President Bush--praised \nWilson for his courageous leadership when he was Ambassador in Baghdad \nin 1990. He praised him for his courageous leadership, saying:\n\n       What you are doing day in and day out under the most trying \n     conditions is truly inspiring. Keep fighting the good fight. \n     You and your stalwart colleagues are always in our thoughts \n     and prayers.\n\n  Yet spokesmen for the Republican Party want to make Mr. Wilson some \nleftist partisan with an ax to grind. No, don't get to the bottom of \nit, you see. Don't find out who leaked it. Attack Mr. Wilson's \ncharacter. Have we seen this before? We sure have.\n  So, again, this is no laughing matter. Quite frankly, I just don't \nunderstand the President joking lightheartedly about this, but he did. \nThe President needs to take it seriously. The American people take it \nseriously; we take it seriously. He can take care of it very quickly, \nas I said, by calling in those senior advisors and asking them, one by \none, if they have knowledge of this. Mr. Ashcroft can hardly \ninvestigate his own boss, with all of the connections he has. He can \nhardly be asked to investigate.\n  That is why under ``recusals'' in the Department of Justice Resource \nManual it says:\n\n       If a conflict of interest exists because a United States \n     Attorney has a personal interest in the outcome of the matter \n     or because he/she has or had a professional relationship with \n     parties or counsel. . . . Where there is the appearance of a \n     conflict of interest, the United States Attorney should \n     consider a recusal.\n\n  I can think of no better example of an appearance of a conflict of \ninterest, nor where the U.S. Attorney has had a professional \nrelationship with parties or counsel. They should recuse themselves. \nThat is what the Attorney General should do, and he should appoint a \nspecial counsel to proceed further to investigate this matter to find \nout who leaked it.\n  I will close with this. As I said yesterday, it is not just the \nperson or two persons who leaked this to six reporters; how did these \nindividuals get that classified information? Who gave that to them? Did \nit come from the NSC? Is that now politicized? Did it come from the \nCIA? Did someone in the White House request this kind of classified \ninformation in order to put it out?\n\n  That is why I said yesterday, and I repeat again today, there is a \ncancer growing on this administration, and the best way to get rid of a \ncancer is to excise it. The best way to excise it is for the President \nhimself to get involved, for the Attorney General to recuse himself, \nappoint a special counsel, and let's get to the bottom of this, not in \na matter of weeks or months but in the next few days.\n\n[[Page S12432]]\n\n  Nothing less will suffice for those brave men and women working all \nover the globe to get the intelligence and the information we need to \nfight global terrorism and to reassure them that this will never happen \nagain.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be allowed to continue as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1618\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 282, S. \n1618, a 6-month extension of the FAA authorization; that the bill be \nread a third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, at the request of other Senators, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I reclaim the floor. I am disappointed \nthat my Republican colleagues objected to this request because the \nfuture of our aviation system is an extremely important matter.\n  On Tuesday just past, the authorization for the Federal Aviation \nAdministration expired under its previous authorization, called Air-21, \nand we are struggling to get something done that can pass both Houses \nand serve the public, as they should be, in aviation.\n  My UC request was to pass a 6-month extension of all aviation \nprograms so we can continue this critical airport improvement program \nwithout any interruption.\n  The continuing resolution that the majority brought to the floor last \nweek intentionally omitted funding for certain important airport \nconstruction programs under the Airport Improvement Program. It is $3.4 \nbillion for fiscal year 2004. The fiscal year is now 3 days old.\n  I think it is irresponsible to allow this critical funding to lapse \nin the current economy. Job loss is at an all-time high, and the \npreliminary U.S. Census Bureau data shows that transportation \nconstruction is down 8.7 percent from this time last year. Withholding \nany part of the $3.4 billion in construction projects makes this \nproblem even worse.\n\n  Why did we need to consider a continuing resolution for aviation \nprograms at all? The Senate passed a bill reauthorizing FAA programs on \nJune 12 of this year. The House passed it before then. But we cannot \nget a bill passed because since that time, Republican leaders, at the \nbehest of the President, have decided to wage an ideological battle \nover privatizing our air traffic control system rather than doing what \nthe public wants and needs.\n  I suggest the White House leave its ideological debates at the \nHeritage Foundation. Let us pass an FAA bill. The public wants safe \nskies--and I agree with them--not cutbacks in safety, not cutbacks in \nsecurity.\n  The biggest problem the White House created in the FAA conference \nreport is overprivatizing our air traffic control system. Despite clear \nlanguage prohibiting this in both the House and Senate versions of the \nbill, conference leaders ignored the clear mandates and bowed to the \nwill of the ideologues in the White House.\n  In all of my years of serving in this Chamber, I have never seen such \ndisregard by conference leaders of a clear safety mandate by colleagues \nin both Chambers. A bipartisan majority in the Senate voted 56 to 41 \nfor an amendment that I offered to prevent privatization of our air \ntraffic control system. We voted to heed the lessons gleaned from the \nattacks of September 11, the lessons of our Space Shuttle Program, the \nShuttle Columbia disaster, and the experiences of our foreign \ncounterparts to avoid making the same mistakes that will end up costing \nour society more.\n  September 11, 2001, was a most tragic day, perhaps the most tragic in \nour history, when America's invincibility was pierced. Almost 3,000 \npeople were killed. In my State of New Jersey, nearly 700 people lost \ntheir lives in the terrorist attacks.\n  As my colleagues know, Transportation Secretary Mineta ordered all \naircraft in U.S. airspace grounded that day. It was a massive \nundertaking in just a few hours. Some 5,000 planes were guided to safe \nharbor, and our air traffic control system managed that unprecedented \neffort flawlessly.\n  I show on this chart what happened on September 11, 2001. At 8:30 in \nthe morning, the skies looked like this to those who were watching the \nscopes in the towers in the FAA: All of these little green stars, \nsymbols, depict an airplane. The sky was filled. If we look at the \nnortheast corner of our country, including New York and New Jersey, we \nalmost cannot see the black portion of the map because the traffic was \nso heavy at 8:30 in the morning on that fateful day.\n  At 9:45, after the attack had begun, we start to see a lessening. \nThere is much more of the map visible.\n  At 10:45, an hour later, look what happened: Those thousands of \nairplanes with passengers in every one of them, almost 5,000 airplanes \nin the sky at that time, and the FAA had to jump in and the controllers \nhad to exercise their best judgment because they had to direct these \nairplanes to a safe landing place regardless of what their original \ndestination was. We see a totally different picture. There are very few \nspots where we see airplanes in the sky.\n  The terrorists crippled our aviation system, and it was the FAA, our \nheroes, who managed this terrible task that day because they knew what \ntheir responsibilities were and they jumped to it. We didn't know \nwhether there were going to be other planes brought down that morning, \nbut the FAA did its job. The Secretary ordered the planes out of the \nsky, and people were able to touch down in almost every case safely. \nThe cases that did not were those that were suicidally brought down by \nmaniacs.\n  On September 11, those who operated our Federal air traffic system \ndemonstrated great heroism and dedication. Air traffic controllers \nacross the Nation performed heroically as they guided the thousands of \naircraft out of the sky. Technicians who certify and maintain the high-\ntech equipment kept it operating reliably throughout the crisis, and \nflight service station controllers talked directly to the pilots to let \nthem know what was happening and to tell them the best places they \ncould look to for a quick, safe landing.\n  In my home State, from the tower at Newark International Airport, the \nair traffic controllers could see the World Trade Center burning in \nfront of their eyes. As they worked to return Americans to the ground \nsafely, they knew that people were dying in front of them.\n\n  In the aftermath of these tragic events, the American people demanded \nprivate baggage screeners becoming Federal employees. But it seems \nbackward to me that the administration, who quickly got on the problem \nwith the baggage handlers because the private side was not handling it \nwell, put them into Government hands--I believe 28,000 was the total \nnumber--and they still want to contract out the air traffic control \nsystem to the lowest bidder. It is one thing to assure ourselves that \nthe baggage that goes aboard these airplanes is free of explosives and \ndamaging material, I agree with that, but it is worse to ignore the \nfact that airplanes full of people, perhaps my grandchildren, my \nchildren, other people's children and their families, are in those \nairplanes. Do we not want the best that we can get in safety and \nprotection for our people? I think so.\n  The risks of privatizing highly technical and complex operations \nspeak for themselves. On February 1 of this year, our country suffered \nanother tragedy. The Space Shuttle Columbia tragically exploded over \nthe skies of Texas, and we lost some of the most courageous Americans \non that day. Immediately after that accident, it was our air traffic \ncontrol system that worked flawlessly to guide aircraft around the \nfalling debris.\n  Following this disaster, the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, \nled by ADM Harold Gehman, published its findings. The board found that \ncrosscutting and a drive for ever-greater efficiency at NASA--a pioneer \nin Government privatization--had eroded NASA's ability to assure \nmission safety.\n\n[[Page S12433]]\n\n  Now, if safety lapses can lead to the Columbia Shuttle accident and \nthe failure to guarantee the safe return of our brave astronauts from \nmission STS-107, just how much are we willing to gamble on the safety \nof the 2 million Americans who travel in our skies every day?\n  The lessons of privatization are hard learned and should not be \nignored. Other countries have tried this already and they have paid the \nprice. Australia, Canada, and Great Britain all have privatized systems \nthat did not live up to the promised benefits of privatization. Just to \nclear the air, privatization means that these tasks will be handed over \nto companies whose mission it is to make a profit and who will try to \ndo the job at the cheapest prices.\n  A member of Parliament of the British House of Commons named Gwyneth \nDunwoody said this:\n\n       The privatization of the United Kingdom's air traffic \n     control system was a grave mistake, and one that the United \n     States can still avoid making. British air traffic \n     controllers are among the best in the world, and they fought \n     tooth and nail to keep ATC in the public sector.\n\n  The public sector means in government.\n\n       They insisted that the sale of the national air traffic \n     services would lead to a collapse in morale, the unwise \n     introduction of inadequate and unreliable equipment, and an \n     increasing danger of catastrophic accidents. The Government \n     did not listen and went ahead. They were wrong and the air \n     traffic controllers were right.\n\n  Costs have gone up and safety has gone down since Great Britain \nadopted privatization. Near misses have increased by 50 percent and \ndelays have increased by 20 percent. Do we want to risk near misses in \nthe skies over America? Do we want to take a chance because we can buy \nsecurity on the cheap? I do not think so, and I am going to do whatever \nI can to prevent that from happening.\n\n  The British Government has already had to bail out the privatized air \ntraffic control company twice. When is this administration going to \ntake off the ideological blinders from its eyes and learn the lessons \ntaught to our British friends?\n  President Bush himself should be quite familiar with the importance \nof our air traffic control workforce. Last month, on September 10, the \nday before the second-year anniversary of the most tragic attack on our \nsoil, the President traveled to a fundraiser in Florida. As Air Force \nOne, the President's airplane, approached for a landing, air traffic \ncontrollers noticed an unidentified car on the runway that Air Force \nOne was attempting to land on. Disaster was avoided because of the \nquick reaction of those air traffic controllers in Jacksonville.\n  Despite these lessons, the administration has pushed hard to \nprivatize through the contract tower program which has been beneficial \nto many small airports across the country. Most of these 200 or so \nsmall airports would not otherwise have an air traffic control tower.\n  There are many more. Some 4,000 small airports exist that could use \nthis program, but the administration wants to use the program to \nprivatize some of the busiest airports in the country. Examples of some \nof the busiest airport towers: They want to privatize the eighth \nbusiest airport in the country, Van Nuys, CA, almost a half a million \nflight operations in 2002; the 18th most busy, the Denver Centennial \nAirport in Colorado, over 400,000 flight operations in 2002. In fact, \nthose two airports are busier than Washington Dulles, which was 23rd \nwith 392,000 flight operations in the year 2002. We look at Arizona, \nthe 24th busiest airport, Phoenix/Deer Valley Municipal Airport, \n390,000 flight operations in 2002. The list goes on. We are looking at \nthe 50 busiest airports in the country.\n  Some may notice that two airports were dropped out of the list, both \nin the State of Alaska. Now, why is Alaska exempted? The chairman of \nthe Transportation Committee in the House of Representatives is \nCongressman Young. He is chairman of the committee because he has \nseniority. Well, he made sure that the two Alaskan airports that were \nlisted for privatization were taken off the list. They are smart in \nAlaska. They know they have to fight to protect themselves. They are a \nlong distance from the mainland, but they are smart enough to exempt \nthemselves from this dangerous privatization scheme.\n  I do not believe the safety of every other airport in our national \naviation system is any less important than the safety at Alaska's \nairports.\n  The White House interfered in our process and altered language in the \nFAA conference bill so they would be explicitly allowed to privatize \nsome of the busiest air traffic control towers in the world. It is for \nthis reason that I and many of my colleagues are not going to agree. We \nare not going to accept any FAA reauthorization conference report \nwithout language prohibiting privatization of our air traffic control \nsystem. I am going to fight until the will of the Senate is heeded. \nOthers have pledged to do the same thing.\n  I want to make clear to my colleagues that we passed legislation to \nprevent privatization of the air traffic control system. It was \nbipartisan. There were 11 Republicans and the remainder Democrats who \npassed that bill.\n  The system is made up of many important parts, including the air \ntraffic controllers themselves, those who run the towers, the \ntechnicians who have the responsibility to certify that the equipment \nis working, and the flight service station controllers who communicate \ndirectly with the pilots as they make their way to their destination.\n  As FAA conference leaders did not abide by the will of both the \nSenate and the House to prohibit privatizing our air traffic control \nsystems, my colleague, Senator Rockefeller, the ranking member of the \nCommerce Committee's Subcommittee on Aviation, and I, introduced S. \n1618. It is the Temporary Federal Aviation Administration \nReauthorization Act of 2003. This legislation extends funding for \nreauthorization for all aviation programs, including the AIP program, \nfor 6 months, and it also addresses the immediate safety and security \nneeds while FAA conference leaders work with us to go back and fix the \nproblems they created for themselves in the FAA conference report.\n  But, unfortunately, my unanimous consent request to pass this \nextension was objected to by the majority. In the meantime, our \nGovernment operates under a continuing resolution that means we \ncouldn't get our work done in time, that as fiscal year 2003 ended we \nwere not prepared, though we knew a year in advance that the new fiscal \nyear was going to start with October 1, 2003. I find it outrageous that \nthe Republican leadership in Congress would effectively punish our \neconomy with further job losses in order to afford the opportunity to \nthe White House to wage their ideological battles.\n  I am appalled they would intentionally zero out the Airport \nImprovement Program, again, the program that keeps updating our \nairports across the country. It is over $3 billion. I am appalled they \nwould intentionally zero that out, zero out the opportunity to put \nFederal funds in there for airport construction programs, to muscle \ntheir plan through the Congress. It is not going to happen.\n  Our economy cannot stand to lose any more jobs, and using a \ncontinuing resolution to cancel a program which will provide $3.4 \nbillion in AIP funding is just irresponsible.\n  I hope when we get this bill up my colleagues will work with us so we \ncan do the right thing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to share a few thoughts. I will \nprobably talk about it next week on the supplemental for our activities \nin Iraq.\n  I congratulate and will be forthright in my support for the military \nmen and women who are serving so extraordinarily well and Ambassador \nBremer for his leadership in an effort to create a new government in \nIraq where the\n\n[[Page S12434]]\n\npeople can live and progress and have the benefits of progress that \nhave been denied them for so long.\n  I am exceedingly pleased with what they are doing. They are operating \nat risk, particularly in certain areas of Iraq--at less risk in other \nareas. Progress continues to be made throughout the country. I am proud \nof that.\n  I was a Federal prosecutor and attorney general of Alabama. I served \nin law enforcement for over 15 years. I went to Iraq in August and \nasked specifically to visit the Iraqi police training center, which I \nwas allowed to do. From the beginning of this effort, it was clear to \nme that the key to a prosperous and healthy and stable and peaceful \nIraq is the bringing on of a capable police force.\n  It is not as easy as you would think. The Iraqi police were \nfunctionaries under Saddam Hussein. He had a tough secret police that \ndid the heavy, vicious work, and he had other police who were poorly \ntrained, and many of them not functioning at the level at which we \nwould expect police in the United States to function. So it is not an \neasy thing.\n  Originally the plan was to bring on a smaller police force. I urged \nthem to go to a larger police force, and they certainly are doing that. \nWe now have 35,000 police up and operating in Iraq. These are Iraqis. \nThe goal is going to be to double, or more, that number.\n  We also have plans to bring on an Iraqi Army, which is exactly the \nright thing. Our numbers were smaller but now we are looking to have a \n40,000-person army. We could go more. I would have thought at first \nglance that we would have a larger army. But the truth is, Iraq is not \nsubject and not expecting and we should not worry too much about an \ninvasion of Iraq. What we have in Iraq is a suppression of pure and \nsimple crime--criminals, thugs, gang members, and that sort of thing. \nWe have the remnants of a Baathist regime that is attempting to \nsabotage a new and free government in the hopes they can at some point \nin the future recapture control of Iraq. Then we have Islamic \nextremists, not out of the heart of Islam but this extremist element \nthat is slipping into the country and participating. So this is quite a \ndifferent thing than what normally an army would confront.\n  These comments are relevant because a large part of the supplemental \nthat the President has asked for has been for the training of police \nand security forces. The administration, Ambassador Bremer also plans \nto bring on a substantial number of security forces. Those would \nprotect sites such as the oil companies or the electricity or the water \ncompanies that may be subject to sabotage and may require a different \nkind of training; maybe less training.\n  I point out these officers are being paid less than $100 per month. \nAnd I suppose for the most part they pay their own food, rent, and that \nkind of thing. But in salary alone, we could hire 20 Iraqi police \nofficers for the cost of one American soldier there on salary, not \ncounting the support group that has to keep that soldier there, not \ncounting the food they have or the retirement benefits or any of those \nthings. So we can probably do 30 or 40, maybe 50 Iraqi soldiers for the \ncost of 1 American soldier. The price, as I understand the salaries for \nthe soldiers and police, are not a lot different, and run, generally, \nunder $100 a month. This is the right way to go.\n  I had the opportunity when I visited in Iraq in August to go to the \nbase, the operating base of a military police unit from my home State \nof Alabama. They were first rate. Over half of them were police \nofficers in the State, patrolling State Troopers and sheriff's deputies \nand others. They have real-world experience. They told me they were \npatrolling with Iraqi police officers on a daily basis. They go to the \nIraqi police station, they buddy up, and go out and patrol in that \nfashion. That is precisely what we need to see more of.\n  There are a lot of reasons for that. Our soldiers, the mere presence \nof them, sends a clear message that we will not allow any organized \ngroup to assume control or domination over any area of Iraq.\n  Really, they are not good police officers because they can't speak \nthe language.\n  They may be some of the best police officers in Alabama or anyplace \nin the country, and they may have been trained going through the FBI \nAcademy. But if you can't speak the language, you really can't be as \neffective as you would like to be. What they are effective at is \nencouraging and strengthening the local Iraqi police officers. They are \ngood at training them, showing them how to keep records and how to \nmaintain intelligence. They can provide integrity, courage, and a sense \nof consciousness that we are going to be with those Iraqi police \nofficers who stand for a new Iraq, who put on that uniform, and who go \nout on patrols in neighborhoods where people know them and their \nfamilies. If they will show that courage and step out there and do the \njob, they can be successful and create a country that would be quite \ndifferent than they have had before. I know that can happen. I am \nreally convinced that can happen.\n  I am pleased that this supplemental has a good deal of money for \nthat. Some Members complain, well, we don't mind helping our American \nsoldiers over there, but we don't want to spend our money on \ninfrastructure or police training.\n  By the way, the infrastructure money includes training for police and \nsoldiers and for deployment of police and soldiers. I think that is \nwrong. What we know is this: We know we are spending almost $4 billion \na month to sustain our military forces there at some risk. There is no \ndoubt about it. We have lost 90 soldiers since May 1. I suppose it has \nbeen 120 days since that time. It is very disturbing.\n  I went by Walter Reed the weekend before last. I talked to soldiers \nwho lost limbs, who had been injured and are rehabilitating. Their \nspirit was terrific. But it does not cause you to lose appreciation. It \ncauses you to increase appreciation for them. I know the Senator from \nTexas has lost soldiers from Texas. We have lost 10 soldiers from my \nhome State of Alabama since this war began. I have had the burden of \ncalling families to express my personal sympathy and the sympathy on \nbehalf of our country for their service.\n  What do we do here? People say let us support our troops. Let us make \nsure they have the money, but we want to attack this extra money. It is \n$60 billion of this $87 billion for soldiers and maintaining our \nmilitary presence. It is $20 billion for reconstruction, which includes \nbringing on a military and a police force.\n  I am going to tell you frankly what my view is. I believe we need to \nhelp this country create a new country, one that provides opportunities \nfor all Iraqis to succeed.\n  Dr. Chalabi was the president last month of the council. They rotate. \nHe was here this past week. I note that some have criticized Dr. \nChalabi here and there. But he has been very effective as a leader over \nthere, it appears to me. He is outspoken and brilliant. He went to the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology. He majored in mathematics. He \nwent to the University of Chicago and got his Ph.D. in mathematics. He \nwas dean of the American University School in Beirut, Lebanon. He spent \n4 years living with the Kurds in northern Iraq as he helped to \nparticipate in the effort to overthrow the evil regime of Saddam \nHussein. He was sharing his vision of how they have already passed laws \nto allow economic progress to occur. They have already passed rules \nthat would break down the racial traditions. He said they had a law. \nSaddam Hussein went back to determine racial ancestries to the fifth \ngeneration and completely wiped them out. People are going to be given \na chance no matter what background or religion or ethnic group they are \nfrom to progress. It is exciting to hear people who have been there \ntalk about it. The key to it is going to be the police.\n\n  One Senator said, well, they are not very good. Senator Kennedy said \nthey are not effective. I asked our MPs in August about Baghdad. \nBaghdad is a tough area. Some of the areas are very peaceful, and \nthings going along much better than some of the areas in Baghdad. There \nare tough areas. They said: We like these police officers. They are \nworking with us. We patrol with them on a daily basis. One young \nsoldier told me, with no brass around: We bonded with them.\n  That is an important concept.\n  At Walter Reed the week before last, one of the soldiers who was \ninjured was an MP. He is a good-looking young\n\n[[Page S12435]]\n\nman. I asked him some questions. I asked him about local police, did he \nwork with them. Yes.\n  I asked: How good were they? What he said to me really kind of \nshocked me.\n  He said: That is exactly what President Bush asked me when he came by \nhere.\n  The President was at Walter Reed and visited with him and asked him \nthat question. How are the local police doing? He said: Yes, they are \nnot ready to take over the country right now. But he said they are \ngood. There are some good ones. He talked about when they went on \npatrol. One of the Iraqi policeman was at the rear of the patrol. They \ntook fire. He returned fire in an effective and courageous way. He was \nimpressed with him. He said that he showed discipline and courage under \nstress. He was impressed.\n  I also had the opportunity to meet the chief of police in Baghdad. He \nis a very impressive man; a two-star general under Saddam Hussein who \nmade negative comments about Saddam Hussein which resulted in him being \nput in jail for 2 years.\n  When asked by Secretary Wolfowitz at one point why he spoke out \nagainst Saddam Hussein, he said he really didn't speak out. He was \ntalking to his closest friend, questioning him, and it leaked back to \nSaddam Hussein and he goes to jail. That is the kind of life under \nwhich they lived. This man is courageous. Some say the police don't \nhave gumption. But he goes out personally on raids. They are doing \nraids every night seizing weapons and arresting dangerous individuals.\n  Two weeks before I got there, leading a raid late one night, the \nchief of police--you will not see that much in America cities--was out \non a raid and was shot in the leg and wounded. He came back to work \nsooner than he was supposed to according to the doctors because he \nwanted to be there. He wanted to show his commitment and wanted to get \nthe work done for Iraq.\n  Subsequent to my return, there was a bomb attempt to kill him.\n  There is a tough, dangerous group out there. How do you get them? We \nare not going to get them with rolling tanks down the street. We are \nnot going to get them with armored vehicles on the streets with \nAmericans who really become targets. We are going to get them by \nutilizing intelligence from individuals. We are going to utilize \nindividual police officers who are Iraqi citizens, who believe in a new \nIraq, who are willing to step up and be counted, and who can change \nthat country forever.\n  It is an exciting thing out there. I particularly wanted to share my \nthoughts today.\n  I do not agree with the comments of the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts who suggested that the police in Iraq are not effective \nand can't do the job. No, we shouldn't walk away from that. We \nshouldn't leave them out there exposed. If we stay to back them up, we \nwill be able to draw down our soldiers. And the sooner we can draw down \nour soldiers, the better we are going to be. That local police force \ncan be the key to stabilizing the country so that a new government can \nbe formed--a free, independent constitutional government that provides \nlegal protection for all.\n  I think we can be successful. We have made a commitment as a country. \nWe voted in this body 77 to 12 to undertake this activity. We were told \nthat all kinds of bad things would happen. Some have happened. We lost \nsome soldiers. But we lost fewer than most people were predicting. We \ndidn't have the house-to-house fighting in Baghdad. We didn't have the \nthousands of casualties that many predicted. We didn't have a \nhumanitarian disaster. We did not have a lot of things that were \npredicted. But the looting that took place exceeded anything I \nimagined. We found out the infrastructure in Iraq was far more damaged, \nhaving had far less updating and improvement in 20 or 30 years of his \nwarring than most people imagined. It will take more money than we \nthought.\n\n  So we get electricity turned on in that country and have it reliable \nfor the first time ever, we get the water on, a healthy water system, a \npolice force, and a continuing strengthening of that government.\n  We will have a new government and we will have been successful in \neliminating a major threat to this world and eliminating one of the \nmost despicable evil leaders this world has seen. I will put him in the \ntop 10 at any time. Any person who sees the graves of people killed by \nhim knows that is true. You see the pleasure the people have of seeing \nhim gone. It is overwhelming. A European poll not too long ago said 87 \npercent of the Iraqi people did not want the United States to leave \nright now.\n  We will be able to help them do something special, create a better \nlife for that area of the world, and in the long run that will be a \nmagnificent advantage to us. We do not want to take over their oil or \ntheir land or dictate religious faith. We simply want them to progress, \nto be successful, to create a good government so their people will be \nable to live in peace and harmony. That is our goal. It is a great goal \nand worthy of the United States.\n  This supplemental is critical. I am a frugal Member of this body. I \nam proud of the Watchdog of the Treasury Awards I get. I watch closely \nhow we spend money. But right now, let's do the right thing. Step up \nthe effort to create a stable Iraq, step up the timetable of bringing \nour troops home, and help step up the time the people of Iraq can have \na decent government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu).

Mr. President, I stand before you today to speak of a \nyoung man who has touched many of the lives here in the Senate Chamber. \nIt is with great sadness that I rise today to talk about a young man \nfrom Alaska. Alaska and the country lost this young man last week.\n  On Friday, just 1 week ago, one of my former Senate pages, Joshua \nAlexander Boycott, was killed in a car accident in his hometown of \nFairbanks. It was one of those mornings. He was driving his younger \nbrother to school. In Fairbanks at this time of year, winter is \nstarting to happen. It was the first snowfall, with slippery, icy \nroads. Apparently Josh lost control of the vehicle and was killed.\n  Josh was one of those young Americans, those young Alaskans whom we \nlook at and we can identify instantly as a young man going places. I \nlook at the beautiful faces of the young pages who serve in this \nChamber. I look at each one of them and I see the potential and the \ngreatness in each and every one of these beautiful young men and women. \nJosh had that.\n  Josh came to the Senate during the 2002 fall semester. He was one of \nthose who so thoroughly enjoyed what he did in the Senate as a page. \nFor those who are not familiar with the routines and rituals of the \npages on the Senate floor, it may seem that oftentimes what pages do is \na bit mundane--filling glasses of water, standing guard at the door \nduring the votes, getting lecterns for Senators so they may speak, \nrunning errands all over. It is not exactly intellectually challenging, \nhigh-powered stuff. But Josh enjoyed every bit of it. He would stand \nthere and open the door with a big smile and a ``Good morning.'' It was \nnot just to me, his Senator from Alaska, it was to every Senator who \ncame through. He was so thoroughly enjoying being part of the process. \nHe was well liked by the other pages with whom he worked. He did \nexceptionally well in the page school.\n  Again, the pages certainly know the routine they have to deal with on \na daily basis: Very early morning hours, attending page school, full, \nlong days, attending to their duties here in the Senate Chamber. And \nthen in the evening, it is not as though you have the night off and can \ngo do what you want; it is time to study and do all that is required of \nyou. It is an extremely rigorous schedule, but there were no complaints \nfrom Josh. He was thriving on it because he was doing exactly what he \nwanted to do.\n\n  The last time I saw Josh was in late July. He was one of two Alaskans \nselected to attend the American Legion\n\n[[Page S12436]]\n\nBoys Nation, a conference at Marymount University just outside of \nWashington, DC. After the conference ended, he came up to my office to \nsay hi to everybody because he made great friends here. I was fortunate \nenough to be having a party for my summer interns at my home that \nnight. We were having a barbecue at the house, so I invited Josh over \nto join us. He fell right in with this group of new Alaskans he hadn't \nmet, but by the end of the evening it was obvious everybody enjoyed him \nas much as I had. It was a wonderful conversation. We were talking \nabout what it is he wanted to do when he grew up, where he wanted to go \nnext. He actually had aspirations of attending my alma mater in \nWashington, DC, which is Georgetown. Josh was in the process of \napplying to the university.\n  What he really wanted to do was return to Washington, DC, to continue \nhis passion for politics. He had seen so much, he had observed so much, \nand was so stimulated by what he saw around him that he wanted to come \nback and make a difference. I have no doubt that were he able to, he \nwould have done just that.\n  In addition to being a great young man everybody liked, he was a \ngreat student. He was at the top of his class, ranking 15 out of 262 \nseniors. He scored over 1500--actually, 1510--out of a possible 1600 on \nhis SAT exam. He was an incredible singer. I had the privilege of being \nserenaded, if you will, by his singing choral group in Fairbanks. I \nlooked over and said, wait a minute, don't I know that boy from \nsomewhere? It was during the summer months. He left DC as a page and he \nwas then back in Fairbanks. I looked over and I thought, wait a minute, \nthat is Josh. What is he doing singing like a bird. It was beautiful, \njust gorgeous.\n  Josh was a dynamic young man, a gifted young man who had a future \nthat I think we can look to and say he was making a difference. It is a \ntragedy Josh's life was cut short. He was truly an extraordinary young \nman who brought so much joy and so much pleasure to everybody who was \naround him. I personally feel blessed to have known him, to have been \nable to share some of his short time with him. I ask that we remember \nhis friends, and particularly his family, who are grieving for this \nloss at this particular time.\n  But as we reflect on the life and contributions of a young man such \nas Josh Boycott, I suggest all those who are able to serve us here as \npages in the Senate look at this as a gift, an opportunity to be in a \nplace of service, to be in a place where you can learn, and you can \ngive back so much at a later point in your life.\n  So, again, I am blessed to have known Josh. I know many in this \nChamber feel the same way. I mentioned yesterday in the cloakroom that \nI was going to be speaking about Josh, and everyone in the cloakroom \nremembered him. He has been gone from the Senate Chamber now for over 6 \nmonths. All the Senate pages look alike--in terms of their dress, that \nis--yet Josh had distinguished himself.\n  So it is with great love and respect that we pay tribute to this fine \nyoung man and to his family during this time of mourning.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/03/senate-section/article/S12436-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12436-S12438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, health care affects each of us in very \npersonal ways. As a physician, but also being majority leader, people \nwill come to me and ask: What are you doing about this particular \nhealth care issue? It might be a senior who asks: Why don't I have \naccess to prescription drugs as I did when I was 60 years of age and \nemployed by a company, and all of a sudden it disappears when I go into \nMedicare?\n  That is the type of question to which this body has responded and, \nindeed, we have passed a prescription drug benefit appropriately \ncoupled with health care--Medicare specific--modernization, in the \nsense that it brings the Medicare Program up to today's standards, the \ntype of health care to which other people have access.\n  We are addressing in the conference between the House and the Senate \nthis Medicare prescription drug package. We had two meetings today with \nthe various conferees, in a bipartisan way--the House and Senate \ntogether working through the details of marrying the House and the \nSenate bill. I am absolutely confident that under the leadership of \nChairman Bill Thomas in the House and Vice Chairman Chuck Grassley in \nthe Senate that this conference will deliver a bill in October that \nwill accomplish that goal of health care security and access to \nprescription drugs for all seniors.\n  People also ask me: What about those people who do not have access to \nhealth insurance, those people who are not in Medicare at all? Medicare \nis our program for seniors and individuals with disabilities. What \nabout those who are not in Medicaid, which is our unique Federal-State \npartnership through which health care is delivered for the underserved \nand the impoverished or poor of the Nation? What if one is not in an \nemployer-sponsored plan as I mentioned?\n  Most people who are not in Medicare and Medicaid, the overwhelming \nmajority get their health care through employer-sponsored plans. What \nif somebody is not in one of those plans today? What if one is not in \nthe SCHIP program, the program that originated in our Congress that \nreaches out to children predominantly run by States, or if one is not \nin a Government program or not in the private program and thus \nuninsured? What are you doing, Senator Frist, and what will you do?\n  This week, the Census Bureau confirmed what many of us felt and \nfeared, and that is that the number of people without health insurance \nincreased last year to over 43 million. That is about one out of every \nseven Americans under the age of 65. That represents a 5.7 percent \nincrease over 2001. So the uninsured number is increasing, and there \nare a lot of reasons why. We have talked in our various conferences and \ncommittees and debated why that number is increasing. One can parse the \nstatistics and numbers and say that is how many do not have insurance \nover a period of time, and 6 months later many of them will have \ninsurance.\n  Putting all that aside, I argue that the uninsured are among the \ngreatest health care challenge we have in the United States of America \ntoday. Thus, I believe we have a real obligation not to say we have so \nmuch else going on that we cannot address that but that we do have \nreally a moral obligation to address this issue of the uninsured and to \ndo it in a systematic way.\n  As I mentioned before, very much of our focus has been on Medicare \ntoday. I will mention shortly some of what we have been doing with \nregard to the uninsured, but there is still a lot we need to be doing. \nIf we step back and look at our economy, although the economy itself is \nimproving--and maybe not as quickly as a lot of us would like, but the \neconomy is getting better each day--in spite of that, the budget \npressures at the State level and the job losses from last year combined \nin a very complex way to increase the number of uninsured to 43 million \npeople. To me, this is one of the most daunting health challenges--I \nwould say it is even beyond health policy challenges--that we have \naffecting our Nation.\n  I say that in part because of personal experience. I have had the \nopportunity to treat Medicare and Medicaid patients and the uninsured \nthrough the transplant program in which I had the opportunity to \nparticipate in Nashville. Both in the acute care and in the chronic \ncare, it is obvious that if one has no health insurance, no help with \nbeing able to access health care with a lowered financial burden, one's \nquality of health care suffers. It is not as good as the health care of \npeople who have some type of insurance, private sector or public \ninsurance.\n  The uninsured are four times less likely to receive dental care and \nnecessary medical care. They are five times less likely to obtain \nprescription drugs. They are four times more likely--and this really \nmakes sense--to access the emergency room for routine care rather than \nthe more efficient, and arguably more effective, channels\n\n[[Page S12437]]\n\nof being able to see a physician or go to a doctor's office.\n\n  The lack of affordable health care is also one of the key factors \nthat affects what we call health care disparities among the underserved \nor minorities themselves; that is, where a person of one race has \ndifferent health care outcomes than those of another race or one \nsocioeconomic level versus another socioeconomic level. It does not \nexplain it all, but it is clearly one of those variables we can affect, \nand we have to do it in a coordinated way because our health care \nsystem in America, which is the best in the world, no question about \nit, overall health care in the United States is of higher quality than \nanywhere in the world.\n  If we do look at the numbers that were released this week, they were \na year old, and since they were compiled--because they are historical \ndata, being a year old--the economy has improved over that year, and \nindeed almost all economists expect that, depending on how one looks at \nthe statistics, we will have annualized growth of nearly 4 percent in \nthe coming months. It may go higher than that and come back down a \nlittle bit, but we will have good, significant growth in the coming \nmonths.\n  Indeed, the Associated Press this week reported:\n\n       America's consumers, flush with tax cuts that left them \n     with extra cash in their wallets, ratcheted up their spending \n     by a strong .8 percent in August, helping to power an \n     economic resurgence.\n\n  So I think we are seeing improvements in our economy. That is only \njust beginning to be reflected in jobs. We did have encouraging news \nearlier this morning from the Labor Department that U.S. companies show \na net increase of 57,000 jobs. That is good news for the economy, but \nalso that is good news overall for health insurance or medical \ninsurance. Why? Because most Americans in this country get their health \ncare through their employer, through jobs. Thus, as we grow the economy \nand add jobs to the economy, we do have an expansion in medical \ncoverage.\n  While the recovery takes hold, it is clear that we have an obligation \nto respond with policies and that as we look at the future agenda in \nhealth care, we need to focus on the uninsured.\n  Some of what we are doing now in this body, in response to what we \nrecognize is a major problem and one that is growing, are the \nfollowing: Last month, the Senate passed the Labor, Health, and Human \nServices appropriations bill. In that bill, we had $1.6 billion for \ncommunity health centers. We met the President's request for an \nadditional $122 million in funding over last year, which was an \nincrease over last year. This response by this body enables us to move \ntoward the President's goal of enabling community health centers to \nserve an additional 6 million patients by the year 2006.\n  We all have community health centers in our States, districts, and \nregions, and we know the vital role they play in reaching out to the \nunderserved or those without health insurance today.\n  I say we all know, and I say that in part because I have been so \ninvolved in health care issues, being a physician, but I think we need \nto shine a light on them. They serve a tremendous need and respond in \nan innovative, flexible way that is locally driven, which is something \nthat cannot be praised enough.\n  Second, as I said, many people get their insurance through Federal \nprograms or joint Federal-State programs. There is a program called \nSCHIP. Basically when you hear SCHIP, think health care for children. \nIn July, the Senate fulfilled the President's request to extend the \navailability of $2.7 billion in Federal SCHIP funds that either expired \nat the end of 2002 or will expire in the current fiscal year. These \nfunds will be available to allow States to continue the program without \nwhich, if we had not acted, as many as a million children would have \nlost health coverage. That has now become law.\n  In addition, in terms of looking at what we are doing, focusing on \nthis whole issue of the uninsured, if you look to the jobs and growth \npackage, the 2003 jobs and growth package that we passed--people always \ntalk about the tax cuts, tax relief which is so instrumental in pulling \nus out of this recession and stimulating our economy, but in there as \nwell was $20 billion in fiscal relief that goes directly to the States, \nand about $10 billion of that was specifically targeted at enabling the \nStates to maintain gains they had made in health care for the poor \nthrough their Medicaid Programs through a tool or through the technique \nof the enhanced Medicaid Federal match rate. That is the technical way \nof saying the Federal Government, in an enhanced way, helps the States \nwith funds that go directly to the State.\n  I mentioned those two or three examples because it is important for \nour colleagues and others on the other side of the Capitol, in the \nother body, and really our constituents, to understand that we in the \nSenate are addressing the issues of the uninsured. President Bush has \nmade tax credits, what we call refundable tax credits for low- and \nmiddle-income families, a major part of his proposal to address the \nissues of the uninsured and to expand health coverage. He also has \nconsistently supported medical savings accounts and promoted the \nexpansion of medical savings accounts in other ways that can offer \naffordable health care options to those who might not have insurance \ntoday.\n  The President and we, or many of us--about half of us; not all of \nus--in this body continue to fight hard for medical liability reform, \nmedical litigation reform, malpractice reform. The reason for that is \nnot to in any way jeopardize the very good system we have, that if \nthere is harm and injury there is just and fair compensation, but the \npurpose for that is to get rid of the unnecessary lawsuits, the \nexcessive lawsuits that drive up the costs of health care that \nultimately are passed on to patients, driving up the cost of health \ninsurance for everybody. Meaning, if you don't have sufficient \nresources, you simply give up your health insurance or you can't get it \nin the first place. Again, it is an important part of the President's \ninitiative, as well as our own initiative on this floor. For my \ncolleagues, I will say we will keep coming back to address this whole \nissue of medical liability.\n  The cause of 43 million people who lack insurance today is difficult \nto characterize, in terms of a generalization. It does take a targeted \napproach to identify who the 43 million people are and then target \nspecific approaches to them. Therefore, it has to be comprehensive but \nit is also very complex by its very nature.\n  I think the tone of a lot of the debate today on the uninsured has \nbeen polarizing. Because of that polarizing framework, a lot of people \nhave been hesitant to put it out front and to put an agenda out front. \nI wish to share with my colleagues my commitment to work to find \nworkable solutions to a problem that is increasing, a problem that \ndirectly affects the health care of 43 million but indirectly affects \nthe health care, really, of us all.\n\n  In that regard, I have asked Senator Judd Gregg, our colleague from \nNew Hampshire, to lead a Senate Republican task force on uninsured and \naccess to affordable health care coverage. I have asked Senator Gregg \nand his task force to propose a series of recommendations to address \nthe uninsured issue so we can both debate, discuss, and through \ncommittees but also on the floor attack this problem head on.\n  The task force will be looking at all options, including new ideas. I \nlook at it as a place that ideas can be brought, that we can debate and \ndiscuss, and hopefully we will look at many of the ideas that have been \nproposed in the past but also reach out and obtain new ideas, creative \nideas, ideas we may not yet have thought about or that we haven't \naddressed in the past.\n  I do intend to take these recommendations and use them as a basis in \nestablishing a legislative agenda so we can on this floor \nsystematically address the issue of the uninsured.\n  In closing, I appreciate Senator Gregg's willingness to take on this \ntask. I look forward to working with him and his task force in \naddressing this pressing issue. I am confident that out of this task \nforce we will get new ideas, innovative thinking, dynamic ideas that \nwill allow us to deliver real solutions to the American people who do \nnot have health insurance today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n[[Page S12438]]\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Before he leaves the floor, I say to the distinguished \nmajority leader how much I have enjoyed working with him over the years \non this issue of health care. As he knows, Senator Hatch and I have \nworked for many months on a bipartisan proposal that we would like to \nbe part of the discussion he is going to launch. I have come to the \nconclusion that, as pressing as the financial issues are with respect \nto health care, the social and ethical issues are going to be even more \nimportant as we face this demographic tsunami of millions of baby \nboomers who are retiring in 2010 and 2011. So I am grateful the \nmajority leader continues his interest in health care.\n  I continue to have a bipartisan interest in working with the majority \nleader, who has spent so much time on those issues over the years. I \nknow I speak for Senator Hatch in this regard as well.\n  We have to break the gridlock on this issue. Literally for 60 years, \nif you look at the parallel between what Harry Truman tried in the 81st \nCongress in 1945 and what was tried in 1993 and up to this day, we see, \nunless we find a way to take a fresh approach, as the distinguished \nmajority leader said today, we are not going to break this gridlock.\n  So I welcome your statement today. I am anxious to work with you and \nthe chairman of the committee, Senator Gregg, to pursue these \nproposals.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, just briefly responding through the Chair, \nI very much appreciate those comments because, just as we have done \nwith Medicare, it is going to take strong bipartisan support to get \ngood, effective legislation through.\n  Second, the point about why now versus 10 years ago, 20 years ago, or \n30 years ago--I agree wholeheartedly. We have this huge demographic \nshift that didn't occur 10 years ago or 20 years ago or 30 years ago or \n40 years ago, that we are realizing right now. It gives us a perfect \nreason for all of us to come together to address these problems--the \nuninsured is a major one for both of us--in a way that may be \nunprecedented, at least in the last 10, 20, or 30 years.\n  I very much appreciate those comments and look forward to working \nwith my colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/03/senate-section/article/S12438-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12438-S12439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         IRAQI GASOLINE PRICES\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon because \nI am troubled by what appears to be a request by the Bush \nadministration in the Iraq supplemental that would have our citizens \nuse their hard-earned tax dollars to subsidize the cost of gasoline in \nIraq so Iraqi citizens would only have to pay 10 cents a gallon.\n  The questions I am going to raise this afternoon with respect to this \nproposal can all be found essentially on page 29 of the report with \nrespect to the request for the supplemental funds for rehabilitation \nand reconstruction of Iraq.\n  For those who are following this discussion, this is under the \nquestion of the purchase of oil products at page 29 of the request for \nthe supplemental.\n  I want to begin asking some questions about the fairness of this Bush \nproposal and about how this subsidy program that is in this report \nwould work if it was actually to be funded by the Senate.\n  Today I also intend to send a letter to the President trying to get \nanswers to some of these questions. But I would tell the Senate that \nhere is what we know at present.\n  The Bush administration has included in its Iraq supplemental funding \nrequest an estimated cost of $900 million to cover the difference \nbetween ``Iraqi demand and refinery production to establish and \nmaintain a 30-day reserve in all major petroleum products to ensure no \ninterruption in basic services due to terrorist activity.''\n  The administration's funding request specifies:\n\n       $600 million will be needed in the first quarter of 2004 to \n     compensate for the large difference between demand and \n     production and to build this 30-day reserve.\n\n  The first question is, How much is going to be spent on creating this \nreserve, and how much is going to be spent on purchasing gasoline for \nIraqis? Using demand data from the Energy Information Agency's latest \nreport on Iraq and current market conditions, it is estimated the \nestablishment of a 30-day fuel product reserve would cost approximately \n$200 million. If that amount is correct, that would mean roughly $400 \nmillion would be spent to purchase gasoline and other petroleum \nproducts for Iraqis in the first 90 days of next year. Iraq is \nimporting about 750,000 gallons of gasoline a day, according to recent \nstatements by senior oil ministry officials.\n  Based on those statements, Iraq would need about 67.5 million gallons \nduring the first quarter of 2004. If that estimate is correct, U.S. \ntaxpayers would be paying almost $6 per gallon for the gasoline that is \nprovided to Iraqis by the United States in the first quarter of 2004.\n  The question I ask today and in the days ahead will be: Why does it \ncost $6 per gallon to provide gasoline to Iraqis when the cost in \nneighboring countries such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait is less than $1 \nper gallon and below the $2 per gallon cost almost everywhere in our \ncountry?\n  According to an article in the Houston Chronicle on September 28, the \nUnited States has already spent hundreds of millions of dollars to \nprovide gasoline to Iraq under the contract previously issued with \nHalliburton. My question here would be: What is the cost of gasoline \nthat has been sent to Iraq by the United States? What was the wholesale \nprice involved here that Halliburton paid for the gas sent to Iraq at \ntaxpayer expense?\n  Of course, I think our citizens would want to know what profit was \nmade on these deliveries.\n  The Houston Chronicle also reported that in Iraq the low-octane \ngovernment-subsidized gasoline sells for less than a dime a gallon.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from the Houston Chronicle \nentitled ``U.S. Taxpayer Footing Bill for Cheap Iraqi Gasoline'' be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n       [From the Houston Chronicle; Sept. 28, 2003]\n\n          U.S. Taxpayers Footing Bill for Cheap Iraqi Gasoline\n\n                           By Michael Hedges\n\n       Baghdad, Iraq.--Mahmoud Ali, a gap-toothed 15-year-old, \n     worked steadily under a penetrating sun at his rather \n     monotonous job outside the large Mansur filling station here.\n       Taking turns with his two uncles, Ali waited in line in the \n     family's 1982 Chevrolet to get a tank of cheap gasoline, \n     which the locals call benzene, at the station subsidized by \n     the Iraqi Oil Ministry.\n       After filling up the faded white Chevy, the men pulled the \n     vehicle to a curb. There, they siphoned the fuel into 20-\n     liter plastic jugs to sell at triple the posted price to \n     other drivers too frustrated to wait in the lengthy lines.\n       Then, one of the men drove the Chevy back to the line to \n     sweat it out until another full tank of fuel could be \n     secured.\n       Selling fuel at three time its state-set price about 100 \n     yards from a line of 14 working pumps would be a hard dollar \n     to earn in another economy.\n       But it works here in Iraq, because the low-octane, \n     government-subsidized fuel sells for less than a dime a \n     gallon. Even working-class Iraqis earning a few dollars a day \n     are willing to pay outrageous mark-ups to avoid the line.\n       ``Benzene is cheaper than water here,'' local journalist \n     Qais Al-Bashir said Friday.\n       What it is costing American taxpayers is another story.\n       Since the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime last April, \n     Iraq's resuscitated oil industry has been unable to produce \n     enough gasoline, cooking oil and other petroleum products to \n     meet the country's needs.\n       So far, U.S. taxpayers have spent some $562 million under \n     the Halliburton contract to bring in gasoline and other fuels \n     and make needed repairs to Iraq's gas distribution network, \n     according to the Army Corps of Engineers. In fact, that \n     effort has accounted for nearly half the $1.22 billion worth \n     of work that Halliburton has performed in Iraq since the war.\n       ``The benzene we sell here comes from Turkey, Kuwait and \n     Saudi Arabia,'' said Majed Mohammed, 44, who manages the \n     Mansur station for the Iraqi Oil Ministry.\n       ``Before the war,'' he said, `` it was 100 percent from \n     Iraq. But now we have problems with sabotage of the \n     pipelines. The refineries are working at far less than \n     capacity.''\n       Mohammed, who has worked for the Oil Ministry for 21 years, \n     said artificially low fuel prices are nothing new to his \n     country.\n       ``The cost is subsidized by the ministry,'' he said. ``It \n     was like that before the war when Saddam was here, and it is \n     the same now. We are obliged to do it because of the needs of \n     the people. If we didn't, there would be major problems and \n     even more anger at the Americans.''\n       Iraq is importing about 750,000 gallons of gasoline a day, \n     according to recent statements by senior Oil Ministry \n     officials. Expectations by the Bush administration that\n\n[[Page S12439]]\n\n     oil could fund the massive rebuilding of the country--or at \n     least the needs of its people in the immediate future--have \n     not been met.\n       Iraq's oil output is less than half the pre-war level of \n     2.3 million barrels per day and only about one-third the 3.2 \n     million barrels produced by the nation before the 1991 \n     Persian Gulf War and the subsequent United Nations embargo.\n       Experts differ on when Iraq's fuel production capacity will \n     reach 1990 levels. The Coalition Provisional Authority, which \n     oversees the U.S.-led occupation, has said that production \n     could reach 3 million barrels per day by later summer of \n     2004. Private analysts have said it could take at least a \n     couple of years to reach that level.\n       For the foreseeable future, the occupation authority will \n     have to spend massive amounts to underwrite the fuel used by \n     Iraqis. And conservation seems unlikely in a country where \n     decades of cheap gasoline have created a culture in which \n     driving around in aging, fume-spewing cars is seen as a form \n     of recreation.\n       ``Iraqis always loved to drive, and there are more cars \n     than ever now--cars from Kuwait and Jordan that have come in \n     since the war,'' said Mohammed, the Mansur filling station \n     manager.\n       Even on Friday, the Muslim holy day, lines formed at the \n     city's fuel stations.\n       ``We used to be open 24 hours a day before the war, so \n     there were no lines,'' Mohammed said. ``Now we have a curfew, \n     and people don't feel safe to wait in line after dark because \n     of the explosions.''\n       The 10-person staff at the Mansur station provides its own \n     security, and a stack of AK-47s is kept handy in the main \n     office.\n       Not all the city's fuel stations are owned and operated by \n     the Oil Ministry, though none is a truly private business.\n       Meqdam Abdullah, 30, runs a station near the Sheraton \n     Ishtar Hotel in central Baghdad that his family leases from \n     the Oil Ministry. In exchange, officials sell fuel to the \n     station at a slightly reduced price. By averaging sales of \n     more than 100,000 liters a day, the station ekes out a small \n     profit, Abdullah said.\n       But it is a tough business. During the war, the station got \n     caught in a firefight between U.S. soldiers and armed \n     looters, as evidenced by patched bullet holes.\n       Since the war ended, thieves have struck more than once, \n     taking, among other things, the station's generator that is \n     needed to produce electricity. Abdullah's family had to pay \n     the looters to get the generator back. It was a necessary \n     expense, because officials provide electricity to Baghdad in \n     sequences of three hours on, three hours off.\n       Like many other Iraqis, Abdullah said the failure of U.S. \n     authorities to provide security is his biggest complaint in \n     the post-Saddam era. The lack of consistent electricity is \n     the second.\n       He attributed the sporadic power to some inscrutable form \n     of manipulation similar to the times, he said, that Saddam \n     cut off fuel to disfavored minorities.\n       ``America,'' Abdullah said, ``is the world's great \n     superpower, and it can't get the electricity back? I can't \n     believe that.''\n       The generator briefly failed at the service station on \n     Friday. Ironically, dirty fuel provided by the government \n     because of poor refining was believed to be the cause, \n     Abdullah said.\n       For a while, the station was quiet. But as the generator \n     sputtered back to life, cars immediately veered into the \n     lanes besides the pumps.\n       The only types of gasoline transaction not largely \n     controlled by the Oil Ministry here are the bootleg \n     operations like those of Ali and his uncles.\n       ``It is illegal, but no one bothers with them,'' shrugged \n     Mohammed, the Mansur station manager.\n       On Friday, business was slow as Ali and his uncles offered \n     large plastic jugs of fuel for sale.\n       ``It is always slow like this on Fridays, because it is the \n     holy day,'' Ali said. ``But we'll be back tomorrow. We always \n     do well on Saturdays.''\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, my question flowing from what we have \nlearned and the various issues we have been exploring throughout the \ndays since we learned about this is, Were U.S. taxpayer funds spent to \nkeep the cost of gasoline in Iraq at this heavily subsidized low price?\n  I am of the view that our taxpayers deserve to get answers to these \nquestions. I think we deserve to get them before Congress votes on the \nBush administration's funding request.\n  I can tell my colleagues in the Senate that when I read page 29 of \nthis particular report with respect to oil products purchased, I was \nvery concerned. My citizens and the folks I represent in the Pacific \nNorthwest consistently pay some of the highest gasoline prices in our \ncountry. Oregon, Washington, and California have been very hard hit \nwith respect to gas prices. It amounts to a quasi-monopoly in 27 States \nin our country. We have red lining. We have zone pricing, and a whole \nhost of anticompetitive practices. Now we have outlined on page 29 of \nthis request for supplemental funds what appears to be a request from \nthe administration to have the hard-earned tax dollars of our citizens \ngo to subsidize the cost of gasoline in Iraq so Iraqi citizens will \nonly have to pay 10 cents a gallon. I can tell my colleagues there are \npeople we represent here in the Senate who are not paying that kind of \nmoney.\n  That is why I want to get the details on this proposal. I am \namplifying on the questions I am asking today in a letter to the \nPresident of the United States. We also come away with a concern that \nthe administration seems to be willing to support creating a reserve in \nIraq to protect Iraqi citizens against interruptions in gasoline and \ndiesel fuel supplies when there is no gas and diesel reserve in the \nUnited States to protect our citizens in the event of terrorist \nactivity or other disruptions.\n  This proposal in the report which I have outlined and referred to \nspecifically so that colleagues can see it raises some very troubling \nquestions.\n  Given what we already know now that the administration has included \nin its Iraq supplemental funding request an estimated cost of $900 \nmillion to cover the difference between Iraqi demand in refinery \nproduction to establish and maintain this reserve due to possible \nterrorist activities, I think it is time for the Senate to take out a \nsharp pencil and review this proposal very carefully. I think it raises \nfundamental questions with respect to fairness and with respect to how \nthe hard-earned tax dollars of our citizens are being used at a time \nwhen in my State, with the highest unemployment rate in the country, \nthere is a world of hurt.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a good look at this proposal because I \nintend to focus more on it when the Senate comes back after having the \nopportunity to be home and gather with the people we represent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/03/senate-section/article/S12439-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12439-S12440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CHARITABLE CHOICE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in April of this year the Senate passed, \nwith an overwhelming vote of 95 to 5, a bill called the charitable \nchoice bill. It is obviously bipartisan legislation that was shepherded \nthrough this body by Senator Santorum, and a lot of work, over a long \nperiod of time, has been put into the efforts for passage of this \nlegislation.\n  Two weeks ago, the House of Representatives passed its version, H.R. \n7, by a vote--again, it was overwhelming--of 408 to 13.\n  The regular process of the House and the Senate is that the bill will \nproceed to a conference on the differences between these two bills. \nUnfortunately, it is my understanding that we will be unable to reach \nan agreement today, this afternoon, before adjourning to go on break, \nto appointment conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  There is, simply put, an objection on the other side of the aisle, \nand with so many Members who have left for the day, I will not ask for \na formal consent agreement. But clearly, I am disappointed that we were \nunable to take the next logical regular order step in finishing this \nbill. I do hope we can clear this agreement with my Democratic \ncolleagues just as soon as we return from this nonlegislative period.\n  Another disappointment for me, as we prepare to adjourn, has to do \nwith the partial-birth abortion ban bill--disappointment that we are \nnot able to progress with the legislative process until we get back. \nWhen we do return, I will seek an agreement for the consideration of \nthe conference report to accompany S. 3, the partial-birth abortion ban \nbill. In fact, it is S. 3 which shows the priority of this body toward \nthis important legislation.\n  Yesterday the House of Representatives passed the conference report, \nand as soon as we get back, we will be scheduling it for consideration. \nThe bill passed the Senate on a bipartisan vote of 64 to 33. With the \nconference complete and with the House having passed the agreement, it \nis imperative that the Senate consider this measure\n\n[[Page S12440]]\n\nin short order so the President can sign this legislation into law.\n  As I watched yesterday with the House completing their \nresponsibilities on this legislation, I was hopeful that we could do \nthat, pass it today. Why? Because this is a bill that I believe will \nsave lives. It is a ban on a procedure that offends the sensibilities \nof almost all Americans, a procedure that the will of this Congress \nsaid to ban, and a bill the President will sign. Yet we will not be \nable to, at this juncture, consider it until we get back.\n  I know discussions have begun on both sides of the aisle as to how \nmuch debate time will be needed. I encourage members to move quickly on \nwhat we expect to be the final action--the final action--on this \nimportant priority. I will speak directly to the issue as soon as we \nreturn, but I wanted to put my colleagues on notice that we will be \nmoving forward and will be scheduling this conference report for Senate \naction as soon as we possibly can.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/03/senate-section/article/S12440-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               KURT DODD\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, each year, a prominent member of the \nNation's cultural community is invited to deliver a lecture on the role \nof the arts in the public policy. These annual lectures are tribute to \nthe memory of Nancy Hanks, who served as chairperson of the National \nEndowment for the Arts from 1969 to 1977, and who had the wide respect \nof all of us on both sides of the aisle.\n  Robert Redford was honored as this year's Nancy Hanks Lecturer, and \nhe delivered an impressive address at the Kennedy Center last month.\n  His remarks emphasized the fundamental importance of the arts in our \npublic policy, as an essential expression of our freedom and as an \nindispensable part of our national imagination at its best.\n  The unfortunate reality today is that when the economy suffers, \nsupport for the arts and for arts education is reduced. In communities \nacross the Nation, funding for the arts and for cultural programming \nare facing serious reductions. Robert Redford's address reminds us of \nthe unacceptable price we pay for neglecting the arts.\n  Today, Robert Redford is an American cultural icon, and his \naccomplishments as an actor and director are renowned throughout the \nworld. His advocacy for the arts is less well known, but he deserves \ngreat credit for his impressive leadership and dedication in elevating \nthe national debate on this vital issue. Many of us feel it is his \nfinest role of all.\n  At the beginning of his lecture, speaking of his own early years, he \nsays:\n\n       I grew up in a time when democracy was taken for granted \n     since it was drummed into our minds as a fundamental \n     definition of America and why it was great. I was shaped by \n     WWII and a time when we were all united in its purpose--\n     unlike conflicts of today. Because times were tough, and my \n     family resources slim, we didn't have fancy toys or luxuries \n     and had to be creative in inventing worlds of our own. My \n     imagination was my most valuable commodity and thankfully it \n     became a life force for me at a very young age. I saw the \n     world around me not only as it was. I saw the world around me \n     as it could be. Art and the imagination that give it life \n     became my closest companions.\n       Before anyone was much interested in what I had to say, \n     they were interested in what I created. As a kid, I remember \n     sketching everything in sight. My parents and their friends \n     played cards and I began drawing them as a group, individual \n     faces and the like. Then I moved under the table and began \n     sketching their feet at which point I think everyone started \n     to worry. Even though they thought I was a bit weird, I got \n     attention and encouragement for my ``art'' at a young age.\n\n  His lecture will be of interest to all of us in Congress and I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Remarks of Robert Redford at the Americans for the Arts' 16th Annual \n             Nancy Hanks Lecture on Arts and Public Policy\n\n       I've been coming to Washington, D.C. for the past 30 years, \n     either filming here, as was the case in All the President's \n     Men, or for lobbying efforts on behalf of issues relating to \n     the environment, energy, human rights and art. In the \n     beginning, it was a heady experience to be in the halls of \n     power surrounded by history and event, feeling what it is \n     like to be an integral part of a democracy--particularly if \n     you were fortunate enough to move someone on an important \n     issue.\n       In time, you experience changes in political climates, \n     different attitudes and priorities. The strength of the \n     system that controls decisions and compromises became clear \n     over time, and expectations of success had to be tendered \n     with failure relating to these realities. But still, you feel \n     fortunate to have access to the ears that made decisions.\n       Even though you knew that celebrity was maybe a door \n     opener, it nonetheless cuts both ways in politics. Like the \n     time I was on the Presidential campaign trail and speaking to \n     thousands of kids on a college campus about the importance of \n     their vote and environmental issues. In the roar of their \n     connection with what I was saying, I thought for a moment \n     ``I'm really getting through here!'' Then I walked off stage \n     and immediately a reporter stuck a microphone in my face and \n     said, ``Who do you think is better looking, you or Dan \n     Quayle?\n       So, just when you might be feeling your oats, reality has a \n     way of sneaking up and putting it all in perspective. But as \n     a citizen and an artist, I try to remember that it is a right \n     and responsibility to be able to partake in the process of \n     democracy I'm here today because of my belief that art is a \n     great translator of that which is both familiar and \n     unfamiliar and that it is through art that we can come to \n     know ourselves and others. To me, the vitality and insight \n     which art brings to civil society is more important now than \n     ever.\n       I grew up in a time when democracy was taken for granted \n     since it was drummed into our minds as a fundamental \n     definition of America and why it was great. I was shaped by \n     WWII and a time when we were all united in its purpose--\n     unlike conflicts of today. Because times were tough, and my \n     family financial resources slim, we didn't have fancy toys or \n     luxuries and had to be creative in inventing worlds of our \n     own. My imagination was my most valuable commodity and \n     thankfully it became a life force for me at a very young age. \n     I saw the world around me not only as it was. I saw the world \n     around me as it could be.

Then I moved under the table and began \n     sketching their feet at which point I think everyone started \n     to worry. Even though they though I was a bit weird, I got \n     attention and encouragement for my ``art'' at a young age.\n       While I was a poor student academically, I shined in sports \n     and in art and my third grade teacher was next to recognize \n     that art was a legitimate means of expression for me as I \n     struggled with more traditional approaches.\n       I remember she had me come to the front of the room and \n     draw a story on this big pad of newsprint on an easel. I \n     think we were studying English and she used it as a basis to \n     make a point. The whole class seemed to get it and all \n     learned a little about sentence structure and storytelling in \n     away that engaged and made sense. I didn't know what ``it'' \n     was that they got, but it sure felt good.\n       My teacher's encouragement of my artistic tendencies \n     continued, making me realize art was something legitimate to \n     pursue and that it was integral to how I was finding my way \n     in this world and making sense of things. If not for this, I \n     may have taken a path that wasn't as fulfilling and \n     productive. That's the main reason I'm here, to pay tribute \n     to the work that so many of you do every day, to keep art \n     alive in schools and in communities all across the country.\n       Being in this hall tonight prompted me to remember some of \n     the writings of President\n\n[[Page S12441]]\n\n     John F. Kennedy. I became reacquainted with a speech he gave \n     in 1963 at Amherst College where he paid tribute to the \n     American poet Robert Frost, and reflected on the value of the \n     arts to a society. It was less than a month before his \n     assassination.\n       ``I look forward to an America which will reward \n     achievement in the arts as we reward achievement in business \n     or statecraft. I look forward to an America, which will \n     steadily raise the standards of artistic accomplishment and \n     will steadily enlarge cultural opportunities for all of our \n     citizens.''--John F. Kennedy.\n       To me, art, in all its forms, is the purest reflection of \n     the most diverse aspects of us as individuals, as \n     communities, as nations and as cultures. It's art that feeds \n     and nurtures the soul of a society; provokes thought; \n     inspires critical thinking; and fosters understanding of \n     things foreign to our own immediate world. In the end, art \n     plays a primary role in encouraging healthy tolerance of \n     diversity in any culture. In times like these--in this very \n     hour--more of this kind of encouragement would serve us well. \n     Joseph Campbell felt that a society without mythology was \n     doomed. I feel the same way about the role that art can play \n     in a society's sustainable future. On the surface, it may not \n     have the weight of the SEC, the Dept. of Defense, or Social \n     Security and other programs that may be easier to quantify. \n     But it is still a part of the whole. More importantly, it \n     exemplifies one of our great, maybe our greatest critical \n     luxuries--freedom of expression.\n       Throughout the 80s and into the 90s, battles over free \n     expression were furious and frequent. On the one side, the \n     perception that art was undermining the moral fabric of our \n     society began to stick and took on a life of its own and it \n     became the order of the day. When the moralistic posturing \n     gave way to the rationale to cut funding, for a time it was \n     the political value of attacking the arts that increased \n     significantly in stature. By falsely positioning the debate \n     as one of morals and money, these forces hoped to use fear to \n     obscure the real truth--the value of art to every community--\n     and fear is a very dangerous platform to work off of.\n       I wondered then, why aren't they going after tabloid media \n     or corporate greed with such a vengeance? Why isn't there the \n     same fervor about the dismal state of literacy in our \n     schools, the AIDS epidemic, or homeless men, women and \n     children? Why is the zeal not pointed at the virtual flood of \n     guns and drugs into our nation's streets, or pollution into \n     our air and water and the resulting public health \n     implications? When has a painting ever instigated the \n     destruction of a culture? Is a song or a play, a painting or \n     a photograph that much of a threat to our nation's well-\n     being? That notion seems particularly absurd in light of the \n     larger threats we are currently facing.\n       Luckily the collective voice against this trend won out, \n     and of course, the political winds changed substantially. \n     And, while the cultural wars may have subsided, they still \n     rear their ugly head too frequently. But there's more than \n     one way to strangle the arts and today, funding cuts being \n     discussed all across this country at all levels of government \n     could paint a truly devastating picture when all is said and \n     done.\n       As most of you know all to well, when the economy is in as \n     bad a shape as it is now, art becomes the ``throw-away.'' Art \n     and art education becomes the funding cut they feel won't \n     have a tangible effect. In other words, it's the cut from \n     which they think nobody will suffer and they think nobody \n     will notice its absence. Well that's not true. It may take a \n     while to get it, but society at large will suffer and I \n     believe, society at large will ultimately notice.\n       Government support for the arts is not the frivolous give-\n     away that some would have you believe. It's a good investment \n     and it is sound economic development. Art and public policy \n     is good business. Let's look at the financial stake \n     government has in the arts. The non-profit arts world is \n     roughly a $134 billion a year industry, employing millions. \n     It generates nearly $81 billion in spending by those who \n     partake in its cultural offerings and is responsible for some \n     $24 billion in taxes going back to federal, state and local \n     governments annually.\n       And, this doesn't take into consideration the impact the \n     non-profit sector has as the training ground for writers, \n     musicians, actors, dancers, painters, photographers, \n     filmmakers and the like. It doesn't take into consideration \n     the ultimate effect these people and their work have on a \n     thriving multi-billion dollar private sector.\n       So, supporting the arts is good business and the numbers \n     bear this out. It's also good public policy. A study by the \n     Justice Dept., Americans for the Arts and the NEA \n     demonstrated that arts programs helped at-risk youth stay out \n     of trouble, perform better in school and improve how they \n     felt about themselves and their future. How do you put a \n     price on that?\n       Yet, President Bush recommended virtually no increase for \n     arts grants administered by the NEA. President Bush also \n     recommended terminating funding of the Arts in Education \n     program, which is administered through the Dept. of \n     Education. State legislatures all across the country are \n     making substantial cuts. Several states proposed wiping out \n     their entire state budget for the arts.\n       Are these federal and state governments missing something \n     in turning their backs on the arts? You bet they are. We need \n     people in office who will have a vision for our country that \n     goes beyond the next election. We need people in office who \n     understand that encouraging creative pursuit could be \n     critical to any number of sectors, from the next great \n     technological idea to the next historic medical discovery. \n     How do you put a price on that?\n       Creativity is made all the more special because it is a \n     great intangible. It can come from the most unlikely places \n     and from those that might not fit the ``traditional'' model \n     of the artist. Creativity is inherent in all great endeavors \n     whether traditionally artistic or not. It is creativity that \n     must continue to be nurtured if we hope to reap the benefits \n     of the many great minds we don't yet know. How do you put a \n     price on that?\n       Yes there are pressing needs all around us. But completely \n     ceasing to fund the arts is sadly short sighted in any \n     economy. Governments have to find a way to remain in the mix \n     of resources for the arts and the private sector--\n     corporations, foundations and individuals--they all need to \n     find ways to help fill the gap during these tough times such \n     as we're in now.\n       And that includes my industry, which benefits greatly from \n     a vital and thriving artistic force. When one thinks of \n     Hollywood, art isn't necessarily the first thing to come to \n     mind. Some would say it is often anti-art. No. It's first a \n     business. But it is a business that cannot exist without \n     creative talent in every facet of the making of its product. \n     So, in the end, the challenge to create art still rests \n     squarely on the artist not the industry. As in any medium, \n     sometimes we succeed and sometimes we fail. But we succeed \n     often enough to create films that inspire, expose, transform \n     and provoke, amuse, entertain and even teach.\n       Just as all other arts did at the moment of their own \n     conception, cinema transformed the world. For good or for \n     bad, it is a universal communicator on a global platform. \n     Film is an indigenous American art form even though it's \n     always been a struggle to have it taken seriously as an art \n     form. But we can't deny that business has significantly \n     infiltrated the practice of art in general, and in particular \n     film. The constant talk of grosses--dollars and cents as the \n     benchmark of a film's worth--is very debilitating to the body \n     of serious film discussion and appreciation. And after all, \n     where would the business of film be without art as its \n     seed.\n       While mine is a somewhat solid industry, it will be \n     important in the years to come for it to embrace risks as \n     readily as is does, sure things. It must sure that freedom of \n     artistic expression is honored and nurtured across a broad \n     spectrum. I believe strongly that keeping diversity alive in \n     my industry will keep the industry alive.\n       For example, the Sundance Institute is a step toward making \n     sure diverse voices and the creative energy they bring with \n     them are given an opportunity to grow and evolve. Those who \n     come to the Sundance labs to make films and those who come to \n     the Festival to show films really are a microcosm of the kind \n     of diverse voices which our industry needs to continue to \n     support and nurture if it wants to maintain itself. They are \n     also the kind of voices that will join in characterizing us \n     to the rest of the world in the years to come. It's all \n     connected.\n       Even after two decades, Sundance continues to be a \n     community work in progress, success and failure \n     simultaneously evident, treating failure as a step toward \n     growth, rather than the destruction of a vision. I look at \n     the Sundance Film Festival and the innovative hustle \n     demonstrated by scores of young filmmakers to bring their \n     vision to the screen. They haven't curled up and died because \n     they can't get government backing for their projects. Somehow \n     they find a way. But I'm sure if I took a quick poll, I'd \n     find that most of them found art, found their voice, in \n     neighborhood, community and school arts programs. That's \n     where they began the dance with the wonders of creativity.\n       By the way, I started the Sundance Institute with a grant \n     from the NEA when many others were skeptical of the idea's \n     potential and ultimate worth. I will always be grateful to \n     the NEA for believing in us at the time. It was instrumental \n     in getting us started. It wasn't just the seed funding, but \n     the seal of approval that gave the idea impetus.\n       What most of you know that maybe others don't is that out \n     there right now is some kid with a great song in their head \n     we've yet to hear or a novel in their heart that has yet to \n     be written. There's someone out there that hasn't picked up a \n     paintbrush yet but has a masterpiece on the horizon. There's \n     a kid out there who hasn't picked up a camera yet but could \n     end up making a memorable film of their time.\n       What most of you know that others might not as clearly see, \n     is that the nurturing of creativity comes into play in \n     everything from world diplomacy to world economics, business \n     endeavors to social endeavors and everything in between. It \n     is creativity that gives all of it the nuance that often \n     makes the difference. In all its forms, art plays a critical \n     role in finding our way as people and as a culture.\n       As President Kennedy said that day in Amherst: ``I see \n     little more importance to the future of our country and our \n     civilization than full recognition of the place of the \n     artist. If art is to nourish the roots of our culture, \n     society must set the artist free to follow his vision \n     wherever it takes him.''\n       We hear the word freedom bandied about a lot these days. \n     It's a sacred concept. How fortunate we are to have it. How \n     viscerally\n\n[[Page S12442]]\n\n     we need to feel the commitment to protect it. To be able to \n     be part of a freedom of expression that allows us to tell \n     stories of our choice in the uniqueness of our own voices as \n     citizens and as artists is not to be taken lightly. To be \n     able to freely voice dissent in our hearts or in our art is \n     something to protect at all costs. But then, the glory of art \n     is that it can, not only survive change, it can inspire \n     change.\n       It is for all these reasons that it behooves government to \n     sustain an environment that enables, supports and nurtures \n     the free and creative expression of its citizenry.\n       I have great hope for the future of art and thus civil \n     society as I look out over this room, and imagine the \n     collective power, the collective voice that will not cower in \n     the face of budget slashing critics, and will not surrender \n     its advocacy for art and free expression.\n       My hope comes from not only those gathered here tonight, \n     but from the efforts of grassroots, state and national \n     organizations; young artists I meet at Sundance film labs; \n     inner-city elementary school kids who are learning to play \n     music and write poetry; the literary and theater programs in \n     prisons; and traveling exhibitions to rural communities all \n     across the country.\n       Thank you to the co-sponsors of this evening. To Americans \n     for the Arts my gratitude for your tireless and effective \n     advocacy on behalf of art and all that comes with that. You \n     truly make a difference and we're all the better for it. And \n     to the Film Foundation a recognition and respect for the \n     important work you do to inspire young artists through \n     education and for protecting and restoring some of the \n     greatest films of all time and thus enabling the diverse \n     perspective of it all to live on.\n       Lastly, it is an honor to pay tribute to the memory and the \n     contribution of Nancy Hanks whom I knew and remember fondly. \n     Nancy Hanks had a profoundly gifted perspective on cultural \n     policy in the United States, that being access to the arts. \n     Her legacy is the success of many of your programs; the \n     creative mastery of many of the artists here tonight; and the \n     commitment to freedom of expression that we collectively \n     embrace. The life she lived really meant something.\n       So we go forth here tonight to continue to try to enlighten \n     those who dismiss the arts as unnecessary, irrelevant or \n     dangerous. And we do so not only in the memory of Nancy \n     Hanks, but in the name of the active and deserving \n     imagination of every American child.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/03/senate-section/article/S12442-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             REMEMBERING THE HEROES OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Believing that an \n     invasion by the U.S. forces was imminent, the prisoners were \n     forced into three tunnel air raid shelters, thus following \n     orders from the Japanese High Command to dispose of prisoners \n     by any means available.

Those not \n     instantly killed by the explosions ran burning from the \n     tunnels and were machine gunned and bayoneted to death.\n\n  Only a few survived this horror.

Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to \ndiscuss my opposition to the voucher provision in the D.C. \nappropriations bill.\n  Our government promises every child in the United States a free and \nappropriate public education. The very idea that Federal funds that \nshould be going to our Nation's public schools to fulfill that promise \nwill instead be siphoned away to private schools is of great concern to \nme.\n  As a product of public schools, and the child of a public school \nteacher, I am a strong supporter of the public school system. I often \nsay that while we cannot be a Nation of equal outcomes, we can and must \nbe a Nation of equal opportunities. Our public schools are the key to \nequal opportunity for all American children.\n  Although the voucher program we are discussing today would only \nimpact the District of Columbia, it clearly would have national \nimplications. It is a calculated first step toward broader voucher \nprograms, which would drain resources from our public schools--the very \nschools that are free and open to all children, and accountable to \nparents and taxpayers.\n  Simply put, vouchers are not the answer to our educational ills--they \nare bad education policy driven by ideological goals.\n  Wouldn't our energy be better focused on strengthening our public \nschools, which can and do succeed with adequate resources? To succeed, \nschools need high-quality teachers, a rigorous curriculum, high \nexpectations, parental involvement, and effective management. All of \nthese require adequate resources.\n  In 2001, Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act, which was \nintended to reform public education by establishing high standards for \nevery student, providing Federal incentives to boost low-performing \nschools, and creating accountability.\n  Unlike vouchers, which even supporters acknowledge would reach only a \nsmall fraction of children, No Child Left Behind was intended to \nimplement proven, effective reforms in all schools not just for a few \nstudents, but for all students.\n  But the administration and this Congress are not living up to the \npromise of No Child Left Behind and are underfunding it by over $8 \nbillion. This leaves millions of children behind and places additional \nburdens on already burdened State and local education budgets.\n  And, on top of underfunding No Child Left Behind, we are now \nconsidering giving funds to schools that are not even subject to its \nprovisions.\n  As we know, No Child Left Behind would ensure oversight and \naccountability, including testing standards and teacher qualification \nstandards. But the voucher program we are considering today does not \nprovide the same system of accountability or oversight of these private \nschools, nor does it set the same criteria for the very people that \nwill be teaching our children.\n  In fact, this bill allows any private school to apply to participate \nin the program, but there is no evaluation process before they are \naccepted to participate. This leaves D.C. children vulnerable to poor-\nperforming schools.\n  I ask proponents of the bill: How can we ask our public schools to \nfulfill the significant mandates of No Child Left Behind, when we are \nrefusing those schools adequate funds and at the same time giving \nFederal money to schools that are not even required to abide by many of \nits mandates?\n  Proponents of the voucher program say that it provides parents with \n``choice'' that they do not currently have. This is simply not true. \nThe District of Columbia already offers three alternatives to \ntraditional public schools. First, D.C. has the largest number of \npublic charter schools per capita in the Nation. If we pass this \nvoucher program, these charter schools will remain underfunded. Yet we \nstill want to give private schools money.\n  Second, D.C. has established 15 public transformation schools that \nhave, for the first time ever, succeeded in raising the scores of low-\nincome children in low-performing schools. Again, however, the very \nprograms in these transformation schools that have succeeded are now \nseeing cuts in funding. Yet we still want to give private schools \nmoney.\n  Finally, D.C. allows parents who are not content with their \nneighborhood school to send their child to out-of-boundary schools that \nare accountable to public education standards. Yet we still want to \ngive private schools money.\n  If this is not school choice, then what is? Why can't we give these \ntypes of\n\n[[Page S12443]]\n\nschools a chance to succeed rather than undermining them and draining \nfunds from their already successful programs?\n  Proponents of vouchers also claim that the program in this bill is a \npilot program and should be given a chance. But Milwaukee and Cleveland \nboth tried to implement a voucher program, and a GAO study of the \nprograms in these two cities found no or little difference in voucher \nand public school students' performance.\n  Our cities have tried vouchers and have not succeeded. Our children \nshould not be guinea pigs for programs that have simply not been proven \neffective at raising academic achievement.\n  I am not the only one opposed to this program. My friend and \ncolleague in the House of Representatives, Eleanor Holmes Norton, along \nwith the majority of the D.C. City Council and School Board, also \noppose any voucher program. In addition, the residents of the District \nof Columbia are overwhelmingly opposed to private school vouchers.\n  Let's not turn D.C. into a laboratory for school vouchers. Vouchers \nare not the solution to improving educational opportunity in D.C. or \nanywhere else in America. Let's instead focus on fulfilling the promise \nof No Child Left Behind by fully funding it, and giving our public \nschools the resources they need to truly succeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/03/senate-section/article/S12443-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MOTHER TERESA: A BELOVED SAINT FOR OUR TIME\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on October 19, Mother Teresa of Calcutta \nwill be officially beatified in Rome. I say ``officially,'' because in \nthe eyes of so many people around the world, Catholic and non-Catholic \nalike, she is already recognized as an extraordinary saint. She is, \nwithout question, one of the most beloved individuals of our time.\n  Why is this? By all means, her accomplishments are well known and \nrespected. Mother Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity and \noversaw the organization's amazing growth. By the time of her death, \nthe order had grown to include more than 5,000 sisters, brothers, and \nvolunteers, operating some 500 centers around the world. Even here in \nWashington, DC, we witness Missionaries of Charity on the streets of \nthis city, tending to the homeless and feeding the hungry.\n  But there is another reason why this woman is so beloved. It is \nbecause we live in a world of such extraordinary material abundance, a \nworld that prizes youth and health. And yet here was a woman who \nwillingly and lovingly embraced poverty, and devoted her life to the \nold, the sick, and the dying. And more than that, she inspired \nthousands of people all across the world to join her in that mission.\n  I remember hearing about a journalist who visited one of Mother \nTeresa's hospices in Calcutta. He watched as one of the sisters bathed \nand dressed the terrible wounds of a leper who was near death. The \njournalist said to the sister, ``You know, I wouldn't do that for all \nthe money in the world.'' To which the sister answered, ``Neither would \nI.''\n  In 1979, when Mother Teresa accepted the Nobel Peace Prize, she said:\n\n       I chose the poverty of poor people. But I am grateful to \n     receive the Nobel Prize in the name of the hungry, the naked, \n     the homeless, the blind, the lepers, all the people who feel \n     unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout our society, people \n     that have become a burden to society and shunned by everyone.\n\n  That is just an amazing statement, an amazing testament. Mother \nTeresa was powerfully motivated by the words of Jesus in the Gospel of \nMatthew, ``As you did for the least of these your brethren, you did on \nto me.'' And just as Jesus inspired Mother Teresa, the soon-to-be Saint \nTeresa of Calcutta inspires all of us. She is a saint for all time, but \nshe speaks with special urgency to us today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/03/senate-section/article/S12443-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12443-S12444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL SPINA BIFIDA AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to remind my colleagues that \nOctober is National Spina Bifida Awareness Month and to pay tribute to \nthe more than 70,000 Americans and their family members who are \ncurrently affected by Spina Bifida--the Nation's most common, \npermanently disabling birth defect.\n  Spina bifida is a neural tube defect that occurs when the central \nnervous system does not properly close during the early stages of \npregnancy. Spina bifida affects more than 4,000 pregnancies each year, \nwith 1,500 babies born with spina bifida each year. There are three \ndifferent forms of spina bifida with the most severe being \nmyelomeningocele spina bifida, which causes nerve damage and severe \ndisabilities. This severe form of spina bifida is diagnosed in 96 \npercent of children born with this condition. Between 70 and 90 percent \nof the children born with spina bifida are at risk of mental \nretardation when spinal fluid collects around the brain.\n  The exact cause of spina bifida is not known, but researchers have \nconcluded that women of childbearing age who take daily folic acid \nsupplements reduce their chances of having a spina bifida pregnancy by \nup to 75 percent. Progress has been made convincing women of the \nimportance of consuming folic acid supplements and maintaining diets \nrich in folic acid. However, this public education campaign must be \nenhanced and broadened to reach segments of the population that have \nyet to heed this call.\n  Although folic acid consumption reduces the risk and incidence of \nspina bifida pregnancies, we will still have babies born with spina \nbifida who need intensive care and families that need guidance and \nsupport in caring for and raising these children. The result of this \nneural tube defect is that most babies suffer from a host of physical, \npsychological, and educational challenges, including paralysis, \ndevelopmental delay, numerous surgeries, and living with a shunt in \ntheir skulls in an attempt to ameliorate their condition. Today, \napproximately 90 percent of all babies diagnosed with this birth defect \nlive into adulthood, approximately 80 percent have normal IQs, and \napproximately 75 percent participate in sports and other recreational \nactivities. With proper medical care, people who suffer from spina \nbifida can lead full and productive lives. However, they must learn how \nto move around using braces, crutches or wheelchairs, and how to \nfunction independently. They also must be careful to avoid a host of \nsecondary health problems ranging from depression and learning \ndisabilities to skin problems and latex allergies.\n  After decades of poor prognosis and short life expectancy, \nbreakthroughs in research combined with improvements in health care and \ntreatment children with spina bifida are now living long enough to \nbecome adults with this condition. Yet, with this extended life \nexpectancy people with spina bifida now face new challenges in the \nfields of education, job training, independent living, health care for \nsecondary conditions, aging concerns, and other related issues.\n  I am grateful for my colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond who, along \nwith myself, sponsored the Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities \nPrevention Act of 2003, S. 286. This important legislation helps \nprevent spina bifida as well as meets the current and growing needs of \nindividuals with spina bifida live active, productive, and meaningful \nlives. Our legislation helps those with spina bifida and their families \nlearn how to treat and prevent secondary health problems which range \nfrom learning disabilities and depression to severe allergies, and \nrespiratory and skin problems that make life difficult and at times, \nfraught with danger that make life difficult for these patients by \nauthorizing the National Spina Bifida Program at the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, CDC. All of these problems can be \ntreated or prevented, but only if those with spina bifida are properly \neducated and taught what they need to do to keep themselves healthy. \nThe national program focuses and coordinates the agency's efforts to \neducate health care providers about the range of spina bifida issues--\nincluding the availability of in utero surgery--as well as help promote \nthe dissemination of information regarding how to prevent the myriad \ncomplications of the condition.\n  Last year, I chaired a hearing of the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pension's Subcommittee on Children and Families on birth \ndefects, in which Connecticut resident Fred Liguori's testimony \nprovided a parent's\n\n[[Page S12444]]\n\nvaluable perspective on spina bifida. After losing two pregnancies, the \nLiguori's were informed their unborn child had spina bifida. After \ncareful consideration and information from the SBAA, the Liguoris \nelected to proceed with in utero surgery that could reduce the effects \nof spina bifida. Since the late 1990s, doctors at four U.S. hospitals \nhave been operating before birth on babies diagnosed with spina bifida. \nBy closing the spinal lesion early in pregnancy, these doctors believe \nthey can minimize the damage created by fluid leaking from the spine, \nas well as by the spinal cord's contact with amniotic fluid. Surgeons \nhave found that closing the hole in the spine in this fashion before \nbirth may correct breathing problems in 15 percent of the children \nreceiving the procedure and may reduce the need for a shunt to drain \nbrain fluid build up by between 33 percent and 50 percent. While the in \nutero surgery was successful, their three-year-old son still requires \nextensive therapy and medical attention. Fred Liguori's testimony made \nit clear that a national spina bifida program is critically needed for \nthe prevention of this condition and to improve the quality of life for \nthose individuals and their families living with spina bifida. \nFortunately, in fiscal year 2003, Congress was wise to provide $2 \nmillion in funding to establish and support a national spina bifida \nprogram and is poised to provide a much-needed increase in funding for \nfiscal year 2004. The House provided a $500,000 increase while the \nSenate included a total of $3 million for the program for fiscal year \n2004. I strongly urge my colleagues to support the Senate allocation as \nthis level of funding is needed to ensure that the CDC has the \nresources necessary to support and expand its comprehensive efforts to \nprevent spina bifida, improve quality-of-life for those living with the \ncondition, and to deliver important public health messages to those \ncommunities most at-risk for a spina bifida pregnancy.\n  I want also to recognize the special work of the Spina Bifida \nAssociation of America, SBAA, an organization that has helped people \nwith spina bifida and their families for nearly 30 years, working every \nday--not just in the month of October--to prevent and reduce suffering \nfrom this devastating birth defect. The SBAA was founded in 1973 to \naddress the needs of the individuals and families affected by and is \ncurrently the only national organization solely dedicated to advocating \non behalf of the spina bifida community. As part of its service through \n60 chapters in more than 100 communities across the country, the SBAA \nputs expecting parents in touch with families who have a child with \nspina bifida. These families answer questions and concerns and help \nguide expecting parents. The SBAA then works to provide lifelong \nsupport and assistance for affected children and their families.\n  Together the SBAA and the Spina Bifida Association of Connecticut, \nSBAC, work tirelessly to help families meet the challenges and enjoy \nthe rewards of raising their child. I would like to acknowledge and \nthank SBAA and the SBAC for all that they have done for the families \naffected by this birth defect, especially those living in my State. I \nwould also like to commend the leadership of Hal Pote, President of the \nSpina Bifida Foundation--uncle of Greg Pote who lives with spina \nbifida, Alex Brodrick, President of the Spina Bifida Association of \nAmerica, father of Joel Brodrick who lives with spina bifida, and Cindy \nBrownstein who serves as Chief Executive Officer of the SBAA. The spina \nbifida community and our Nation owe a tremendous debt to the SBAA for \nits work over the past three decades.\n  As a Nation, we have accomplished a great deal in our battle against \nbirth defects. However, much more work remains to be done. I urge all \nof my colleagues and all Americans to endorse the important efforts to \nprevent spina bifida but also to support those already living with this \noften debilitating birth defect. Those living with spina bifida and \ntheir loved ones deserve our utmost support. It is my hope that by \nrecognizing National Spina Bifida Awareness Month we can move closer to \nthe laudable goal of eventually eliminating the suffering caused by \nthis terrible birth defect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/03/senate-section/article/S12444-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NICS IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I bring the National Instant Criminal \nBackground Check Improvement Act, formerly called the Our Lady of Peace \nAct, to the attention of my colleagues. On March 12, 2002, a priest and \na parishioner were killed at the Our Lady of Peace Church in Lynbrook, \nNY, by a man who was able to obtain a gun despite the fact that he had \na prior disqualifying mental health commitment and a restraining order \nthat should have prevented him from purchasing a gun. The man who \ncommitted this double murder passed a Brady background check because \nthe NICS database did not have the necessary information to determine \nthat he was ineligible to purchase a firearm.\n  The NICS Improvement Act would provide funding to fix the hole in the \ncurrent NICS background check system caused by the failure of many \nstates to computerize and update their criminal history records. While \nthe Brady check system currently provides fast responses to firearms \ndealers for over 90 percent of gun purchasers within a few minutes, \nresponses are occasionally delayed because information concerning state \nand local convictions is not up-to-date or available. This can result \nin delays for some who lawfully seek to purchase a gun and the failure \nto block gun sales to some unlawful purchasers. To fix this problem \nStates need adequate funding to input and update criminal history data. \nThis bill would provide $1 billion to help States do just that.\n  This is not a small problem. According to Americans for Gun Safety, \n25 States have automated less than 60 percent of their criminal \nconviction records. Twenty States do not automate domestic violence or \ntemporary restraining order records. This shortcoming in our public \nsafety system, according to AGS statistics, has allowed over 10,000 \nprohibited buyers to obtain a gun because the background check could \nnot be completed within the three business days as required by the law.\n  The NICS Improvement Act has been sponsored by Senators on both sides \nof the aisle, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/03/senate-section/article/S12444-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12444-S12445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ALTHEA GIBSON\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to mourn the loss \nof Althea Gibson, a sports legend in professional tennis and golf and a \npioneer for African-Americans in all walks of life. Ms. Gibson passed \naway in East Orange this past Sunday after suffering from respiratory \ncomplications.\n  Althea Gibson was born on a cotton farm in Silver, SC, in 1927 but \nspent most of her childhood in Harlem, NY. She eventually moved to New \nJersey.\n  At an early age, Althea Gibson showed great promise in sports. Her \nfavorite was basketball but she excelled at table tennis, too. Musician \nBuddy Walker noticed her ability and gave her a tennis racket as a gift \nwhen she was 14. The harsh reality of racial segregation left her \nunable to play tennis on public courts while growing up. Fortunately, \ntwo prominent African-American doctors had a private tennis court and \ngave Ms. Gibson the opportunity to play tennis there.\n  By the early 1940s, Ms. Gibson began her tennis career as an amateur, \nplaying in tournaments organized by the American Tennis Association, \nATA, a predominantly African-American organization.\n  In 1947, she won the first of 10 straight ATA National Championships. \nWithin a few years, Ms. Gibson was ready to compete outside of the ATA.\n  Her talent and record should have been sufficient for her to compete \nagainst white players in tournaments sanctioned by the United States \nLawn Tennis Association, USLTA. But it took the help of Alice Marble, a \nchampion tennis player herself, who wrote an article in American Lawn \nTennis magazine. Ms. Marble noted that Gibson wasn't invited to \nparticipate in the USLTA championships for any reason other than \n``bigotry.'' Ms. Marble wrote, ``I think it's time we face a few facts \n. . . If tennis is a game of ladies and gentlemen, it's time we acted \nin a gentle manner, not like sanctimonious hypocrites.''\n  Ms. Gibson finally received an invitation to play in the 1950 \nNational Tennis\n\n[[Page S12445]]\n\nChampionships and made her historic debut at Forest Hills against \nLouise Brough, who had just won her third consecutive Ladies' Singles \nChampionship at Wimbledon.\n  One year later, Ms. Gibson became the first African-American to \ncompete at Wimbledon.\n  Between 1956 and 1958, she dominated the world of tennis, becoming \nthe first African-American to win major tournaments, including the \nFrench Open singles and doubles, the Italian Open singles, Wimbledon \nsingles and doubles, and the U.S. Open singles.\n  She was selected as the Associated Press Athlete of the Year in 1957 \nand again in 1958, the first African-American woman to be so honored.\n  Despite her success and fame, she encountered pernicious segregation \nthroughout her career. Oftentimes when she competed at tournaments, \nshe couldn't stay at the hotels the white players used, or join them \nfor meals at restaurants. But her strength of character, her poise, and \nher determination carried her though such indignities. And she was \ngracious, too, writing in her autobiography, ``I Always Wanted To Be \nSomebody'': ``If I made it, it's half because I was game enough to take \na lot of punishment along the way and half because there were a lot of \npeople who cared for me.''\n\n  In 1958, Ms. Gibson retired from amateur tennis and began a short-\nlived career in professional basketball for the Harlem Globtrotters. \nShe also pursued a professional career in golf, becoming the first \nAfrican-American woman on the Ladies Professional Golf Association, \nLPGA, tour in 1962.\n  Over the years, Ms. Gibson received many awards and accolades. Some \nof her most esteemed awards were her induction into the National Lawn \nTennis Association Hall of Fame, the International Tennis Hall of Fame, \nthe Black Athletes Hall of Fame, and the International Sports Hall of \nFame.\n  Just a few weeks ago I was eulogizing another New Jerseyan who broke \nthe color barrier, my friend Larry Doby, who played baseball for the \nCleveland Indians. What Larry Doby and Jackie Robinson did for \nbaseball, what Jesse Owens did for track and field, Althea Gibson did \nfor tennis. She paved the way for Arthur Ashe, Zina Garrison, and Venus \nand Serena Williams.\n  Althea Gibson could have rested on her laurels. But her work wasn't \ndone when she retired from the world of professional sports. She was \nthe New Jersey State Commissioner of Athletics for 10 years (the first \nAfrican-American woman to hold the post) and served on both the New \nJersey State Athletics Control Board and the Governor's Council on \nPhysical Fitness.\n  The Althea Gibson Foundation, created in her honor and based in \nNewark, NJ, lives on, helping urban youth develop their tennis and golf \nskills and improve their lot in life.\n  It is clear that the life Ms. Gibson led has served as an inspiration \nfor African-Americans and all people. While I am saddened by her death, \nI am glad that she graced us with her presence. Ms. Gibson taught each \nof us that ``without struggle there can be no progress.'' She \nstruggled, she succeeded, and we are all better for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/03/senate-section/article/S12445-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. BARBARA LAZARUS\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay a special \ntribute to one of the true educational leaders of our time, Dr. Barbara \nLazarus, whose contribution to expanding educational access for women \nand people of color has been immeasurable. It is not often that a \nsingle individual envisions how the world can be more just, has the \ntalent to implement that vision, and conveys the passion that attracts \nothers to the cause. Dr. Lazarus embodied all of these attributes and \nmore, working tirelessly for inclusion and understanding.\n  Dr. Lazarus, an educational anthropologist, served as the associate \nprovost for academic affairs at Carnegie Mellon University until her \nuntimely death this past July. While at Carnegie Mellon, she became a \nnationally recognized leader in promoting women in science and \nengineering, and she won Carnegie Mellon's Doherty Prize, the \nuniversity's highest honor for educational contributions. Dr. Lazarus \ntouched the lives of hundreds of students and staff through her efforts \nto give women and minorities increased access to nontraditional \noccupations. Her commitment to promoting women and minorities in \nscience and engineering has had an important impact throughout American \nhigher education, as programs she created to overcome barriers have \nbeen replicated across the country.\n  Also concerned with reaching children, especially girls, she invented \n``Explanatoids,'' short lessons explaining the science behind everyday \nphenomena, from roller coasters to curve balls. This project, too, is \nbeing replicated at playgrounds and other institutions, including the \nSmithsonian's Air and Space Museum.\n  Prior to joining Carnegie Mellon, Dr. Lazarus was the director of the \nCenter for Women's Careers at Wellesley College where her \ngroundbreaking work focused on the role of professional women in a \nglobal, multicultural society. She became the codirector and the only \nnon-Asian member of the Asian Women's Institute Commission on Women and \nWork. In that capacity, she organized meetings in several Asian \ncountries that brought together women scholars, government leaders, and \nactivists to address the challenge of moving Asian women from \ntraditional to nontraditional roles, particularly in the workplace.\n  Throughout her career, Dr. Lazarus wrote books, articles, and gave \nhundreds of talks to share her ideas and inspire others in this work. \nShe will be missed by her family, as well as the hundreds of friends, \nfaculty, and students who were inspired by her counsel. And she will be \nmissed by all of us for her significant contributions addressing \nimportant issues of our time, and general improvement of our human \ncondition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/03/senate-section/article/S12445-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need \nfor hate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Lincoln, \nRI. On August 28, 2000, Jesse Ousley, a gay teenager, was severely \nbeaten by a police officer using antigay invectives. Ousley received a \nbloody nose, two black eyes, and numerous contusions, including marks \non his neck, allegedly from the police officer's attempt to strangle \nhim.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/03/senate-section/article/S12445-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12445-S12446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              IN RECOGNITION OF THE NAAMANS LITTLE LEAGUE\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Biden and \nmyself, I congratulate Coaches Joe Mascelli, Bob Waters and H.J. Lopes, \nand the Naamans Little League team. Their accomplishment of becoming \nthe first Delaware team to reach the Little League World Series \ndemonstrates the success that comes from hard work, perseverance, \ndedicated coaching, and the support of parents and fans.\n  The Little League World Series, held during the month of August in \nWilliamsport, PA, ended a dramatic, record-breaking season for the \nNaamans Little League team. The Delaware State champions and Mid-\nAtlantic regional champions final overall record through district, \nstate, regional, and world series play was 14-3. They finished their \nworld series experience at 1-2, with a win over Iowa and losses to \nArizona and Texas.\n  This year, the Mid-Atlantic Regional championship team consisted of \n12 players: Jarad Carney, Kevin Czachorowski, Scott Dougherty, Cory \nFirmani, Constantine Fournaris, Danny Frate, Michael Julian, Zack \nLopes, Tim Marcin, Dave Mastro, Vince Russomagno, and Kip Skibicki.\n  Coach Mascelli said his team gained a lot from this experience, both \non the field and off the field. One of the highlights was the \ntremendous outpouring\n\n[[Page S12446]]\n\nof fan support, not just from residents of Delaware, but also from \npeople around the nation and the world. They were flooded with letters \nand emails from states across the nation, including California, and \ncountries as far away as Germany. Coach Mascelli also said his players \nreceived an education beyond baseball. They all handled their celebrity \nstatus with the public and the media with a maturity well beyond their \nyears. The team's objective at the Little League World Series was to \nrepresent the state of Delaware with class and dignity. We are proud to \nsay that the Naamans team accomplished just that.\n  Today, we congratulate the Naamans Little League and coaches \nMascelli, Lopes, and Waters. They accomplished something that no other \nDelaware team has done, and they made each one of us proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/03/senate-section/article/S12446-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO HUGH GREGG\n\n Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, on Wednesday I introduced S. 1692, \nto designate the U.S. Post Office Building at 38 Spring Street in \nNashua, NH as the ``Hugh Gregg Post Office Building,'' and honor one of \nour State's most beloved and hardest working public servants.\n  On September 24, New Hampshire lost one of its great citizens, \nstatemen, and historians when Hugh Gregg passed away at the age of 85. \nHugh Gregg was an alderman and then mayor of his hometown of Nashua, \nleading the city through a time of economic transition by bringing \nprosperity back to the mill yards lining the Merrimack River in Nashua \nafter they had gone in silent in the 1940s. He was elected the youngest \nGovernor in New Hampshire history at the age of 34, then returned to \nthe private sector to pursue successful ventures as a lawyer and \nbusinessman. It was at this point that Hugh Gregg began to evolve into \none of the most important figures in New Hampshire history.\n  Hugh Gregg's love of New Hampshire and politics inspired his passion \nfor preserving, and often-times defending New Hampshire's first-in-the-\nnation Presidential primary. He was involved formally and informally \nwith many campaigns over the years, and was a virtual encyclopedia of \nknowledge regardingthe history of New Hampshire's unique role in \nelecting Presidents of the United States. In 1998 Hugh Gregg, who is \noften referred to as the Godfather of the New Hampshire primary, help \nfound the New Hampshire Political Library, which was and is the only \nnonpartisan, nonprofit institution in the State dedicated to politics \nand the primary.\n  Hugh Gregg held high the New Hampshire values of honesty, frankness \nand caring throughout a life of political, business, and community \nleadership. I was just one among his countless friends who turned to \nhim for his advice and perspective over the years, receiving sound \ncounsel often accompanied by a touch of dry wit. My thoughts and \nprayers go out to Hugh Gregg's wife, Cay, his son and our colleague in \nthe Senate, Judd Gregg, and the entire Gregg family. My family and I, \nand all of New Hampshire will miss Hugh Gregg very much.\n  Mr. President, naming the Post Office in Nashua for Hugh Gregg is an \nappropriate way to remember the life of one of New Hampshire's most \nenduring and endearing personalities. I ask that my colleagues in the \nHouse and Senate move quickly to pass this legislation in his \nhonor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/03/senate-section/article/S12446-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12446-S12447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MAJOR GENERAL ARNOLD L. PUNARO\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on October 14, 2003, at Marine \nBarracks 8th & I, Washington, D.C.--the oldest post in the U.S. Marine \nCorps--GEN James L. Jones, Supreme Allied Commander Europe and \nCommander, U.S. European Command and the former Commandant of the \nMarine Corps will officiate at a retirement ceremony for MG Arnold L. \nPunaro. GEN Punaro is completing 35 years of superlative commissioned \nservice in the United States Marine Corps and is someone I have worked \nwith both in and out of uniform for over 25 of these years. Contingent \non the Senate schedule, I intend to be present and join his many \nfriends in wishing him and his family fair winds and following seas.\n  Many here will recall Arnold's outstanding 24 year career in the U.S. \nSenate working for our former Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman, \nSenator Sam Nunn. He started as an intern in Senator Nunn's office in \n1973, and rose to become Staff Director of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. During that 24-year period he was involved in every major \nnational security decision and set a standard of excellence and \nleadership that few others achieve. While he came from Georgia, I am \nproud to say he has been a Virginia resident for 30 years and someone \nwith whom I worked closely during his years in the Senate.\n  Simultaneously, he was engaged in a highly successful career in the \nUnited States Marine Corps which he entered out of college in 1968. At \nthe peak of the draft, he was a volunteer into a tough outfit that I \nknow well. He was an infantry platoon commander in combat in Vietnam \nwhere he was wounded in battle and decorated for heroism.\n  Following active duty service, he went into the reserves in 1973. \nOver the next 30 years he would serve with distinction in both command \nand staff billets to include mobilization for Desert Shield/Desert \nStorm in 1990. He also was mobilized in 1993 to serve as the Commander \nof Joint Task Force Provide Promise, Forward, in command of all U.S. \ntroops serving in the former Yugoslavia and in Macedonia. His command \nwas part of a multi-national force and provided much needed stability \nin that region.\n  He was promoted to general officer in 1994, and served as Commanding \nGeneral of several major commands for 5 of his 9 years as a general. \nJust as he was the longest serving Staff Director of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, he had the longest tenure as Commanding General of \nthe 4th Marine Division--one of the legendary divisions of World War II \nIwo Jima fame. Today this division has over 20,500 Marines and Sailors \nlocated in 105 cities and 38 states. The vast majority fought in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom.

PUNARO\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on October 14, 2003, at Marine \nBarracks 8th & I, Washington, D.C.--the oldest post in the U.S. Marine \nCorps--GEN James L. Jones, Supreme Allied Commander Europe and \nCommander, U.S. European Command and the former Commandant of the \nMarine Corps will officiate at a retirement ceremony for MG Arnold L. \nPunaro. GEN Punaro is completing 35 years of superlative commissioned \nservice in the United States Marine Corps and is someone I have worked \nwith both in and out of uniform for over 25 of these years. Contingent \non the Senate schedule, I intend to be present and join his many \nfriends in wishing him and his family fair winds and following seas.\n  Many here will recall Arnold's outstanding 24 year career in the U.S. \nSenate working for our former Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman, \nSenator Sam Nunn. He started as an intern in Senator Nunn's office in \n1973, and rose to become Staff Director of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. During that 24-year period he was involved in every major \nnational security decision and set a standard of excellence and \nleadership that few others achieve. While he came from Georgia, I am \nproud to say he has been a Virginia resident for 30 years and someone \nwith whom I worked closely during his years in the Senate.\n  Simultaneously, he was engaged in a highly successful career in the \nUnited States Marine Corps which he entered out of college in 1968. At \nthe peak of the draft, he was a volunteer into a tough outfit that I \nknow well. He was an infantry platoon commander in combat in Vietnam \nwhere he was wounded in battle and decorated for heroism.\n  Following active duty service, he went into the reserves in 1973. \nOver the next 30 years he would serve with distinction in both command \nand staff billets to include mobilization for Desert Shield/Desert \nStorm in 1990. He also was mobilized in 1993 to serve as the Commander \nof Joint Task Force Provide Promise, Forward, in command of all U.S. \ntroops serving in the former Yugoslavia and in Macedonia. His command \nwas part of a multi-national force and provided much needed stability \nin that region.\n  He was promoted to general officer in 1994, and served as Commanding \nGeneral of several major commands for 5 of his 9 years as a general. \nJust as he was the longest serving Staff Director of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, he had the longest tenure as Commanding General of \nthe 4th Marine Division--one of the legendary divisions of World War II \nIwo Jima fame. Today this division has over 20,500 Marines and Sailors \nlocated in 105 cities and 38 states. The vast majority fought in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. Under his leadership, the 4th Division's \nwarfighting readiness was significantly improved as was demonstrated in \nIraq and, upon his departure, he turned over an organization that had \nachieved the highest readiness ratings that DoD provides.\n  That does not surprise any of us who worked closely with him over the \nyears because he was known as someone who always had a vision and knew \nhow to get things done--both strategically and tactically. He was \ndirect, forceful, and always focused on reaching the goal.\n  He was most recently mobilized--for the third time in his reserve \ncareer--for Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom as \nboth the U.S. Marine Corps Director of Reserve Affairs and a Special \nAssistant to the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe.

Mr. President, in recent months I have risen on \nseveral occasions to pay tribute to the men and women who are fighting \nin Iraq and elsewhere in the global war on international terror. Today \nI rise once again to pay tribute and to honor a young man who was \nrecently killed in action in Iraq--Dustin K. McGaugh. Dusty was killed \nTuesday near Balad, Iraq. He was 20 years old.\n  Dusty grew up in Springdale, AR, and graduated from high school in \nTulsa, OK. After graduation, he joined the Army ROTC. His father, James \nMcGaugh, told one newspaper in Arkansas that Dusty joined the Army \nbecause he was looking for direction in life and because he ``wanted to \nserve and be part of something important.'' Dusty enlisted shortly \nbefore September 11, 2001--in fact, when the terrorist attacks occurred \non that horrible day, he was undergoing basic training in boot camp. \nOne newspaper account quotes a close friend who told of Dusty being so \ndedicated to his Army service that he finished his last three weeks of \nbasic training after breaking his shin bone in a fall. Dusty decided \nnot to report his injury, so that he might graduate from basic training \non time with his colleagues. He graduated with special honors. In April \nof this year, Dusty's unit--the U.S. Army 17th Field Artillery \nBrigade--was deployed to the Middle East. He accepted his mission with \npride and served with honor.\n  Dusty is survived by his father James of Springdale; his brother, \nJames McGaugh, of Claremore, OK; his mother, Marina Hayes, of Tulsa; \nhis stepmother, Katrina McGaugh, of Springdale; and a twin sister, \nWindy McGaugh, of Derby, KS. I ask my colleagues to join me in \nextending our deepest condolences to Dusty's family and friends.\n  When he learned that he would be going to Iraq, Dusty reportedly told \none friend, ``I believe in this. I want to serve our country.'' His \nresolve and his commitment to his country will not be forgotten. The \nmission continues in Iraq, and we remain confident that Dusty McGaugh's \ncourage and sacrifice will have been given in a worthy cause.\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor SSG Daryl \nDevries of Armour, SD. Staff Sergeant Devries was recently awarded the \nPurple Heart for injuries suffered while serving in Iraq.\n  Daryl was injured when a rocket-propelled grenade struck the Humvee \nhe was riding in while on security patrol in northern Iraq. Daryl, who \nis a member of the 200th Engineer Company, was sent to Iraq in April to \nhelp assemble and secure a bridge across the Tigris River.\n  The Purple Heart was established by General George Washington at \nNewburgh, NY, on August 7, 1782, during the Revolutionary War. The \nPurple Heart, which is awarded to a member of the Armed Forces who is \nwounded or killed in an armed conflict, is unique in that an individual \nis not recommended for the decoration; rather they are entitled to it. \nDaryl joins a heroic and honorable group of soldiers who have \nsacrificed their own wellbeing in service to our country.\n  Let me also express my admiration for the South Dakota National \nGuard. With 750 members of the National Guard serving in Iraq, South \nDakota has one of the highest rates of mobilization in the Nation. This \nhigh rate of service is a reflection of the hard work and pride South \nDakota National Guard members maintain. These brave and accomplished \nservicemen and women regularly win national awards and rank at or near \nthe top in National Guard performance tests and competitions. They \nrepresent South Dakota principles with remarkable distinction.\n  I know Staff Sergeant Devries is a valued member of the South Dakota \nNational Guard. As the father of a soldier who has recently returned \nfrom active duty service in Iraq, I am especially appreciative of his \nskilled and courageous actions. This prestigious award is a reflection \nof his military professionalism and extraordinary bravery.\n  Mr. President, I join with all South Dakotans in expressing my \ngratitude to Staff Sergeant Devries. We are all proud and thankful for \nall that he has done and continues to do in the service of the United \nStates of America.\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor SP Tyler \nCampbell of Lemmon, SD. Specialist Campbell was recently awarded the \nPurple Heart for injuries suffered while on patrol in northern Iraq in \nJuly.\n  Tyler, who is a member of the 854th Quartermaster Company, was sent \nto Iraq in April to help assemble and secure a 300-meter bridge across \nthe Tigris River.\n  The Purple Heart, which was established by General George Washington \nat Newburgh, NY on August 7, 1782, during the Revolutionary War, is \nawarded to a member of the Armed Forces who is wounded or killed in an \narmed conflict. Tyler richly deserves this prestigious award, and joins \na honorable group of soldiers who have admirably sacrificed their own \nsafety while serving our country.\n  Let me express my admiration for the South Dakota National Guard. \nWith 750 members of the National Guard serving in Iraq, South Dakota \nhas one of the highest rates of mobilization in the Nation. This high \nrate of service is a reflection of the hard work and pride South Dakota \nNational Guard members maintain.

A bill to increase the expertise and capacity of community-\nbased organizations involved in economic development activities and key \ndevelopment programs; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Community \nEconomic Development Expertise Enhancement Act of 2003.\n  This regulation would provide funding for nonprofit, community-based \neconomic development organizations and for the establishment of \npartnerships between these organizations. Most importantly, the \nlegislation would authorize grants to promote the use of mentors to \nimprove the operational capabilities of community-based organizations \nin the areas of project development, personnel management, legal \nservices, and financial management. These and other eligible uses of \nthe funding would increase the capacity of these organizations to \nexpand community development activities throughout the country.\n  Over the past several decades, our Nation has seen the emergence of \ncommunity-based organizations that have helped break the cycle of \npoverty for millions of families. Today, according to the National \nCongress of Community Economic Development, there are more than 3,600 \nof these organizations, many of which serve some of our Nation's most \neconomically challenged communities. These include both urban and rural \nareas, as well as suburban regions.\n  Typically, community development corporations have annual budgets \nranging from $200,000 to $500,000 and staffs averaging about six \nmembers. Their lack of personnel, expertise and financing often creates \nreal constraints on their ability to make even greater contributions to \ntheir community.\n  This legislation would expand our investment in these organizations, \nand expand their capacity to build homes, create jobs, improve public \nsafety, provide critical social services, increase access to capital, \nand turn around communities now filled with despair. The bill would \nserve a wide range of communities with different economic, geographic, \nand social characteristics.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the bill, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1711\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n        This Act may be cited as the ``Community Economic \n     Development Expertise Enhancement Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) there are a multitude of community economic development \n     programs administered by the Federal Government that assist \n     many of the most economically distressed areas in the United \n     States in--\n       (A) revitalizing physical and economic structures; and\n       (B) providing support to small- and medium-sized businesses \n     to encourage and assist the businesses in generating long-\n     term jobs and economic opportunity;\n       (2) there are many nonprofit, nongovernmental, community-\n     based economic development organizations, including faith-\n     based organizations, that have successfully operated \n     community economic development programs that create jobs, \n     build homes, and revitalize local markets;\n\n[[Page S12450]]\n\n       (3) Federal community economic development programs in \n     effect as of the date of enactment of this Act are intended \n     to leverage private sector investment as part of an overall \n     community development effort;\n       (4) Federal community economic development programs connect \n     residents of distressed neighborhoods to jobs and \n     opportunities of the regional marketplace, replacing economic \n     distress with opportunity;\n       (5) Federal community economic development programs--\n       (A) provide financial assistance, including tax credits and \n     loan guarantees;\n       (B) involve private investment institutions and \n     universities; and\n       (C) provide technical expertise for small businesses;\n       (6) Federal community economic development programs in \n     effect as of the date of enactment of this Act build on \n     ongoing efforts to encourage economic growth in distressed \n     communities by--\n       (A) helping to create new affordable housing opportunities;\n       (B) allowing communities to address important public \n     safety, access to capital, infrastructure, and environmental \n     concerns; and\n       (C) providing social services, including affordable health \n     care, transportation, child care, and youth development;\n       (7) the continuing success of Federal community economic \n     development programs will depend in great measure on the \n     ability of community-based organizations and private sector \n     institutions to form partnerships that connect residents of \n     distressed neighborhoods to jobs and other opportunities;\n       (8) the Federal Government administers various programs \n     that employ the services and capabilities of community-based \n     organizations to deliver a wide range of services to \n     residents of distressed communities;\n       (9) Federal community economic development programs help \n     achieve lasting improvement and enhance domestic prosperity \n     by the establishment of stable and diversified local \n     economies, sustainable development, and improved local \n     conditions;\n       (10) there is a need for greater cooperation between the \n     Federal Government, States, and other entities to ensure \n     that, consistent with national community economic development \n     objectives, Federal programs are compatible with, and further \n     the objectives of, State, regional, and local economic \n     development plans and comprehensive economic development \n     strategies;\n       (11) while economic development is an inherently local \n     process, the Federal Government should work in closer \n     partnership with community-based economic development \n     organizations to ensure that--\n       (A) resources are fully utilized; and\n       (B) all people in the United States have an opportunity to \n     participate in the economic growth of the United States; and\n       (12) extending technical assistance to community-based \n     economic development organizations may be necessary or \n     desirable--\n       (A) to alleviate economic distress;\n       (B) to encourage and support public-private partnerships \n     for the formation and improvement of economic development \n     strategies that promote the growth of the national economy;\n       (C) to stimulate modernization and technological advances \n     in the generation and commercialization of goods and \n     services; and\n       (D) to enhance the effectiveness of United States companies \n     in the global economy.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide a new source of Federal funding to enhance \n     the capabilities of nonprofit, nongovernmental, community-\n     based economic development organizations, or collaborations \n     of those organizations, to leverage private sector investment \n     as part of an overall community development strategy;\n       (2) to establish educational programs for nonprofit, \n     nongovernmental, community-based organizations to expand the \n     project development capabilities of those organizations;\n       (3) to increase the use of tax incentives to leverage \n     private sector investment in community economic development \n     projects;\n       (4) to promote and facilitate investments in community-\n     based economic development projects from traditional and \n     nontraditional capital sources;\n       (5) to encourage partnerships between community-based \n     organizations that will expand and enhance the expertise of \n     emerging nonprofit, nongovernmental organizations in using \n     private sector investment as part of the comprehensive \n     community development strategies of the organizations; and\n       (6) to ensure that viable community economic development \n     projects are successfully pursued throughout the United \n     States in communities having a wide range of economic, \n     geographic, and social characteristics.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to re-establish and reform the independent counsel \nstatute; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be joining today \nwith Senator Levin in introducing the Independent Counsel Reform Act of \n2003. With this bill, we hope to convince our colleagues that an \nimproved independent counsel statute can serve an essential purpose. We \nwant to convince our colleagues that our legislation will preserve the \nideals that motivated the enactment of this statute in the years after \nWatergate, that no person is above the law, and that our highest \ngovernment officials must be subject to our laws in the same way as any \nother person. If they are guilty, they must be held accountable. If \nthey are not, they must be cleared. In these cases the American people \nare more likely to trust the findings of an independent counsel's \ninvestigation and conclusions. Officials who are wrongly accused will \nreceive vindication that is far more credible to the public than when \nit comes from the Department of Justice. As a result, the public's \nconfidence in its government is enhanced by the independent counsel \nstatute.\n  In 1999, as the independent counsel law was expiring, I joined with \nSenators Levin, Specter, and Collins in introducing the Independent \nCounsel Reform Act of 1999. That year, we drafted new provisions to \ncurb the excesses we had seen in some of the investigations conducted \nunder the prior incarnation of the law. The revisions ensure that there \nwill be fewer Independent Counsel appointed, and that their actions \nwill in many respects be constrained by the same sorts of guidelines \nand practical restraints that govern regular federal prosecutors. The \nbill we are introducing today retains these suggested reforms. In fact, \nit is virtually identical to the Independent Counsel Reform Act of \n1999, with a single exception I will describe in a moment.\n  We made those substantial changes after the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs had held five hearings on the Independent Counsel statute. \nDuring the hearings we heard from numerous witnesses who had served as \nIndependent Counsel, and as Attorney General, from former prosecutors \nand from defense attorneys. Many witnesses supported the statute, even \ndefense attorneys who had represented targets in Independent Counsel \ninvestigations. Both witnesses who opposed the statute outright, and \nthose who advocated keeping it in some form, suggested a number of \nimprovements to the statute. We carefully considered those \nrecommendations before we sat down to draft a bill that retained the \nessential features of the old law while reducing its scope, limiting \nthe powers of the Independent Counsel, and bringing greater \ntransparency into the process.\n\n  For example, the threshold for seeking the appointment of an \nIndependent Counsel will be raised, so that a greater amount of \nevidence to back up allegations of criminal conduct will be required. \nThe attorney General will also be entitled for the first time to issue \nsubpoenas for evidence and convene grand juries during the preliminary \ninvestigation, and would be given more time to conduct preliminary \ninvestigations. This change responds to concerns that, in the past, the \nAttorney General's hands have been tied during the preliminary \ninvestigation stage. With our bill, the Department of Justice will be \nable to conduct a more substantial preliminary investigation.\n  In another change that will reduce the number of Independent Counsel \nappointed, officials covered by the statute will be limited to the \nPresident, the Vice President, the President's Chief of Staff, and \nCabinet members. This is a major reduction compared to the number of \nofficials covered by the Independent Counsel statute when it expired. \nThe Attorney General will retain the discretionary authority to appoint \nan Independent Counsel to investigate non-covered individuals when the \nAttorney General determines that investigation or prosecution by the \nDepartment of Justice would result in a personal, financial or \npolitical conflict of interest. This discretionary authority was part \nof the Independent Counsel law from 1983 to 1999; although the \nprovision was not included in the bill we introduced that year, it has \nbeen included in this bill because of the promulgation, after our bill \nwas introduced, of new regulations by the Department of Justice.\n  In many administrations, high level political advisers can have \nenormous influence, much more even than some Cabinet members. When we \nfirst introduced the Independent Counsel Reform Act of 1999, I hoped \nthat criminal allegations against officials not covered by the statute \ncould be handled either by the Department of Justice, or, in cases \ninvolving high-level officials or other conflicts of interest, through \nthe appointment by the Attorney General of a Special Counsel. After our \nbill was introduced, however, then Attorney General Reno issued revised \nregulations for the appointment of Special Counsel, which provide that \nthe Attorney General may block any investigative or prosecutorial \naction being pursued by the Special Counsel. The regulations also allow \nthe Attorney General to shut down the investigation entirely, or starve \nit of funds. These revisions, and others, constituted a major reduction \nin a Special Counsel's autonomy. As Robert Fiske had testified during \nour committee hearings in 1999, he accepted his 1994 appointment to be \nthe Whitewater Special Counsel only after satisfying himself that the \nregulations then in effect granted him the same powers as would have \nbeen available to an Independent Counsel. Now, with the variety of \ncontrol mechanisms in place under the Department's 1999 regulations, it \nis far too easy for an Attorney General to stifle an investigation in \nways less dramatic and less public than actually removing the Special \nCounsel.\n\n  Under the legislation we are introducing today, each Independent \nCounsel will have to devote his full time to the position for the \nduration of his tenure. This will prevent the appearance of conflicts \nthat may arise when an Independent Counsel continues with his private \nlegal practice, and it will expedite investigations as well. The \nIndependent Counsel will also be expected to conform his conduct to the \nwritten guidelines and established policies of the Department of \nJustice. The prior version of that requirement contained a loophole, \nwhich has been eliminated.\n  There have been many complaints about runaway prosecutors, who \ncontinued their investigations longer than was necessary or \nappropriate. Our bill will impose a time limit of two years on \ninvestigations by Independent Counsel. The Special Division of the \nCourt of Appeals will be able to grant extensions of time, however, for \ngood cause and to compensate for dilatory tactics by opposing counsel. \nImposing a time limit with flexibility allows Independent Counsel the \ntime they genuinely need to complete their investigations, and deters \ndefense counsel from using the time limit strategically to escape \njustice. But the time limit will also encourage future Independent \nCounsel to bring their investigations to an expeditious conclusion, and \nnot chase down every imaginable lead.\n  Our bill makes another important change that will prevent expansion \nof investigations into unrelated areas. Until now the statute has \nallowed the Attorney General to request an expansion of an Independent \nCounsel's prosecutorial jurisdiction into unrelated areas. This \nhappened several times with Judge Starr's investigation, and I believe \nthose expansions contributed to a perception that the prosecutor was \npursuing the person and not the crime. An Independent Counsel must not \nexist to pursue every possible lead against his target until he finds \nsome taint of criminality. His function, our bill makes clear, is to \ninvestigate that subject matter given him in his original grant of \nprosecutorial jurisdiction.\n  We are bringing greater budgetary transparency to the process by \ndirecting the Independent Counsel to produce an estimated budget for \neach year, and by allowing the General Accounting Office to comment on \nthat budget. This greater transparency will provide more incentive for \nCounsel to budget responsibly.\n  Another correction we are making is to eliminate entirely the \nrequirement that an Independent Counsel refer evidence of impeachable \noffenses to the House of Representatives. The impeachment power is one \nof Congress's essential Constitutional functions, and\n\n[[Page S12453]]\n\nno part of that role should be delegated by statute to a prosecutor.\n\n  Our bill was unsuccessful in the 106th Congress. Perhaps one of the \nreasons was that we were still too close to one or two controversial \ninvestigations that turned some against the statute; perhaps the wounds \nwere still too raw. Now with a fresh perspective gained through the \npassage of time, Congress should reconsider what it has given up by \nallowing the Independent Counsel law to lapse for the past four years. \nHopefully, occasions will be few and far between when serious and \ncredible criminal allegations emerge against high-level officials. When \nthis happens, however, the public will question how we can be certain \nthat the incident is being appropriately investigated. Indeed, in the \nabsence of an Independent Counsel law, some may even question whether \nallegations are as likely to surface in the first place. If people with \nknowledge of criminal wrongdoing suspect that their information may be \ncovered up rather than acted upon, they would be less likely to take \nthe risk of coming forward.\n  The controversy that has enveloped the White House in the past week \nillustrates the need for an Independent Counsel law. According to news \nreports, two high-level Administration figures, which some reports have \nplaced in the White House, willfully disclosed the name of a covert CIA \noperative. If true, this disclosure would be a serious criminal law \nviolation, one that may well have endangered not just the covert \noperative, but the people abroad who worked with her in service to the \nUnited States. The disclosures were reportedly made to punish the \nagent's husband, Ambassador Joseph Wilson, for questioning the accuracy \nof comments made by the President about Iraq's nuclear weapons program. \nThe Department of Justice recently initiated an investigation, but \naccording to a recent poll the public overwhelmingly prefers that the \ninvestigation not be handled by the Department. Although we do not yet \nknow which individuals may be implicated as a result of a thorough \ninvestigation, many Americans question whether Attorney General \nAshcroft can preside impartially over a probe that could prove very \ndamaging to his close associates in the White House, and to the \nPresident. An Independent Counsel statute is absolutely essential so \nthat we have an institutionalized means for addressing allegations such \nas these. We should not, as we are now, forced into an ad hoc and \nsituationally driven discussion of whether the Department of Justice \ncan investigate a particular case.\n  I have always believed that the Independent Counsel statute embodies \ncertain principles fundamental to our democracy. The alternative to an \nIndependent Counsel statute is a system in which the Attorney General \nmust decide how to handle substantive allegations against colleagues in \nthe Cabinet, or against the President. Often the President and the \nAttorney General are long-time friends and political allies. The \nAttorney General will not be trusted by some to ensure that an unbiased \ninvestigation will be conducted. In other cases, many will question the \nthoroughness of an investigation directed from inside the Department. \nIn a time of great public cynicism about government, the Independent \nCounsel statute guarantees that even the President and his highest \nofficials will have to answer for their criminal malfeasance. In that \nsense, this statute upholds the rule of law and will help stem the \ndistrust toward government. The Independent Counsel statute embodies \nthe bedrock American principle that no person is above the law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Independent Counsel \nReform Act of 2003 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1712\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amemd title IV of the Small Business Investment \nAct of 1958, relating to pilot program for credit enhancement \nguarantees on pools of non-SBA loans; to the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small \nBusiness Credit Liquidity Act of 2003, and I am pleased to be joined by \nmy colleagues, Senator Pryor and Senator Bond, as sponsors of this \nbill.\n  The genesis of this legislation was a proposal made by the Small \nBusiness Administration. When the President's Fiscal Year 2004 budget \nrequest was transmitted to the Congress this past February, it stated \nthat the SBA was exploring a possible new approach to expand the \nopportunities of small businesses to access capital markets by \nfacilitating the securitization of non-SBA small business loans, i.e., \nloans that were not already guaranteed by the SBA. Increasing access to \ncapital is a high priority of small businesses, and has been one of the \nCommittee's priorities throughout its history. We are always seeking \ninnovative ways to increase access to capital for small businesses, \nwhile at the same time measuring the cost and risk of loss that the \nFederal government must incur to facilitate such financing. \nAccordingly, we recognized the potential benefits of this proposal for \nsmall businesses across the Nation.\n  At our roundtable on April 30, 2003, the Committee discussed the idea \nof the securitization of non-SBA small business loans. The SBA reported \nthat it had been exploring this type of program for some time and \nthought the idea had considerable merit. The agency was uncertain, \nhowever, whether it had the statutory authority to develop and \nimplement such a program, absent legislative authorization. After the \nroundtable, we consulted with the SBA and with participants in the \nsmall business financing industry to determine the program's \nappropriate elements.\n  In addition to the support the SBA expressed for the proposal in its \nbudget request, at the Committee's roundtable, and in subsequent \ndiscussions with Committee staff, the SBA took other steps to help make \nthe proposal a success. For example, the agency entered into a contract \nwith Dun & Bradstreet and with Fair, Isaacs, Co., to create a credit \nscoring model for small businesses, similar to individual consumer \ncredit scores, to help small businesses gauge their credit quality. The \nscoring model will be an important asset to the pooling proposal by \nproviding uniformity of pricing, thus reducing one obstacle to the \nsecuritization of non-SBA small business loans. The Office of Advocacy \nof the SBA has also helped build support for the proposal by \npublicizing the need to take the foundational steps to build a \nsecondary market for small business loans, rather than later trying to \ncreate such a market in one step when economic pressures called for an \nimmediate response.\n  Support for a program to securitize small business loans has also \nbeen advocated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \nIn its September 2002 Report to the Congress on the Availability of \nCredit to Small Businesses, the Federal Reserve stated that the \nsecuritization of small business loans could ``substantially influence \nthe availability of credit'' to small businesses. The Federal Reserve \nnoted that one primary benefit of a secondary market would be that \nsmall business borrowers could enjoy lower financing costs.\n  In addition to the Federal Reserve report, other studies have shown \nthat small businesses could benefit from an efficient secondary market \nfor small business loans. Several, including the Federal Reserve \nreport, have noted that a primary obstacle to a wide-spread secondary \nmarket for small business loans has been the lack of standardized \ninformation to evaluate and price small business loans efficiently for \nresale. As noted, the SBA has exercised foresight by securing the \ncontract with Dun & Bradstreet and Fair, Isaacs to address this \nproblem. With the information provided by this new credit-scoring \nmodel, the securitization of non-SBA small business loans will be far \nmore feasible.\n  With input from the SBA, small businesses, and financial firms in \nhand, and having considered many studies regarding small business \ncredit and the effectiveness of secondary markets, we included a \nprovision similar to this Act in S. 1375, the Small Business \nAdministration 50th Anniversary Reauthorization Act of 2003, which was \napproved unanimously by the Committee on July 10, 2003.\n  Working with Senator Pryor and with other colleagues, we endeavored \nto provide sufficient specificity in the instructions the legislation \ngives the SBA regarding the pilot program, so as to ensure that the \npooling proposal provides the greatest benefit to small businesses in \nneed of capital while limiting risk to the Federal government.\n\n[[Page S12459]]\n\n  Unfortunately, despite all the hard work and input from the SBA and \nfrom other participants in the small business financing industry, some \napparently either failed to recognize or understand the benefits for \nsmall businesses that exist in this idea that originated with the SBA. \nIn the interest of expediting the passage of S. 1375 before the SBA's \nauthorizing legislation expired, I reluctantly removed that provision \nfrom S. 1375 to focus on those elements of the bill that had to be \nenacted before the legislation expired. I continue to appreciate the \nbenefits of this proposal, and I am now introducing this provision as a \nseparate bill. With the support this proposal already has, I am \nconfident we can implement this innovative program, and I look forward \nto the benefits it can provide as we try to assist small businesses to \nprosper, create more jobs, and pull the economy out of its current \ndoldrums.\n  The Small Business Credit Liquidity Act of 2003 authorizes the Small \nBusiness Administration (SBA) to develop and implement an innovative \nthree-year pilot program to facilitate the securitization of small \nbusiness loans in order to increase the liquidity of capital available \nto small businesses. Under the pilot program, the SBA could provide \npartial guarantees on pools of securitized small business loans that \nare not otherwise guaranteed by the SBA. The legislation seeks to \nincrease capital available to small businesses, without creating \nadditional risk for the government since the SBA's guarantees would be \npaid for by fees charged to the financial firms administering the \npooling of loans, and thus no appropriations will be necessary.\n  I believe this pilot program has a great potential to provide \nincreased access to capital on terms that are beneficial to small \nbusinesses. The pilot program will also allow lenders, including small \nlenders such as community banks, to utilize their capital better, and \nmake more loans available to small businesses on better terms, by \nincreasing the liquidity of existing loans.\n  The pooling structure is based on similar arrangements for home \nmortgages, credit card loans, and car loans, which have active \nsecondary markets based upon their pooling and securitization. The \nincreased liquidity of loans provided by a secondary market allows \nlenders to be confident that the loans they make can be sold to \ninvestors, so that the lenders can utilize again capital that is \notherwise locked into existing loans. In addition, because lenders \nreceive a quick ``turnaround'' on the loans that they make and then \nsell to investors, the profit that the lenders receive from the \ninterest rates charged to borrowers becomes less important for the \nlenders, who can receive a smaller per-loan profit, but increase the \nnumber of loans they make, and thereby receive a greater profit. \nLenders are thus able to make more loans and to provide better terms to \nborrowers on those loans.\n  As Chair of the Committee on Small Business, I realize that access to \ncredit for small businesses is often a challenge. The Committee has \nconsistently found that encouraging more lending to small businesses \nthat have a likelihood to succeed, grow, and create new jobs is a sound \nnational policy. The pilot program takes advantage of the successful \nexample of the prior securitizations of SBA small business loans, and \nof changes in the investment community, to facilitate lending in the \nsmall business community for years to come.\n  This pilot program is not a departure from the SBA's current practice \nof guaranteeing loans and regulating the securitization of those loans. \nThe SBA already regulates the securitization of both guaranteed \nportions of 7(a) and 504 loans to small businesses and non-guaranteed \nportions of the same loans. These loans are made both by Federally-\nregulated lenders and by lenders that are not federally regulated. In \nFiscal Year 2002, the SBA regulated the securitization of $3.4 billion \nin government-guaranteed 7(a) loans to small businesses. When the \nguaranteed portions of the 7(a) loans are securitized separately from \nthe non-guaranteed portions, the SBA is guaranteeing 100 percent of the \nloan pools.\n  This bill authorizes a pilot program with a much more modest SBA \ninvolvement than is represented by the SBA's current financing \nprograms. Under the pilot program, financial firms approved by the SBA \nwould pool loans not individually guaranteed by the SBA. These pooling \nentities would then issue securities offering returns based upon the \nreturns from the loans in the pool. The securities would be rated by a \nrating agency and sold to investors.\n  The pooling entities, also known as ``loan poolers,'' would also \noffer a partial ``first-loss'' guarantee to investors on the \nsecurities' returns. If the loans had insufficient returns to pay the \nexpected returns on the securities, the pooling entities' guarantees \nwould be the first guarantees called into performance to pay investors. \nThe SBA would issue partial, not complete, ``second-loss'' guarantees \non the return from the securities, but not on individual loans within \nthe pool. The agency's guarantees would thus be available only after \nthe first-loss guarantees offered by the loan poolers are exhausted.\n  Significantly, the cost of the SBA guarantees will be fully funded by \nfees paid by the loan poolers, so no Federal appropriations will be \nnecessary. The bill provides that the SBA will adjust the fees required \nfrom the poolers under the pilot program annually, as necessary.\n  The legislation also includes other provisions to ensure that the \npilot program will not lead to increased risk or liability for the \ngovernment. In particular, it caps the SBA's guarantees on any loan \npool at a maximum of 25 percent of the value of the securities issued \nfor that loan pool. In contrast, the SBA's guarantees for the 7(a) and \n504 loan programs are as high as 90 percent and 40 percent, \nrespectively, of each loan in those programs. Moreover, in the 504 loan \nprogram the SBA is in a first-loss position, sustaining the loss of its \nfull guaranteed amount on a defaulted loan before the private lender \nincurs any loss, whereas in the pilot program the SBA will be in a \nsecond-loss position.\n  In addition, the bill requires that firms licensed as loan poolers \nadhere to certain standards, such as being well-capitalized and \nmaintaining sufficient reserves. The bill also provides that the SBA \nwill set standards for the licensed poolers and will review these \nentities annually to verify that they are conforming with SBA \nrequirements. Among the requirements the SBA would establish for such \nloan poolers would be standards relating to loan delinquency, default, \nliquidation, and loss rates. If any licensed loan pooler fails to meet \nthe SBA's standards, the SBA may terminate the pooler's participation \nin the pilot program.\n  To ensure that the pilot program is initially implemented on a \nmanageable scale, the legislation specifies that no individual loan \npool created by a licensed pooler will exceed $350 million in loans in \nfiscal year 2004, $400 million in loans in fiscal year 2005, or $450 \nmillion in loans in fiscal year 2006. The bill also specifies that the \nSBA's total guarantees under the pilot program will not exceed $2.1 \nbillion for fiscal year 2004, $3.25 billion for fiscal year 2005, or \n$4.5 billion for fiscal year 2006.\n  Finally, this legislation requires three separate types of reports to \nensure that the pilot program is properly monitored and evaluated. \nFirst, the SBA must provide to the Senate and House Committees on Small \nBusiness a report detailing the pooling program before it is \nimplemented, and wait 50 days after submitting the report before \nimplementing the program. In addition, the SBA must file with the \nCongress, in the SBA's Budget Request and Performance Plan, an annual \nreport about the program's performance. To strengthen the on-going \noversight of the pilot program, the bill also specifies that the SBA's \nannual report to Congress will include information about the pooled \nloans, including delinquency, default, loss, and recovery rates. Third, \nthe GAO is required to study the program once implemented, and report \non the program's performance, including any effects the program may \nhave on the 504 or 7(a) programs, before calendar year 2006.\n  My Small Business Committee has received expressions of support for \nthe pilot program from representatives of thousands of small businesses \nthat believe the program could improve access to capital, and could \nimprove the terms of loans received, for many small businesses, \nparticularly those without significant real estate property to use as\n\n[[Page S12460]]\n\ncollateral. In particular, support for the program has been expressed \nby minority-owned small businesses and by women-owned small businesses. \nFor these small businesses, which often have less real estate \ncollateral than other small businesses, this pilot program holds great \npotential for creating capital resources to meet their financing needs.\n  For instance, a recent study by the SBA's Office of Advocacy, issued \nin September 2003, reveals that small businesses owned by women are \nmore likely than other small businesses to rely on expensive personal \ncredit cards to finance the business, rather than more traditional \ntypes of loans. For these small businesses, an increase in the \navailability of traditional business loans, with lower financing costs \nand on terms beneficial to the borrowers, would be a welcome \ndevelopment.\n  In addition, the same study showed that minority-owned small \nbusinesses, in addition to being less likely than other small \nbusinesses to obtain credit, were far less likely to obtain their \ncredit from traditional Federally regulated depository institutions, \nand were more likely to resort to financing their businesses through \nsources such as family, friends, and acquaintances of the business \nowners. While this bill does not address subjective lender behavior, it \ndoes address the objective cost/profit opportunity presented to a \nlender by a loan to a small business, including a minority-owned or \nwomen-owned small business. If a lender is able to sell a conventional \nsmall business loan in an efficient secondary market, the potential \ndownside cost of the loan to the lender, e.g., its default risk, is \ndecreased, and the lender is assured that its capital will still be \navailable for other loans.\n  Financial firms currently involved in the pooling and securitization \nof loans issued in the SBA's two primary loan guaranty programs, under \nSection 7(a) of the Small Business Act (``7(a) loans'') and under \nSection 504 of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (``504 \nloans''), have also expressed their support for the program, and have \nstated their belief that it will increase small businesses' access to \neffective capital.\n  In closing, the Small Business Credit Liquidity Act of 2003 is an \ninnovative approach to a persistent problem for small businesses in \nthis country--access to capital. I believe it has the potential to \naddress this problem for small businesses with effectively no risk to \nthe Federal Government. At a time when our small enterprises are \nhelping to lead the country back onto the road to economic recovery, we \nshould be doing all we can to eliminate obstacles facing small \nbusinesses, which hold the greatest potential for job creation in \nAmerica today. This bill is an important step in that direction, and I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting its enactment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a summary of \nits provision be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n              Small Business Credit Liquidity Act of 2003\n\n\n                         Summary of Provisions\n\n       The Small Business Credit Liquidity Act of 2003 authorizes \n     the Small Business Administration (SBA) to develop a three-\n     year pilot program to facilitate the securitization of small \n     business loans, and thereby improve the opportunities for \n     small businesses to obtain capital by increasing the \n     liquidity of small business loans.\n       Under the pilot program:\n       Financial firms, after being licensed by the SBA, would \n     create ``pools'' of conventional small business loans, i.e., \n     small business loans not individually guaranteed by the SBA.\n       These financial firms, also known as ``loan poolers,'' \n     would then issue securities, rated by rating agencies, which \n     would offer returns based upon the returns from the loans in \n     the pools. The securities would be sold to private investors.\n       The loan poolers would offer partial ``first-loss'' \n     guarantees to investors on the securities' returns (i.e., on \n     the pools themselves, rather than on individual loans). If \n     the loans had insufficient returns to pay the expected \n     returns on the securities, the pooling entities' guarantees \n     would be the first guarantees called into performance to pay \n     investors.\n       The SBA would issue additional guarantees, on the pools \n     rather than on individual loans, that would be in a ``second \n     loss'' position, meaning that the private investors would \n     receive the full first-loss guarantees from the loan poolers \n     before any SBA guarantee was applied. The SBA's second-loss \n     guarantees for each pool would be limited to 25 percent of \n     the size of that pool.\n       The SBA's second-loss guarantees would be funded \n     exclusively through fees paid by loan poolers, and would \n     therefore require no appropriated funds.\n       The SBA would be required to report its plan for the \n     program to the Senate and House Committees on Small Business \n     before implementing the program. The SBA would also be \n     required to file with the Congress, in the agency's Budget \n     Request and Performance Plan, an annual report about the \n     program's performance. In addition, the General Accounting \n     Office (GAO) would be required to study the pilot program \n     after it began and analyze its results.\n       To ensure that the pilot program is initially implemented \n     on a manageable scale, loan pools under the pilot program \n     would have maximum individual sizes beginning at $350 million \n     for fiscal year 2004 and increasing to $450 million for \n     fiscal year 2006. In addition, the SBA's guarantees would be \n     limited to maximum amounts of $2.1 billion for fiscal year \n     2004, $3.25 billion for fiscal year 2005, and $4.5 billion \n     for fiscal year 2006.\n       The program will sunset at the end of fiscal year 2006 \n     unless it is reauthorized by Congress.\n\n                                S. 1713\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the National Housing Act to increase the \nmaximum mortgage amount limit for FHA-insured mortgages for multifamily \nhousing located in high-cost areas; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, the \nFHA Multifamily Housing Loan Limit Adjustment Act of 2003, that will \nimprove access to affordable housing for families living in high cost \nareas where there is a shortage of such housing. This bill was \nintroduced earlier this year by Congressmen Gary Miller (R-CA) and \nBarney Frank (D-MA) and was recently approved by the House Financial \nServices Committee.\n  The Multifamily Housing Loan Limit Adjustment Act of 2003 is \nsupported by housing and community advocates and has also been endorsed \nby the National Association of Home Builders, the National Association \nof Realtors, the Mortgage Bankers Association, the Manufactured Housing \nInstitute, and the National Affordable Housing Management Association.\n  The Federal Housing Administration's Multifamily Housing programs are \namong HUD's most successful. The Federal Government has tried a number \nof different approaches to providing housing over the last 50 years. \nThe most successful of these rely heavily on a public/private \npartnership that encourages the private sector to produce housing with \nsupport from the Federal Government. The FHA mortgage insurance \nprograms have been extremely successful in producing new and \nrehabilitated housing with little or no cost to the Federal Government.\n  As you know, rising construction costs have resulted in a shortage of \nmoderately priced affordable rental units. Rent increases now exceed \ninflation in all regions of the country, and new affordable rental \nunits have become increasingly harder to find. Because of the current \ndollar limits on loans, FHA insurance cannot be used to help finance \nconstruction in high-cost urban areas such as the New York/New Jersey \nmetropolitan area, Philadelphia and San Francisco.\n  HUD statistics demonstrate this--in 2002 and 2003, no multifamily \nloans have been FHA insured in New York City, Philadelphia, Los \nAngeles, Seattle, Massachusetts, or New Jersey.\n  Increasing the limits on loans for rental housing would create more \nincentives for public/private investment in communities through America \nand spur the new production of cooperative housing projects, rental \nhousing for the elderly and new construction or substantial \nrehabilitation of apartments by for- and non-profit entities.\n  The National Association of Home Builders estimates that increasing \nthe limits in high cost areas will allow for an additional 6,000 units \nof rental housing to be built each year in the cities limited by the \ncurrent law. These 6,000 units will generate $318 million in new income \nto the residents and businesses in these cities, $38 million in added \nrevenues to the local governments, and 6,720 new jobs. Over a ten year \nperiod, the cumulative effects of the additional building will \ncontribute $9 billion in new income to the cities where the limits \ncurrently constrain new rental production.\n\n  While Congress approved legislation I introduced in 2001 to increase \nthe statutory limits for FHA-insured multifamily project loans to \naccount for inflation, we failed to act on a key provision in my bill \nto raise the loan limits for high cost areas. I am reintroducing that \nportion of my bill gain, with the hope that two years later, we can \nfinally achieve the increases we need to make the FHA multifamily \nprograms succeed in all our communities, particularly in those high \ncosts areas that so desperately need additional affordable rental \nhousing.\n  There is currently no HUD program designed to provide rental housing \nfor working families from 60 percent to 100 percent of median income \nwho are unable to find decent, affordable housing near where they work. \nYet, the most recent Census data reveals that these working families, \nincluding vital municipal workers like teachers and police officers, \nare increasingly vulnerable and the lack of decent, affordable housing \nis increasingly being seen as a significant impediment to local \neconomic growth. This is one reason why the FHA multifamily programs \nare so important.\n  Without this much-needed adjustment to the FHA multifamily loan \nlimits, access to affordable housing for our working-citizens will \ncontinue to lag, thousands of more families will join the 14 million \npeople who currently face severe housing needs and our nation's economy \nwill suffer.\n  I hope my Senate colleagues will support the legislation and help \nensure that America's working families have access to affordable \nhousing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1714\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Jon S. Corzine.\n     U.S. Senate, 502 Senate Hart Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Corzine: I am writing to convey the National \n     Affordable Housing Management Association's (NAHMA) strong \n     support for the FHA Multifamily Housing Loan Limit Adjustment \n     Act.\n       NAHMA represents owners and individuals involved with the \n     management of affordable multifamily housing developments. \n     Affordable properties owned and managed by NAHMA members are \n     subject to the regulations of federal agencies including the \n     U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the U.S. \n     Rural Housing Service, and the Internal Revenue Service. \n     NAHMA members provide quality affordable housing to more than \n     two million Americans with very low and moderate incomes. \n     Executives of property management companies, owners of \n     affordable rental housing, public agencies and vendors that \n     serve the affordable housing industry constitute NAHMA's \n     membership.\n       The FHA multifamily insurance programs are an important \n     component of any affordable housing strategy. Your \n     legislation, which increases the maximum Federal Housing \n     Administration (FHA) multifamily mortgage loan limits in high \n     cost areas from 110 to 170 percent above the base loan \n     limits, will help increase the availability of affordable \n     housing for low-to-moderate income families. This bill will \n     encourage production of multifamily developments in some of \n     the most expensive areas in the nation--where affordable \n     housing is often desperately needed.\n       NAHMA is pleased to offer its strong support for the FHA \n     Multifamily Housing Loan Limit Adjustment Act. I look forward \n     to working with you to advance this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Kris Cook, CAE,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Association of Realtors, National Association of \n           Home Builders, Mortgage Bankers Association,\n                                                  October 2, 2003.\n     Hon. Jon S. Corzine,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Corzine: On behalf of the membership of our \n     associations who represent the home buying, home building, \n     and home financing industries, we are writing in support of \n     legislation you intend to introduce to increase the Federal \n     Housing Administration (FHA) multifamily loan limits in high-\n     cost areas. Over the past 2 years, Congress and the \n     Administration have taken steps to update the FHA multifamily \n     loan limits. However, one final hurdle remains since the \n     current maximum FHA multifamily mortgage limits are \n     inadequate and continue to constrain new construction and \n     rehabilitation in many urban and suburban areas, where \n     construction costs are significantly higher than in the rest \n     of the country.\n       The FHA's multifamily mortgage insurance programs enable \n     qualified borrowers to obtain long-term, fixed-rate, \n     nonrecourse, financing for a variety of multifamily \n     properties that are affordable to low- and moderate-income \n     families. This public/private partnership has resulted in a \n     successful program providing housing for a portion of the \n     population not usually served by private industry alone. In \n     addition to serving a valuable purpose, according to recent \n     calculations by HUD and OMB indicate that virtually all of \n     the FHA multifamily insurance programs operate on a break-\n     even basis or raise revenue for the government.\n       Without higher FHA multifamily loan limits in high-cost \n     markets, critical housing needs will go unmet. Those who will \n     be most affected will include low- and moderate-income \n     families, including important community service providers \n     such as teachers, firefighters, and police officers. By \n     increasing the maximum loan limit for FHA's multifamily \n     programs, these programs can help provide the housing \n     opportunities necessary for the economic and social well \n     being of our Nation. We applaud your efforts to increase the \n     availability of affordable housing in our Nation's high-cost \n     areas.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 1715. A bill to amend the Indian Self-Determination and Education \nAssistance Act to provide further self-governance by Indian tribes; to \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by \nSenator Inouye in introducing the Department of Interior Tribal Self \nGovernance Amendments of 2003, a bill that is a companion to the bill \nwe introduced yesterday, the Department of Health and Human Services \nTribal Self Governance Amendments of 2003.\n  Taken together, these bills will strengthen the government-to-\ngovernment relationship between the United States and Indian tribes by \nshepherding in the next phase of Indian Self Governance.\n  Due to the Federal reservation status of Indian lands, the Department \nof the Interior, among all Federal agencies, has historically had the \nmost significant impact on the lives of Indians.\n  This longstanding relationship with Indian tribes has often been \nstormy, with Federal bureaucrats providing all or nearly all services \nto Indian tribes and their members, including police, fire, education \nand health care services.\n  The Federal-tribal relationship took a decided turn for the better in \n1975 with the enactment of the Indian Self Determination and Education \nAssistance Act of 1975, Pub. L. 93-638. Since passage of Pub. L. 93-\n638, Congress has systematically devolved to Indian tribes the \nauthority and responsibility to manage Federal programs within the \nBureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service.\n  The bill I am introducing today will expand the provisions of Self \nGovernance within the Department of the Interior by creating a \nDemonstration Project within the Department of the Interior for non-BIA \nprograms.\n  This Demonstration Project is integral to the continued success of \nSelf Governance for Indians, as there remain many non-BIA programs with \nthe Department that affect the ability of Indian tribes to better serve \ntheir members.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1715\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nauthorize the use of funds made available for nonpoint source \nmanagement programs for projects and activities relating to the \ndevelopment and implementation of phase II of the storm water program \nof the Environmental Protection Agency; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues \nSenator Bond of Missouri and Senator Jeffords of Vermont in introducing \nlegislation today that addresses an issue of great concern for our \nStates and regions--the availability of Clean Water Act Section 319 \nfunding for development and implementation of the Phase II Storm Water \nProgram.\n  Stormwater runoff carries with it a host of contaminants as it runs \nover rooftops and lawns, parking lots and new construction sites, \ndepositing nutrients, toxic metals, and sediments into downstream \nwaterbodies. In many areas of the country, and particularly strongly \nurbanized areas, stormwater ranks high on the list of priority \npollution sources impacting the water quality of our lakes, rivers, \nstreams, and bays. As States proceed with development of the federally-\nmandated Phase II Storm Water Program to address critical stormwater \nrunoff, the costs of implementing the requirements of the program are \nbecoming a major concern for States and the municipalities.\n  At issue is whether funds provided to States through Section 319 of \nthe Clean Water Act may be used for the purposes of developing and \nimplementing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Phase II Storm \nWater Rule that went into effect in March 2003. This issue is \nsignificant because the Phase II Program requires States to regulate \nstormwater discharges, which have historically been treated as nonpoint \nsources, as if they are point sources under the National Pollutant \nDischarge Elimination System (NPDES) Program. As a result, it is \npossible that federally-mandated State nonpoint source control \nprograms, which have been funded by 319 monies in the past, may have to \nfind new funding sources even as stormwater requirements are increased.\n  In recent years, the Environmental Protection Agency's Nonpoint \nSource Program has increasingly focused on impaired waters and \nstormwater-related concerns as the agency has moved toward a watershed-\nbased approach. Although the Clean Water Act appears silent on the \neligibility of Section 319 funding to address stormwater issues \ncurrently falling under the NPDES Program, EPA has thus far interpreted \nthe Act to prohibit 319 funds from being used for implementation of the \nPhase II Storm Water Program. In recent months, a lack of clarity also \nexists on the use of Section 319 funding in geographic areas covered by \nthe Phase II Program. Phase II applies to all populated areas of 1000 \npeople or greater per square mile. In Rhode Island, nearly all of the \nstate's impaired waters are included in Phase II areas. Given a strict \nEPA interpretation of the law, Section 319 funds could not be used in \nany of these areas.\n  Last year, the Senate approved and the President signed into law the \nGreat Lakes and Lake Champlain Act of 2002 which contains a provision \nproviding a one-year extension, during fiscal year 2003, for states to \nretain flexibility in using 319 funding for addressing their stormwater \nconcerns. We are introducing legislation today that builds upon the \nfiscal year 2003 fix by providing permanent authority for states to use \nSection 319 monies for development and implementation of the Phase II \nStorm Water Program. Further, the legislation clarifies that 319 monies \nmay be used in Phase II geographic jurisdictions.\n  The Phase II Storm Water Program is an important step toward \nprotecting our Nation's waters from stormwater discharges, and striving \nfor an integrated strategy in preventing, controlling, and reducing \npollution entering our waterbodies. The legislation introduced today \nprovides critical flexibility to States and municipalities as they \ncontinue to struggle financially with coming into compliance with the \nPhase II Program. I encourage my colleagues on the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, and in the Senate, to join us in expeditiously \napproving this important legislation. Thank you.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise before the Senate today to join \nmy colleagues Senator Chafee and Senator Bond to introduce legislation \nto provide funding for storm water control and management. This \nlegislation will ensure that smaller communities required to comply \nwith the storm water phase II regulations will continue to have access \nto section 319 grant funds under the Clean Water Act.\n  The storm water phase II regulations went into effect on March 10, \n2003. These regulations require that smaller communities required to \nobtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit \nand implement best management practices to control storm water \ndischarges and prevent water pollution. Existing EPA policy requires \nthat once a community obtains an NPDES permit, it can no longer use \nsection 319, non-point source funding. However, there are no dedicated, \nalternative funding sources available for storm water management. As \nsmaller communities, like many of those in Vermont, are working hard to \nimplement strong programs to control storm water runoff, it seems \ncounterintuitive to remove one of the main funding sources these \ncommunities use for this purpose.\n  During the 107th Congress, as Chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, I supported Senator Chafee's efforts to put in place a \none-year fix to this problem, allowing section 319 funds to be used for \nstorm water controls during fiscal year 2003. This one-year fix passed \nthe EPW Committee, the full Senate, and the full House unanimously. I \nhope that we have the same level of support during the 108th Congress.\n  In our efforts to make our nation's water cleaner, non-point sources \nof pollution remain our next major hurdle. Storm water runoff is one \narea where we can make an immediate difference in the amount of \npollution reaching our waters with an investment in best management \npractices and control techniques. We need to make more resources \navailable to communities working hard to reduce the impact of storm \nwater runoff on water quality. This legislation is step one of a long \nlist of actions that I believe this Congress should take to make more \nresources available for storm water management.\n\n[[Page S12469]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Specter, and Mr. \n        Dodd):\n  S. 1717. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \nNational Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network to prepare, store, and \ndistribute human umbilical cord blood stem cells for the treatment of \npatients and to support peer-reviewed research using such cells; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce the ``Cord \nBlood Stem Cell Act'' of 2003. I am particularly gratified that \nSenators Brownback, Specter, and Dodd have joined me as cosponsors of \nthis bipartisan bill. The purpose of the Cord Blood Stem Cell Act is to \ncreate a network of qualified cord blood banking centers to prepare, \nstore, and distribute human umbilical cord blood stem cells for the \ntreatment of patients and to support research using such cells.\n  As my colleagues are aware, thousands of Americans receive and are \nsaved by bone marrow transplants each year. But, thousands more die for \nlack of an appropriate donor. The good news is that for several years, \nexperts from a few centers have collected and preserved the blood and \nstem cells from human placenta and umbilical cords. These cells can \nprovide an alternative to bone marrow transplantation. For some \npatients, particularly those for whom a bone marrow match cannot be \nfound, transplantation of these cells can be a life-saving therapy.\n  In some cases cord blood stem cell transplants provide an advantage \nrelative to bone marrow transplants because they reduce risk to the \ndonor, they are readily available, and they lower the risk of \ntransplant complications. Cord blood stem cells also increase the \nsuccess of transplantation from donors to recipients who are not fully \nmatched, thus decreasing the difficulty of finding a fully matched \ndonor.\n  Cord blood transplantation has been used successfully to treat \nleukemia, lymphoma, immunodeficiency diseases, sickle cell anemia, and \nseveral metabolic diseases. However, despite initial successes, not \nenough cord blood exists currently to meet the need. Currently, the \nnumber of cord blood stem cell units in the United States is \ninsufficient to meet the need.\n  The bipartisan Cord Blood Stem Cell Act of 2003 proposes to establish \nan inventory of 150,000 cord blood stem cell units that reflects the \ndiversity of the United States and will enable at least 90 percent of \nAmericans to receive an appropriately matched cord blood stem cell \ntransplant. The inventory would provide a critical resource for those \nin need of transplants and allocate a certain proportion of units to \nsustain further research on cord blood stem cells.\n  The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Network, administered by the \nSecretary of Health and Human services and a Board of Directors \nappointed by the Secretary, would be a system of qualified donor banks \nwhich will acquire, test, and preserve cord blood stem cells, educate \nand recruit donors, and make such cells available to transplant centers \nfor stem cell transplantation. The Network would establish a National \nCord Blood Stem Cell Registry, which would acquire and distribute \ndonated units of cord blood, provide health care professionals with the \nability to search the entire registry for a suitable donor match for \npatients and maintain a database to document the activities of the \nNetwork.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a brief section-by-section analysis of \nthe National Cord Blood Stem Cell Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the analysis was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Cord Blood Stem Cell Act of 2003\n\n       Section 1--Short Title: Cord Blood Stem Cell Act of 2003\n       Section 2--National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network:\n       Subsection (a): Sets fourth the definitions to be used for \n     the purposes of this document.\n       Subsection (b): (1) In general--A national cord blood stem \n     cell bank containing of 150,000 units will be established and \n     provided for by qualified cord blood stem cell banks. (2) \n     Purpose of donor banks--The banks will acquire tissue type, \n     test, cryopreserve, and store donated cord blood stem cell \n     units and make cord blood units available. Ten percent of \n     this cord blood inventory will be allocated for research. (3) \n     Eligibility of donor banks--In order to create an effective \n     donor bank it must obtain all licenses, certifications, and \n     registrations needed to operate. It must preform adequate \n     screenings of the cord blood in order to eliminate \n     transmission of disease and other harmful infections. Donor \n     banks must uphold the utmost confidentiality to protect the \n     patients and the donors under HIPAA. A donor bank must \n     encourage an ethnically diverse population of cord blood stem \n     cells. A donor bank must also develop an adequate system of \n     communication for nationwide usage of cord blood stem cells, \n     and educate the public on the advantages of donating and \n     utilizing cord blood stem cells.\n       Subsection (c): Administration of the Network--Cord blood \n     stem cell banks shall be run by a board of directors, \n     including a chairman. Each member of the board of directors \n     shall serve a 3-year term, and the board will be represented \n     by various experienced people. Each year \\1/3\\ of the board \n     of directors' terms will expire.\n       There shall also be a National Cord Blood Stem Cell \n     registry. The registry shall find appropriate cord blood for \n     matched candidates; allow searches in the registry for a \n     suitable donor for patients; and maintain a healthy, updated \n     database.\n       The Database shall be confidential under HIPAA, and will be \n     carefully monitored by the Secretary.\n       Subsection (d): Authorization of Appropriation--Authorizes \n     $15 million for FY2004.\n       This is a therapy that can be life-saving for many \n     Americans with diseases that can be treated by stem cell \n     transplantation; particularly for many minorities and other \n     Americans who are unable to find a matching bone marrow \n     donor. I am pleased to introduce this bill that will save \n     lives by providing Americans with the opportunity to receive \n     a promising therapy.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Hatch, Senator \nBrownback, and Senator Specter in introducing legislation to advance \nthe use of umbilical cord blood for clinical applications and research. \nI first became aware of the potential therapeutic benefits of cord \nblood when my daughter was born 2 years ago. At that time, our doctor \ninformed me and my wife that preserving a small amount of blood from \nthe umbilical cord could prove enormously beneficial later in her life. \nShould she become ill with a disease requiring bone marrow \nreconstitution, he told us, her own cord blood stem cells could be \nused. This would eliminate the need to find a suitable bone marrow \ndonor.\n  The bill that we are introducing today will begin a new national \ncommitment to the development of this technology--which has the \npotential to reduce pain and suffering and save the lives of so many \nAmericans afflicted with some of the most debilitating illnesses. Cord \nblood has already been used successfully in treating a number of \ndiseases, including sickle cell anemia and certain childhood cancers. \nHowever, the use of cord blood is still fledgling. Recent developments \nhave suggested that the stem cells derived from cord blood may be \nuseful in treating a much wider range of diseases, such as Parkinson's \ndisease, diabetes, and heart disease.\n  Like many Americans, I had never heard of cord blood before the birth \nof my daughter. It is not widely used--at least in this country. In the \nfirst 8 months of this year, 95 percent of all bone marrow \nreconstitutions were done using a bone marrow transplant. Only 5 \npercent used cord blood. This figure is surprising when we consider the \npotential benefits of cord blood relative to bone marrow.\n  First, it can be very difficult to find a suitable bone marrow donor. \nAccording to a General Accounting Office, GAO, report, of the 15,231 \nindividuals needing bone marrow transplants between 1997 and 2000 who \nconducted a preliminary search of the National Bone Marrow Donor \nRegistry, NBMDR, only 4,056 received a transplant--a 27-percent success \nrate. This number is even lower for minorities. Cord blood would not \nonly produce an additional source of donation, it also does not require \nas exact a match as bone marrow.\n  In addition, cord blood is readily available. While it can take \nmonths between finding a bone marrow match and actually receiving a \ntransplant, a unit of cord blood can be utilized in a matter of days or \nweeks. Cord blood also lowers the risk of complications of both the \ndonor and the recipient. The need to extract bone marrow from the donor \nis eliminated, and the risk of infection or rejection by the recipient \nis significantly reduced. Finally, research has suggested that cord \nblood might produce better outcomes than bone marrow in children.\n  Why then, given all of these benefits, has the use of cord blood not \nbecome\n\n[[Page S12470]]\n\nmuch more prevalent in the United States? In Japan, where the use of \ncord blood in clinical settings is more advanced, nearly half of all \ntransplants now use cord blood rather than bone marrow.\n  The relatively infrequent use of cord blood in our country is at \nleast partly attributable to the lack of a national infrastructure for \nthe matching and distribution of cord blood units. There are a handful \nof cord blood banks around the country doing excellent work, but there \nis a much more developed infrastructure for bone marrow. This is thanks \nto legislation passed by Congress in 1986 that established a National \nRegistry for bone marrow. By the way, that legislation is due to be \nreauthorized next year--and I would like to voice my strong support for \nthat reauthorization.\n  Our bill would create a similar infrastructure for cord blood. \nSpecifically, it would direct the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, HHS, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources \nand Services Administration, HRSA, to establish a National Cord Blood \nStem Cell Bank Network, as well as a registry of available cord blood \nunits. The network and registry would be required to collect a minimum \nof 150,000 units, which should be sufficient to provide a suitable \nmatch for 90 percent of the U.S. population.\n  Donor banks would also be required to educate the general public \nabout the potential benefits of cord blood, and encourage an ethnically \ndiverse population of cord blood donors. Given the untapped potential \nof cord blood, at least 10 percent of the available units must also be \nmade available for research. Finally, the legislation authorizes an \nappropriation of $15 million for fiscal year 2004, and such sums as may \nbe necessary for fiscal years 2005 through 2008.\n  Mr. President, before finishing today I would like to make it clear \nthat I strongly support the continuation of the excellent work done by \nthe National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP). Cord blood should act as a \ncomplement to--not a replacement for--bone marrow. In many cases, a \nbone marrow transplant is still the preferred therapy. Physicians \nshould have the ability to decide on a case-by-case basis which is best \nfor their patients. That is why I am hopeful that the NMDP will have a \nvery active role in designing and supporting the National Cord Blood \nStem Cell Network and Registry. Ideally, the two will work together to \nprovide a single resource where doctors can search both cord blood \nstockpiles and a list of marrow donors for a suitable match for their \npatients.\n  I firmly believe that the creation of a national infrastructure for \ncord blood will, in time, save the lives of thousands of gravely ill \nAmericans. We have a responsibility to encourage use of cord blood \nwhere appropriate today, and invest in research to fully tap the \npotential of this technology. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/03/senate-section/article/S12470-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12470-S12471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 239--DESIGNATING NOVEMBER 7, 2003, AS ``NATIONAL \nNATIVE AMERICAN VETERANS DAY'' TO HONOR THE SERVICE OF NATIVE AMERICANS \n   IN THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF NATIVE \n             AMERICANS TO THE DEFENSE OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \nThomas, and Mr. McCain) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nInouye, Bingaman, Johnson, and Thomas in submitting a resolution to \nhonor Native American Indian veterans for their service in the Armed \nForces of the United States and to designate November 7, 2003 as \n``National Native American Veterans Day''.\n  As the events of conflict in Iraq continue we all hope and pray for \nthe safe return of the men and women who are overseas, far from home \nprotecting our nation and others.\n  Native Americans have fought in wars and conflicts that date back to \nthe days before the Revolution and fought alongside the colonists \nduring the Revolutionary war.\n  Native people continued the call by enlisting in the armed services \nof the United States to fight in the many conflicts of our past \nincluding the War of 1812, the Civil War, and the Spanish-American war \nin 1898.\n  In 1868, the U.S. Army established the Indian scouts to utilize their \nspecial skill of scouting the enemy. Theodore Roosevelt recruited \nNative Americans to be part of his famous Rough Riders. This is \nprobably a little known fact.\n  Within the last century, approximately 12,000 Native Americans served \nin World War I, 44,000 in World War II and the Korean War, 42,000 in \nthe Vietnam war, and at the end of the 20th century there were nearly \n190,000 Native American Indian men and women serving in the military.\n  At the same time, few people know that American Indians were not made \ncitizens until Congress enacted the Indian Citizenship Act in 1924.\n  In 2001, I was honored to take part in ceremonies awarding the \nCongressional gold medal to the Navajo Code Talkers who made such a \ngreat contribution to the war efforts in the Pacific during World War \nII. At a time when the Japanese were breaking the codes developed by \nAmerican intelligence, the Code Talkers made use of the Navajo language \nto confound the enemy and communicate military strategy and positions \nwithout compromise. Of all the codes developed in World War II, the \nNavajo language code was the only one not broken during World War II.\n  The Code Talkers story is not the only one worthy of recognition. \nOnly recently was it rediscovered that an Oneida woman, Tyonajanegen, \nfought alongside her husband, an American army officer, during the \nAmerican Revolution. Sacajawea, a Shoshone woman, guided and served as \nan interpreter for Lewis and Clark during their expedition. Native \nwomen also served in the Spanish American War and World War I as \nmilitary nurses. Approximately 800 Native women served in World War II. \nThey continued to answer the call throughout the military campaigns of \nthe Korean War, the Vietnam War, Operations Desert Shield and, \nrecently, Desert Storm.\n\n  We also honor the memory of Lori Piestewa, a Hopi woman, who fought \nvaliantly and bravely to protect her fellows during the invasion of \nIraq. Just as we cheered when Jessica Lynch was rescued and returned \nhome, all Americans were saddened to learn of Lori Piestewa's fate.\n  Some warriors served this country valiantly, yet fell, not by a \nbullet, but\n\n[[Page S12471]]\n\nby a broken heart. Ira Hayes is one such man. He was a Pima Indian from \nthe Gila River Indian Reservation in Arizona.

Res. 240\n\n       Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives were the \n     original inhabitants of the land that now constitutes the \n     United States;\n       Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives have \n     traditionally exhibited a respect for the finiteness of \n     natural resources through a reverence for the Earth;\n       Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives have served \n     with valor in all of the wars of the United States, beginning \n     with the Revolutionary War and continuing through the \n     conflict in Iraq, and the percentage of Native Americans \n     serving in the United States armed services has significantly \n     exceeded the percentage of Native people in the population of \n     the United States as a whole;\n       Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives have made \n     distinct and important contributions to the world in many \n     fields, including agriculture, medicine, music, language, and \n     the arts;\n       Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives should be \n     recognized for their contributions to the United States, \n     including as local and national leaders, artists, athletes, \n     and scholars;\n       Whereas such recognition will encourage self-esteem, pride, \n     and self-awareness in American Indians and Alaska Natives of \n     all ages; and\n       Whereas November is a month during which many Americans \n     commemorate a special time in the history of the United \n     States, when American Indians and English settlers celebrated \n     the bounty of their harvest and the promise of new kinships: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates November 2003 as ``National American Indian \n     Heritage Month''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the Federal Government and State and local \n     governments, interested groups and organizations, and the \n     people of the United States to observe the month with \n     appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by \nSenators Inouye, Dorgan, Bingaman, Johnson, Domenici, McCain, Thomas \nand Hatch in submitting a resolution to recognize the many \ncontributions American Indians and Alaska Natives have made to our \ngreat Nation and to designate November, 2003, as ``National American \nIndian Heritage Month'' as Congress has done for nearly a decade.\n  Native people have left an indelible imprint on many aspects of our \neveryday life that most Americans take for granted. The arts, \neducation, science, the armed forces, medicine, industry, and \ngovernment are a few of the areas that have been influenced by American \nIndian and Alaska Native people over the last 500 years.\n  In the medical field, many of the healing remedies that we use today \nderive from practices used first by Native people hundreds of years \nbefore we incorporated them into western medicine.\n  Native people revere the natural environment, have great respect for \nelders and veterans, and cherish the family which is the center of \nIndian life and culture. These values are deeply rooted, strongly \nembraced and thrive with generation after generation of Native people.\n  From the difficult days of Valley Forge through our peace keeping \nefforts around the world today, American Indian and Alaska Native \npeople have proudly served and dedicated their lives in the military \nreadiness and defense of our country in wartime and in peace. It is a \nfact that on a per capita basis, Native participation rate in the armed \nForces outstrips the rates of all other groups in the Nation.\n  Many Native men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice in \ndefending the Nation, some before they were granted citizenship in \n1924.\n  Many of the words in our language have been borrowed from Native \nlanguages, including many of the names of the rivers, cities, and \nStates across America. Indian arts and crafts have also made a distinct \nimpression on our heritage.\n  By designating November 2003, as ``National American Indian Heritage \nMonth'' we will continue to encourage self-esteem, pride, and self-\nawareness among American Indians and Alaska Natives of all ages and \nremind all Americans of the contributions of the Native people of this \ngreat land.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/03/senate-section/article/S12471-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 241--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n                         PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to address \nyet another misguided judicial action that is threatening again to \nprevent the ``Do-Not-Call Registry'' from going into effect on \nWednesday, October 1. This body just last week addressed the misguided \napplication of the law from a Federal Court in Oklahoma.\n  Not 48 hours had passed before the lawyers for the telemarketers \nfound another judge to halt the implementation of that program--this \ntime on constitutional grounds.\n  The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado in Mainstream \nMarketing Services, Inc., et. al. v. Federal Trade Commission, last \nFriday held that the FTC ``Do-Not-Call Registry violated the Right of \nFree Speech provisions of the United States Constitution.\n  How many times must this body speak before the courts will listen?\n  Americans are outraged that their right to privacy can be invaded \nevery night while they try to eat dinner with their families. Our lives \nare busy enough throughout the day with work and school, after school \nactivities and preparing for the next day. To have a little quiet time \nat dinner is not too much to ask, yet these telemarketing companies now \nfeel it is their right to disturb our few moments of family solitude.\n  In the first case they brought against the regulations they argued \nlack of authority. Now they argue lack of constitutional support. What \nis next, lack of ability to abide by what the Administration, Congress \nand the American people are clamoring for?\n  Those who seek to stop the implementation of this program assert they \nare protected by a right of free speech. Therein lies the problem.\n  The commercial speech that the telemarketers seek to preserve is not \nheld to the same standard under the First Amendment as individual right \nof speech. Further, the FTC regulations are not arbitrary and \ncapricious because the FTC considered the comments of thousands of \npeople and clearly made findings justifying their regulations.\n  Now, Congress has subsequently acted to establish in law the \nauthority for the FTC to say that telemarketers do not enjoy a free \nrein into our homes by using the telephone.\n  I say it is the people who have the right to decide they do not want \nto be hounded by telemarketers and those who would interrupt the \nsanctity of their homes.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court has found that one aspect of residential \nprivacy is the right to avoid unwanted communications. The Supreme \nCourt also has repeatedly held that individuals are not required to \nwelcome unwanted speech into their homes and that the government may \nprotect this freedom.\n  The entire purpose of the FTC's ``Do No Call Registry'' program is to \nallow Americans to opt-out of receiving these annoying phone calls. In \nmy judgment the court's decision to stop this program tilts our privacy \nrights out of balance in favor of these telemarketing companies.\n  As we heard repeatedly on the Senate floor last week, in just the few \nshort months since the FTC adopted these rules nearly 50 million people \nhave registered to stop these harassing phone calls.\n  Alaskans were looking forward to the implementation of this FTC rule \nto give them the peace and quiet they have sought for so long. We need \nthis FTC rule to protect our citizens and their privacy.\n  Americans and Congress have spoken. People do not like to be \ndisturbed by unwanted and harassing phone calls from people selling \nproducts over the phone. The Administration listened to the cries of \nAmericans. Congress listened to the cries of Americans. Now the courts \nmust respect the choice of the people by allowing this rule to go into \neffect.\n  Unfortunately, the most recent court opinion on this issue shows yet \nagain that the justice system in America is broken and badly in need of \nrepair.\n  The resolution that I submit today is different from what the Senate \nvoted on last week. This resolution states that it is the sense of the \nUnited States Senate that the court's judgment in this most recent case \nwas in error.\n  The Resolution further authorizes the Senate Legal Counsel to \nintervene in this most recent case to assert the constitutionality of \nthe ``Do-Not-Call Registry,'' or if it is unable to intervene, to file \nan amicus curiae brief in support of the constitutionality of the do-\nnot-call registry.\n  Once again I ask this body: How many times must we speak before the \ncourts will let this rule go into effect? Hopefully the courts will pay \nattention today.\n  I am proud to submit this resolution and I hope this body will act \nquickly on this measure to send yet another message to our courts that \nthe privacy of our homes cannot be invaded.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/03/senate-section/article/S12472-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12472-S12473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 72--COMMEMORATING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF \n THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE UNITED STATES CADET NURSE CORPS AND VOICING \n THE APPRECIATION OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE SERVICE OF THE MEMBERS OF \n        THE UNITED STATES CADET NURSE CORPS DURING WORLD WAR II\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 72\n\n       Whereas the United States experienced an extreme shortage \n     of nurses and medical personnel during World War II, and this \n     shortage was filled in part by the 180,000 women of the \n     United States Cadet Nurse Corps;\n       Whereas the United States Cadet Nurse Corps was under the \n     jurisdiction of the Public Health Service, a branch of the \n     uniformed services of the United States;\n       Whereas the United States Cadet Nurse Corps was established \n     pursuant to the Act of June 15, 1943 (Chapter 126; 57 Stat. \n     153), commonly known as the Bolton Act in honor of \n     Congresswoman Frances Payne Bolton who introduced the \n     legislation;\n       Whereas the members of the United States Cadet Nurse Corps \n     were required to undergo training that involved 12-hour days \n     in hospitals followed by classes, with specific standards for \n     admission into the Corps;\n       Whereas the members of the United States Cadet Nurse Corps \n     made a pledge upon entrance into their post to be available \n     for military, governmental, or essential civilian services \n     for the duration of World War II;\n       Whereas the members of the United States Cadet Nurse Corps \n     wore uniforms with patches certified by the Secretary of the \n     Army and served under the authority of commissioned officers;\n       Whereas members of the United States Cadet Nurse Corps were \n     charged with the reception of sick and wounded members of the \n     Armed Forces and performed other duties in promotion of the \n     public interest in connection with military operations;\n       Whereas the United States Cadet Nurse Corps was responsible \n     for saving civilian hospital nursing services by providing 80 \n     percent of the nursing staff for civilian hospitals during \n     World War II;\n       Whereas some members of the United States Cadet Nurse Corps \n     left their families and served all across the Nation in \n     various hospitals, occasionally substituting for doctors; and\n       Whereas the United States Cadet Nurse Corps remains \n     unrecognized as a military organization and its members \n     remain unrecognized as veterans of the United States Army: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the members of the United States Cadet Nurse \n     Corps for their patriotism and civic activism in a time of \n     emergency during World War II; and\n       (2) honors the 60th Anniversary of the creation of the \n     United States Cadet Nurse Corps.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am submitting a concurrent \nresolution to honor a special group of women\n\n[[Page S12473]]\n\nwho served their Nation during World War II, veterans of the Cadet \nNurse Corps.\n  During World War II, 250,000 nurses were sent to the front lines to \ncare for Allied troops. By 1942, there was such a shortage of civilian \nnurses in the United States that many immunizations were cancelled and \nhundreds of clinics were closed. An alarmingly high number of babies \nwere being delivered at home, without the assistance of medical \nprofessionals, and some hospitals were forced to shut wards.\n  To alleviate this shortage, nearly 180,000 young women answered the \ncall of government recruiters to join the Cadet Nurse Corps. These \nyoung women staffed domestic hospital wards while the overseas nurses \ncared for wounded troops on the front lines. The Cadet Nurses comprised \nnearly 80 percent of the nursing staff for civilian hospitals during \nWorld War II, and, without their service, our Nation could not have \nafforded to make such a tremendous commitment to providing medical \nattention to our troops overseas.\n  Recently, a number of former Cadet Nurses who trained at St. Luke's \nHospital in Aberdeen, SD, gathered for a reunion. This year, as you may \nknow, marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the Cadet \nNurse Corps. The reunion drew about a dozen former members of the \nCorps, including several who now live out of State.\n  Among the participants was Esther Roesch Buechler, and her story \nprovides insight into what it was like to serve as a Cadet Nurse.\n  Esther, now 78 years old, grew up in Roscoe, a small community in \nnorth-central South Dakota. She was born with a number of medical \nproblems that have inspired her to help others in need. With great \nsupport from her father, she was determined to devote her life to \nmedical care. Upon her graduation from high school in 1943, Esther \njoined the Cadet Nurse Corps. Assigned to St. Luke's, she recalls long, \narduous hours at a clinic whose nursing staff had been decimated by the \nwar. Later in her training, she was sent to the VA nursing home in Des \nMoines, Iowa, where she treated World War I veterans, as well as new \nveterans from the World War II campaign. Following her Cadet Nurse \nCorps experience, Esther served in various hospitals for nearly 10 \nyears before she retired to raise her children. And she passed her \ncommitment to medical service on to her children--her oldest son \ncurrently works as a paramedic.\n  Cadet Nurses like Esther were an essential part of our military \nforce. They were members of the Public Health Service, one of our \nNation's seven uniformed services. They served under the authority of \ncommissioned officers, wearing patches certified by the Secretary of \nthe Army. And they treated the injuries of troops returning home from \nthe war front. Despite their dedicated service to our Nation, it is \nunfortunate that the Department of Defense has elected to block efforts \nto recognize these women as military veterans.\n  During the existence of the Cadet Nurse Corps, more than 124,000 \nCadet Nurses graduated from 1,125 schools operating nurse training \nprograms around the country. Without the Cadet Nurses, our battlefield \nmedical services, as well as our health care here at home, could not \nhave carried on with the same proficiency. For their tremendous service \nto our nation, I salute the Cadet Nurse Corps, and I ask you to join \nwith me in supporting this resolution honoring their patriotism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/03/senate-section/article/S12473-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1825.

Mr. President, we voted today on the nomination of Prof. \nJack Goldsmith to head the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of \nJustice. I have serious reservations about Professor Goldsmith's \nnomination. In particular, I am concerned about his positions as they \nrelate to the international protection of human rights, the engagement \nof the United States in holding accountable those who commit crimes \nagainst humanity, the administration's use of military tribunals and, \nmore broadly, our Nation's place in the global community.\n  Professor Goldsmith is a leading opponent of the use of the Alien \nTort Claims Act, ATCA. For the past 23 years, judges have interpreted \nthe ATCA to allow victims of torture and abuse to file claims in United \nStates courts against foreign governments, torturers, and multinational \ncorporations. Victims have used the act to bring claims against \nnotorious violators of human rights, such as war criminal Radovan \nKaradzic, the former prime minister of the Philippines, Ferdinand \nMarcos, and the banks and companies that profited from Nazi war crimes. \nProfessor Goldsmith's opposition to the use of ATCA reflects a \ndisturbing shift away from international efforts to hold human rights \nabusers responsible for their inhumane treatment of innocent victims \nthroughout the world.\n  Professor Goldsmith is also a vocal opponent of the International \nCriminal Court, ICC. Over the past few months, the ICC has taken steps \ntoward becoming an effective tool to hold accountable those accused of \nwar crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity. Yet Professor \nGoldsmith has dismissed the Court as ``futile'' and ``unrealistic.'' \nMany believe that the ICC is the best forum to bring the world's worst \ncriminals to justice, but Professor Goldsmith has predicted that it is \nheaded for the grave: I am hopeful that the United States can one day \nplay a key role in ensuring that the ICC effectively carries out its \nhistoric mandate, and I worry that Professor Goldsmith has not \ndemonstrated a commitment to leading the administration in this \nimportant direction.\n  Professor Goldsmith also vigorously defended the President's \nauthority to try suspected terrorists by military tribunal, despite the \nconcerns raised by many Americans and our allies about the legality of \nthese practices. Legitimate questions have been raised about the \nadministration's inconsistency in bringing some cases in federal court \nwhile referring other similar cases to military tribunals, where the \ndefendants' rights are fewer and the procedures less clear. I urge \nProfessor Goldsmith to take a hard look at the administration's recent \ntreatment of prisoners of war: I fear it may have negative implications \nfor the treatment of our own citizens abroad.\n  Professor Goldsmith's positions on ATCA, the ICC, and military \ntribunals reflect a broader, disturbing trend in his thinking, \nscholarship and writings. At a time when the United States should be \nincreasing our engagement in the international community, I am \nconcerned that Professor Goldsmith will advocate for less engagement. \nAt a time when the United States should be increasing our global \ncooperation in areas such as the war on terrorism, the environment, and \ninternational peace and security, I am concerned that Professor \nGoldsmith will advocate for less cooperation. At a time when the United \nStates should be reaffirming\n\n[[Page S12475]]\n\nour commitment to protecting individual liberties, due process rights, \nand access to equal justice, I am concerned that Professor Goldsmith \nlacks a true commitment to these foundations of our democracy.\n  I am also alarmed by the veil of secrecy that has been drawn by \nAttorney General Ashcroft over the operations of the Office of Legal \nCounsel. I encourage Professor Goldsmith to allow the sun to shine into \nthe Office of Legal Counsel by disclosing memoranda and opinions to the \nAmerican public, insofar as such disclosure would not raise legitimate \nnational security concerns.\n  I hope that, within the context of Professor Goldsmith's temporary \nappointment, he will look beyond his academic musings and offer the \nobjective legal advice he promised this Senate he would provide. As he \ndevelops his legal opinions and advises the administration, I hope that \nhe seriously considers the universally accepted international legal \nnorms that have proven essential in protecting the rights of all \nmembers of our global community to freedom, security, and due process \nof law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/03/senate-section/article/S12475-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 66\n\n       Whereas November 22, 2003, marks the 20th anniversary of \n     the establishment of the National Endowment for Democracy \n     (hereinafter the ``Endowment''), a bipartisan nongovernmental \n     institution that promotes democracy around the world;\n       Whereas through the National Endowment for Democracy Act \n     (22 U.S.C. 4411 et seq.), signed into law by President Ronald \n     Reagan on November 22, 1983, Congress has made possible the \n     funding of the Endowment's worldwide grant programs;\n       Whereas 2003 also marks the 20th anniversary of the \n     National Republican Institute for International Affairs \n     (which was subsequently renamed the International Republican \n     Institute (IRI)), the National Democratic Institute for \n     International Affairs (NDI), and the Center for International \n     Private Enterprise (CIPE), all of which joined the Free Trade \n     Union Institute (which was subsequently renamed as the \n     American Center for International Labor Solidarity) to form \n     the four affiliated institutions of the Endowment;\n       Whereas the Endowment and the affiliated institutes have \n     supported grassroots programs to build democratic \n     institutions, spread democratic values, encourage free market \n     institutions, and promote political parties, worker rights, \n     independent media, human rights, the rule of law, civic \n     education, conflict resolution, political participation by \n     women, and many other essential components of civil society \n     and democratic governance in emerging and transitional \n     democracies, nondemocracies, and war-torn societies;\n       Whereas the programs carried out or funded by the Endowment \n     have made significant contributions to the efforts of \n     democratic activists to achieve freedom and self-governance \n     around the world;\n       Whereas the Endowment, through the Journal of Democracy, \n     the International Forum for Democratic Studies, the Reagan-\n     Fascell Democracy Fellows Program, and the World Movement for \n     Democracy, has served as a key center of democratic research, \n     exchange, and networking, bringing together thousands of \n     democracy activists, scholars, and practitioners from around \n     the world; and\n       Whereas the spread of democracy throughout the world, to \n     which the work of the Endowment has contributed \n     significantly, has enhanced the national security interests \n     of the United States and advanced democratic ideals and \n     values throughout the world: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) commends the National Endowment for Democracy for its \n     major contributions to the strengthening of democracy around \n     the world on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the \n     establishment of the Endowment; and\n       (2) endeavors to continue to support the vital work of the \n     National Endowment for Democracy.\n\n                              S.

Res. 231\n\n       Whereas on December 27, 2002, the Republic of Kenya \n     successfully held presidential, parliamentary, and local \n     elections;\n       Whereas the elections were widely praised by objective \n     international observers as free and fair;\n       Whereas the elections signal a major step forward for \n     democracy in Kenya, particularly when compared with other \n     elections held in Kenya since Kenya became an independent \n     state in 1963;\n       Whereas the transition of power started by the elections \n     culminated on December 30, 2002, when former President Daniel \n     Toroitich arap Moi peaceably transferred the Kenyan \n     presidency to President Mwai Kibaki;\n       Whereas the people of Kenya have manifested a strong desire \n     to combat the endemic corruption that has crippled Kenyan \n     society for years; and\n       Whereas the Government of Kenya has responded to this \n     desire with concrete initiatives aimed at fostering \n     transparency and accountability in Kenya: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the people of the Republic of Kenya for \n     conducting free and fair elections;\n       (2) commends the Government of Kenya for the successful \n     completion of a peaceful and orderly transition of power;\n       (3) expresses its desire to see this new democracy in Kenya \n     thrive;\n       (4) acknowledges the suffering inflicted on the people of \n     Kenya as a result of terrorist activity and appreciates the \n     assistance and cooperation of Kenya to the global fight \n     against terrorism;\n       (5) reaffirms the friendship that exists between the people \n     of the United States and the people of Kenya, as 2 nations \n     bound together by the shared values of democracy;\n       (6) applauds the regional peacemaking efforts of Kenya and \n     the contributions of Kenya to international peacekeeping;\n       (7) commends the commitment and concrete steps taken by the \n     Government and people of Kenya--\n       (A) to strengthen democracy, human rights, and the rule of \n     law;\n       (B) to combat corruption, including through the passage by \n     the Kenyan Parliament of the Public Officer Ethics Bill and \n     the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Bill;\n       (C) to improve access to education; and\n       (D) to prevent the transmission of HIV/AIDS;\n       (8) commits to working with the people of Kenya to continue \n     making progress in combating corruption, encouraging \n     development, fighting HIV/AIDS, and fostering respect for the \n     rule of law and a climate of transparency; and\n       (9) welcomes the October 2003 visit of Kenyan President \n     Mwai Kibaki to the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/03/senate-section/article/S12476-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12476-S12477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nEXTENDING THE DURATION OF THE IMMIGRANT INVESTOR REGIONAL CENTER PILOT \n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of S. 1642, and that the Senate \nproceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I urge the Senate to pass S. 1642, a bill \nto extend for 5 years the EB-5 immigrant investor visa regional center \npilot program, which lapsed at the end of the fiscal year on Tuesday. I \nam pleased that Senators Brownback and Daschle have joined me in \nsponsoring this bill. There are more than 25 regions in the Nation that \nhave qualified as a ``regional center'' under this program, including \nin my State of Vermont. This designation allows them to attract foreign \ninvestment by adjusting the standard that investors must meet to obtain \nlegal permanent resident status. The entrepreneurs must still meet a \nheavy burden, however, showing that their investment will create 10 or \nmore jobs in these relatively depressed areas.\n  The pilot program is narrowly tailored to avoid fraud. An area \nseeking regional center status must provide, among other things, \ndetailed information regarding how the center will promote economic \ngrowth through improved regional productivity, job creation, and \nincreased domestic capital investment. The applicant must also provide \na detailed explanation of why the regional center will have a positive \nimpact on the regional or national economy in general.\n  The Judiciary Committee approved the language in this bill \nunanimously, as part of a substitute amendment to S. 1580, the \nReligious Workers Act of 2003. I am pleased to include an amendment \nfrom Senator Feingold that the Judiciary Committee also unanimously \napproved, calling for a GAO study on the EB-5 program as a whole. Such \na study will give us a better idea of how the program is working and \nwhat improvements may be needed.\n  This is an important program for my State and many other regions of \nthe country, and I ask for the support of all Senators in extending it \nfor an additional 5 years.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the Feingold amendment, which \nis at the desk, be considered, agreed to, the bill as amended be read \nthree times and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table \nwith no intervening action or debate, and that any statements related \nto the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 2152, and \nthe Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2152) to amend the immigration and nationality \n     act to extend for an additional 5 years the special immigrant \n     religious worker program.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this House bill is identical to S. 1580, \nthe Religious Workers Act of 2003, of which I am a proud cosponsor. The \nbill extends for 5 years provisions of our immigration law that provide \nfor special immigrant visas for religious workers sponsored by \nreligious organizations in the United States. These visas allow \nreligious denominations or organizations in the United States to bring \nin foreign nationals to perform religious work here. This modest \nprogram--which provides for up to 5,000 religious immigrant visas a \nyear--was created in the Immigration Act of 1990, and has been extended \never since.\n  These religious workers contribute significantly not just to their \nreligious communities, but to the community as a whole. They work in \nhospitals, nursing homes, and homeless shelters. They help immigrants \nand refugees adjust to the United States. In other words, they perform \nvital tasks that all too often go undone.\n  I have worked on this issue over the years, and cosponsored bills in \n1997 and 2000 that would have made this program permanent. I still \nbelieve that it should be permanent but fully support a 5-year \nextension as the next best thing. Time is now of the essence as we have \nentered Fiscal Year 2004 and allowed this program to lapse.\n  The House passed this bill last month by voice vote. I urge the \nSenate to follow suit by approving this extension and sending it to the \nPresident without further delay.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the bill be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 2152) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/03/senate-section/article/S12477-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12477-S12478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ACCOMPLISHMENTS THIS WEEK\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, at this juncture I wish to take a second to \nthank everyone for their assistance throughout this week. It has been a \nbusy week. We have accomplished a great deal. Earlier this week we \nbegan consideration of the Iraq supplemental request. We made good \nprogress on the supplemental request and, as we had discussed, we will \ncomplete action on this request during the first week we return.\n  We also considered this week the DC appropriations bill. Although I \nam disappointed we were unable to finish that bill, we had very \nimportant debate and discussion, much of which centered around the \nopportunity scholarships for impoverished children in the District, \nsupport for public charter schools, as well as additional support for \npublic schools in the District. We were not successful in passing that \nbill.\n  I do want to assure my colleagues that we will be coming back and \naddressing that important issue of opportunity scholarships for \nimpoverished schoolchildren in the District. We have addressed it and \nwe will continue to address it with the leadership of Mayor Anthony \nWilliams as well as other local leaders.\n  Last night, we reached an agreement for final passage on a genetic \nnondiscrimination bill, which I spoke to in detail last night. The vote \non final passage of that bill will occur at 2:30 on October 14. Last \nnight, I commended the tremendous work on both sides of the aisle in \naddressing this legislation, under the leadership in large part of \nSenator Olympia Snowe, someone who has been working on this issue for \nat least 6 years because I know I have been working for at least the \nlast 6 years on that important legislation. We completed debate on it \nlast night. We will vote on it Tuesday, October 14. At that juncture, \nwe will have addressed the issues of civil rights protections and the \nimportance of preventing the use of genetic information in a \ndiscriminatory way. I look forward to that vote on October 14.\n  In addition, this week we passed H.R. 1925, called the Runaway \nHomeless and Missing Children's Protection bill. This is the House \ncompanion bill to Senator Hatch's bill which we passed earlier.\n  In addition, Chairman Shelby helped in securing passage of S. 1680, \nthe Defense Production Act. We are grateful for his efforts as this \nlegislation expired earlier this week.\n  We were also able to pass TANF this week, the Temporary Assistance \nfor Needy Families extension. Senators Grassley and Baucus were \ninstrumental in ensuring this was completed on time.\n  Chairman McCain and the Commerce Committee finished up and the full \nSenate subsequently passed S. 1261, the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission reauthorization.\n  In addition, just a few moments ago, I read S. Con. Res. 66, which \nwas a resolution commending the National Endowment for Democracy for \nits contributions to democratic development around the world. That \nresolution has been introduced and addressed because it is the 20th \nanniversary of the establishment of the National Endowment for \nDemocracy. The sponsor of that resolution was Senator Lugar.\n  I just wanted to mention that because I had the opportunity to sit \nthrough a board meeting and a review of the important programs the \nNational Endowment for Democracy does, the programs reflecting the \ntremendous work in promoting democracy in countries all around the \nworld. I am proud this body has passed this very important resolution \nto commend that organization for the productive and very important work \naround the world.\n  Finally, a short while ago, we were able to confirm, along with seven \njudges from earlier this week, a series of executive nominations. One \nof these nominations was Randall Tobias to be coordinator of U.S. \nGovernment activities to combat HIV/AIDS globally with the rank of \nAmbassador. This particular position, in essence, is the person in \ncharge, the point person for the United States of America, in terms of \nour global efforts to address one of the greatest moral, humanitarian, \nand public health challenges of the last 100\n\n[[Page S12478]]\n\nyears; that is, the global threat of HIV/AIDS, a little virus that we \nin this country knew nothing about just 25 years ago in 1980. It never \nhad been in the United States. It didn't exist as a virus. But since \nthat point in time it has taken the lives of over 40 million people, \nand is likely to take the lives of 10, 20, 30, or 40 more million \npeople. The President of the United States in a bold initiative has \ncommitted $15 billion over 5 years to address the humanitarian \nchallenge--a bold initiative, an unprecedented initiative on a single \ndisease, a single entity. Randall Tobias, now Ambassador Tobias, will \nbe the coordinator for that overall effort.\n  In closing, I thank my colleagues for cooperation during this work \nperiod. I encourage all to rest. Most are going back to their home \nStates to be with constituents. I encourage them also to rest their \nbatteries because we will return for a very busy final few weeks of \nthis first session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/03/senate-section/article/S12478-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, OCTOBER 14, 2003\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
