Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 1805, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1805) to prohibit civil liability actions from \n     being brought or continuing against manufacturers, \n     distributors, dealers, or importers of firearms or ammunition \n     for damages resulting from the misuse of their products by \n     others.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Hatch (for Campbell) amendment No. 2623, to amend title 18, \n     United States Code, to exempt qualified current and former \n     law enforcement officers from State laws prohibiting the \n     carrying of concealed handguns.\n       Kennedy amendment No. 2619, to expand the definition of \n     armor piercing ammunition and to require the Attorney General \n     to promulgate standards for the uniform testing of \n     projectiles against body armor.\n       Craig (for Frist/Craig) amendment No. 2625, to regulate the \n     sale and possession of armor piercing ammunition.\n       Levin amendment No. 2631, to exempt any civil action \n     against a person from the provisions of the bill if the gross \n     negligence or reckless conduct of the person proximately \n     caused death or injury.\n       Warner amendment No. 2624, to improve patient access to \n     health care services and provide improved medical care by \n     reducing the excessive burden the liability system places on \n     the health care delivery system.\n       Lautenberg amendment No. 2632, to require that certain \n     notifications occur whenever a query to the National Instant \n     Criminal Background Check System reveals that a person listed \n     in the Violent Gang and Terrorist Organization File is \n     attempting to purchase a firearm.\n       Lautenberg amendment No. 2633, to exempt lawsuits involving \n     injuries to children from the definition of qualified civil \n     liability action.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today, the Senate will resume consideration \nof S. 1805, the gun liability bill. The unanimous consent agreement \nfrom Friday provides for approximately 4 hours of debate in relation to \ntwo proposed amendments that will be voted on tomorrow. The debate \ntoday will center around the gun show loophole amendment and the \nassault weapons ban amendment.\n  I will manage time on our side during this period, so Senators are \nwelcome to come to the floor to speak.\n  Following the debate, at 4 p.m. today, Senator Bingaman will offer \nhis amendment relating to definition. Under the order, that debate will \ngo until 5 o'clock, at which time we will vote in relation to the \nBingaman amendment. Therefore, the first vote of today's session will \noccur at 5 o'clock.\n  The consent agreement governing the remaining consideration of the \ngun manufacturers' liability bill allows for further debate tomorrow \nmorning prior to a series of stacked votes on a number of amendments. \nThere will be as many as seven stacked votes, including final passage, \nin that series of votes, which will begin at 11:35 a.m. on Tuesday.\n  Members can therefore expect final passage of S. 1805 tomorrow \nafternoon.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Senator Feinstein will be managing the \nfirst hour of the debate today on assault weapons; and Senator Jack \nReed from Rhode Island will be the manager of the second hour relating \nto gun show loopholes.\n  Let me wish my colleagues a good afternoon.\n\n\n                    The Budget For Veterans Affairs\n\n  Mr. President, I want to talk, on my leader time, about an issue that \nwill be the subject of a good deal of attention next week; and that is \nthe budget, especially as it relates to our veterans.\n  The budget this year has many reasons for concern for all of us. I \nwill address many of those concerns at a later time. But I want to \nfocus, this afternoon, if I can, on just one; that is, the budget for \nVeterans Affairs.\n  The legislation before the Budget Committee would increase the \nVeterans Affairs budget by about 2 percent. Unfortunately, that \nrepresents about a $700 million increase in health care for veterans \ngoing from approximately $28.5 billion to $29.2 billion--a $700 million \nincrease for veterans health.\n\n[[Page S1902]]\n\n  What is disturbing to me about that number is what one finds when you \nlook at what it means a little more closely. What it means is that, for \nthe first time, veterans themselves will be required to pay fees in \nexcess of $1 billion for health care that they were promised. People \nprobably cannot fully appreciate what that means--a billion-dollar fee \nrequirement from veterans themselves for the first time. We have never, \nin all of history, had a requirement that veterans pay at this level--\n$1 billion--for health care.\n  For now, categories 7 and 8 will be charged $250 a year before they \ncan walk in the door the first time. Their fees--which have been $7, \nand were $2 just a couple years ago--for prescription drugs now go up \nto $15. Their per-office doctor visits go from $15 to $20.\n\n  So for the first time, veterans, in many cases, will be denied care, \nnot because they do not need it but because they cannot afford it.\n  When I was home over the last week or so, it was troubling to me how \nmany veterans said: Senator Daschle, $250 may not seem like a lot to \nyou, but there is no way I can pay $250. I just won't get care; or: I \nwill try to find care at some clinic where it's free.\n  It is so troubling to me that I would be hearing that from veterans \nwho gave so much to their country, at a time when we are counting on \nour soldiers to do so much for us in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and now in \nHaiti. Time after time, we send our soldiers into harm's way. They come \nback now, having felt the brunt of that war, and we tell them we just \ncan't afford to give them the care they need.\n  This is only one of the issues that will be debated during the \nveterans budget. But I hope all of us--Republicans and Democrats \nalike--will be very careful before we commit to this new fee structure.\n  Some of us have argued for a long time that it is now time for us to \npass what we call mandatory funding--to treat veterans health the way \nwe treat Medicare, the way we treat Social Security--to recognize that \nwe have an obligation, and it ought to be met.\n  Mandatory funding is a bill that has been offered to authorize this \nnew status in health care delivery, and I hope that our colleagues \nwould consider it very carefully.\n  What is all the more troubling is that there is also a provision in \nour veterans health care system that is very ironic, it seems to me, in \nso many ways. We actually require a veteran, after he has gone to a \nprivate physician and has been prescribed prescription medicine, to go \nto a VA doctor to have it verified. Sometimes the VA doctor requires \nadditional physicals. But this duplicative process, this requirement \nfor yet another VA physician review now costs the Veterans' \nAdministration a billion dollars. So the irony is that now that we are \nasking veterans to pay for fees they cannot afford--now in excess of a \nbillion dollars--we are actually spending a billion dollars we would \nnot have to spend if we simply said we are going to trust the decisions \nmade by those physicians in the first place. We tested it with 8,000 \nveterans over the last couple years, and we found there was absolutely \nno problem associated with having this requirement that a VA doctor be \nconsulted eliminated. We could save a billion dollars.\n  I argue that billion dollars ought to come out of the fees required \nof our veterans. That alone would reduce some of the anxiety and \nextraordinary frustration so many of our veterans now experience. This, \ntoo, is a veterans budget matter that I hope we can address both in the \nBudget Committee, as well as on the floor of the Senate in the coming \ndays as we debate the veterans budget.\n  There are two other issues of budget connection and budget relevance \nthat I think we ought to address. The next is the concurrent receipt \nproblem. It is still remarkable to me in this day and age that we \ndeduct disability compensation from retirement income for veterans. \nThose who gave the most are now required to pay the biggest financial \nsacrifice. For the life of me, I cannot understand why. We are told we \ncannot afford it, but those men and women could not afford to give up \ntheir jobs, sometimes their good health, to go into war either.\n  Where there is a will, there is a way. We ought to be cognizant of \nthe incredible disparity and extraordinary unfairness for every \ndisabled American veteran today by this practice of deducting \ndisability pay from retirement. Over the last couple of years, we have \nactually ultimately passed compromise legislation that would allow \nveterans who are at least 50-percent disabled from beginning to receive \ntheir full compensation for both disability and retirement. But it will \nbe phased in over the next 10 years. A lot of veterans in South Dakota \ntold me they will be gone before this legislation is fully phased in. \nSo I hope we can also look at concurrent receipt.\n  Let's eliminate the disability tax. Let's recognize that we owe these \ndisabled veterans more than just lipservice. Let's recognize in this \nday and age, especially now as some are even required to pay fees, that \nthis disparity, this unfairness, this embarrassment in our Veterans' \nAdministration health delivery and compensation system has to be \naddressed.\n  Finally, while the President pro tempore has been as sensitive to \nthis issue as anybody in the Chamber, we still have a long way to go in \nproviding TRICARE to all members of the Guard and Reserve. I was \nreminded, as I talked to another guardsman who has been permanently \ninjured as a result of wounds incurred in Iraq, he has no health \ninsurance. I worry about all of those veterans who come home, about the \nprospect of losing their health insurance not only for themselves but \nfor their families. In this day and age, with the extraordinary role \nnow played by the National Guard and the Reserve, we can't accept a \ndouble standard with regard to the way health care is provided. If we \nare forcing these young men and women into battle, if we are forcing \nthem to endure the pain, suffering, anxiety, the loss of life and limb, \nwe ought to at the very least provide them with the health insurance \nthey have earned and they deserve.\n\n  So we will be offering legislation once again to provide full funding \nfor TRICARE health insurance for members of the Guard and Reserve. It \nis my hope that on a bipartisan basis, as we have done now on several \noccasions, we can pass it, enact it into law, and send a clear message \nthat that double standard, too, will end in this Congress.\n  Mr. President, there are a lot of issues relating to veterans that I \nhope will be provided the time, attention, and priority they deserve. \nWe will have the first opportunity during the budget debate next week. \nI look forward to that debate and to the consideration of amendments to \naddress many of these concerns. I am hopeful that on a bipartisan basis \nwe can address them successfully.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there will be 4 \nhours of debate, with 1 hour of the time controlled by the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain or his designee; 1 hour under the control of the \nSenator from California or her designee; 2 hours under the control of \nthe Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig, or his designee.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if anybody wants to use part of their time, \nthey have to get permission from Senator Feinstein. She is here to use \nher hour. Senator Reed will be the designee for Senator McCain. We have \nthe offer of the amendment by Senator Bingaman for an hour, and then we \nwill vote.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and \nSenators Warner, Schumer, DeWine, Levin, Chafee, Dodd, Jeffords, Boxer, \nand Clinton, and also Senators Reid and Lautenberg, to offer an \namendment which is identical to S. 2109, introduced early last week. \nThis amendment will simply reauthorize the 1994 assault weapons ban. It \nis a straight reauthorization. There is nothing added to it.\n  The present legislation sunsets on September 13 of this year. As you \nand others know, the President has said he will sign a straight \nreauthorization. This is it.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Warner, who I hope will be \nhere shortly to speak for himself. I very much appreciate his \ncosponsorship of this legislation. When the legislation came before \nthis Senate 10 years ago, Senator Warner didn't support it. Therefore, \nhis reconsideration of that\n\n[[Page S1903]]\n\nposition is all important. I won't give reasons for it. I believe that \nis up to him. I believe both he and Senators DeWine and Schumer will be \nutilizing the hour of our time.\n  I ask that the Chair inform me when 15 minutes of the hour has \npassed, if I might.\n  The issue of assault weapons is near and dear to my heart. It is not \nabout politics or polls or interest groups. In my view, it is about \nreal people and real lives. It is about the ability of working men and \nwomen and children to be safe from disgruntled employees or schoolmates \nwho show up one day at a law firm or school or a place of business and \nfire away until the room becomes filled with dead and wounded \ncolleagues.\n  Unfortunately, in this society, we are always going to have some \npeople who are prone to grievance killing.\n  It is my belief the assault weapon, the military-style semiautomatic \nassault weapon, has become the weapon of choice for grievance killers.\n  It is about the ability of children to learn, play, and grow without \nthe fear that someone such as Dylan Klebold or Eric Harris would show \nup at Columbine High School with assault weapons and fire until the \nschool is literally littered with bodies--a dozen students and a \nteacher murdered, more than two dozen others injured.\n  It is about making sure our law enforcement officers can safely go \nabout their duties and return home to their families at the end of the \nday, instead of finding themselves confronted, such as Officer James \nGuelff found himself in 1994, with assailants wearing body armor and \nfiring from an arsenal of 2,000 rounds of ammunition and a cache of \nassault weapons.\n  The officer was gunned down after 10 years of service, and it took \n150 police officers to equal the firepower of a gunman clad in Kevlar \ncarrying assault weapons.\n  I first raised this issue in 1993, when I was a new Senator. I was \ndetermined to try to pass the assault weapons legislation as an \namendment to the crime bill. Members told me: Forget it; the gun owners \naround here have too much authority. We would never be able to enact \nassault weapons legislation. I was told the NRA was simply too strong. \nSenator Biden, then-chair of the Judiciary Committee, said it would be \na good learning experience for me, and, in fact, it was.\n  It was the will of the American people, it turns out, that was \nstronger than any lobbying organization, even the National Rifle \nAssociation. And today, 77 percent of the American people and 66 \npercent of gun owners believe this legislation should be reauthorized.\n\n  We got the bill passed, and America has been safer for it. In fact, \nthe percentage of assault weapons used in crimes since this bill has \npassed has diminished by two-thirds. That is the fact. Assault weapons \ntraced to crimes since the passage of this legislation have diminished \nby two-thirds. That is the good news.\n  It is interesting, the NRA says: Oh, the ban doesn't work; it is just \ncosmetic; forget it. But the ban does work, and it was carefully put \ntogether. No gun owners have lost their weapon because of this \nlegislation. No gun anywhere in America has been confiscated from a \nlegal owner because of this ban. The sky did not fall. Life went on, \nbut it went on with fewer grievance killings, fewer juveniles using \nthem, fewer driveby shooters having access to the most dangerous of \nfirearms.\n  I want to talk about just a few of the guns we banned. The bill \nbanned 19 specific assault weapons and then set up a physical \ncharacteristics test which, frankly, if given my way, I would toughen \nnow. We have had more experience. We know gun manufacturers get around \nit. California has toughened the test and, basically, I would like to \nemulate that legislation. Clearly, the votes are not in this Chamber \nfor it; certainly not in the other Chamber, and we probably would not \nbe able to gain a Presidential signature. I probably used too \noptimistic a word by using ``probably.'' Let me say we would not be \nable to gain a Presidential signature.\n  Let me speak for a moment about perhaps the most notorious assault \nweapon, the AK-47. This gun, developed in the former Soviet Union, is \none of the most widely used military weapons in the world. It is not \nused to hunt, at least not to hunt animals. It is not well designed for \nhome defense. Its ammunition can easily pierce walls and kill innocent \nbystanders. I will tell you what it is good for: the rapid killing of \nother people. How well I remember when an unstable drifter by the name \nof Patrick Purdy, with an assault weapon modeled after the AK-47, \nwalked into a Stockton schoolyard in northern California. He lay on his \nbelly, and he fired indiscriminately into the schoolyard. He fired 106 \nrounds of ammunition. By the time he was done, 5 children were dead and \n29 were injured--five children dead because a of drifter who could gain \none of the most powerful military weapons and use it against children.\n  Each of these children had families. They had futures. One might have \nbeen a doctor one day, another a teacher, maybe even one a Senator, but \nthey never got that chance. Their families did not see them grow up.\n  Then there is the Uzi. The Uzi was designed for Israeli paratroopers \nin the 1950s. Again, this is not a weapon designed for hunting or self-\ndefense. This is a weapon of war. It can spray fire rapidly and with \nsome accuracy and is used for raids, firefights, and, to put it simply, \nthe killing of enemy soldiers in close combat.\n  An easily concealed weapon of war that sprays fire can also be used \nagainst civilians, and so it was when James Huberty walked into a \nMcDonald's in San Ysidro, CA. He was able to kill 21 people and wound \n15 others. The McDonald's customers were simply in the wrong place at \nthe wrong time. Had Huberty carried a revolver, who knows how many \nlives would have been saved. But with an Uzi, there is no ability to \nescape. With a big clip and a light trigger, nobody can get to you to \ndisarm you before you have emptied the clip. The spray fire begins and \nthe tragedy looms large. Again, a weapon of war falls into the hands of \na grievance killer.\n\n  The TEC-9. For me, these incidents really came to a head on July 1, \n1993, when a man by the name of Gian Luigi Ferri walked into 101 \nCalifornia Street carrying two high-capacity TEC-DC9 assault pistols.\n  Let me show you what he looked like. He is dead in this picture. Look \nat this clip on this assault pistol. Look at the additional clips he \nwas carrying in the bag. And look at the weapon in his hand.\n  Ferri's gun--well, his guns--actually had special spring-loaded \nhellfire switches that allowed them to be fired, for all practical \npurposes, as fast as a machine gun. As a result, it did not take long \nfor him to accomplish his task. Within minutes, he murdered eight \npeople and six others were wounded.\n  I just looked at a shot of a lovely blond woman on the floor in her \noffice with three shots in her back and one in her shoulder. I have \nspoken to the survivors and families of these victims over the years, \nand I can tell you it is just plain heartbreaking.\n  One such survivor was Michelle Scully. I will paraphrase what \nhappened to her that day. Michelle and her husband John Scully--he was \na lawyer in the firm--sought refuge in the nearest room, but the door \ndid not have a lock. Michelle and John tried to block the door with a \nfile cabinet, but they could not move it. Finally, he spread his 6-\nfoot-4 body over his wife as a shield as the gunman wordlessly opened \nthe door and fired this gun over and over again.\n  John was hit six times. His wife once. ``Michelle, I'm sorry,'' John \nScully said a few minutes later, ``I am dying.''\n  No one should have to go through this. No one should have to read \nabout it in a newspaper. Nobody goes to work in the morning or says \ngoodbye to their spouse expecting something like what happened at 101 \nCalifornia Street.\n  These were not soldiers or law enforcement officers. These were \npeople doing everyday jobs in an everyday place. Because a person who \nhad a bone to pick also had two assault pistols, eight lives were ended \nbefore the day was done.\n  Now, my colleagues can tell me guns do not kill people, that people \nkill people. Of course, I have to agree with that, but when there is a \nnut or a man so inflamed that he is going to go out and exact vengeance \nand a weapon of war designed to kill large numbers in close combat is \nmade available to him,\n\n[[Page S1904]]\n\nwhen our Government enables this to happen, we fall down on the job \nbecause we are here to see that there are laws that protect people.\n  In 1994, a man used a TEC-9 to kill three people in the Washington, \nDC, police headquarters. Those killed were two FBI agents and a veteran \npolice sergeant. The shooter walked into the crowded building with a \nconcealed weapon, one of the key factors in how dangerous these weapons \ncan be because they either have collapsable shoulder mounts or they are \neasily concealed. He then proceeded unimpeded directly into a homicide \nsquad office and began firing. This is what the TEC-9 can do. Again, we \ndo not hear stories of TEC-9s being used to hunt deer. We do hear about \ntragedy after tragedy.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator has utilized 15 \nminutes of her time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. I appreciate that.\n  In 1999, even after the assault weapons ban had been law for almost 5 \nyears, Dylan Klebold fired 55 shots from a TEC-DC9 at Columbine. The \nTEC-DC9, a gun manufactured before the ban took effect and thus \ngrandfathered and legal, was obtained from a gun show and then used to \nkill his fellow students.\n  It is my hope that over time and the way the bill is structured, the \navailability of these guns will dry up because what the legislation \ndoes is prohibit the manufacture and the sale of these weapons, not the \npossession. When they do dry up, the Dylan Klebolds of the world can no \nlonger have access to them.\n  The supply of these guns is not going to dry up, however, if the \nassault weapons ban sunsets in September. We would be giving Intratec \nand other such companies a renewed license to manufacture these \nmilitary guns and market them elsewhere across the Nation.\n  We specifically exempted 670 rifles and shotguns from the legislation \nso anybody who said, oh, my gun is going to be taken, could be \nreassured and we could show them we did not, in fact, take their gun.\n  Although it may be difficult to read, this is the listing of the \nhunting guns and other recreational weapons protected in the \nlegislation. It goes on and on. The Weatherby Mark V Sport Rifle, the \nSavage Model 111BC heavy barrel varmint rifle, and all centerfire \nrifles that are single shot, drillings, combination guns; shotguns-auto \nloaders; shotguns-slide actions; shotguns-over/unders; centerfire \nrifles-auto loaders; centerfire rifles-lever and slide; centerfire \nrifles-bolt action; shotguns-side by sides, shotguns-bolt actions and \nsingle shots. Total, 670 hunting weapons.\n  The reason I did this is I approached some Members of the Senate and \nsaid, what do they need to support legislation? And they said they \nneeded assurance that hunting weapons are not covered. We provided that \nassurance. That assurance has worked and no one has lost a single \nweapon on this list.\n  The list includes every conceivable weapon: shotgun, rifle, et \ncetera. It is designed to protect the ability of innocent gunowners to \nkeep their hunting weapons and to keep their guns for self-defense. The \nlist of protected guns and the 9 years of accounting of history behind \nthe ban show that the National Rifle Association's hysterical claims of \ngun confiscation are simply not true.\n  I will speak about support for this legislation. As my colleagues can \nsee from the list behind me, countless organizations, civic and law \nenforcement, are asking that this assault weapons legislation be \nreauthorized. At the top of the list we have the largest law \nenforcement organization in the Nation, the Fraternal Order of Police. \nWe have the National League of Cities, the United States Conference of \nMayors, National Association of Counties, the International Association \nof Chiefs of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, \nthe International Brotherhood of Police Officers, the United States \nConference of Catholic Bishops, the National Education Association the \nNAACP, and the list goes on.\n  By latest poll, more than three-fourths of the American people, even \ntwo-thirds of gunowners, support reauthorizing the assault weapons \nlegislation. So the will of the people could not be more clear. The \nAmerican people know that these guns should not, once again, be \nmanufactured and imported into the United States.\n  We saw in the Columbine shooting, the Long Island Railroad shooting, \nand so many others that high-capacity assault weapons can make those \nwho wield them temporarily invincible because it is so difficult to get \nclose to them to disarm them. So the fate of this bill is in this \nSenate.\n  In April of last year Presidential White House spokesman Scott \nMcClellan said of the assault weapons legislation:\n\n       The President supports the current law, and he supports \n     reauthorization of the current law.\n\n  That is what we are doing with this legislation, reauthorizing the \ncurrent law, period.\n  Now, I realize the President has expressed concern about amendments \nto the gun immunity bill that might delay its passage beyond this year, \nbut the assault weapons legislation expires in less than 7 months and \nwe cannot delay this bill beyond this year, either. I am hopeful that \nas people look back and they look at this terrible litany of events all \nacross this Nation, in schoolyards, in businesses, in factories, in \nprint shops, in law offices, wherever people congregate, they recognize \nthat it is prudent to keep assault weapons off the streets of our \nAmerican cities.\n  As gangs move guns across State lines, they move assault weapons. So \nthe ability to dry up this supply over time, the ability to prohibit \ntheir manufacture and their sale is what this legislation does.\n  It has always puzzled me because the NRA says it is only cosmetic, it \ndoes not work, and I wonder, if it is only cosmetic why do they get so \nexercised about it? But it does work, because assault weapon gun traces \nto crimes have declined by two-thirds since this bill has passed. That \nis the proof. It has had an effect. That is why the NRA is calling \noffices today. That is why the NRA is asking Members not to vote for \nthis: Because it has worked.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of our time. I yield the floor. Mr. \nPresident, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent the time that is running be \nequally divided between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The first hour, of course, is allocated to the debate over \nthe semiauto ban, so your request is against the semiauto ban and the \ntotal?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Just this one.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I object to that until I better understand it. I want to \nallocate my 2 hours reserved in the UC for this afternoon. Could the \nSenator explain?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. There is a reason for it. We were told this would be \nlater, at 3 o'clock, and then learned it would be 1 o'clock, and then \nit was noon. I was here so I could come down. Senator Warner, I \nbelieve, has not yet arrived, and would like to speak, as would Senator \nDeWine and Senator Schumer. It is a Monday. The time has essentially \nchanged. So I would like to leave them time to be able to speak.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, might I ask we go into a quorum, only for \nthe purpose of discussing this and better understanding it?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have no objection.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is able to do that. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, before the Senator from Florida speaks--and \nneither the Senator from California nor I,\n\n[[Page S1905]]\n\nwho control time at this moment, object to that; it is my understanding \nhe wants to speak on the crisis in Haiti--what I would like to consider \nis that we reconsider the unanimous consent from the Senator from \nCalifornia as it relates to time. Apparently there has been a \nmisunderstanding on the part of some Senators, or their staff failed to \ninform them as to the time schedule that was agreed upon in the \nunanimous consent that was established to operate today.\n  What is critical is a 5 o'clock vote on the Bingaman amendment and \nallocating necessary time for the Senators to speak to that prior to \nthat vote, and for me to respond.\n  I ask unanimous consent that time that is being used now, or that may \nnot be used in quorum call, be taken equally from all sides and that \nthat time be extended after the vote, at 5 o'clock, for those who were \nnot given the opportunity to speak on the assault weapons ban or the \nsemiauto ban who are missing it at this time, so we can keep the Senate \nrunning.\n\n  Mr. President, I will withhold that UC for a while. There is another \nSenator who has an amendment that is in position at this time who would \nhave to concur. Why don't I withdraw my UC and yield the floor to the \nSenator from Florida for speaking on Haiti as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Florida?\n  Mr. CRAIG. He would speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. With the time now charged against anyone?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Time charged on all sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Time charged on all sides?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The distinguished Senator from Florida is recognized.\n\n\n                                 Haiti\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, moment by moment things are \nunfolding down in the poverty-wracked, AIDS-infected, politically \nunstable island nation of Haiti. I have had quite a bit of commentary \non this subject since I had sent a letter of February 10 to the \nPresident suggesting what should be done. Given the events that have \nunfolded over the weekend--the fact that Aristide has fled, the fact \nthat the U.S. military is located there as a first wave of an \ninternational security force to try to establish order--I want to talk \nabout the future of that island nation.\n  Clearly, it is a nation that has been troubled for stability, \npolitical and economic. I think what is in the interests of Haiti, as \nwell as the interests of the United States, is to stabilize that \nnation. It is a nation that has not been comfortable because of the \nscores of coups d'etat that have occurred over the 200-year history of \nthat little country. It is a country where we only need to look 10 \nyears back to see that.\n  When Aristide was elected President, a coup went in, removed him from \npower, and it took the U.S. military to come back in to put him back \ninto power. The problem is that we didn't stay for the long haul. We \ndidn't help Haiti pull itself up by its economic bootstraps. We didn't \ncontinue to help them understand if they had no history of democratic \ninstitutions that functioned well--to help them continue to improve \ntheir institutions so it would foster free and fair elections and \npeople would respect the rule of law.\n\n  That is why we are at this place. That is why I have taken this \noccasion to come and talk to my colleagues about what ought to happen \nin the future in Haiti.\n  First, the Haitian people are an industrious people, and they are a \nproud people.\n  I visited the city slum called Cite Soleil in the capital city of \nPort-au-Prince amidst enormous poverty and the most meager of material \npossessions. There is a huge drainage ditch running through this \nsection of Port-au-Prince. It is an open garbage sewer. Yet as I walked \ninto those little homes which many times only had a piece of corrugated \ntin across the top not even sealing the roof, I found those little \nhomes so neatly kept with such pride. I found in the middle of that \nslum a little area no larger than half the size of a basketball court \nneatly swept and used as a soccer field. I found there were lots of \nAmericans there trying to assist with education.\n  One of our colleagues from this body, Senator DeWine of Ohio, has \nbeen to Haiti some 12 or 13 times. He contributes from his own pocket \neach year to some of the missions there and a Catholic priest who has a \nschool--not only for the children but a school afterhours for the \nparents to come and learn what their children are learning so they will \nbe in a position of encouraging their own children to have a chance to \nescape poverty by opening up their minds through education.\n  I saw an extraordinary medical clinic, much of which is assisted by \nthe United States, in the midst of all of that poverty and disease--\nindeed AIDS as well. This medical clinic was like a beacon of light in \nthe midst of darkness. It was well respected--even by the hooligans who \nare there. They respect that medical clinic as well.\n  Our delegation talked to a Dr. Pap who has had tremendous success in \nbringing under control the surging numbers of AIDS infections. But when \nyou start with a huge percentage of the population already infected \nwith AIDS--indeed the highest degree of infection in the Western \nHemisphere--then you have to start from a base that is already out of \ncontrol.\n  I saw industries that were once thriving suddenly, because those \nprivate enterprises could not get loans--by the way, what bank was to \ngive loans to an area where it was so wracked with political and \neconomic chaos? I saw the fact that our Government had basically not \ngone to bat for Haiti on international loans from the development \nbanks; and that we were insisting that Haiti pay off arrears before it \nwould get another loan. How was Haiti going to pay off any arrears? As \na result, there were not the loans coming in to build the roads or, \nmore importantly, to improve the existing roads and just to maintain \nthem.\n  As I went 50 miles north from Port-au-Prince on a road that only had \na hard surface for 16 or maybe 17 miles, then there was nothing but \npotholes, and all the commerce running north and south in the island \nwas attempting to go on that road.\n  What can we learn about what to do for the future of Haiti? It is \nvery clear to me. The United States had better be involved. We had \nbetter not have a hands-off policy as we have had over the course of \nthe past 5 or 6 years. We had better be involved, because it not only \naffects Haitians but it affects the United States. Let me tell you how.\n\n  In the midst of the Western Hemisphere with a country to be as \npoverty stricken as Haiti is, it is going to be ripe for insurrection \nand tumult. What happens when there is insurrection and tumult? It is \nripe to attract the drug trade--which it already has in big-time \nnumbers--and it is ripe to attract terrorists.\n  When we start talking about what is in the interest of the United \nStates, it had better be one conclusion: to help Haiti in the future. \nIf there is hopelessness and despair with no way out and no jobs, what \nis going to happen? There is going to be a mass exodus from that island \nnation just as there was in the beginning of all of this political \nstrife that occurred over the past few weeks.\n  The Coast Guard has picked up over 700 people at sea. What is in the \ninterest of the United States? The Coast Guard doesn't have to do that. \nBut if people start fleeing in such huge numbers that they start \noverwhelming the coast of Florida, what does that do to our social \nsystem in Florida? What does that do to Immigration and Customs? What \ndoes that do in our ability to protect the homeland by securing our \nborders?\n  Need I remind you that in a mass migration to the United States, is \nthere not the opportunity for terrorists to slip into the country under \nthe cover of that mass migration, not even to speak of the drug trade \nthat would be entering our country?\n  I appreciate the time in the midst of this gun debate. I thank the \ntwo Senators who are leading this debate for allowing me to come and \npour out my heart. I am not looking to the past now. The past is past. \nLet us go forward. It is clearly in the interest of the United States \nand it is clearly in the interest of the Haitian people for the\n\n[[Page S1906]]\n\nUnited States to take the lead economically and politically; for \ninstitutions to help them understand and develop. That should be an \ninternational effort outside of the Western Hemisphere.\n  France has an interest and has already offered to help. We should \nwork with all of the nations of the world that want to help this little \npoverty stricken nation. Then we will be doing what we should. We will \nbe leading by an example--that what we preach, in fact, we are doing \nwith our daily acts.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Who yields time? The distinguished \nSenator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we will not propound a unanimous consent \nrequest because time is burning on the clock equally. The unanimous \nconsent agreement that brought us here this morning largely allocated 4 \nhours of time between 1 and 4 p.m. to debate both the assault weapons \nban and the gun show loophole argument.\n  At 4 o'clock, Senator Bingaman will be here to offer his amendment \nand that will be debated. We will vote at 5 p.m. Following that, the \nLevin amendment will be debated. Of course, we can debate into the \nevening on either of those two issues, if Senators so wish. Feeling \nthey may not have gained time this afternoon to do so, there is no \nrestriction in that.\n  For a few moments let me discuss the issue that is at hand, the \neffort to reinstate the assault weapons ban. In September of this year \nthe law expires, so there is urgency on the part of those who believe \nit was an effective law to get it reinstated. I will argue in the next \nfew moments it has made no difference and that statistics do \ndemonstrate certain things, but statistics have to be placed in the \nright context of understanding how they were gained to show the \nineffectiveness of this law and the ineffectiveness of the ban itself.\n  Semiautos are not the weapon of choice in the commission of nearly \nall the crimes in this country.\n  What is important is to understand where we are with S. 1805, the \nunderlying bill and the ability to keep that bill as clean as possible \nso that it can get to the President's desk. The semiauto ban, the gun \nshow loophole, and a variety of other issues could simply drag this \nbill down and deny substantial tort reform in an area that is narrow, \nthat is specific, that is clean, that says to the American people: Yes, \nwe are becoming responsible in denying the kinds of junk lawsuits that \nsome push through the courts to legislate a public policy that they \ncannot effectively gain by bringing it to the Congress of the United \nStates.\n  That is why the administration has been clear in its statement of \nadministrative policy. On S. 1805, the administration strongly supports \nthe passage of this legislation. The administration urges the Senate to \npass a clean bill in order to ensure enactment of the legislation this \nyear. Any amendment that would delay enactment of the bill beyond this \nyear, in their opinion, is unacceptable. For myself, being the author \nof the amendment, I clearly agree with that.\n  The manufacturers or sellers of a legal, nondefective product should \nnot be held liable for the criminal or unlawful misuse of that product \nby others.\n  This is a continuation of the statement of administrative policy: The \npossibility of imposing liability on an entire industry for harm that \nis solely caused by others is an abuse of the legal system, erodes \npublic confidence in our Nation's laws, threatens the diminution of a \nbasic constitutional right and civil liberty, sets a poor precedent for \nother lawful industries, will cause a loss of jobs and burden \ninterstate and foreign commerce. S. 1805 would help curb frivolous \nlitigation against a lawful American industry and the thousands of \nworkers it employs and would help prevent abuse of the legal system.\n  At the same time, the legislation would carefully preserve the rights \nof individuals to have their day in court with civil liability actions. \nThese civil actions are enumerated in the bill and respect the \ntraditional role of the States in our Federal system with regard to \nsuch actions.\n  That is the statement from the administration as it relates to this \nlegislation. It is important because they are asking for a clean bill.\n  Listeners will hear me say time and time again over the course of \ntoday and tomorrow as we move to the vote on these amendments that are \nbeing debated today: Let's keep this bill clean. The legislative year \nis short. We have a bill that is supported now by a 2-to-1 vote margin \nin the Senate. This bill will pass this Senate by a fair margin. That \nexpresses a bipartisan will of this Congress to get this bill to our \nPresident under the same context as the statement of administrative \npolicy so spoke.\n\n  Let's talk about the amendment at hand at this moment, the assault \nweapon or semiauto ban. I prefer to call it a semiauto ban, and during \nthe course of the next few minutes you will see why. The word, \n``assault,'' is by itself an image-getter. It is a cosmetic word that \ndefines for some a certain type of firearm, at the same time sometimes \nas a weapon, obviously sometimes as a collector's piece. What more \nclearly identifies the issue at hand is the mechanism of the gun \nitself, the firearm itself. For the next few moments I will speak to \nthat.\n  At the time this law was first enacted, most in Congress were very \nskeptical it would work. That is why there was a sunset provision \nincluded in the law. OK, if the law is able to accomplish this, let's \nsee if, in fact, it can accomplish that. Let's make sure that Congress \nhas an opportunity to revisit it, as we do quite often with laws we are \nnot sure of, and therefore a sunset provision. The year is at hand, the \nsunset provision is such that this bill will expire. The results are \nin. These firearms are not, nor have they been generally--and I use the \nword ``generally''--used in crime. The restrictions imposed by this law \nmake no sense and only create a burden on law-abiding citizens and \nbusinesses.\n  It is my opinion we ought to let it expire. Again, it is another one \nof the bureaucratic hurdles we love to put in front of the law-abiding \ncitizens of this country, knowing full well that the criminal on the \nground does not play by the rules, and that in a civil society is the \nlaw. My arguments of the next few moments will show just that.\n  There continues to be a tremendous amount of misinformation about the \nfirearms banned by this law and what the ban has accomplished, so let \nme go through some of the facts. Semiautomatic firearms were first \nintroduced more than a century ago. The first semiautomatic rifle was \nintroduced in 1885, the first small pistol in 1890. The first \nsemiautomatic gun, the Browning automatic 5, was patented in 1900. \nTheodore Roosevelt, our United States President from 1901 through 1990, \nhunted with a semiauto shutgun.\n  Today, Americans own approximately 30 million semiautomatic rifles, \npistols, and shotguns across the landscape of this great Nation, \napproximately 15 percent of privately owned firearms in the United \nStates. About 15 percent of all firearms owned in the United States \nmeet the definition of semiauto. What are they doing with these \nfirearms? Semiauto rifles, including many defined as assault weapons--\nagain, a definition of a term based on how a given weapon appears by \nthe 1994 Federal gun ban--are used for formal marksmanship, \ncompetition, recreational target shooting, and hunting. Semiauto \nshotguns are very widely used for hunting, as well as skeet, trap and \nsporting clay shooting.\n  Many of us enjoy that sport and engage in it. Semiautomatic handguns \nare used in formal marksmanship competition, as well as for \nrecreational shooting and hunting. Many semiautomatic firearms, \nincluding some affected by the Federal assault weapon law, are highly \nvalued by gun collectors. They are also commonly kept and used, as \nwitnesses testified during the hearings before the House of \nRepresentatives Subcommittee on Crime in 1995, for protection against \ncrime and criminals.\n  There is nothing intrinsically more dangerous about these firearms \nthan others. In fact, they do less damage to a target than a shotgun \ndoes. Clearly, the shotgun, given the range, has by far the greater \nforce. And they are functionally identical to thousands of other guns \nbeing used for legal purposes in this country today, functionally \nidentical. Many people mistakenly\n\n[[Page S1907]]\n\nbelieve these are machine guns which fire more than one bullet when the \ntrigger is pulled. If someone was listening to this debate and they \nheard the words ``spraying a crowd,'' they would think of a fully \nautomatic weapon. That is simply not the case, and I think that fact \nneeds to be clearly understood.\n\n  On the contrary, semiauto firearms do not spray bullets. They fire \none bullet per trigger pull. The mechanism simply ejects the shell and \nreplaces it with another bullet, and you have to pull the trigger \nagain. That is a semiauto. Let's remember that fully automatic machine \nguns have been banned since 1934. This Congress spoke to that in 1934.\n  The Federal assault weapon law is set to expire, as I have said. It \nhas prohibited the manufacture, since September 13, 1994, of a semiauto \nrifle equipped with a detachable magazine or two or more attachments, \nsuch as a bayonet lug or a flash suppressor, with similar guidelines \nimposed on handguns and shotguns. The manufacture of large ammunition \nmagazines, holding more than 10 rounds, was also outlawed.\n  Now we are beginning to get into what is, by those who understand it, \nviewed as an assault weapon. It is the physical attributes of two or \nmore attachments, such as a bayonet lug and a flash suppressor.\n  Assault weapons, large magazines manufactured before September 13, \n1994, are exempt from the law. Before September 13, 1994, manufacturers \naccelerated production to increase inventories available for sale \nlater.\n  After the law took effect, the BATF informed manufacturers that they \ncould produce firearms identical to assault weapons but without one or \nmore of the prohibited features. And that is a reality today. So again, \nwhen I use the word, ``cosmetic,'' there is a lot more truth to that \nthan fiction. If it does not look this way, if it does not have this \nparticular item on it, but it shoots identically and it has the same \nfirepower, well, then it is legal.\n  Also, new models of semiautomatics have been introduced, and the \nproduction of some previously discontinued models has resumed.\n  The ban affects firearms never widely used in crime, according to a \nstudy conducted by Congress--the Urban Institute, Impact Evaluation of \nthe Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act of 1994.\n  According to the FBI, rifles of any kind are used in only about 3 \npercent of homicides--only about 3 percent of homicides.\n  Here is an explanation of why a law-abiding gun owner would purchase \none of these firearms. Now, I pulled it out of my files because I \nthought it was a good one because the Senator from California said: \nWell, these weapons are not for hunting purposes.\n  Yes, some people do hunt with them. Does it mean you simply machine \ngun down a deer? No, it does not mean that at all. It is because it is \na weapon of choice, largely because it is lighter than many hunting \nweapons, and it can be carried by a smaller person.\n  In this instance, this person's name is Mary. She happens to be a \nlicensed hunter in Idaho, and she happens to use a Colt AR-15. It is a \nsemiauto that uses a 20-round clip. That is what she hunts her deer \nwith. That is what she kills her deer with. So she and her boyfriend \nwrote us and sent a picture, saying: Look, what the semiauto ban of \n1994 does is it eliminates this kind of firearm, and, in essence, it \neliminates the ability of a smaller person to go out into the brush to \nhunt deer and to recreate in that fashion.\n  Now, the ban in 1994 did a couple of things. First of all, it named \ncertain guns specifically. And I could go through that list of \nparticular firearms that it actually named. Of course, the Senator from \nCalifornia is very well aware of that in crafting a specific list of \nfirearms at that time. Some guns it only named by features.\n\n  A semiautomatic rifle that can accept a detachable magazine and has \nat least two of the following is included within the ban: a folding or \ntelescoping stock, a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath \nthe action of the weapon, a bayonet mount, a flash suppressor or \nthreaded barrel, a grenade launcher. But, then again, of course, the \nNational Firearms Act already outlaws those, so even if this law \nexpires in September of this year, it still is going to be illegal to \nhave a grenade launcher, as it should be, unless you are a bona fide \ncollector and have been given the authority to collect for collection \npurposes.\n  A semiautomatic pistol that can accept a detachable magazine and has \nat least two of the following: again, an ammunition magazine that \nattaches to the pistol outside of the pistol grip; a threaded barrel \ncapable of accepting a barrel extender, flash suppressor, forward \nhandgrip, or silencer; a shroud that is attached to, or partially or \ncompletely encircles the barrel, and that permits the shooter to hold \nthe firearm with the nontrigger hand without being burned; a \nmanufactured weight of 50 ounces or more when the pistol is unloaded; \nand a semiautomatic version of an automatic firearm.\n  That is how technical this law has become.\n  Here is another one: a semiautomatic shotgun that has at least two of \nthe following: a folding or telescoping stock, a pistol grip that \nprotrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon, a fixed \nmagazine in excess of five rounds, and an ability to accept a \ndetachable magazine.\n  But here is something that is important to understand. You know the \nold phrase, ``Let's make the record perfectly clear.'' I think it is \nappropriate.\n  What were banned by other laws that will still be banned after this \nlaw expires? I think I heard reference to the popularity of the AK-47, \na foreign rifle, and Uzis. Well, they were banned from importation in \n1989, under Federal firearms importation law--now 18 USC 925(d)(3). The \nuse of gun parts to assemble the same guns in the United States was \nprohibited by the Unsoeld amendment in 1990. In 1993, the so-called \nassault pistols, like the Uzi pistol, were banned under the importation \nlaw. In February of 1994, revolving cylinder shotguns--I have heard the \nwords used here, and they were commonly called ``Street Sweepers'' and \n``Striker-12s''--were banned under the National Firearms Act.\n  So those will still be illegal firearms to traffic in, to commerce \nin. And as a result of that, it is important that we make the record \nperfectly clear that ownership of these prior to the passage of the law \nbut after the passage of the law, these do not go away.\n  Again, as I have said, after the assault weapons law expires, here is \nwhat will happen. American-made rifles, such as the AR-15, will once \nagain be made in their original configurations. Private citizens will \nalso, once again, be able to buy standard capacity ammunition--\nmagazines usually between 13- and 17-round capacity--instead of the \narbitrarily reduced capacity 10-round magazines the law imposed, a \nchange that will assist in defending themselves against criminals and \nfor recreational purposes. In other words, what a difference a law \nmakes.\n  Well, in this instance, the difference the law made was it kept \nfirearms of these type and by definition out of the hands of law-\nabiding citizens. But if you are a criminal, if you want to deal in the \nback streets and in the black market, as most criminals do, then you \nare not going to walk in and try to buy one of these off the shelf. \nThat is why criminals will have them, because you cannot acquire them \noff the shelf because it is illegal under the current law, and you \nwould not be able to anyway if you were a criminal. It is the law-\nabiding citizens who subject themselves to the laws, as they should.\n  Now, is this statistic that I have in front of me accurate? The \nSenator from California had a chart a few moments ago that would \nindicate quite the difference. In fact, she showed a declining number \nin the statistics. This statistic is accurate. Bureau of Justice \nstatistics, Department of Justice: Before the semiautomatic firearms \nban, less than 2 percent of crimes in this country were semiauto. After \nthe ban, 1997 and forward, less than 2 percent were. Same figure.\n  How is it possible, then, that the Senator from California gets the \nstatistic and the chart that shows the decline? I am not suggesting she \nmisrepresents this chart, because I believe this chart to be accurate, \nand I believe it is accumulated in a nonbiased way.\n  Let me try to talk about the use of and/or the misuse of what is \nknown as tracing data. There is a problem when using firearm commerce \ntracing reports justifying any assault weapon\n\n[[Page S1908]]\n\nlaw. Let me try to walk you through this. Is this technical? It is a \nbit technical. But the CRS looked at it and they agree with this \nfigure. That is the research service that we employ in a nonpartisan \nway to give us accurate facts and statistics about those items we \ndebate on the floor.\n  More than a decade ago, the CRS examined the firearms tracing system \nin the context of the assault weapon issue and determined that \ninformation derived from traces should not be used to determine how \noften any kind of guns--not just assaults or semiautos--were used by \ncriminals. One of the key limitations of the tracing system is the fact \nmost guns that are traced have not been used to commit violent crimes, \nand most guns that are used to commit violent crimes are never traced. \nThe tracing system was designed to collect statistics. The \nCongressional Research Service said this:\n\n       Fire arms selected for tracing do not constitute a random \n     sample and cannot be considered representative of the large \n     universe of all firearms used by criminals or of any subset \n     of that universe.\n\n  CRS also noted that:\n\n       A law enforcement officer may initiate a trace request for \n     any reason. No crime need be involved.\n\n  It pointed out that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and \nExplosives admitted:\n\n       It is not possible to determine if traced firearms are \n     related to criminal activity.\n\n  In other words, it is just a matter of gaining certain statistics on \ncertain items.\n  One problem with the tracing system in the context of assault weapons \nis that before the assault weapon law was enacted, traces on those guns \nwere requested disproportionate to their use in crimes. That is because \nthere was so much political interest in the guns at the time. It was \nthe talk of the day, if you will. It was the placebo of action in 1994 \nthat gave us the political law we have today that still represents \nthose figures, known as the assault weapons ban. That is why it was \ndisproportionate. Why? Political interests, a lot of questions being \nasked.\n  Certainly crimes that were committed using a semiauto or an assault \nweapon in this percentage of 2 percent or less were highly dramatized \nat the time. That is because there was, again, so much action today. A \ndecade later, they constitute a smaller share of traces because there \nhas been less interest in them and because other guns are now \nbeing traced more heavily. In other words, the decline in the Senator's \nchart, in my opinion, represents that shift in attitude and in \nattention, if in fact you use tracing data as a way to determine that \nsemiautos/assault weapons are being used in the commission of the \ncrime. That is the reason for this statistic from the Department of \nJustice.\n\n  While they look at these kinds of statistics, they don't believe them \nvalid. Because of the method by which they are collected, they are \nviewed as heavily inaccurate if used in certain contexts. To determine \nthe extent to which assault weapons have been used in crimes, we have \nto look at State and local law enforcement agency reports on prime \nweapons. That is the Department of Justice's felony survey and the \ncongressionally mandated study on the assault weapon law. They all show \nassault weapons have been used in only a very small percentage of \nviolent crimes. That is the reason for that statistic.\n  Well, getting technical about a technical issue is important. We can \ntalk about all of the dramatics and the tragedies that happen when \nfirearms are misused. We can talk about Columbine, and there are a lot \nof kinds of things that are, appropriately so, to emote the kind of \nemotion all of us feel and understand when these kinds of firearms are \nused improperly and illegally.\n  But what happens when we start banning them, we have all learned, is \nthat it is the law-abiding citizen who may own them and use them \nresponsibly and who may be collecting them that is blocked by the law. \nThe criminal is not.\n  In this survey that the Department of Justice uses, they go out and \nsurvey criminals. They surveyed 14,000 of them locked up in prison and, \nas a result of that, that figure, along with a good many others, I \nthink clearly demonstrates the dramatic and important side of this \nissue.\n  Well, I will talk through the balance of the day on this issue. But I \nthink it is important that we demonstrate in its appropriate context \nthe information we are providing.\n  In my opinion, based on CRS's studies, based on the Department of \nJustice studies, to say the assault weapons ban law has dramatically \nworked since 1994 is inappropriate. The reality is that it was less \nthan 2 percent in 1991, and less than 2 percent after its passage in \n1997 and beyond. That statistic holds today, in my opinion, based on \nthe sources that I quote, which I believe are valid and justifiable. \nThere are a good many more statistics that I can talk about, and we \nwill throughout the course of the day.\n  Let me return to my initial argument. I think we have the opportunity \nto, in a very narrow and specific way, protect law-abiding people--gun \nmanufacturers, licensed gun dealers who play by the rules that this \nCongress has laid down, and provide a quality product to Americans \nunder their second amendment rights. But what we now see is a class of \nlawsuit out there that is designed for one reason: to control guns. It \nis a new form of gun control, because the gun control advocates of this \ncountry who continually came to Congress through the 1960s, 1970s, and \n1980s, saying we have to have gun control to save people's lives, found \nout that we read the statistics, we looked at the facts, and we said \nno. They decided they would go through the courts and they would begin \nto, by law or by action of the court, attempt to legislate those kinds \nof actions--in this case, by penalizing a law-abiding citizen for a \nthird party action.\n  Let me close with this thought. It happened to me once again this \nmorning. I was on the phone to my State of Idaho in a radio interview. \nThe interviewer said:\n\n       Senator, we watch what you are doing on the floor of the \n     Senate. How is that any different from suggesting that--\n\n  And he used the particular automobile, the Chevy truck. He said:\n\n       How is what you are doing any different from suggesting if \n     a drunk driver uses a Chevy truck and runs over someone and \n     kills them, that Chevrolet is responsible for that third \n     party action?\n\n  I said:\n\n       Frankly, there is no difference. That is why it is \n     important that this Congress reinstate the historic tort law \n     as we understand it. Individuals are held responsible for \n     their actions. That is what the administration is asking us \n     to do.\n\n  That is what we are doing in S. 1805. Let's not extend the assault \nweapon ban, add it to S. 1805 and risk a failure to pass this very \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I hope I will have an opportunity to \nrebut the distinguished Senator's comments. I find it very interesting \nthat suddenly gun trace information is not acceptable information, but \nwe can go out and do a survey of criminals, and that is an acceptable \nway of evaluating the success or failure of the assault weapons \nlegislation. I don't buy it. In my view, tracing guns to crime is an \nappropriate way.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the executive \nsummary of a new report out on ``Target: The Impact of the 1994 Federal \nCivil Assaults Weapons Legislation.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       To evaluate the questions below, the Brady Center to \n     Prevent Gun Violence asked Crime Gun Solutions LLC to review \n     and analyze national crime gun trace data maintained by the \n     Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). \n     This data represents guns nationwide that have been illegally \n     possessed, used in a crime, or suspected of being used in a \n     crime, thereafter recovered by law enforcement, and then \n     traced to learn about the sales history of the gun.\n       Has the Federal Assault Weapons Act reduced the incidence \n     of assault weapons in crime?\n       Yes. In the five year period (1990-1994) before enactment \n     of the Federal Assault Weapons Act, assault weapons named in \n     the Act constituted 4.82% of the crime gun traces ATF \n     conducted nationwide. Since the law's enactment, however, \n     these assault weapons have made up only 1.61% of the guns ATF \n     has traced to crime--a drop of 66% from the pre-ban rate. \n     Moreover, ATF trace data\n\n[[Page S1909]]\n\n     shows a steady year-by-year decline in the percentage of \n     assault weapons traced, suggesting that the longer the \n     statute has been in effect, the less available these guns \n     have become for criminal misuse. Indeed, the absolute number \n     of assault weapons traced has also declined.\n       This decline is extremely significant to law enforcement \n     and has clearly enhanced public safety, especially since \n     these military-style weapons are among the deadliest ever \n     sold on the civilian market. For example, if the Act had not \n     been passed and the banned assault weapons continued to make \n     up the same percentage of crime gun traces as before the \n     Act's passage, approximately 60,000 additional assault \n     weapons would have been traced to crime in the last 10 \n     years--an average of 6,000 additional assault weapons traced \n     to crime each year.\n       Have industry efforts to evade the Act through ``copycat'' \n     assault weapons eliminated its positive effects?\n       No. After the Assault Weapons Act was passed, gun \n     manufacturers sought to evade the ban by producing weapons \n     with minor changes or new model names. The Act was designed \n     to prevent this occurrence by defining assault weapons to \n     include ``copies or duplicates'' or the firearms listed in \n     the ban in any caliber, though this provision has never been \n     enforced. Yet, even if copycats of the federally banned guns \n     are considered, there has still been a 45% decline between \n     the pre-ban period (1990-1994) and the post-ban period (1995 \n     and after) in the percentage of ATF crime gun traces \n     involving assault weapons and copycat models.\n       The results of this study make it clear that the United \n     States Congress needs to renew the Federal Assault Weapons \n     Act. If the Act is not renewed, a decade of progress could be \n     lost and thousands of additional assault weapons are likely \n     to be used in crime in the future.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the presence \nof the Senator from Ohio and cede 10 minutes of time to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague, Senator \nFeinstein, for her great work in this area. I rise today in support of \nher amendment to reauthorize the 1994 assault weapons ban which is set \nto expire later this year. I thank her for her great leadership in this \narea.\n  Since it took effect in 1994, the assault weapons ban has been an \neffective tool in curbing crime in this country. The assault weapons \nban has made it more difficult for vicious criminals to get access to \nfirearms that are designed really only to maximize the number of shots \nthat can be fired and people killed in a short period of time. It is \nthe only reason they exist, the only reason they are made. The ban has \nallowed us to keep these dangerous weapons out of the hands of \ndangerous criminals and has helped make our streets safer.\n  Banning these weapons is smart law enforcement and it is good public \npolicy. Continuing the ban is simply the right thing to do.\n  I am not alone in this assessment. The assault weapons ban \nreauthorization has the support of the White House and also has the \nsupport of every major law enforcement organization in this country--\nevery single one. Furthermore, it has the support of the National \nLeague of Cities, the United States Conference of Mayors, and the U.S. \nConference of Catholic Bishops. This is for good reason.\n  Prior to the 1994 ban, the Cox newspaper service conducted a survey \nusing data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. That \nstudy found that assault weapons were 20 times more likely to be used \nin a crime than a conventional firearm. This, therefore, is a question \nof public safety.\n  It is to me disconcerting that we still hear complaints about \nextending the duration of the ban. One stated concern is the ban may \nsomehow accidentally infringe on the rights of law-abiding gun owners. \nFor example, some people worry the ban may affect hunting or \nrecreational rifles. The ban has been in effect for almost 10 years now \nand that has not been a problem so far.\n  What is the compelling reason to repeal this law, because that is, in \neffect, what we would be doing if we do not extend it? What has been \nthe problem? How many of us have heard from our hunters? How many of us \nhave heard from people who want to use a firearm in a proper way to \nprotect themselves or for recreation purposes, that this particular law \nis somehow infringing upon their rights? I do not think we have.\n  This law will not be a problem in the future either because this \nlegislation specifically provides protection of 670 different types of \nhunting and recreational rifles that are presently being manufactured. \nThis list is by no means meant to be exhaustive. A gun does not have to \nbe on the list to be protected.\n  Furthermore, the ban does not just protect the right to purchase and \nuse rifles. It also protects a wide range of guns because it only \naffects those weapons with no legitimate use.\n  We know why American citizens buy guns. The most common answer to the \nquestion of why we buy a gun is protection, hunting, target shooting, \nand other legitimate reasons. These are very legitimate uses for \nlegally acquired firearms. The firearms included in the assault weapons \nban do not effectively serve any of these purposes.\n  No legitimate gun owner need have a weapon such as the TEC-9 that has \nbeen talked about before. I will not take my colleagues' time to talk \nabout this weapon, but it is not a legitimate weapon for anyone but a \ncriminal who wants to see how quickly he can kill a large number of \npeople.\n\n  Probably the most important reason to have this ban, if we really \nwant to analyze it, is that it limits the number of rounds in a clip to \n10. What significance does this have in regard to law enforcement? \nMaybe if I can go back to my days as a county prosecuting attorney and \ndraw upon my conversations I had not just then but throughout the years \nwith my friends in law enforcement, some of my police officer friends \nwho I have known and continue to know and call my good friends, what is \nit people fear and police officers fear? One thing is someone comes in \nand they have a big clip, and they can just shoot, shoot, shoot, and \nshoot and nothing will stop them--15, 20, 30 rounds.\n  What does this law do? It limits it to 10. That is an arbitrary \nfigure. It could have been something different. We understand that. At \nleast it limits it to 10. That makes some sense. Yes, someone could put \nthe other clip in and continue on, but there is a period of time where \nthey have to stop and do that. What law enforcement people tell us is \nthat period of time, when you have a mass murderer who is intent on \nkilling as many people as he or she can, is valuable, that period of \ntime is significant from a law enforcement point of view and it maybe \nwill save lives. In some cases, it will save lives.\n  Law enforcement will be able to react in that period of time and \nlives will be saved and shots will not be able to be taken, and that \ncriminal, that person who maybe is insane, will be stopped, disabled, \nor killed by law enforcement, by a bystander, by someone.\n  That, from a law enforcement point of view, is the most effective \npart of this bill. In my opinion, at least, and in the opinion of many \npeople in law enforcement with whom I have talked, that is the heart of \nthis law we have today, and I think it is the heart of the Feinstein \namendment. She is attempting to do something that is not revolutionary. \nAll she is trying to do with this very modest amendment is to keep \ncurrent law. Let me emphasize that. A vote for the Feinstein amendment \nis a vote for the status quo. It is a vote to keep current law. I urge \nmy colleagues to follow that law.\n  The assault weapons ban prevents the manufacture of new high-capacity \nmilitary style magazines for sale to the general public. Indeed, the \nguns we banned were designed to work in conjunction with these high-\ncapacity magazines. Many of them are able to hold 30 or 40 rounds in \neach magazine. That is 30 bullets that can be fired rapidly without \never reloading.\n  This is far more ammunition than a hunter, sportsman, or individual \nconcerned with self-protection needs in one magazine. This deadly \ncombination of large clips and rapidly firing guns is not \ncharacteristic of recreational guns or guns used for personal \nprotection. We all know that. Neither is a threaded barrel designed to \naccommodate a silencer, a feature that is much more useful to assassins \nand snipers than it is to a sportsman; or a bayonet mount that allows a \nknife to be attached to the front of a rifle; or a grenade launcher. \nAgain, it was provided in this bill. Does a grenade launcher sound \nrecreational?\n  Under this provision, the Feinstein amendment, and under current law, \nwe do not outlaw a gun unless it has two of these features. It has to \nhave two of\n\n[[Page S1910]]\n\nthem. I think it is a pretty modest law, and a pretty modest amendment.\n  The assault weapons ban does not outlaw a gun if it has one of these \nfeatures. It only outlaws a gun with two or more of these features.\n  These are dangerous weapons that do not belong on our streets. I urge \nmy colleagues to talk, as I have, to law enforcement officers in their \nStates. Talk to the mayors of their cities, talk to people who are on \nthe front lines and who might potentially have to deal with these types \nof weapons if we do not reenact this law. They will say these weapons \nare a threat to law enforcement and to the general public. These \nweapons are not for hunting. They are not for self-defense. It is time \nto once again reauthorize this law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for his \ncomments and for his support. I very much appreciate it.\n  One of the issues is that those States that have big cities see how \nthese weapons are used, and in the big cities they are used by gangs. \nSo the argument of the collector versus the argument of the majority \nwho wants to be protected from these weapons is what we are talking \nabout today.\n  The distinguished Senator from Idaho referred to them as just \nsemiautomatic firearms, really no different from other firearms. I do \nnot see it that way at all. Many of these come with collapsable stocks. \nThey come with 20-round clips. Two 30-round clips can be put together, \nand two banana clips, and have 60 rounds. The trigger can be adjusted \nso that with some of these weapons one can fire as many as, believe it \nor not, 30 bullets in 3 seconds. That cannot be done with a revolver \nand with most rifles.\n  So these are different weapons, and those of us who support this \nlegislation essentially believe they do not belong on our streets. No \ncollector is stopped from collecting one of these weapons. A collector \ncan still buy one of these weapons. What is stopped is the manufacture \nand sale of new weapons. The existing stock is still around.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during \nthe quorum call the remaining time be equally divided between the two \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask that time allocated to Senator McCain, \ncosponsor of the gun show amendment with myself, be given to me for \nsuch time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we are debating legislation that is a \nserious encroachment on the common law of negligence. It is a \nlegislative proposal that, in my view, is audacious in its breadth and \nalso something that is presumptuous, presumptuous in the fact that, at \nthe heart of this legislation, any liability for a gun dealer or a \nmanufacturer or a trade association would rest on a violation of a \nstatute, a Federal or State statute. Of course that presumes we are \nwise enough and bright enough to provide a statutory answer to every \nquestion posed by life. And I don't think we are.\n  That is, in effect, one of the reasons why the law of negligence \narose. It was not a response to the fact that we have too many laws; it \nwas a response to the fact we had laws that did not require a standard \nof care in every circumstance. This legislation presumes we will govern \nevery conceivable item of conduct and if one of those items of conduct \nis violated, a statutory requirement, then liability will arise. That \ndefies human experience.\n  Again, that is why our system of law over centuries developed the \nnotion that outside of laws there is another standard. That is the \nstandard of reasonable conduct. That is a standard that says an \nindividual should act in a way that does not reasonably lead to the \ninjury of another.\n  We are upsetting that totally with this legislation. One example of \nthe deficiency of the current legislation that we have, the legislative \nframework, is the governance of gun shows. These are sales of weapons \nin public areas that take place in most jurisdictions of this country--\nin many, many jurisdictions. We became aware of one of the glaring \nshortcomings of this legislative framework after the Columbine \nkillings. There, two very disturbed young men were able to obtain a \nweapon through a gun show. They used this weapon and other weapons to \ngo in to wreak havoc in Columbine High School: classmates dead, \nfamilies shattered, a community in turmoil.\n  At that point, this body moved very appropriately to try to close the \ngun show loophole. What is this gun show loophole? It is very simply \nstated. If you are a licensed Federal firearm dealer, then you must \nconduct a background check upon anyone who purchases a weapon from you. \nBut if you are an unlicensed dealer, i.e. someone who does not engage \nin the sale of firearms, then there is no requirement that you conduct \nthis background check. It turns out that at gun shows there are many \nlicensed dealers but a significant number of unlicensed dealers.\n  They come and sell their wares at that show. In fact, you can go up \nto one table at a gun show and ask about a weapon. A licensed dealer \nwould presumably quote you a price and say, I also have to conduct a \nbackground check under Federal law. You can step 3 or 4 feet away to \nanother table to an unlicensed dealer, someone who ``knows the \nbusiness'' of selling weapons, where in fact you don't have to do a \nbackground check. He says, ``I don't have a license. This is the price \nI want for it.''\n  It is not fair. It also allows for the distribution of this weapon \ninto society in a way that can be harmful. The Columbine case is an \nexample of that. Senator McCain and I are proposing legislation that \nwill close this loophole.\n  Again, back in 1999, in the wake of Columbine, Senator Lautenberg \nproposed legislation that passed this body. It was, unfortunately, \nstripped out of the legislation before it reached the desk of the \nPresident. We hope to offer an amendment tomorrow morning, and \nhopefully it will be agreed to.\n  It is very important to have an active framework for the regulation \nof firearms in the country. It is important because in many cases we \nhave avoided subjecting firearms to the regulation which is common for \nother goods that are sold in commerce. Firearms are exempt from \nconsumer product safety laws that apply to virtually every other \nproduct in the country.\n  I think it is important when we have public sales of firearms that we \nshould have a situation in which every dealer is required to conduct a \nbackground check on the purchase.\n  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms reported to Congress in \n2000 that gun shows are a major source of gun trafficking, responsible \nfor 26,000 illegal firearms sales during the 18-month period they \nstudied these sales.\n  That suggests to me this is an issue that must be dealt with and must \nbe dealt with in this legislation. They have told us many of these \npurchases are by convicted felons, domestic abusers, and other \nprohibited purchasers who cannot obtain a weapon if they go to a \nlicensed dealer and have a background check.\n  At least three suspected terrorists that we know have also exploited \nthe rules to acquire firearms, including one suspected member of al-\nQaida.\n  Under Federal law, Federal firearms licensees are required to \nmaintain careful records of their sales and, under the Brady Act, to \ncheck the purchaser's background with the National Instant Criminal \nBackground Check\n\n[[Page S1911]]\n\nSystem. However, as I explained, a person does not need a Federal \nfirearms license, and the Brady Act does not apply, if the person is \nnot ``engaged in a business'' of selling firearms pursuant to Federal \nlaw.\n  These unlicensed sellers make up to one quarter or more of the \nsellers of firearms at thousands of gun shows in America each year. \nConsequently, felons and other prohibited persons who want to avoid \nBrady Act checks and records of their purchases buy firearms at these \ngun shows. It stands to reason if you are a felon and you know the \nsystem and know that if you go to a licensed dealer you have to have a \nbackground check, where do you go? You go to someone who doesn't have \nto conduct a background check. In many cases, it is gun shows and \nunlicensed dealers.\n  As I also mentioned, 5 years ago, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold \nkilled 13 people at Columbine with weapons purchased from an unlicensed \nseller at a gun show. The woman who purchased those guns on behalf of \nHarris and Klebold testified to the Colorado Legislature she would \nnever have purchased the weapons had she been required to undergo a \nbackground check. Had we had those background checks in place, then we \nmight have avoided a terrible tragedy at Columbine.\n\n  We are united in this bipartisan legislation, Senator McCain and \nmyself and other cosponsors, and we have brought together provisions \nfrom several previous gun show bills to make gun show transactions \nsafer for all Americans. The amendment we will propose tomorrow will \nrequire Brady law background checks on all firearms transactions at any \nevent where 75 or more guns are offered for sale. Three years after \nenactment, States could apply to the Attorney General of the United \nStates for certification for a 24-hour background check for unlicensed \nsellers at gun shows. In order to be eligible for this 24-hour \ncertification, a State would be required to have 95 percent of its \ndisqualifying records automated and searchable under NICS, including 95 \npercent of all domestic violence misdemeanor and restraining orders \ndating back 30 years.\n  If a State can show their records are accessible through the system, \nif they are updated, if they cover the range not only of felony \nconvictions and other criminal convictions but also domestic violence, \nmisdemeanors, and restraining orders, then they could have a system in \nwhich an unlicensed dealer could have the check resolved in no more \nthan 24 hours.\n  Before certifying a State for this 24-hour background check, the \nAttorney General would be required to establish a toll-free telephone \nnumber to enable State and local courts to immediately notify the NIC \nsystem anytime a domestic violence restraining order is filed, and \ncourts within a certified State would be required to use the telephone \nnumber immediately upon the filing of such an order to notify the NIC \nsystem.\n  The bill also directs the Attorney General to work with States to \nencourage the development of computer systems that would allow courts \nto provide electronic records to NICS immediately. The Bureau of \nJustice Statistics would conduct an interim review of all certified \nStates to ensure they continue to meet the conditions of the 24-hour \nbackground check and certification.\n  The amendment Senator McCain and I will offer tomorrow differs in \nseveral respects from the legislation Senator McCain and I proposed \nlast fall.\n  First, gun show operators would not be required to notify the \nAttorney General of plans to hold a gun show. This provision was \nincluded in previous legislation, but it has been stricken from the \namendment. Thus, there will be no requirement for a gun show operator \nto notify any Federal agency about plans to operate a gun show.\n  Second, gun show operators would not be required to notify the \nAttorney General of vendors who sell firearms at gun shows. Again, this \nis a provision that has been dropped from previous legislation. The \nledger of vendors at a gun show would be maintained at the permanent \nplace of business of the gun show operator.\n  Let me repeat that our amendment contains no requirement for gun show \noperators to notify any Federal agency about the names of firearms \nvendors at gun shows. Therefore, the amendment would not, as the NRA \nhas claimed, in their words, create ``gun owner registration.'' It \nwould not do that.\n\n  Third, our amendment does not authorize the Department of Justice to \ndraft regulations concerning how gun shows notify each gun show patron \non the provisions of the law.\n  Again, in previous editions of legislation, there was a requirement \nthey would inform patrons about the provisions of the law. This \nlegislation does not contain such a provision.\n  The NRA has claimed, in keeping with their longstanding tradition of \nextreme rhetoric, our bill would create ``massive bureaucratic red \ntape'' and give a so-called ``antigun administration'' the power to \n``regulate gun shows out of business.'' That was never true to begin \nwith. But the changes Senator McCain and I have made to our amendment \nshould put these accusations to rest.\n  The overriding purpose of our bill is to require background checks on \nall gun show sales in the most convenient manner possible for gun show \noperators, unlicensed sellers, and private citizens who seek to \npurchase firearms at gun shows.\n  I have no doubt the gun lobby will continue to say this is an attempt \nto end gun shows. But the experience of States that have closed the gun \nshow loophole proves otherwise.\n  California, for example, requires not only background checks at gun \nshows but a 10-day waiting period for all gun sales. Yet gun shows \ncontinue to thrive there.\n  We are not trying to end gun shows. We are trying to end the free \npass we are giving to terrorists and convicted felons that allows them \nto simply walk into a gun show, find an unlicensed fellow, buy whatever \nweapons they want, and walk out without a Brady background check.\n  In overwhelming numbers, gun owners believe a background check should \nbe required whenever a firearm is sold at a gun show. An October 2003 \npoll found 85 percent of gun owners support closing the gun show \nloophole, that 83 percent of those who have attended gun shows support \nclosing the loophole as well.\n  The people of Colorado--one of several States--confirmed this \nwidespread support after Columbine when they approved a ballot \ninitiative to close the gun show loophole. President George Bush said \nrepeatedly during the 2000 campaign he supported legislation to require \nbackground checks at gun shows.\n  We hope tomorrow this amendment will be adopted so the President can \nsign a bill which he has indicated clearly and repeatedly throughout \nthe 2000 campaign that he supports. I urge my colleagues to support the \nMcCain-Reed amendment so we can finally close the loophole in every \nState and make sure that convicted felons, domestic abusers, and other \nprohibited persons do not use gun shows to purchase firearms without \nthe background check.\n  There has been some discussion and rebuttal by those who say this is \nunnecessary because this is not an opportunity for felons to obtain \nweapons. In fact, the NRA maintains there is no gun show loophole. What \nis the truth? Under Federal law, licensed dealers must do background \nchecks at gun shows, but unlicensed dealers do not. Thus, at thousands \nof gun shows each year, a licensed firearm dealer must conduct a \nbackground check, while 2 feet away an unlicensed dealer is able to \nsell a weapon without a check. That suggests strongly--it would defy \ncommon sense otherwise--that if you are looking to get a weapon and you \nare prohibited from having one, where would you go? Right to the \nunlicensed dealer, right to that loophole. Put the money on the table \nand take the weapon and walk out, no questions asked.\n  According to the NRA, they suggest hundreds of thousands of guns are \nsold each year at gun shows without these background checks--that is \ntheir own statement--hundreds of thousands of guns not subject to \nbackground checks.\n  It is not fair. I have talked to my colleagues from States that have \nquite a few gun shows and they simply say, what sense does it make that \nsomeone who walks into a Target or a Wal-Mart to buy a weapon has to \nundergo a Federal firearms check and they can just walk across the \nstreet to some type of\n\n[[Page S1912]]\n\ngun show and get one without a background check. That is not fair. It \nis not an even playing field. It is a loophole. We hope we can close \nthat loophole tomorrow.\n  The NRA says if we adopt this legislation we will put gun shows out \nof business. That is not true, either. Seventeen States have closed the \ngun show loophole on their own. According to the Krause Gun/Knife Show \nCalendar, which bills itself as the complete guide for anyone who \nattends or displays at gun shows, States which closed the loophole \nhosted more gun shows each year than States which have left this \nloophole open: an average of 45 gun shows per year in the 17 States \nwhich have closed the loophole compared to 41 in the other 33 States.\n  The NRA also says lengthy background checks take too long for weekend \ngun shows. But thanks to improvements made by the NIC system, National \nInstant Recovery background system, 91 percent of the background checks \ntake less than 5 minutes; 95 percent take less than 2 hours to \ncomplete. For 19 out of 20 background checks, instant checking is truly \ninstant, within minutes, and no more than 2 hours. Of the remaining 5 \npercent that take longer than 2 hours, about one-third of these result \nin a denial because they have found information indicating the \nindividual is prohibited from purchasing a weapon.\n  Also, as indicated, our amendment gives the State the opportunity to \nqualify for a 24-hour background check for unlicensed sellers at gun \nshows if it has automated 95 percent of its background check records. \nThese checks can be made, they will be made, they are being made \nwithout inhibiting gun shows on behalf of licensed dealers who sell at \nthe shows. The idea that requiring unlicensed dealers to get a \nbackground check would disrupt gun shows is, in my view, completely \nunsubstantiated.\n\n  The NRA says criminals do not buy guns from gun shows. The truth is, \ncrime guns do come from gun shows and it has been documented. That is \naccording to ATF Special Agent Jeff Fulton. In a comprehensive ATF \nreport on illegal guns, they found gun shows were the second leading \nsource of firearms recovered in illegal gun trafficking operations.\n  The NRA says also the Department of Justice survey of prison inmates \nfound only 2 percent of prisoners obtained their firearms from the gun \nshows and flea markets. The 1997 survey at the NRA sites admits an \nobvious flaw: The gun show loophole did not exist until the Brady law \npassed at the end of 1993, requiring background checks by licensed \ndealers. Thus, any criminal imprisoned before 1994, or inmate who \nacquired a firearm before 1994, could go to a gun store without having \nto undergo any type of background check. The survey they rely upon is \ninvalid.\n  We have several recent examples of gun show loopholes being exploited \nby criminals. Thomas Timms was arrested last October with 147 guns, \n60,000 rounds of ammunition, a submachine gun, a 20 millimeter antitank \nrifle, a 12-gauge ``street sweeper'' and a rocket launcher. According \nto Federal agents, he had been selling large quantities of weapons at \nGeorgia gun shows that were used in crimes in Washington, DC, New York, \nand Georgia.\n  Caesar Gaglio was arrested in September after selling 11 guns to \nundercover agents and was among 5 unlicensed sellers caught with 572 \nguns in an undercover sting that encompassed gun shows in Oklahoma, \nKentucky, and Kansas.\n  John Loveall and eight others were arrested in June for selling \nfirearms to felons or people under indictment at Tennessee gun shows. \nThey were arrested with 500 guns in their possession. In the words of \nthe Federal attorney, this is 500 guns that will not wind up in the \nhands of criminals to use, to rob, or to shoot or murder citizens of \nMemphis or anywhere else in the western district of western Tennessee.\n  Tommy Holmes pleaded guilty in October for being part of a \ntrafficking scheme that included a known felon buying scores of guns at \nAlabama gun shows to sell on the streets of Chicago. Fifteen of the \nfirearms have been recovered in the course of criminal investigations \nor at crime scenes.\n  Bud Varnadore was sentenced to prison in November for trafficking in \nfirearms at Tennessee gun shows. He was caught in a sting that \nidentified 23 other suspicious sellers and recovered over 1,600 \nfirearms. Tennessee is a ``source State'' of guns for criminals, \nthrough unlicensed dealers, according to AFT Special Agent James \nCavanaugh.\n  Nigel Bostic and two accomplices were arrested for buying 239 \nfirearms at 11 Ohio gun shows and reselling them to criminals in \nBuffalo, NY. At least one was recovered in a homicide. In one instance, \nBostic purchased 45 firearms and his accomplice purchased 85 guns. ``We \nare still finding guns that have been used in crimes and tracing them \nback to him,'' said Buffalo Police Lieutenant Amy Marracino.\n  Viktor Mascak was arrested on 56 counts of trafficking in firearms at \nWashington State gun shows. At least five of Mascak's guns were \nrecovered in crimes, including one that was carried into Hanford Middle \nSchool by a 13-year-old.\n  Billy Gage and Lowell Ronald Wilson, a felon, were arrested at the \nSeagoville flea market outside of Dallas with 2 machine guns, 91 \nhandguns, and 49 rifles. They were apprehended after a 9 millimeter \npistol they sold to a felon was used to murder Garland County Police \nOfficer Michael Moore.\n  This is quite a record of criminals exploiting gun shows and \nexploiting the current loophole. If we do not close it, there will be \nmore to add to this infamous list.\n  The NRA says supporters of closing the gun show loophole are \nshamefully exploiting terrorism to make their case. The truth is, we \nknow three cases where suspected terrorists exploited the gun show \nloophole. Ali Boumelhem, a Lebanese national and member of the \nterrorist group Hezbollah, was arrested and convicted of attempting to \nsmuggle firearms he bought from Michigan gun shows to Lebanon.\n  Muhammed Nasrar, a Pakistani national in the country on an expired \nvisa, admitted to buying and selling firearms at Texas gun shows. \nNasrar is a suspected al-Qaida member who obtained a pilot's license, \nhad photos of tall buildings of American cities, and, though seemingly \nimpoverished, attempted to purchase a time share for a Lear jet.\n  Connor Claxton, an admitted member of the Irish Republican Army, \nspent over $100,000 at Florida gun shows and through other private \ndealers to obtain firearms to smuggle to Ireland.\n  The National Rifle Association says also the McCain-Reed amendment \ncreates gun owner registration. Not correct.\n  The truth: Special firearms event licensees, those who are certified \nto perform background checks for unlicensed firearms vendors at gun \nshows, are required to keep the same records as federally licensed \nfirearms dealers, no more or no less. Unless one argues that buying a \nfirearm from a licensed dealer constitutes gun owner registration, then \none cannot argue this amendment constitutes gun owner registration.\n  The NRA says the McCain-Reed amendment requires gun show operators to \nregister all firearm vendor names to the Federal Government.\n  The truth: The amendment does not require this. Gun show operators \nare not required to submit a list of vendors to the Federal Government. \nGun show operators are only required to maintain their own paper \nrecords of those who sell firearms at gun shows.\n  The NRA says the McCain-Reed amendment requires registration of gun \nshows.\n  The truth: The amendment does not require gun show operators to \nregister or notify the Federal Government about the scheduling of any \ngun shows. A gun show notification requirement in our bill has not been \nincluded in this amendment. We struck it. The Federal Government has no \nrole in approving or denying gun shows from operating in any way.\n  The NRA says the McCain-Reed amendment allows harassment of gun show \norganizers and vendors.\n  The truth: Federal authorities will have no more inspection authority \nover gun show operators than they have now with licensed firearms \ndealers. There is no new inspection authority over any vendors in this \namendment.\n  The NRA also says the McCain-Reed amendment creates massive \nbureaucratic redtape.\n  The truth: This amendment is remarkably redtape free. There are no\n\n[[Page S1913]]\n\nnew paperwork requirements for unlicensed sellers. The Federal \nGovernment has no role in approving or disapproving gun show events. \nGun shows are under no obligation to notify Federal authorities about \ntheir intent to hold an event.\n  The NRA also says the McCain-Reed amendment turns casual \nconversations into gun show sales.\n  Not true. The amendment clearly defines a firearms transaction as \n``the sale, offer for sale, transfer, or exchange of a firearm.''\n  The NRA says the McCain-Reed amendment's 24-hour maximum allowable \nbackground check is a smokescreen.\n  It is not. If a State wants to place a 24-hour limit on the length of \nbackground checks at gun shows, it may do so once that State has its \nbackground check records in order and automated. If a State chooses not \nto limit the length of background checks below the current 3 business \ndays, it does not have to.\n  The NRA says the McCain-Reed amendment makes no improvements to \ninstant check.\n  The truth: Legislation to improve instant check has been introduced \nseparately by Senators Schumer, Craig, Hatch, and Kennedy. I am proud \nto be both a cosponsor of the legislation and a longtime supporter of \nthe National Criminal History Improvement Program to help States get \nmore of their disqualifying records into the system.\n  NRA also says the McCain-Reed amendment gives no priority to gun show \nbackground checks.\n  That is because it is not necessary. The NIC System currently \noperates from 8 a.m. to 1 a.m. 7 days a week and 364 days a year. That \nis why 91 percent of background checks are completed in minutes, and 95 \npercent are completed within 2 hours. The remaining 5 percent are 20 \ntimes more likely to turn up an illegal buyer than the rest of the \nchecks. There is no need to put gun show checks in front of other \nbackground checks the NICS processes nationwide every day because the \nsystem is working very efficiently.\n  These are some of the refutations of the amendment Senator McCain and \nI are offering, but none of them hold any weight. This is an amendment \nthat will close the gun show loophole without materially affecting the \noperation of gun shows or the conduct of unlicensed gun dealers, but it \nwill attempt to prevent some of the rogues, whom I described, from \ngetting access to weapons.\n  Once again, there is a great discussion on this floor almost every \nmoment of the principles of law, the principles we espouse. But a lot \nof what we do must be common sense. I ask my colleagues, and also the \npeople listening, to think about it. If you were a felon, or if you \nwere a terrorist, and you were aware, as so many of them are, that you \ncould go to a gun show, find unlicensed dealers and buy a weapon--some \nof them extremely dangerous weapons--without any questions asked, where \nwould you go? You would go right there.\n  All the principles of law, all the principles of legal theory, have \nto respond to that commonsense insight. The McCain-Reed amendment seeks \nto make a commonsense response to this glaring omission, to close the \nloophole, to require anyone purchasing a weapon at a gun show must go \nthrough a background check, and to do so in a way that we do not \ninhibit gun shows and we do not impose undue requirements on both the \noperator of the gun show or those dealers, both licensed and \nunlicensed, who may attend.\n  I mentioned before discussion of the terrorist connection. It seems \nto me that after 9/11, when we attempted to strike an extraordinarily \nstrong posture against any form of terrorism--where this body, in \nvirtual unanimity, passed the PATRIOT Act, which empowers the Federal \nGovernment to take unusually strong steps with respect to individual \nprivacy and individual protections--to now suddenly allow this loophole \nto exist that may be exploited by terrorists, seems to me astounding.\n  If we can have thousands of people at airports screening bags against \nterrorist threats, why can't we simply pass a gun show loophole \namendment that will close a source of weapons that has been exploited \nin the past by terrorists?\n  I mentioned three cases in particular. I would like to elaborate, if \nI may.\n  The first is Ali Boumelhem, a known terrorist, connected to \nHezbollah. He is currently serving prison time for attempting to \nsmuggle guns into Lebanon. He was discovered by an informant. As a \nresult of this information, Federal law enforcement agents trailed him, \nobserved him, and saw him go to a gun show in Michigan. He purchased a \nweapon. He also involved his brother as a straw buyer, to purchase \nanother weapon. He was caught after attempting to smuggle the weapons \nout of this country to Beirut.\n  It is important to note, because there has been some suggestion that \nhe never actually purchased a weapon at these shows, that he always \nused straw purchasers to purchase them. As a result, it would foil our \namendment, the McCain-Reed amendment.\n\n  But in a sworn affidavit, dated November 6, 2000, ATF Special Agent \nCheryl Crockett testified agents assigned to the Joint Terrorism Task \nForce had Boumelhem under surveillance on October 29, 2000, when he \nwent to the Grand Rapids Gun and Knife Show. One agent particularly, \nEdwin Edmunds, observed Boumelhem approach a table and examine an M-16 \nrifle upper receiver--that is, the receiver, barrel, carrying handle, \nand handguards. This configuration is a firearm under Federal law.\n  Boumelhem walked away, but then returned minutes later with a wad of \ncash, which he exchanged for the M-16. He was seen leaving the gun show \nwith a plastic bag that, in the language of the agent, ``comports with \nthe size and shape of an M-16 receiver.''\n  Mr. Boumelhem himself purchased a weapon at a gun show. Had the \nMcCain-Reed amendment been in effect, the individual would have been \nrequired to have conducted a background check of Mr. Boumelhem, and he \nwould have been denied the right to buy that weapon because he had \nalready been convicted in California of an offense that would \ndisqualify him to purchase such a weapon.\n  Mr. Boumelhem was involved in a conspiracy not only to purchase \nweapons on his own behalf but to enlist others to purchase these \nweapons and to ship these weapons back to Beirut. In fact, he was \nfinally arrested after a Federal agent searched an auto park's cargo \ncontainer on a ship bound for Lebanon. They found weapons and other \nmateriel. He was attempting to flee the country, apparently, when he \nwas arrested by the Federal agent. He had a one-way ticket to Beirut. \nIt appeared he was not making just a business stop but, indeed, was \ntrying to flee the country.\n  Our Federal agents also had witnesses and informants who had seen \nBoumelhem in Lebanon with, in their words, AK-47s, M-16s, explosives, \ngrenade launchers, grenades, rocket launchers, and rockets in his \npossession. The press reported the FBI has a video tape apparently \nshowing Ali Boumelhem firing automatic weapons in Lebanon and \nacknowledging he is a member of Hezbollah.\n  This is the charge--someone who, under observation by Federal agents, \nused the gun show loophole to acquire an M-16. He was engaged in \nsignificant conspiracy with others before to exploit gun shows or other \nmeans. His brother said Ali Boumelhem was a frequent gun show attendee. \nIn his own words, he said his brother said he went to ``gun shows \neverywhere. Gun shows everywhere here, almost every week. If it's not \nMt. Clemens, it's in Taylor.''\n  Both of them were searching out gun shows all through Michigan. This \nindividual qualifies as a terrorist. He would have been denied the \nright to purchase this firearm had the Reed-McCain legislation been in \neffect.\n  There are others, too, who have been indicated as terrorists and have \nbeen involved in these details. One other is the case of Muhammad \nAsrar. Mr. Asrar is an illegal Pakistani immigrant who has pleaded \nguilty to weapons and immigration charges. At a presentencing hearing, \nthe Government sought an ``upward departure'' from the sentencing \nguidelines because of Asrar's ``intent and demonstration of violent and \nterrorist motives.'' Asrar remains under investigation by a Federal \ngrand jury on suspicion of involvement with al-Qaida. The Government \nhas revealed that he was stockpiling guns he had illegally bought and \nsold\n\n[[Page S1914]]\n\nat Texas gun shows. Asrar had also obtained a pilot's license, \ncollected pictures of tall buildings in the U.S., and tried to purchase \na timeshare in a Lear jet.\n  Asrar was convicted of illegally possessing 50 rounds of 9 mm \nammunition. As an illegal alien, it was illegal for Asrar to buy or \npossess guns or ammunition. He was also convicted on an immigration \ncharge--illegally overstaying his student visa since 1988. He has \nadmitted to having bought and sold guns at gun shows. Asrar told \nauthorities that he had bought and sold a variety of guns at Texas gun \nshows over the last 7 years. These included a copy of a Sten submachine \ngun, Ruger Mini-14 rifle, two handguns, and a hunting rifle. None of \nthe guns were in his possession when he was arrested on September 17.\n  In addition to the ammunition, authorities also found pictures of the \ntall buildings, as I indicated, and also pictures of the guns that he \nsaid he at one time purchased and had in his possession. He told the \nauthorities he bought and sold guns at gun shows.\n  It appears he was stockpiling these weapons. The fact is, he had at \nleast 16 guns, and possibly as many as 30 guns. He was arrested on \nSeptember 11 when an informant had indicated he was behaving \nsuspiciously. The informant indicated that Asrar had asked him whether \nor not he could help Asrar smuggle a foreign national across the border \nfrom Mexico, and if he would take pictures of tall buildings for him \nduring his travels, and if he would mail letters for him from \nPennsylvania.\n  Now, the Government is presently developing cases against this \nindividual based on a theory that he is involved in terrorist activity. \nAs I said, in a presentencing motions hearing, the Government indicated \nthat it is conducting this further investigation. In their words, ``We \nare asking for upward departure based on his intent and demonstration \nof violent and terrorist motives.'' This is the text of the open \nsession in court:\n\n       . . . will testify that he, there's numerous gun \n     transactions, there's more than what's in the presentencing \n     report.\n  This is the Federal attorney:\n\n       The presentencing report contains most of the ones that are \n     more well defined, but there's other witnesses who are a \n     little bit more vague, but they describe more gun \n     transactions, or gun incidents I should call them, not gun \n     transactions necessarily. But also the presentencing report \n     contains incidents where he's trying to buy explosives. \n     There's also the--on September 8, Your Honor, he rented a \n     car. He drove to Houston, Texas; he returned the car on the \n     11th. He met with well-known persons of middle eastern \n     descent there in Houston. He has obtained a flying, a pilot's \n     license. Although he was apparently completely broke, he was \n     trying to purchase a timeshare in a Lear jet. He requested a \n     person who was traveling to the East Coast to take pictures \n     of tall buildings for him and send them to his brother. \n     There's an incident, Your Honor, where approximately a year \n     before the defendant was arrested, persons had been calling \n     in to local authorities saying he had been involved in gun \n     transactions and the ATF went with, I believe it was the \n     TABC, or some alcohol-related agency, and they went to search \n     his property, and about a year before he was arrested. And \n     they found no guns. When we began interviewing people after \n     he was arrested, we looked into one, Mr. Robert Fang, who's \n     an admitted friend of Mr. Asrar, who says, who referred back \n     to that incident a year earlier and said that Mr. Asrar \n     brought him a case of guns, a case of guns, I believe it was \n     5 to 7 guns, somewhere in there, and said, ``Please hold \n     these for me. My place is about to get searched by agents. \n     Please keep these for me so they won't find them.''\n\n  Mr. President, you have someone who is behaving extremely \nsuspiciously, is illegally in this country, who has apparent ties to \nterrorist organizations--at least enough to ask the Federal authorities \nto ask in a presentencing that he be treated as such. Of his own \nadmission, he frequented gun shows, and bought and sold guns. Again, I \nthink this is a strong case for closure of the gun show loophole.\n  Briefly, before I yield the floor, I will mention the case of Conor \nClaxton. Mr. Claxton is an admitted member of the Irish Republican \nArmy. He came to the United States--specifically Florida--because he \nwas looking to develop an arsenal of weapons to ship back to Ireland. \nHe testified that the IRA chose Florida because ``we don't have gun \nshows in Ireland, and you see things here like you never imagined.'' He \ntold the FBI it is common knowledge that obtaining weapons in the \nUnited States is easy.\n  Now, Mr. Claxton was involved in, apparently, using about $100,000 to \nassemble an arsenal for the IRA. The Irish authorities recovered 46 \nhandguns in 1999 and more than 600 rounds of ammunition hidden inside \n23 packages containing toys, computers, and other goods to be shipped \nfrom the cabal of the IRA in the United States.\n  Claxton usually used a straw purchaser, a naturalized American \ncitizen, Siobhan Browne, who is also his girlfriend. She acquired many \nof these guns. But it appears, also, because Browne indicated that \nClaxton ``spent more than $100,000 off the books on semi and fully \nautomatic weapons in sales from private dealers.'' So there is strong \nevidence to suggest that Claxton himself was engaged in the acquisition \ndirectly of firearms for the purpose of arming IRA members in Northern \nIreland.\n  Now, Mr. Claxton was ultimately charged and he was convicted along \nwith two codefendants on the gun smuggling charge of which he was \naccused. He is currently serving a 56-month sentence.\n  Despite his admission that he was a member of the IRA, he was \nacquitted of the charges of terrorism and conspiracy to maim and \nmurder. That seems to be a technicality. According to the Good Friday \naccord negotiations, the IRA had been dropped from the Federal \nGovernment's ``Dirty 30,'' the list of officially recognized terrorist \norganizations. If the IRA had stayed on this list, his conviction would \nbe automatic. Because of that delisting, however, Federal authorities \nhad to show that the weapons had been smuggled ``with the specific \nintent to murder or maim.''\n  A specific intent offense requires a level of proof that is \nsignificant. Even though they failed in this level of proof, Mr. \nClaxton's contact and his own admission of the involvement with the IRA \nstrongly suggests that he, too, was involved in terrorist activities.\n  We have a situation in which, because of the gun show loophole, there \nis mounting evidence that criminals have access to weapons and indeed \nterrorists have access to these weapons. The amendment Senator McCain \nand I will propose will close this gun show loophole without unduly \nburdening gun show operators. It will also not interfere with the \noperation of unlicensed gun dealers.\n  I have suggested, by pointing out specific incidents, a situation \nwhere individuals have used the gun show loophole. Let me say in \nconclusion that the vast majority of individuals participating in these \ngun shows, licensed and unlicensed dealers, are law-abiding individuals \nwho have no intent to defeat the law. But as long as we have such a \nlow, virtually nonexistent threshold, there will be a few--and there \ncertainly will probably be more--criminals and terrorists who will seek \nto avoid the responsibilities under the gun laws.\n\n  I think it is entirely appropriate to pass this legislation to close \nthis gun show loophole and to ensure simply that at a gun show everyone \nis treated the same--licensed dealers and unlicensed dealers--and that \neveryone knows the rules. Gun shows now will require a background \ncheck.\n  I retain the remainder of my time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we have just heard an explanation as to why \nwe ought to change a law on gun commerce in this country. It has \nlargely been touted as a loophole. My contention this afternoon and my \ncontention has always been that there is not a loophole because if \nthere is one, it exists outside of gun shows if it exists inside of gun \nshows.\n  Gun shows are, in fact, a mirror image of gun commerce in this \ncountry. An individual can sell a gun without a federally licensed \nfirearm permit to do so, but if he or she is in the business of selling \nguns, then they have to have that license.\n  It is also true in gun shows. When you walk through the door of a gun \nshow, the law has not changed nor does it change. But under the McCain-\nReed amendment, they are suggesting it should change and that this \nparticular cloistered environment of a gun show ought to be something \nnew and different.\n  We have heard the explanation. Let me attempt to set the record \nstraight\n\n[[Page S1915]]\n\nthis afternoon because it is important we understand that an attempt is \nbeing made to set a whole new tranche of Federal regulations against \nwhat has historically been U.S. commerce that was legal and law-\nabiding.\n  Gun shows grew out of the firearms collectors associations that were \nformed as part of this country's commerce in legitimate firearms in the \nearly 20th century. Those associations remain active today and some \nbecame national and even international organizations and some sponsor \ngun shows.\n  Commercial gun shows first appeared largely after World War II. They \nare large, well-advertised public events in convention centers and \nsimilar facilities. Annually, some 4 million people attend gun shows. \nFour million people attend these kinds of efforts in gun commerce.\n  Behind me is a picture of a typical gun show. I have attended \nnumerous of them over the years. You will see all kinds of displays, \nfrom educational material to actual firearms.\n  Gun shows provide an opportunity for people interested in gun \nselecting and in the shooting sports to examine and learn about many \ndifferent types of firearms, as well as to buy and to sell or to trade \nguns, ammunition, and related materials. Notice I said ``to buy and to \nsell or to trade guns, ammunition, and related materials.'' Right now \nif you are buying and selling and moving guns and ammunition and \nrelated material for your living and you are in the commerce of \nfirearms, you have to be a federally licensed firearm dealer. But if \nyou are a collector, if you are an individual and you do not commerce \nin guns, you do not make your living by doing commerce in guns, you do \nnot have to be federally licensed. But you could still go to a gun \nshow, you could still rent a table, and you could sell an occasional \nfirearm.\n  Why? Because the law outside is the same law today that is inside, \nand the Reed-McCain amendment would say: Oh, no, we have now \nestablished for you the raw example of the unique thing that goes on at \na gun show and, therefore, it ought to be licensed. What they fail to \nsay is, but in the back streets of America where there are gun \ntraffickers and black market dealers, we would really like to license \nthem, too, but, of course, they are criminals and you cannot get them \nlicensed, and they won't play by the rules.\n  To suggest that guns are sometimes sold at a gun show that might \nenter into a criminal act, I am not going to stand here and deny that \nbecause guns that are bought from legitimate licensed firearm dealers, \nbought by a straw person are finding their way into misuse for criminal \npurposes. That is the reality of the world in which we live, but that \nis not the norm.\n  Finally, at the end of all of this debate, Senator Reed acknowledged \nthat a very large majority of those who attend gun shows are law-\nabiding, honest citizens who go there for all the right purposes. But \nhe is suggesting that we have to have this one little special dot on \nthe legal map because it is uniquely different from everything that \ngoes on outside of a gun show.\n  If you want to traffic in guns, you can set up across the street from \na gun show, and yet his law would not pertain to that person. If they \nhappen to be standing out there and open the trunk of their car and try \nto persuade people who come in and out of a gun show that they ought to \nbuy from them, isn't that somehow a misconception of reality? I think \nit is.\n  Gun shows are also important venues for those interested in the \ngeneral ownership of guns and the general manufacture of them. Gun \nrights groups frequently set up booths at gun shows and distribute \nliterature. Attendees share information to work together to protect \nwhat I believe is their constitutionally mandated right in this country \nto have fair, open access to firearms. Therefore, gun shows are an \nimportant part of what we in this country call the political process.\n  Free speech under the first amendment--I know in going to gun shows, \na lot of dialog ensues between those who are attending. Why? Because \nthey are advocates; because they are collectors; because they are vocal \nin their constitutional rights.\n  It is estimated that more than 1,000 commercial gun shows are held \neach year in this country. A typical gun show will have approximately \n300 exhibitors offering items for sale and educational display. The \npaid public attendance at an average gun show can be estimated at about \n4,000 people. Generally, gun shows are held in a 2- or 3-day timeframe \nover a weekend. Larger shows attract exhibitors and patrons from \nhundreds if not thousands of miles away.\n  Gun shows today are regulated by State law in relation to gathering \nand commerce and by local ordinances as is appropriate for all large \ngatherings that cities would want to know about and have registered.\n  Let us talk about statistics. I think I can, by what I just said, \nestablish the long tradition of gun shows in this country, some 1,000 \nof them starting in the early part of this century, largely following \nWorld War II.\n  In the mid-eighties, the National Institutes of Justice sponsored a \nstudy of how convicted felons in 12 States obtained their guns. One of \nits findings was that gun shows were such a tiny source of crime guns \nthat they were not even worth reporting as a separate figure. That was \nin the eighties.\n  In 1997, the National Institutes of Justice report called ``Homicide \nin 8 U.S. Cities'' actually covered more than homicides, which put the \nnumber of crime guns from gun shows at or around 2 percent by that \nstatistic.\n  In 2000, a BJS study of Federal firearms offenders, 1992 through \n1998, found that 1.7 percent of Federal prison inmates obtained their \nguns from gun shows; in other words, a statistic that will show up, but \na very minor one in reality of the total misuse of firearms in our \ncountry.\n  The most recent study done by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, \nNovember 2001, found that less than 1 percent of crimes committed \ninvolving the use of firearms utilized guns obtained at gun shows, \nincluding sales by fully licensed firearm dealers at gun shows; in \nother words, those who were doing background checks.\n  This was the largest study of its kind based on an investigation of \n18,000 convicted felons. According to these reports, most criminals get \nguns from theft, burglary, black market, friends, or family.\n  The one inconsistent study is misleading. In January of 1999, the \nJustice and Treasury Departments published the result of a study on gun \nshows, Brady checks, and crime gun traces, concluding that nonlicensee \nfirearm sales at gun shows contributed to trafficking in crime guns, \nthe use of firearms in drug crimes and crimes of violence. The study, \nbased upon an examination of 314 ATF criminal investigations, \nrecommended additional legislation to deal with so-called loopholes. \nThat is where the word began to appear in 1999.\n  However, the study does not show that occasional gun sales by one-\ntime sellers at gun shows significantly contributed to illegal \ntrafficking. They made the argument, but they did not make their case. \nThe majority, 54 percent, of investigations involved unlicensed persons \nwho were actually dealing in firearms without the required Federal \ndealer license, which is a felony and may be prosecuted under the law.\n  What they found out is that when it did happen, it was happening by \nthose who were already trafficking in guns. The reason they found out \nis they were able to arrest them because they were already violators of \nthe law. The Federal firearms laws were at work, and that is how we got \nthe statistics because we used the laws to investigate and apprehend \nthe bad guys.\n  Twenty-three percent of the investigations involved violations of \nexisting law by Federal licensees; for example, illegal sales to straw \npurchasers, persons with clean backgrounds who acquired firearms for \nthe actual purchasers. Even the Reed-McCain bill would not screen out a \nstraw man. Somebody with a clean record could acquire a firearm for \nsomeone else, complete the sale, take it out, and hand it off. Does \nthis great new loophole plugger solve it? Not at all. That hole cannot \nbe plugged when somebody lies and they happen to have a clean \nbackground.\n  In 23 percent of the cases where they are now citing examples, folks \nsimply lied. They did not tell the truth, and if one does not tell the \ntruth and they have a clean background and the NICS system cannot pick \nit up, then that\n\n[[Page S1916]]\n\nperson is legitimate in the eyes of the law and in the eyes of a \nlicensed firearm dealer.\n  The point is, in all of these crimes, under current law they were \napprehended, and the vast majority of them are just that.\n  Now we hear a new argument: Terrorists and terrorism, and somehow the \nterrorists who are going to create havoc on the American public are \ngoing to go to a gun show, and he cited one buying an M-16--only that \nwas not to do damage here, it was to do damage outside the country--and \ntherefore we ought to put new restrictions on law-abiding citizens.\n  All I can say is, the great havoc that was wreaked on this country on \n9/11 by terrorists was not by a gun purchased at a gun show. For the \nterrorists, the weapon of choice that did so much damage to our country \nhappened to be a jet airliner and not an M-16 that was due to be \nexported.\n  Senator Reed speaks the truth because these terrorists we now find, \nwho are apprehended and behind bars, were arrested because they were \noperating illegally under current law in many instances. If someone \nlied about their background, they cannot be found, but if they are \nillegal and undocumented in this country, it is a violation to go to a \ngun show and buy a gun. So one deals with an individual purchase and \nnot a licensed dealer. That is so rare and so minuscule that if Senator \nReed thinks that hole can be plugged by sticking one's finger in it, \nthey are simply diverted to the street where they know they can acquire \na gun, but the price is probably going to be a lot more.\n\n  All of that is the tragic environment in which we live, but what is \nimportant to say about the so-called ``loophole'' is, if one walks into \na gun show and only in there a loophole exists, they can walk out of \nthe gun show and it does not exist because they are not proposing to \nchange current law where all commerce in firearms must be background \nchecked.\n  Any individual citizen in this country can sell a firearm they own to \nhis or her neighbor, and they do not have to do a background check--nor \nshould they. But if they are legitimate, or if they are commercing or \nmaking their living in firearms, they are going to have to get a \nlicense and they are going to have to do a background check. That is \nthe law, and that is the way it ought to be.\n  So, again, this is a political placebo for a problem that so rarely--\nI say rarely--exists, and it does rarely exist.\n  I listened very carefully to all of those he listed whom we found out \nto be violators of law. That is why he could list them, because they \nwere already arrested under current Federal firearms laws, and that is \nwhy many of them are doing time.\n  So the answer to the problem is to stack a new law on top of law-\nabiding citizens at a thousand gun shows, and for the Federal \nGovernment to step into the business of regulating commerce in this \narea saying that in some way it might protect the average citizen.\n  Again, I point to the picture behind me. There is the average gun \nshow in America. Nearly 4,000 people attend each one, and there are \nover 1,000 of them. Does the loophole exist? Well, when we look at the \nstatistics from the report that bore the name of the loophole that they \nare now using, we find out those statistics just do not hold up; that \nwhat happened at a gun show can happen outside a gun show.\n  The reality is, one simply cannot make the holes in the sieve tight \nenough to stop everybody. Tighten it as we will, every time we do we \nstep much harder on the private law-abiding citizen than we do the \ncriminal or terrorist element in the world because they know they can \nplay outside the law because the rest of us are required to play inside \nthe law. That is the reality of any law, whether it be a gun law or \nanything else. We know that.\n  That is the history of law. That is the history of those who choose \nto play outside of it and break the law, and the gun show loophole will \ndo nothing to change that. It will simply divert the commerce outside \nthe building instead of inside the building, if someone chooses to \noperate illegally or outside the law.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I make a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. May I inquire how much time is allocated to each individual \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island controls 9 \nminutes. The Senator from----\n  Mr. WARNER. May I ask that the parliamentary inquiry be done outside \nthe time constraint? I pose this inquiry to our distinguished floor \nleader, the Senator from Idaho. I am reading from the Record of the \nSenate on Thursday of last week when the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho said the following:\n\n       I am sure there are some Members on both sides who might \n     have amendments that were not listed to be considered for \n     votes today and/or Tuesday. What I would ask them to do is to \n     come to the Chamber and talk to Senator Reed and myself to \n     see if we might work those out. Certainly, we are happy to \n     take a look at them. There may be an opportunity late Tuesday \n     and possibly Friday to offer additional amendments. The \n     unanimous consent request does not preclude any Member from \n     doing that.\n\n  I wrote the distinguished majority leader a letter on November 18 \nlast year indicating that I wanted to offer an amendment on this bill, \nand I received back a reply from Mr. Schiappa, who had the authority to \naddress this, that said it has been noted. So I have tried to \ndiligently follow the rules and procedures by which to bring up an \namendment. On Friday morning----\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend, I need to find \nout who yields time.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent the parliamentary inquiry be \naddressed by the Chair outside the time agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Reserving the right to object, we have a time problem. \nThat is, at 4 o'clock we go off these two amendments that have been \noffered, and we go to Senator Bingaman. And we have a 5 o'clock \ndeadline in which there will be a vote on the Bingaman amendment. So \nany time you use now, you are eating somebody's time because of the \nfixed times we have set before us.\n  I will not object to your inquiry at the moment but understand you \ncannot effectively allocate yourself time without changing the \nunderlying unanimous consent, which I do not want to allow to happen \nfor the sake of the 5 o'clock vote and the debate on the Bingaman \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. Then if I could quickly ask the distinguished floor \nleaders----\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me yield the distinguished Senator 2 minutes of time \nfor the purposes of this question.\n  Mr. WARNER. I see my colleague from Michigan. He, likewise, offered \nan amendment on Friday morning. My understanding is his is the pending \namendment following the Bingaman vote; is that correct?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I believe that is the unanimous consent; that is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could I then ask unanimous consent my amendment, also \noffered on Friday morning in good faith, pursuant to the instructions \nyou laid down, be the pending amendment following that?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Following?\n  Mr. WARNER. Following the Senator from Michigan?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Reserving the right to object, following the amendment of \nthe Senator from Michigan?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct, whatever disposition the Senator makes \non that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. First of all, we have a UC. I will not object to that \nrequest.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. REED. Reserving the right to object.\n  MR. LEVIN. I would make inquiry.\n  Mr. REED. May I make a point? All of this would be subject to the \nunderlying unanimous consent that all amendments also are withdrawn \ntomorrow morning.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could the Senator speak up a bit?\n  Mr. REED. I understand that under the controlling unanimous consent \nthat all amendments are withdrawn tomorrow morning. So if your \namendment was in order after Senator Levin, I think both amendments \ntechnically at this point would be withdrawn tomorrow morning.\n\n[[Page S1917]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, I would do everything I can \nreasonably do to obtain disposition of my amendment before 8 o'clock or \nwhatever time it is tomorrow morning. So I ask the Senator from \nVirginia as to whether his unanimous consent request is that his \namendment be in order following the disposition of my amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is how I so stated my UC.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the UC is that following the disposition of the Levin \namendment the amendment of the Senator from Virginia would then be the \npending amendment, I would have no objection to that, providing that is \nthe way it is presented.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. I hear no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing no objection----\n  Mr. REED. Reserving my right once more to object again, the \nunderstanding, of course, is that all of these amendments are withdrawn \ntomorrow morning.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object now, Mr. President, that \nassumes they have not been disposed of prior to tomorrow morning or \naccording to some modification of the pending unanimous consent \nagreement. I am not willing to agree that my amendment will still be \npending tomorrow at that hour, nor am I willing to agree that we could \nnot work out some modification of the unanimous consent agreement, \nwhich is now pending, to allow for the disposition of my amendment at \nsome point before or after that appointed hour tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, with that discussion I understand the \nunanimous consent is still operative? Until I understand clearly where \nwe are, so that none of this language in any way undererodes the \nunderlying unanimous consent, which means that all amendments that \nmight be up but have not yet been disposed of by the opening of \nbusiness on Tuesday morning fall, I would have to object at this point \nbecause that underlying agreement cannot be eroded.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time I am not trying to seek in \nany way by my UC to modify that request. It is simply that I be \nconsidered after the disposition of the Levin amendment. It is a very \nsimple procedural request.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield to the Senator from Virginia for an inquiry.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague. I \nthink we clarified among ourselves the parliamentary situation of this \nmatter. I therefore ask, at the conclusion of the disposition of the \nLevin amendment, whatever that may be, is the amendment by the Senator \nfrom Virginia in order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer. I thank my \ncolleagues.\n  I rise today in support of the Feinstein/Warner amendment to \nreauthorize the assault weapons ban.\n  Signed into law in 1994, the assault weapons ban placed a 10-year \nprohibition on the domestic manufacture, transfer, or possession of \nsemi-automatic assault weapons and the transfer and possession of high \ncapacity ammunition clips. The 10-year ban ends on September 13, 2004. \nConsequently, unless Congress and the President act prior to September \n13, 2004, weapons like Uzis and AK-47s will once again be produced in \nAmerica, and more and more often, these weapons will fall into the \nhands of criminals who lurk in our neighborhoods.\n  For a number of years, President Bush has indicated that he supports \nrenewing the assault weapons ban for another decade. Although his \nadministration has not presented a bill to date, it recently reiterated \nhis support for the renewal. Consequently, we introduced a bill, S. \n2109, that achieves his goal: extending the law, without any changes, \nfor another 10 years.\n  The Feinstein/Warner amendment that we debate today is the exact text \nof S. 2109.\n  Some in the Senate, myself included, opposed the ban a decade ago, \nfearing it would do little to reduce crime, and could threaten the \nConstitutional rights of law-abiding gun-owners and hunters.\n  However, a decade of experience has provided us with key facts. The \nassault weapons ban has made our communities safer. Recent Department \nof Justice records indicate that the use of banned assault weapons in \ncrimes has declined measurably--by 65 percent in one analysis--since \nthe measure took effect.\n  Moreover, it is clear that the assault weapons ban has in no way \nchallenged legitimate gun-owners' rights. Let me state, without \nhesitation, the vast majority of gun owners are law-abiding citizens \nwho responsibly keep their guns. As a gun-owner myself, I have long \nbeen a supporter of the Second Amendment. I remember well the day my \nfather gave me my first gun, and I have spent most of my life around \nguns, both with antiques and in hunting.\n  The assault weapons ban only bans a small percentage of all weapons--\nthose military-style assault weapons, that have no hunting or sporting \npurpose, and that are just used to create mass destruction.\n  Furthermore, our world has changed dramatically from 10 years ago. \nSeptember 11, 2001, has taught us many lessons; among them that \nterrorism lurks in our own cities and communities. Given the current \nworld situation, it defies logic to let a good law expire, and in so \ndoing let suicidal terrorists and others simply walk up to a counter \nand buy these weapons for potential attacks.\n  It is for these reasons that my thinking on the assault weapons ban \nhas evolved over the last 10 years, and for these reasons that I join \nwith Senator Feinstein in sponsoring legislation to extend the assault \nweapons ban another 10 years.\n  Not only does President Bush support the continuation of these \nprotections; men and women of law enforcement across the Nation join \nhim, because, being on the front lines, they know it makes communities \nsafer. I note that several sheriffs and chiefs of police, all across \nVirginia, have written to me indicating their support for reauthorizing \nthe assault weapons ban, as has the Virginia State Lodge of the \nFraternal Order of Police.\n  Now, over my 25 years plus in the United States Senate, I have always \ntried to stand up for what is right, regardless of politics. I believe \nthat is why the good people of the Commonwealth of Virginia have given \nme their trust and elected me to represent them in the United States \nSenate.\n  I know that reauthorizing the assault weapons ban is the right thing \nto do.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, could I once again determine how much time \nis available to all the participants?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island has 9 minutes; \nthe Senator from California, 6 minutes; the Senator from Idaho, 37 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 3:35 \nSenator Schumer be recognized for 5 minutes, from the time of Senator \nFeinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. REED. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I listened quite attentively to my \ncolleague, the Senator from Idaho, talk about gun shows and the need or \nlack of necessity to close the gun show loophole. It struck me there is \nsomething quite a bit different between a private\n\n[[Page S1918]]\n\nsale and a sale through a gun show. Again, not the law but the logic. \nMost private sales involve people who know each other. In fact, for a \nhome sale you invite the person into the home to offer them the sale of \na weapon. It is quite different from a gun show, as the picture \nindicated. These are huge events. These are supermarkets for firearms. \nNo individual has the knowledge of the perhaps hundreds or even \nthousands of people who might come up to them and offer to purchase a \nweapon. In that case, the very particular specialized case of a gun \nshow, the need for a background check seems obvious. That is why we \ninsist that Federal licensed firearms dealers conduct such a check.\n  To argue that this is some aberration, that this gun show loophole \namendment we are proposing somehow turns the law on its head, is \ncompletely wrong. Again, here is a situation where these unlicensed \nsellers have very little, if any, knowledge of the thousands of people \nwho come up to them, which of those people is a terrorist or a criminal \nseeking to exploit the gun law. That is what has happened. These \nindividuals I referred to have been captured and prosecuted. But there \nare, I am sure, many others who avoid capture and prosecution.\n  There are those today in this situation. Anyone could. Anyone \nlistening today--I hope they don't take this as direction or guidance--\nbut understanding that, they could walk up to an unlicensed dealer, \nfind an unlicensed dealer and ask to purchase a weapon and do that.\n  Again, the cases seem compelling. Nigel Bostic and two accomplices \nwere arrested for buying 239 firearms at 11 Ohio gun shows. Here is a \nteam of people systematically using gun shows to acquire 239 weapons \nwhich they then sold to criminals in Buffalo, NY. One was recovered in \na homicide. I don't know how many others were involved. That is just \none example, and there are more examples than this.\n  It seems to me this makes obvious sense that we cannot have a \nsituation where there are two standards, for a licensed dealer and for \nan unlicensed dealer at the same place, in a public setting, in a place \nthat is advertising the sale of guns. This is not a situation where you \nare at home or you have a weapon in your garage that you would like to \nsell to someone who came by. You have a friend. You were talking at the \nlocal doughnut shop and discovered that you and your friend have an \ninterest in common, firearms, and you decide: Come back to my place; \nI'll show you a weapon.\n  That is not a gun show, and our amendment does not reach those \nactivities.\n  It is clear, it is logical, it is consistent, it is fair, and it sets \na common standard.\n  This amendment will not disrupt gun shows. California has a statute \nthat not only requires background checks at all sales but a 10-day \nwaiting period for gun shows, and they still have gun shows. In fact, I \nam told their gun shows are quite popular and quite successful. This \namendment is about common sense. It is about dealing with problems \nwhich we know exist--Columbine showed us that--and the arrest of \ncriminals who are engaged in conspiracies to exploit the gun show \nloophole. We have evidence of terrorists--real terrorists--who are \naware of this who have tried to use it.\n  I don't think we can be so sanguine as to say we know how terrorists \nwill attack us, that they will always choose an airline or they will \nalways choose explosives. They will choose the way that is most \ndisruptive to our life and which will cause the most damage. That could \ninvolve in some way, shape, or form exploiting the gun show loophole.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor, retaining the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, we know a great deal about gun shows. We \nknow thousands of Americans go there each year--law-abiding citizens \nwho are collectors, who are avid sportsmen, hunters, and target \nshooters. They go for information. They go to access collections of \nlibraries of gun manuals. Many people who respect firearms and collect \nthem like to have the manuals on how they were manufactured, and the \nballistics of particular firearms. All of those are available at gun \nshows.\n  What is most important is to try to plug a loophole which I argue \nclearly does not exist today, or it exists outside of gun shows, \nbecause we are all operating under the same law whether you are inside \nthe door of a gun show or outside the door of a gun show.\n  Senator Reed mentioned three terrorists and talked about how they had \nused a gun show. They were apprehended, they were prosecuted, and they \nwere convicted under existing law. Did they break the law? Yes. That is \nhow they were apprehended and convicted. It appears the law is working \nand working quite well at this moment. In fact, we are more aware today \nof terrorist activity and undocumented people in our country's \nactivities than we ever were before, and it took a tragic event to \ncause that to happen.\n  I received the amendment about 3 hours ago, and I did not have a \nchance to look at it in detail as it relates to the original amendment \nintroduced by Senator McCain and Senator Reed. I must say considerable \nchange has been made. Of course, the Senator admitted that. But there \nis a great deal left in the bill which I think dramatically alters the \nnature of gun shows and the bureaucracy and the Federal involvement in \nthe law-abiding commerce of firearms that we are not talking about.\n  The McCain-Reed 24-hour wait is in fact a smokescreen. The bill \nprovides the wait may be reduced to 24 hours if a State applies for the \nprivilege of improving its records after the fact, after it happened. \nIn other words, if it happened and when it happened, then only may \naccommodate, but with no real incentive for States or the Federal \nGovernment to improve records even though we are pushing hard to make \nthat happen. It is a complicated and expensive process. There is no \nreason to think the 24-hour check would ever be achieved. Even if a \nState did switch to 24 hours, the change is strictly optional and could \nbe reserved for an anti-gun State government--well, you know in this \ninstance you are going to get the irregular application of the McCain-\nReed law if it were to become law.\n  With a 3 business-day period still allowed to check out-of-State \nrecords, a few large States could drag down the whole scheme for all \ntransfers across the country. In other words, the Federal bureaucracy \nreigns supreme against a legitimate action of commerce that today is \nregulated only by Federal law as it relates to licensed dealers \nspecific to their action and only those who make their living \ncommercing in a law-abiding way in firearms.\n  The McCain-Reed amendment makes no instant check improvements, unlike \nS. 890, and the Senator referenced that. The bill provides no funding \nto criminal upgrades. Hopefully, we can get that accomplished in the \nnear future. I am certainly in favor of that--the carrot and the \nstick--to make States comply so the NICS background check is \nlegitimate, is effective, and certainly has within its recordkeeping \nthe range of violations of law that makes an individual ineligible for \nacquiring a firearm.\n  McCain-Reed gives no priority to gun shows. Remember, we are talking \nabout a weekend event. Yet if the system were active, there is no \npriority to move that check to the front of the list to make it happen \nin those areas where there might be a question--and there oftentimes \nare. It does not mean a person is a violator of the law or has within \nhis or her background something, but there possibly is a triggering \nthat needs further investigation.\n  Does this offer the priority? No, we know it does not. Sometimes law-\nabiding citizens travel hundreds of miles, if not thousands of miles, \nto some of these gun show events, some of the larger ones in the \ncountry, and to not be able to transact their commerce and leave with \nreasonable time involved just does not make a lot of sense. They\n\n[[Page S1919]]\n\ncan do it outside the door of the gun show; they cannot do it inside \nthe door of the gun show. Today, how you act is legal based on your \nadherence to law. That transaction can occur inside or outside the door \nof the gun show.\n  Most importantly, McCain-Reed ignores the real problem. Multiple \ngovernment studies have proven that gun shows are not the source of \ncrime. But because there was once a crime report that mentioned the \nword ``loophole,'' all the romance of that word, somehow out there they \ncan catch the ear of the American public suggesting that here is a hole \nthat all types of criminals and terrorists are getting through to gain \naccess to firearms.\n  The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports in ``Firearm Use By \nOffenders Found'' that less than 1 percent of U.S. crime guns come from \ngun shows. The 2001 study was based on an interview of 18,000 prison \ninmates and is the largest such study ever conducted by the Government \nunder legitimate polling and informational-gathering terms.\n  That is a pretty significant figure, 1 percent--a significant figure \nif you want to compare that to establishing a whole new bureaucracy and \ncontrolling over 1,000 legitimate gun shows on an annual basis.\n  The Bureau of Justice Statistics study is consistent with a previous \nstudy. The 2000 study, ``Federal Firearm Offenders,'' as reported in \n1992 and 1998, found that 1.7 percent of Federal prison inmates \nobtained their guns from a gun show.\n  Similarly, the National Institute of Justice, 1997 study, ``Homicides \nIn Eight United States Cities'' reported less than 2 percent. All of \nthe studies are hovering in that 1 to 1\\1/2\\ percent range on the \naverage. Those are the realities of what we are dealing with.\n\n  We are today trying to drag down a very important law in this country \nor the very important effort to change law in this country to protect \nlegitimate commerce and legitimate manufacturers and those who are \nlicensed gun dealers by cluttering up, in my words, S. 1805 in a way \nthat might drag it down.\n  The McCain-Reed bill, S. 1807, masquerades as reform, imposing \nbureaucratic restrictions aimed at shutting down gun shows without \nfixing real problems on the national instant background check.\n  The Senator deserves credit. We have worked together to try to make \nthose improvements. I want a background check. I want no law-abiding \ncitizen to be blocked from acquiring a gun or making it difficult to \ndo. For those who have in their background those kinds of records that \nviolate the law, we want to check them and keep them out of the \nbusiness of owning a gun.\n  Despite changes from the Lautenberg juvenile justice amendment of \n1999 that is based on the new compromise bill like its parent, S. 890 \nfails to address gun shows most significant concern and would create, \nagain, massive liability for gun show promoters who would likely drive \ngun shows into extinction.\n  The rhetoric is one thing. No, we are not out to close gun shows. The \npractical application is another. Gun show promoters who play by all \nthe rules, if you have substantially put them at risk by liability, \nthey will step back. Again, you close another door for the legitimate \ncitizen who would attempt to acquire a firearm in a logical way.\n  McCain-Reed creates massive bureaucratic redtape. That is reasonable \nto assume. Certainly the author of the amendment can say one thing, the \nATF in its administration and the regulations that would be written \nwould be quite another.\n  McCain-Reed turns what can oftentimes be a casual conversation into a \ngun show sale. Let me give an example. If you are a gun show active \nparticipant, you go, attend, you like to walk around and look at the \ndisplays; you see a firearm you like. But you decide not to buy it at \nthat time. But you know a given dealer has it, or an individual in this \ncase, because a dealer--you would obviously be protected by the Federal \nlaw and the need for a background check. This is an exhibitor, a \ncollector, who is not required by law to adhere to that standard.\n  Some weeks later you have convinced your wife that maybe that is \nreally the firearm you ought to own and you pick up the phone and call \nhim because you took their business card and you buy the weapon. Is \nthat a transaction of a gun show? I don't think it is clear in the \nMcCain-Reed amendment. Is that person, by that telephone call, in \nviolation of the law? He may not be, but if the person who owns the gun \nsays, great, I will sell it to you, come over and pick it up, or I will \narrive at a point in time where we can meet and exchange the necessary \npurchase to do so, are they in violation of the law? I don't know. This \nunenforceable system makes it arguable whether that is the kind of \nthing that would happen.\n  Those are some of the preliminary questions I have at first glance at \nthis amendment that we saw several hours ago which is different from \nwhat has been originally produced over the years that certainly would \nhave created substantial bureaucratic redtape. At the same time, there \nis a simple premise here that we ought not ignore. We are now setting \ngun shows apart as a separate and unique form of commerce for law-\nabiding citizens in the exercise of their second amendment rights. All \nthat can go on inside the door of the gun show can go on outside the \ndoor of the gun show.\n  So if that is the basis of the argument that step one is to control \nthe inside, I have to believe the desire is step two sometime down the \nroad, to work aggressively to control the outside. That is why I and \nothers who believe in our constitutional rights and our second \namendment rights believe the current laws that are on the books are \nadequate to effectively police the legitimate and legal commerce of \nfirearms in our country. That is why I hope Senators will vote this \namendment down. We want to keep S. 1805 clean.\n  The President and the administrative policy statement urged us to \nkeep this bill clean so it can become law this year instead of simply \nfall because the goal of those who are gun control advocates in the \nSenate would load it up in a way that it would be too heavy to move \nback through the Senate and back through the House or through a \nconference.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum if all time can \nbe taken equally from both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I make a parliamentary inquiry and ask how \nmuch time is remaining for the various parties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island has 3\\1/2\\ \nminutes; the Senator from California, 5\\1/2\\ minutes; the Senator from \nIdaho, 19 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, just very briefly, I would like to respond \nto two points that the Senator from Idaho made. One is the suggestion \nthat the Federal study of the felons indicates a very low number of \npeople who have used gun shows to get weapons.\n  I would be very curious to study State prisons because it is in the \nState prisons you find more people who are convicted of crimes such as \nhomicides and armed robberies and burglaries. Federal laws usually \nencompass more white-collar criminals, although there are a significant \nnumber of criminals in jail under Federal drug trafficking charges.\n  But I think the studies we have seen suggest, very strongly--and the \nATF has suggested very strongly--that gun shows are a source of a \nsignificant number of weapons.\n  I also point out, in response to the Senator from Idaho, the \nsuggestion that this is going to disrupt gun shows, create very \ndifficult matters of interpretation so that individuals will be so \nconfused that gun shows will wither on the vine, I think that could not \nbe further from the truth.\n  Let me point out that States have already stepped up and passed \nlegislation to close this loophole, to require everyone who is selling \nweapons at a gun show--regardless of their license status--to involve a \nbackground check on a potential purchaser.\n  In North Carolina, in 2003, there were 76 gun shows. I am told, \nactually, North Carolina is ahead of the rest of the country in \ndeveloping their data\n\n[[Page S1920]]\n\nsystem for instant checks. So there is one example where a State has \nclosed a gun show loophole, but gun shows continue to thrive. In fact, \nNorth Carolina has the distinction of having the most gun shows in the \nyear 2003, from our records. I am sorry, Wisconsin had 88. So they \neclipsed them. And Florida had 111. But North Carolina is among the top \n10, at least.\n  I think that is an example to demonstrate this will not undermine gun \nshows. It will not impose undue burdens on individuals, people who wish \nto sell weapons and people who wish, honestly and legally, to acquire \nthem. So I believe this amendment is compelled by the evidence we have \nseen.\n  Now, the Senator from Idaho has indicated the law has worked. It \ncertainly did not work for that police officer in Garland, TX, who was \nkilled by a weapon that apparently flowed through people exploiting the \ngun show loophole. And it certainly did not work for the 13 children at \nColumbine High School.\n  I think we can make it work. I think we can make it work if we adopt \nthe Reed-McCain amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, time will be charged proportionately to all \nsides.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, time is running on both sides, and \nrunning out rapidly, because at 4 o'clock Senator Bingaman will have \nthe floor for the purpose of offering an amendment.\n  So I want to make some concluding remarks, at least for today, as it \nrelates to the gun show loophole amendment.\n  I think, clearly, we have established that there are well over 1,000 \ngun shows commercially in this country that are registered and abide by \nthe law, some 300 exhibitors on the average, and some 4,000 people who \nattend each show on a regular basis. And the law that is currently on \nthe books outside of the gun show is appropriately and legally and \nnecessarily on the books inside the gun show.\n  So how does the word ``loophole'' appear? Well, it appeared out of a \nspecial study that said, yes, rarely but on occasion--those are my \nwords, not the study's words--does somebody get a gun out of a gun show \nthat is used by them or someone else in the commission of a crime. And \nthe answer is, yes, around 1 percent. Oh, therefore, there must be a \nloophole.\n  Well, there is a loophole, and it is also outside of a gun show, if \nyou want to argue it from that standpoint. It is called the back \nstreets and the alleys and the car trunks and the drug traffickers who \ndeal in this illicit commerce for not good will, but for profit. \nUsually many acquire their firearms who then use them in the commission \nof a crime in another way.\n  Here is our problem with any kind of failure to do instant check. \nThat is, the 3-day waiting period is still in place. We know that. Gun \nshows, by their own activity, are a 2-day event. If you drive 100 miles \nor 200 or 300 miles to a show, you want to buy a gun that day. You want \nan instant background check. There is a waiting period involved in \nnormal commerce--I should put it this way: the Lautenberg amendment \nallowed a 3-day waiting period, the same as current law. That is the \nonly uniqueness I know to a gun show. It is like a flea market, from \nthe standpoint that you go there to buy, not to look and think and buy \nlater. You need instant capability to say yes or no. You are legitimate \nin that commerce. We are working hard to get there with federally \nlicensed firearm dealers.\n  Also, I argue those who are collectors and casual dealers at gun \nshows should not be tied to that law because they are not involved in \nmajor commerce. Those are some of the complications involved in this \ntype of restriction.\n  Then the last argument I place is a great frustration. Much of what \nwe do is impulse buying. But, then again, much of what we do isn't \nimpulse buying. If you are buying a $200 or $300 or $400 or $500 item, \nsometimes you have to go home and talk to somebody else about that kind \nof acquisition. So if you do and days later you call the individual who \nmay not be--well, if he or she isn't a dealer, they are not required to \ncomply with the background check, but are very legitimate and honest.\n  The question is, if their amendment were law, would you in fact be \ncausing that person to violate the law or forcing that individual to \nfind a way to do a background check when they were the collector or the \ncasual seller of a particular firearm? Those are, I believe, legitimate \nquestions that speak to the complication and frustration of stepping \ninto a commerce in which there are no Federal regulations today, other \nthan existing Federal law that governs the sale of firearms by licensed \ndealers.\n  Those are our concerns. Once again, I appeal to my colleagues to turn \ndown this amendment with a no vote, to keep S. 1805 clean, so we can \nget it to the President's desk, hoping it will become law.\n  I understand Senator Cornyn is on his way to the floor and hopes to \nspeak for a few moments on this issue. We hope he will be able to get \nhere before 4 o'clock when our time runs out on this particular \namendment.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I am informed Senator Schumer will not be \narriving to the floor. Since there was a unanimous consent that \nallocated 5 minutes to him from Senator Feinstein's time, I ask \nunanimous consent I be given any time remaining of Senator Feinstein \nand Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. How much time will that be?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That will be 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, one of the factual points that has to be \nstressed again and again is the national criminal background check \nsystem is very efficient and rapid. Ninety-one percent of background \nchecks take less than 5 minutes, so 91 percent of the checks involved \nin the sale under our amendment, by an unlicensed dealer, would be \nexpedited in a matter of minutes--less than 5 minutes. And 95 percent \nof these checks take less than 2 hours. This is not a burden that is \ngoing to undermine the ability of a licensed or unlicensed dealer to \noperate at a gun show, or for a gun show to operate at all.\n\n  The evidence before us suggests that in States which have not only \ninstant checks on all sales but also background checks, and sometimes \neven waiting periods, gun shows continue to operate. Again, this is not \ngoing to cause an undue burden on individuals who want to acquire a \nweapon.\n  The other factor I think has to be pointed out again is surveys of \ngun owners overwhelmingly support the idea of a background check \napplying to all sales at these shows. In a recent survey, 83 percent of \ngun owners said it makes sense. Again, the public nature of a gun \nshow--the inability for an individual to screen his customers is quite \ndifferent than a private sale or a transfer of a weapon between family \nmembers, and quite different than the transfer of weapons among people \nin a hunt club.\n  That is all protected in our amendment, because there is knowledge \nwho you are dealing with. Here, you could have literally hundreds of \nthousands of people come to your booth, look at a weapon, and say I \nwould like to buy. If there is no background check, how does that \nconscientious seller know if he is dealing with a criminal?\n  That is why I think the overwhelming number of gun owners and \nattendees at gun shows suggests this amendment would be helpful, not \nhurtful. And I agree. I urge my colleagues, when we lay the amendment \ndown tomorrow and when we vote, to support this amendment. It provides \na commonsense approach to ensuring there is an even and level playing \nfield so everybody who is participating in a gun show on both sides of \nthe transaction knows there will be a background check. I think it is \nparticularly important because we already have evidence of individuals \nwho are criminals who have exploited this loophole, and terrorists--\nthree we know by name--and, frankly, they are not in the business of \nbroadcasting their names. They understood the loophole, sought to \nexploit it and indeed, in some cases, they were successful--momentarily \nsuccessful.\n  We owe it to the safety of the public to ensure this gun show \nloophole is closed. The McCain-Reed amendment will do that. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n[[Page S1921]]\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I understand my colleague has reserved \nthe balance of the time to be granted to both Senators Feinstein and \nMcCain.\n  Mr. REED. No. Senator Schumer will not be here. I asked to be given \nthe remaining time to allocate to anybody who may come to speak.\n  Mr. CRAIG. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has 11 minutes, 50 \nseconds. The Senator from Rhode Island, 45 seconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Thank you, Madam President.\n  ``Momentarily,'' but they were caught. That is how my colleague just \nreferred to those three terrorists he highlighted as a major reason to \nestablish a new bureaucratic hurdle for law-abiding citizens. How were \nthey caught? They violated the law. They violated the current law that \ngoverns the sale of firearms, that controls, or hopefully controls, \nillegal aliens from acquiring firearms, and all the rest of it. That is \na recordable fact.\n  Did they acquire the firearms at a gun show? Maybe they did. Were \nthey caught? Yes. Does it mean the loophole stops that, that the sieve \nis so tight nothing falls through? I don't think it means that. If the \ndesire is there to acquire the gun, then they simply stand at the door. \nThe person or persons involved, if they are not licensed federally \nregulated firearms dealers, can step outside and, in a different \ntransaction, sell that weapon. That is the tragedy today of any \ncommerce, especially by those seeking to acquire illegally and seeking \nto do harm with that which they acquire--whether it be explosives or a \nfirearm of any kind. So walk into a gun show and say I would really be \ninterested in selling that firearm. But if you would meet me outside \nsomewhere, maybe I could buy it. I would hope 100 percent of those who \nare registered would never do that and 99.9 percent of them won't \nbecause they are law-abiding citizens and would not. If there is a \nloophole, there is another one, and that is the reality of what we are \ntrying to deal with.\n\n  Finally, let us understand that we have been able to reduce crime \nrates in this country and we have been able to save lives in this \ncountry when we said if you use a gun in the commission of a crime, you \ndo the time. No questions asked. You are not plea-bargained back to the \nstreet. You are not granted leniency. If you use the gun, you do the \ntime.\n  Time and again where that principle has been used, commission of a \ncrime with the use of a firearm drops dramatically. The fellow who was \nrobbing the 7-Eleven stores in Richmond with a baseball bat and caught \nwas asked by the authorities why he didn't use a gun. He said: Because \nif I did, they would have put me in prison. Because in Richmond they \nwere absolute in the prosecution of the law. So he chose another weapon \nto intimidate the operator of a 7-Eleven store.\n  Does the law work? You bet it works if it is enforced. We are finding \nout all new kinds of things about terrorists, and the reason we are \ntragically finding them out is because we were lax in our country. Gun \nshows are not the chosen venue by which the terrorist element acquires \nlethalness, and we know that to be a fact. We know less than 1 percent, \nor around that figure, of firearms that might be sold at gun shows \nsomehow find their way into criminal activity. Oh, and that is a reason \nto set up a whole new Federal bureaucracy, a brand new hurdle over \nwhich we ask the law-biding citizens to adhere? I think not.\n  The wonderful thing about law-abiding citizens is they obey the law. \nSometimes they are very frustrated by it, but they obey the law. Thank \ngoodness most of the citizens in our country believe so strongly in \nobeying the law.\n  All of the examples, I believe, Senator Reed has given and the reason \nhe can report on them is because the examples are of people who broke \nthe law, were apprehended by the law, and did the time or were \nconvicted and are serving time. That is the reality of what we are \nabout.\n  I am one of the coauthors of the NICS Instant Background Check \nSystem, and I am going to push to get it as accurate as we possibly \ncan, and we ought to apply that to all federally licensed firearm \ncommerce. But to suggest to the individual, whether they are inside the \ngun show or outside the gun show, that if you are not in the business \nof selling a firearm, you, too, must comply, I don't think that is the \ncase. I hope my colleagues will agree with me.\n  May I ask how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, the Senator from Texas having arrived, I \nsay to him I have 6 minutes left in the allocated time under the \nunanimous consent agreement and would be happy to yield to the Senator \nfor the use of that time.\n  I yield to the Senator from Texas all but 30 seconds of my remaining \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is it the Chair's understanding this amendment \nis just to be submitted?\n  Mr. CORNYN. To clarify, I send an amendment to the desk to be filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be received.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, this amendment is the gun owner privacy \nprotection amendment. This amendment actually will not change the laws \nthat currently exist, but it will continue a temporary provision that \nwas included in the omnibus appropriations bill that will otherwise \nexpire at the end of this fiscal year.\n  I believe when it comes to protecting the American people, the \ninstant background checks that are required upon the sale of firearms \nare a very important part of protecting the public. Principally, I \nbelieve it is important because it does, on a near instantaneous basis, \ndetermine who can legally purchase a firearm and who cannot. Indeed, it \nis a Federal crime for a convicted felon, or some other person who \ncannot legally possess a firearm, to purchase one and, conversely, for \nthe retailer to sell it. This provides an instantaneous piece of \nessential information when it comes to compliance with the law.\n  Of course, we know the primary threat, in terms of public safety, \ncomes from when career criminals illegally use firearms to commit \ncrimes, which they do typically from the time they get up in the \nmorning until the time they go to bed at night.\n  This would provide for the continuation of this privacy protection \nthat was contained in the omnibus appropriations bill.\n  It is specific. What this would require is 24 hours after a sale \ntakes place to a lawful gun owner--that is, there is no reason to limit \nor otherwise be concerned about the legality of that sale; it is as if \nthe gun were sold to you, me, Senator Reed, or Senator Craig--that it \nwould be required to be destroyed. The purpose of this, of course, is \nto determine the sale takes place to somebody who can legally purchase \nthe gun and is no threat to the public safety.\n  The purpose of the instant background check is not--I repeat not--for \nthe Government to maintain a permanent record of who owns firearms. \nThat invasion of personal privacy is not justified by any sound public \npolicy of which I am aware, and I think it would be altogether \nappropriate for those records of instant background checks to lawful \npurchasers be destroyed, as is currently the law, after no more than 24 \nhours.\n  I emphasize this does not change the requirement that dealers must \nkeep records of all firearms sales. Under current law, these records \nmust be retained for up to 20 years to help trace firearms purchases, \nand dealers must still comply with all Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \nFirearms and Explosives trace requests in the course of a criminal \ninvestigation.\n  Finally, for any instant background check that reveals a potential \nsale to an unlawful purchaser, those records would be retained, as they \nare under current law, and they would not be subject to destruction \nafter 24 hours.\n  I submit to my colleagues this would be altogether an appropriate way \nof protecting the privacy of gun owners of an important corollary to \nthe instant background checks which I believe have protected the \nAmerican people from felons and others who cannot legally purchase or \neven possess firearms, which is the policy of the current law.\n\n[[Page S1922]]\n\n  I yield back the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Texas for what I \nthink is a very sensible and responsible amendment as he proposed it. I \nwish it could become part of S. 1805. It will not have that opportunity \nat this time. I do believe in protecting law-abiding citizens and not \nallowing our Federal Government to develop a paper trail of the kind \nthat has no value other than to know what a private law-abiding citizen \nmay own in relation to a firearm.\n  These records ought to be destroyed, as the Senator clearly spelled \nout, in a 24-hour period. That is what is important about it. We are \nnot going to be able to get to this particular segment of the issue at \nthis time. I hope we will have the opportunity to do so.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Just very quickly because I have very little time, this \namendment does not create a new Federal bureaucracy. The national \ninstant criminal background check system exists. We simply are applying \nit to unlicensed dealers at gun shows.\n  Second, I have heard much this afternoon about the law working. It \nhas worked occasionally to punish terrorists and criminals who have \nused violence and weapons, but it has not worked as effectively to \nprevent harm to people who have been killed, the most obvious and most \nnotable, 13 young people at Columbine High School. The Reed-McCain, \nMcCain-Reed amendment can help prevent, we hope, this violence that so \noften strikes our communities.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nMexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Levin amendment is currently pending.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nbe set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2635\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] for himself and \n     Mr. Corzine, proposes an amendment numbered 2635.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To modify the definition of reasonably foreseeable)\n\n       On page 9, strike lines 1 and 2, and insert the following:\n\n     product, when used as intended or when used in a manner that \n     is reasonably foreseeable, provided that the term \n     ``reasonably foreseeable'' means the reasonable anticipation \n     that harm or injury is likely to result.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, my amendment would correct one of the \nmost obvious problems with S. 1805. In fact, what it would do is to \namend S. 1805 so that the bill would do more of what its proponents \nclaim they want to do.\n  The proponents of S. 1805 say its purpose is to bar frivolous or junk \nlawsuits against gun manufacturers and dealers. They define these \nfrivolous suits as situations in which the manufacturer and the dealer \nhave done nothing wrong, but situations where although they have done \nnothing wrong they are being sued when a perfectly good gun, but in a \nperfectly legal manner, is misused by a criminal to cause damage that \nneither the manufacturer nor the dealer intended or could have \nforeseen.\n  I have some sympathy with that concern. In my view, there ought to be \nsome protections against frivolous cases, but S. 1805 bars much more \nthan frivolous cases. It also bars cases where the injury is caused by \nan act or omission of the manufacturer or dealer where the gun was \ndefectively designed or manufactured and where that defective design or \nmanufacture was what caused the injury.\n  The National Rifle Association has distributed a statement opposing \nmy amendment. In that statement they say that S. 1805 does not prohibit \nreasonable suits in product defect cases where the firearm or \nammunition is used in a reasonably foreseeable manner.\n  That statement is blatantly false. S. 1805 says a person can bring a \nsuit for injury caused by a defective product if the injury is \nreasonably foreseeable, but then it goes on to say it is only \nreasonable to foresee injuries that occur when in all other respects \nthe gun is used in a lawful manner. In other words, we should not \nexpect a manufacturer of a gun to anticipate that anyone would ever be \ninjured from the use of that gun while some other law might be \nviolated.\n  This is contrary to common sense. It is analogous to saying that a \ncar manufacturer could only be held liable for a defective steering \nsystem in the car if the driver were in all other respects obeying all \ntraffic laws when the injury occurred. If the driver happened to be \nspeeding or had an expired license, then suit for the defective \nsteering system would be barred. That means all suits against the \nmanufacturer/dealer, not just by the driver of the car but by anyone \nelse who was injured, a pedestrian or a passenger in the car, would be \nbarred if we were to apply the same logic that we are applying in this \nbill to automobile manufacturers as well.\n  Let me explain a real-life situation where this problem occurred in \nmy home State and in our largest city of Albuquerque. In 1993, there \nwere three teenage boys, 14, 15 and 16, who were hanging out together \nat the house of the parents of the 14-year-old. Sean Smith was his \nname. They decided to go out for something to eat, and while they were \nout they were approached in a parking lot to see if they would be \nwilling to buy a gun along with some ammunition for that gun, and the \nprice quoted to them was $40.\n  The 15-year-old in the group, whose name was Michael, examined the \ngun's chamber and saw that it was empty. He took the ammunition \nmagazine and he inserted it in the gun since it was being offered as \npart of the package deal. He inserted it in the gun and he bought the \nwhole thing. Then they went back to Sean's house to continue to waste \ntime.\n  At the house, Michael took the magazine back out of the gun and they \ncontinued to pass the gun around while they were doing various other \nthings. All three of these teenagers thought the gun was unloaded since \nthe magazine had been taken out of the gun again.\n\n  While they were passing this gun around, one of the boys, as he later \nsaid, stupidly pulled the trigger and accidentally shot Sean, the \nyoungest of these three teenagers, who was talking on the telephone \nacross the room. A bullet hit him in the mouth. It seriously injured \nhim.\n  Sean and his parents filed suit against the manufacturer and \ndistributor, claiming that the gun was defectively designed in that \nthere was no warning that the gun might still be loaded even though the \nmagazine had been removed and there was no safety device on the gun to \nprevent it from being fired when the magazine had been removed.\n  The trial judge dismissed the case, but the New Mexico Court of \nAppeals said the case should have been allowed to proceed, and they \nreinstated the case. In doing so, they made a very key distinction. In \ntheir opinion, they said:\n\n       This is not a case where the plaintiffs are arguing that \n     this gun was per se defective and capable of being misused. \n     This is a case where the plaintiffs are saying that the \n     design of a gun was defective and that the designers and \n     manufacturers should have foreseen that an accident like this \n     could happen.\n\n  The court said that the jury should have been allowed to determine \nwhether this kind of injury was foreseeable with a gun designed in this \nway.\n  If S. 1805, as it currently exists on the Senate floor, is enacted \nwithout my amendment, this suit by Sean Smith and his parents will be \nbanned, and similar suits will be banned.\n  This is not just my opinion. This is the opinion of the Congressional \nResearch Service. In a memorandum to me last week, they stated that for \nthis case to avoid the bar that is imposed by S. 1805, the plaintiffs \nwould have to\n\n[[Page S1923]]\n\nshow two things. No. 1, they would have to persuade a jury that the \ninjury was reasonably foreseeable, but second, they would have to show \nthat in no other respect was the misuse of the weapon either criminal \nor unlawful.\n  The Congressional Research Service concludes that there is a New \nMexico criminal statute prohibiting the negligent use of a deadly \nweapon, and that this statute was violated here so that in their view \nthe suit would be barred under the language of S. 1805.\n  The truth is, in virtually every State in this country there is a \ncriminal statute prohibiting the negligent use of a deadly weapon. So \nwhat S. 1805 is saying is, if a person is injured by the negligent use \nof a gun, then the Congress is declaring that the designer, \nmanufacturer, and dealer cannot be sued even if the injury was the \nresult of the negligence of that designer, manufacturer, or dealer.\n  Congress is saying that regardless of the facts of the case, we in \nCongress are deciding that all such injuries are not reasonably \nforeseeable by those potential defendants.\n  I said that this conclusion contradicts all common sense. Let me also \npoint out in addition to that the tort laws of our States say you can \nsue people for injuries they suffer if the injuries were caused by the \nnegligence of the person you are suing and the person should have \nreasonably foreseen those injuries would occur. This is also black \nletter law, well recognized by the American Law Institute in their \nrestatement of torts, their Second Restatement of Torts, which I think \nis universally recognized as an accurate statement of the law in this \ncountry.\n  In section 302(a) of that restatement of torts, the ALI, the American \nLaw Institute, says:\n\n       An act or an omission may be negligent if the actor \n     realizes or should realize that it involves an unreasonable \n     risk of harm to another through the negligent or reckless \n     conduct of another or a third person.\n\n  Then, in 302(b), they go on to say:\n\n       An act or an omission may be negligent if the actor \n     realizes or should realize that it involves an unreasonable \n     risk of harm to another through the conduct of the other or a \n     third person which is intended to cause harm, even though \n     such conduct is criminal.\n\n  S. 1805 redefines what is reasonably foreseeable for companies that \nare in this particular business--this particular business being the \ndesigning, the manufacturing, and the selling of guns. It says that we \nmay want to require auto manufacturers to foresee that producing a \ndefective steering system could injure people, even people who are \nriding in cars where the driver is violating another law, but we will \nnot require that gun manufacturers foresee that producing a defective \ngun may injure people unless, in all other respects, there are no laws \nbeing violated.\n  So my amendment is very simple. It states gun manufacturers should be \nheld to the same standard of care as other manufacturers are; that is, \nauto manufacturers, lawnmower manufacturers, manufacturers of toasters. \nIt defines ``reasonably foreseeable'' the way it is universally defined \nin the tort law. That is the reasonable anticipation that harm or \ninjury is likely to result.\n  We should not be passing a law to shield gun manufacturers from the \nstandard of care that all other manufacturers are required to meet. As \nwritten, S. 1805 carves out special protection for a special interest \ngroup. This is not the equal justice under law that we all give \nspeeches about on the Senate floor. This is not fair to the victims of \ngun violence and gun accidents, such as Sean Smith and his family in \nAlbuquerque. When an injury such as this occurs, they should have some \nredress in the courts. Without my amendment, they will not. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I understand Senator Sessions will be to \nthe floor momentarily to join with me in debating the Bingaman \namendment. But for the moment let me suggest that the Bingaman \namendment would modify very clearly the definition of ``reasonably \nforeseeable'' in product defect cases in such a way that would \nundermine, clearly, the purpose of S. 1805 and undo the Daschle \namendment, the very corrections that the minority leader thought were \nnecessary to be made and to which I and others agreed.\n  Rather than leave criminal and unlawful misuse out of the definition \nof reasonably foreseeable use, like S. 1805 and the Daschle amendment, \nthe amendment of Senator Bingaman would define the term ``reasonably \nforeseeable'' in product defect cases to mean the reasonable \nanticipation that harm or injury is likely to result.\n  S. 1805 exempts product defect cases from qualified civil liability \nactions. The bill, in other words, allows actions for physical injuries \nor property damage resulting directly from a defect in design or \nmanufacture of the product when the product is used as intended or in a \nmanner that is reasonably foreseeable. As it relates to product defect \ncases, the term ``reasonably foreseeable'' does not include any \ncriminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product, other than \npossessory offenses.\n  The Daschle amendment simply made a technical change by including \nthis definition of reasonably foreseeable in the section on product \ndefect cases.\n  In other words, current product liability law still pertains. S. 1805 \ndoes not erase this. The substance, however, remains the same as I have \nsaid. That is, both S. 1805 and the Daschle amendment make clear that \ncriminal and unlawful misuse of a qualified product is not included in \nuse that is reasonably foreseeable.\n  Tort law has long recognized the principle that criminal acts and \nothers are not foreseeable, that a person can generally assume others \nwill obey the law. As one authoritative treatise stated:\n\n       There is normally much less reason to anticipate acts on \n     the part of others which are those which are merely \n     negligent, and this is all the more true where, as is usually \n     the case, such acts are criminal.\n\n  Under all ordinary and normal circumstances, in the absence of any \nreason to expect the contrary, the actor may reasonably proceed under \nthe assumption that others will obey the criminal law.\n  A Maryland court, in the case of Valentine v. On Target, quoted this \nwhen it ruled that a victim of a criminal shooting could not sue a \ngunshop for a murder committed by a gun stolen from the dealer's \ndisplay case.\n  Again, here, as in product defect cases, the criminal and unlawful \nmisuse of a product is not included in the definition of reasonably \nforeseeable.\n  Senator Bingaman's amendment, by including this language, would \nstrike these longstanding principles of tort law and, as lawmakers, it \nis important to recognize these principles of law in S. 1805, and that \nis exactly what we do. Although the legislation does not prohibit \nreasonable suit in product defect cases where a firearm or ammunition \nis used in a reasonably foreseeable manner, there is also no open door \nfor antigun activist lawyers to claim that firearms are defective \nproducts just because they can be used in crime. For this reason I \ncertainly urge that my colleagues oppose the Bingaman amendment. In \nfact, it strikes to the very heart of that which Senator Daschle and I \nproposed in a very bipartisan way, to make this legislation as broadly \nacceptable as it is.\n  The case that the Senator is referring to, no matter how sympathetic, \nstill involves a violation of the law for something such as negligent \nhomicide or the negligent handling of a weapon. Again, criminal or \nunlawful behavior is not foreseeable. This is established in \nlongstanding principles of tort law, as I said, and here, in product \ndefect cases, these principles similarly apply.\n  The Senator's amendment again would strike language, as I said, from \nS. 1805, that clearly restates what we believe to be current law and an \nimportant part of the law.\n  The practical effect of this definition is that it would bar many \nvalid product liability suits involving accidental shootings.\n  For example, in Smith v. Bryco, as he mentioned, a 15-year-old \nunintentionally shot his friend when he pulled the trigger of an \nillegally purchased handgun after removing the magazine. He thought the \ngun would not fire without the magazine and did not realize that a \nbullet may remain in the chamber. His parents sued the manufacturer \nunder strict product liability and negligence theories asserting that \nthe handgun should have incorporated a warning, chamber-loading \nindicator,\n\n[[Page S1924]]\n\nor a magazine-out safety. Under S. 1805, cases like this one would \nlikely be dismissed because they involve some violation of law--\ncertainly in this case--other than a possessory offense such as \nnegligent homicide, negligent handling of a weapon, or similar offense.\n  Those are the fundamental issues. I certainly urge my colleagues to \noppose the Bingaman amendment.\n  We will vote on this amendment at 5 o'clock. I hope others might come \nto the floor for purposes of debate on this amendment.\n  I see Senator Sessions entering the Chamber now and he wished time on \nthis important amendment.\n  Let me also repeat that clearly part of the Bingaman amendment goes \nto the very heart of the definition as it relates to ``reasonably \nforeseeable'' in the law. We think that is critically important. That \nis why Senator Daschle and I teamed to make sure this law was, as I \nexpressed it to be on Wednesday and Thursday and Friday of last week, a \nvery narrow approach toward dealing with the kinds of junk or frivolous \nlawsuits we have seen filed now well over 30 times across this country \nin which law-abiding gun manufacturers and dealers have spent hundreds \nof millions of dollars defending themselves, only to have, in most \ninstances, these cases thrown out of court. We would hope as they enter \nthe courthouse door and the arguments are placed that the judge, based \non S. 1805, can make reasonable decisions as to whether this case ought \nto go forward or whether it meets the definition of what we are \nproposing.\n  May I inquire how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-one minutes 17 seconds. The Senator \nfrom New Mexico has just under 18 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield 10 minutes of my time to Senator Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Idaho for his \nleadership on this issue. We really do need to deal with the question \nof excessive lawsuits in America and try to restore the classical \nunderstanding about fault and who is at fault and who ought to be \nresponsible when bad things happen. The legal system has never \nunderstood that somebody has to pay every time somebody is hurt. What \nthe legal system has always contemplated is that people who do wrong \nget sued, not the people who do right. People who are responsible for \nthe activity are the ones who are subject to the lawsuit--not the \nperson who is the victim of the activity.\n  I just had a number of doctors from Alabama in my office. They feel \nso strongly that lawsuits are driving up the cost of their doing \nbusiness and their insurance rates. Every time we come in with a \nproposal to constrict that and reduce it, we have all kinds of \ncomplaints at the margin about this or that would be wrong and how it \ncould be harmful.\n  As a young law student in Alabama, we had courses on common law \npleadings. I think Massachusetts and Alabama were the last two in the \nNation that still had that. You had to plead with specificity in \nreplevin and trover and trespass. It goes back to the English days. You \nhad to say exactly what your cause of action was and why you were \nentitled to relief. If you did not state it properly, the judge threw \nit out before trial. It became so complex that it was abused. So we \nwent to the more common law pleading like every other State had done. \nBut I think we have gone too far the other way.\n  I want to share this story that was in Saturday's Washington Times \nabout an incident that occurred in Maryland. The story is as follows:\n\n       Sometime after closing on Friday night, March 16, and \n     Saturday night, March 17, 2001, thieves broke into Back River \n     Supply's Glyndon plant, owned by the Geckle brothers. They \n     made off with equipment, including saws, a laser and a fax \n     machine. Most ominously, they took a gun.\n       Matt and Tony called the police and filled out the \n     requisite reports. On March 18, they tried to install a \n     security camera, but could not get it to work. Matt (who told \n     the Baltimore Sun he was worried that the burglars would \n     steal the company computers, which were needed to operate the \n     plant) decided that he would stay over on Sunday night to \n     drive off the burglars if they decided to come back for a \n     third evening in a row. Tony reluctantly agreed, and the pair \n     brought their rifles with them.\n       Early on the morning of March 19, the burglars returned. \n     Tony, armed and standing guard, ordered them to stop, but \n     says the intruders ran toward him in the darkness.\n\n  He fired and killed one of the burglars. No criminal charges were \nbrought. That should have been the end of it. Unfortunately, the \nSteinbach estate has now filed a lawsuit demanding $13 million from \nGeckles and Back River Supply company. The lawsuit contends that the 4-\nyear-old child of the criminal has suffered because of his father's \ndeath.\n  One of our Senators--Friday, I believe it was--in carrying on the \ndebate here talked about a circumstance in which someone stole a weapon \nfrom a gun dealer and went out and committed a crime with it and said \nthat something was wrong if we would keep the victim of this criminal \nact from suing this gun dealer. But in these circumstances, the gun \ndealer is a victim of a crime.\n  How did we get to the point where we are suing criminal victims \ninstead of the person who sold the gun and committed a criminal act? \nWhat are we doing having burglars suing people who are defending their \nproperty? This is contrary to the rule of law on which our American \nRepublic was founded. It is contrary to the Anglo law that we inherited \nfrom England. It is contrary to our traditions. Somebody said: Well, \npolice officers might want to sue a gun dealer or a gun manufacturer if \na criminal got a gun and shot one of them and that we ought not to stop \nthat. But I don't know police officers who want to sue the gun \nmanufacturer when a criminal shoots them. They carry on their hip a gun \nmade by a gun manufacturer every day.\n  This bill, to its credit, is moving forward. Our amendment, which was \nagreed to, will allow officers not on active duty to carry guns so they \ncan be available to help defend American citizens if they come upon \nsomeone in trouble from a criminal act.\n  I guess what I want to emphasize--and I express my appreciation to \nSenator Craig and others who have brought this liability bill--is they \nare not doing something wrong. They are changing the law as it has \nhistorically been. They are dealing with a situation in which a group \nof activist attorneys or a group of activist politicians--sometimes \nmayors, sometimes DAs--are filing lawsuits in jurisdictions that are \nless friendly to guns than other jurisdictions. They are seeking \nmillion-dollar verdicts against perfectly innocent manufacturers who \nhave complied with the law, who have done everything the Federal \nGovernment has said they should, has sent the guns down to a dealer who \nhas a whole complex series of rules that he must comply with before \nselling a gun. And if a person does that, they still want to sue \nbecause of an intervening criminal act.\n  I have dealt with this, as I said on the Senate floor the other day, \nin defense of a lawsuit. Under the law, a person is not expected to \nforesee and, therefore, be liable for an intervening criminal act. It \nis just not right. But if a gun dealer has a gun and sells it loaded, \nand it goes off and injures somebody, he should be sued. If a gun \nmanufacturer produces a gun that blows up and knocks somebody's eye \nout, they ought to be sued. But if the gun performs according to its \nmanufacturer's requirement, and a criminal uses it to harm somebody, \nthen they should not be sued. That has always been the law.\n  I do not know where we have gotten to this idea that we are going to \npoliticize the law to the extent that we are to go against lawfully and \nregulated businesses. Another Senator in the debate said if we cannot \npass it, somebody has to stand up and do something about these guns. If \nit is not done by the legislature, we ought to let them do it by \nlawsuits.\n\n  That is the very definition of activism. We are the people elected to \npass gun laws. We have had a lot of debate on that. People have \ndisagreements about where we should draw the line, about what is legal \nor illegal. That is the way it should be. We are accountable to the \npeople. If we do something wrong, we can be voted out of office. It is \nin a lot of political campaigns on both sides, what a Senator or \nCongressman did with regard to gun rights in America. That is what we \nare paid for.\n  To have a judge who is elected to decide lawsuits or a mayor in some \ncity\n\n[[Page S1925]]\n\nthat is hostile to guns twist the law around to carry out a political \nagenda that affects the whole United States and changes the law in that \nfashion, not voted for by elected representatives, is not good policy.\n  I thank the Senator from Idaho. We had many, many examples of these \nkinds of lawsuits that are unwise, not sound as a matter of public \npolicy. This legislation fundamentally is designed to deal with that \nand to say that we are not going to have frivolous lawsuits brought. We \nare not going to have individuals who comply with the law in this \nhighly regulated environment and do what they are supposed to do, \ncomply with the Government regulations, have them sued because of what \na criminal did. It does not make sense, not correct.\n  I wanted to share those remarks, and I reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. From what the Senator has said, he is on my side and \nshould support my amendment.\n  Where a gun is designed and manufactured in such a way that a person \nwould be misled in believing it was unloaded when, in fact, it was \nstill loaded, and a teenager got ahold of that gun and accidentally \nshot his friend, would the Senator agree under those circumstances that \nthe designer or manufacturer of that gun could be held liable if the \njury found that the injury that resulted was reasonably foreseeable?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I say to my distinguished colleague from New Mexico, \nwho has grown up with guns as I have, the first principle of a firearm \nis you assume it is loaded. Yet you have to be very knowledgeable of \nthat fact.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield additional time to the Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the dealer handed a customer a gun that was loaded, \nperhaps that dealer could be held liable. I think probably they should. \nThe dealer should have checked before they handed it to them. But I \ndon't think you want a circumstance where you say a gun that does not \nclearly show whether or not it is loaded creates a liability. We have \nnever had that before.\n  I have never had a gun that I know of that shows clearly whether it \nis loaded or not. You have to open it up to see if it is loaded.\n  My time has expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. If the Senator will respond on my time, in this case, \nthe gun in question, a pistol these kids bought, and when they bought \nit they looked in the barrel--he was 15 years old--he looked in the \nchamber, saw there was no bullet in there, he got the magazine and put \nit in because he was buying a magazine along with the gun. They went \nback home and he took the magazine out and they were passing it around. \nHe assumed when he took the magazine out the bullets also all came out. \nThey all assumed that, these three boys.\n  Now, in fact, they were wrong. One of these bullets had stayed in the \nchamber and then there was the accidental shooting of one of the boys.\n  The parents of this boy who was shot went to court and said, either \nyou should have had some kind of warning that having a magazine out did \nnot mean the gun was unloaded or you should have a safety which \nprovided if the magazine was out you could not pull the trigger, one of \nthe two.\n  The issue before our court in New Mexico was, shouldn't the jury be \nable to decide that; should the jury be able to decide whether the \ninjury that resulted here was reasonably foreseeable. But does the \nSenator think in that circumstance it is appropriate for the jury to \nmake a decision?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I say this to the Senator. The Senator has to \nunderstand, and everybody does who deals with a firearm, you have to be \ncareful. You cannot assume because you put a clip, a magazine, in it \nand take it out that a cartridge has not been put in the chamber.\n  You want the manufacturer of this gun to be liable for the action of \none of those kids with regard to another one who was reckless or \nnegligent?\n  That is what I am saying. I am not saying the other person who \nhandled the gun in an unsafe manner should not be liable if they did. \nBut I don't think the manufacturer should be liable for that.\n  Of course drawing these lines, as the Senator knows because he is \nskilled and knowledgeable in these matters, is difficult, but having a \nclear line about what we are going to allow in this country under \nclassical rules of law is what we ought to strive for more. I think \nyour amendment is just chipping away and pushing further in this \ninstance about which you feel strongly.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator for his response.\n  Madam President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 14 minutes and 10 minutes 29 seconds \non the other side.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, let my respond to a few points the \nSenator from Idaho made, and also the Senator from Alabama.\n  The first point that the Senator made that I will respond to is the \nSenator from Idaho said the bill as it now stands represents \nlongstanding principles to tort law. The quote he gave us was from \nProsser and Keeton's Treatise on the Law of Torts. All who have been to \nlaw school know that Prosser on torts is the accepted authority. The \nquote he gave was: An actor may proceed upon the assumption that others \nwill obey criminal law.\n  What he failed to say, if you go on in that same paragraph, that: A \ndefendant may still be held liable for not taking precautions for \nforeseeable, intentional, or criminal acts which the defendant might \nreasonably anticipate.\n  The case I have been focused on was not a criminal act in the \ntraditional sense. This was an accident. This 15-year-old boy did not \nintend to shoot his friend who was sitting across the room talking on \nthe telephone. He did shoot him. He shot him in the mouth. It was \naccidental. But because our State legislature and virtually every State \nlegislature in the country has said that the negligent use of a deadly \nweapon is a crime, then essentially they have said negligence is the \nsame as criminal activity in this instance.\n  The position which the Senator from Idaho is taking is that since \nnegligence is the same as criminal activity, we are determining as a \nmatter of law here--if we pass this law without my amendment, we are \ndetermining as a minority of law that it is not reasonable to assume \nthat any teenager with a gun might act in a negligent fashion.\n  I don't know how many in Congress have had teenagers in their house \nbut that is just not a commonsense, reasonable position to take. We all \nknow that at times kids act negligently. Grownups act negligently. \nEveryone does at times.\n  The question is not whether the person acts negligently but whether \nan innocent person who was in that room at the time that negligent \nactivity occurred should be barred from suing for a defective product.\n  Now, the Senator from Alabama says he would not allow suits against a \nmanufacturer because, in his view, this was not something which would \njustify that. That should be decided by a jury. That is exactly what \nour court of appeals in New Mexico said. That is the law of the State \nof New Mexico. This bill is going to override that. This bill is going \nto say, it does not matter what your juries think, we in the Congress \nare saying these guns are not defective, even if the design of the gun \nresults in this type of an injury.\n\n  The Senator from Alabama said the people who do wrong are the ones \nwho should get sued. I agree with that. That is exactly what my \namendment tries to provide. It says let's make a determination as to \nwhether the designer and the manufacturer of this gun did something \nwrong when they designed it and manufactured it; and, if so, let's \nallow them to be held liable.\n  That is exactly what we do in the case of automobile manufacturers. \nThat is exactly what we do in the case of lawnmower manufacturers. It \nis exactly what we do in the case of manufacturers of every other item \nthat we have in our country.\n  We are saying, in this bill, look, we are going to hold gun \nmanufacturers to a lower standard than everybody else. I do not \nunderstand why it is in the public interest for us to hold gun \nmanufacturers to a lower standard of care than everybody else who \nmanufacturers anything in our country. That does not compute with me.\n\n[[Page S1926]]\n\n  I think, clearly, the better course is to allow the State law of New \nMexico and of most States to prevail, to allow the courts to use \ntraditional principles for what is foreseeable to determine who will be \nheld liable. In fact, in this case, the Court of Appeals of New Mexico \nwas right. This case should have been allowed to proceed--should still \nbe allowed to proceed, I would say, because this case has still not \nbeen completed. This case will be barred, if we pass this legislation, \nand the Smith family--Sean Smith and his parents--will be denied \nrecovery, not because Sean was acting negligently, because he was not, \nbecause his 15-year-old friend was acting negligently. And the New \nMexico Legislature has said that the negligent use of a deadly weapon \nis, in fact, a crime.\n  So I think my amendment is a small change in the underlying bill \nwhich would dramatically improve it, in my opinion, and would cause it \nto still deal with the frivolous cases that the Senator from Idaho and \nthe Senator from Alabama and all are worried about.\n  I am not trying to protect frivolous cases. There is all this \nreference to how we have activist attorneys going after innocent \nmanufacturers. That was what the Senator from Alabama said. Frankly, I \ndo not doubt that there are some innocent manufacturers. I do not doubt \nthere are some activist lawyers. In this case, we had a lawyer \nrepresenting a family that had been injured, through no fault of their \nown, and they have a right to go to court. That is all I think we \nshould maintain.\n  So I hope my amendment will be agreed to and that all Senators will \nsupport it.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let' see. Madam President, I have 10 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes 22 seconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I yield 5 of those minutes to the Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Order Of Procedure\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Idaho for \nallowing me to do something I have traditionally done every year I have \nbeen in the Senate, actually taking a tradition that Senator John Tower \nstarted. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business to \nread the letter from William Barret Travis from the Alamo at the time \nthey were under siege.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            The Letter of William Barret Travis At The Alamo\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, at the Alamo, in San Antonio, 184 \nTexas rebels, led by William Barret Travis, made their stand against \nSanta Ana's vastly superior Mexican army. On the second day of the \nsiege, February 24, 1836, Travis called for reinforcements with this \nheroic message.\n  Just to put this in context, the war for independence from Mexico was \nbeing fought through the last several months and would eventually end \nbecause of the valiant stand at the Alamo, at the battle of San \nJacinto. These 184 men were looking at what they thought were 6,000 \nMexican soldiers marching on them. They were asking for reinforcements.\n  They did not get those reinforcements, but they, nevertheless, fought \nto the last death. They held them for so long that it gave Sam Houston \ntime to then get his troops lined up and to form the line on which they \nwould take their stand; and that was near Houston, TX. It was the \nbattle of San Jacinto.\n  But this letter was dated February 24, 1836:\n\n       Fellow citizens and compatriots: I am besieged by a \n     thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Ana--I have \n     sustained a continual bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours \n     and have not lost a man--the enemy has demanded a surrender \n     at discretion, otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the \n     sword, if the fort is taken--I have answered the demands with \n     a cannon shot, and our flag still waves proudly from the \n     wall--I shall never surrender or retreat.\n       Then, I call on you in the name of liberty, of patriotism \n     and of everything dear to the American character, to come to \n     our aid, with all dispatch. The enemy is receiving \n     reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to three or \n     four thousand in four or five days. If this call is \n     neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as \n     possible and die like a soldier who never forgets what is due \n     to his own honor and that of his country--Victory or Death--\n     William Barret Travis, Lt. Col., Commander.\n\n  So, Madam President, this is something that is celebrated in Texas on \nMarch 2 of every year. That is the date of the signing of the Texas \nDeclaration of Independence from Mexico.\n  My great-great-grandfather signed that declaration of independence, \nalong with the first two Senators who eventually served Texas when, 10 \nyears after it won its independence and had become a nation, then \njoined the United States as a State. And the first two Senators were \nSam Houston and Thomas Jefferson Rusk. I hold the Rusk seat. He was the \nsecretary of war and signed the Texas Declaration of Independence \nalongside my great-great-grandfather. They were both delegates from my \nmother's hometown of Nacogdoches, TX.\n  So, Madam President, I thank you. And I certainly thank the Senator \nfrom Idaho for allowing me to keep this tradition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I thought it was important that the \nSenator from Texas be allowed to keep the tradition. My only \nobservation is, if that fight had occurred under modern law, and with \ngun control advocates, it would not have been a gun fight; it would \nhave been a knife fight.\n  But I do thank my colleague. That was an awfully important part of \nTexas history that became American history.\n  I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I rise in support of the Bingaman \namendment. I would just note, if I could, my understanding is this \namendment would clarify that the manufacturer or the seller of a \nfirearm would still be liable for the foreseeable injuries to a \nconsumer who purchases a firearm, just like the producer of a toaster \nor a lawnmower or car seats or any other product, for that matter.\n  I also want to take a moment to speak on behalf of an amendment that \nis going to be offered and probably voted on tomorrow; and that is, \nwith respect to gun shows, an effort, on the part of Senators McCain \nand Reed to close what many of us believe is a loophole.\n  By way of full disclosure, this past weekend I have been working with \nmy youngest son, who is an eighth grader in a school back in Delaware. \nIn school, he has a genealogy project. He has to not only tell his life \nstory, but he has to tell the story of both sides of his family--his \nparents' ancestors--all the way back to North Carolina and Germany, and \nplaces like that.\n  One of things we came across, in looking through the genealogy, is \nthat about 150 years ago, one of the things that was going on in the \nCarper family, in West Virginia, was the development of something \ncalled the Carper rifle.\n  It turned out to be a firearm that bears my family's name and was \nthought to be a weapon people were anxious to have a long time ago. In \nfact, we still trade a few from time to time. My dad was a big hunter \nand fisherman. I also like to fish and take my boys. My sons are Boy \nScouts and they are being introduced to weapons as they go through \ntheir training. Occasionally, we will do some trap shooting. I remember \nmy dad being a gun collector, too. I remember visiting him and my mom \nin Florida where they had lived for some time. I remember looking at \nhis gun collection. He had enough for a small army in their home in \nSeminole, FL. He had rifles, shotguns, and even a musket or two, and \nhandguns as well. He used to say, with some humor, if anybody tried to \nbreak into this house, it would be the last time they tried to do it. \nAll I know is nobody tried to break into their house.\n  My dad also liked people. He was a claims adjuster for Nationwide \nInsurance Company. In the course of his work, he worked with troopers, \npolice, law enforcement officers. He had a great affection for them and \nthe work they did. I am like my father in some ways and different in \nsome ways. We share an affection for the outdoors and also for people. \nWe have a strong respect for the second amendment of the Constitution, \nbelieving people ought to\n\n[[Page S1927]]\n\nhave a right to bear arms and own arms.\n  We have a situation in Delaware, as in about 30-some other States, \nwhere folks can go to a gun show--and people are not able to buy guns \nunder Delaware law. But you can show up at a licensed dealer and they \ncall in to the State Bureau of Investigation, and in a minute or two \nthey will know whether you are eligible to buy a gun.\n  That same person can go to a gun show in my State and if they deal \nwith a licensed dealer, within a couple of minutes, they know whether \nthe person may or may not buy a weapon. If not, they are told you \ncannot buy a weapon. Yet somebody can go as far from me as to the \nreporter right here, who is not a licensed dealer, and that same person \nwho cannot purchase a gun in my State will purchase a gun. It happens \nin my State and in dozens of other States around America.\n  My law enforcement officers want to see a change. They want to see it \nstopped. All of our major law enforcement agencies in Delaware, from \nDover, to Wilmington, to Newcastle, would like to see that loophole \nclosed. Tomorrow when we vote on the gun show loophole amendment from \nSenators McCain and Reed, I plan to vote for it. It is good, \ncommonsense legislation. I hope it will carry the day tomorrow when we \nvote.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico for allowing me to have this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nfrom 9:30 a.m. to 11:15 a.m. tomorrow be equally divided between the \ntwo leaders or their designees; provided further, that the time from \n11:15 to 11:25 a.m. be under the control of the Democratic leader or \nhis designee, and the time from 11:25 to 11:35 a.m. be under the \ncontrol of the majority leader or his designee.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I will not object to this. But everybody \nwithin the sound of my voice should understand these times will not be \nchanged tomorrow. We are working under very tight time deadlines. For \nanybody who wants an extra minute here or there, or to have a vote \nlater, there will be objection and that will not happen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I thank Senator Reid for reinforcing the \nUC and the time constraints we are under tomorrow as we vote on several \nkey amendments.\n  How much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4 minutes 16 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me say I don't question the sincerity or the desire with which \nthe Senator from New Mexico comes to the floor to offer his amendment. \nI must tell you I think he is rewriting current law to fit a situation \nin his State, or attempting to do so. What we have always said here is \nindividuals are responsible for their acts, not a third party or, in \nthis case, the third party is responsible and not the gun manufacturer. \nIt is my understanding all three of these young people were minors; \nthey acquired the gun off the street. You have heard the Senator from \nAlabama talk about the knowledge of handling a firearm and the tragic \nmistake some make when they assume it is empty. Any of us who have ever \ntaken a course in firearms knows that, first and foremost, that is the \none assumption you never make. That gun has to be presumed to be loaded \nuntil you yourself establish by visual contact it is not.\n  The Bingaman amendment would modify the definition of reasonably \nforeseeable in product defect cases in such a way it would undermine \nclearly the purpose of S. 1805 and undo the Daschle amendment we worked \nin compromise and balance to bring. Rather than leave criminal and \nunlawful misuse out of the definition of reasonably foreseeable use, \nlike S. 1805 and the Daschle amendment does, the Bingaman amendment \nwould define the term reasonably foreseeable in product defect cases to \nmean the reasonable anticipation that harm or injury is likely to \nresult.\n  We don't think that is how this argument ought to be approached. \nAgain, there is this great desire in our country that somehow the \nindividual cannot be held responsible, that somehow it was somebody \nelse's fault. The case the Senator speaks of is, without question, \ntragic. That I don't dispute, and my heart goes out to the families in \nthose kinds of incidents, where young people become involved in the \nmisuse of a firearm and it takes someone's life or injures them. We \nhope that does not happen.\n  Again, we have to go back to the underlying principle of \nresponsibility, and in the case of well and long-established court law, \nit is the individual who is responsible, and if their act causes \ninjury, they are responsible. Certainly, that is the intent and the \nvery narrow character of S. 1805.\n\n  There are lawsuits filed for the purpose of changing public policy in \nour country or simply, if you will, draining down the resources of a \ncompany that someone believes should not be in business, even though \nhistorically we have said that is a law-abiding, responsible business \nto be in in our country. In this case, it is a business that was spoken \nto by our Founding Fathers in the second amendment.\n  We think those who play by the Federal rules, whether they be a \nmanufacturer or a dealer, ought to be exempt from these kinds of \nlawsuits, unless under product liability and other law they clearly are \nin violation. But the third party is the one who takes the action, \ncauses the crime that is the criminal act. Why do we want to reach back \nthrough the courts and go after the law-abiding individual or company? \nThat is the issue at hand. I know the Senator speaks to a specific \nversion of that, but at the same time that is the reality with which we \ndeal here.\n  I hope my colleagues, when we vote at 5 or soon after that, will \nobject to the Bingaman amendment in support of a clean S. 1805.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes, 18 seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, to me, this amendment is a question of \nwhether we are going to hold gun manufacturers and designers and \ndealers to the same standards we hold all other manufacturers in this \ncountry. Or are we instead going to pass a law that says, look, \neverybody else has to be held to a high standard, but if you are \ndesigning, manufacturing, or selling a gun, you can forget about that \nhigh standard; you have a much lower standard. That is exactly what \nthis bill does without my amendment. It holds manufacturers to a much \nlower standard.\n  I don't think that is the best public policy. I think we are making a \nmajor mistake in this regard. In this circumstance, the case I have \ntalked about for the last hour, where you have three teenagers, one of \nwhom acts negligently and another of whom is injured as a result of \nthat, there is no doubt that 15-year-old who acted negligently should \nbe subject to liability for what he did. I am not suggesting he should \nnot be subject to liability. All I am saying is a good argument can be \nmade that if this gun had been properly designed, there would have been \nsome warning the gun still was loaded or could be loaded even though \nthe magazine was out, or there would be some safety mechanism on the \ngun to keep it from being fired when the magazine was out. In either \ncase, this injury would have been avoided.\n\n  All I am saying is that under New Mexico law, as our courts have \ninterpreted New Mexico law, an American has a right to go to a jury and \nargue that this injury was reasonably foreseeable by the manufacturer \nand, therefore, the manufacturer should be liable for the damage that \nwas done by this defectively designed gun.\n  I believe we ought to maintain that ability. This bill, S. 1805, \nundercuts that ability and basically bars those lawsuits. That would be \na big mistake.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment I have offered. I \nbelieve it would dramatically improve this legislation and actually \nbring it into line with traditional tort law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 2635.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S1928]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nGraham), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), the Senator from Alaska \n(Ms. Murkowski), and the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Voinovich) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, S. 1805, which we are in the midst of \ndebating, is good legislation and I am a cosponsor of this bill. It \nwill help curb frivolous litigation against a lawful American industry \nand the thousands of workers it employs. Imagine if General Motors were \nto be held liable for every accident caused by a reckless or drunk \ndriver. Likewise, businesses legally engaged in manufacturing, \nimporting or selling firearms should not be liable for the harm caused \nby people who use that firearm in an unsafe or criminal manner. This \nlegislation does carefully preserve the right of individuals to have \ntheir day in court with civil liability actions for injury or danger \ncaused by negligence or defective product, a standard in product \nliability law.\n  Adding amendments such as an extension of the assault weapons ban \nthreatens the chances of this important legislation ever becoming law. \nThis bill is too important to be saddled with ``poison pill'' \namendments.\n  Four years ago, in the midst of the 2000 election, I said that my \ngoal in fighting criminals was to enforce, not repeal, existing laws. \nAnd, indeed, in Virginia we have seen that incarcerating violent felons \nis the best crime reduction policy. I would support reauthorization of \nthe assault weapons ban in its current form if this legislation had \nproven effective in reducing violent crime. I have reviewed the \nthoughtful claims and extensive assertions of proponents and opponents \nof this law. I have concluded, after a review of the evidence, that \nthis symbolic ban of 19 firearms chosen for cosmetic reasons is a \nmeaningless, toothless law that has virtually no impact on crime. I \nhave decided, therefore, to vote against extension of the assault \nweapons ban.\n  Police reports and Federal felon surveys have consistently shown that \nso-called assault weapons are used in only 1 to 2 percent of violent \ncrimes. Crime victim surveys indicate the figure is only one-quarter of \n1 percent, 0.25. Murders with knives, clubs and hands outnumber those \nwith assault weapons by over 20-to-1.\n  Put another way, notwithstanding this 10-year ban of 19 firearms, \ncriminals continue to commit criminal acts, they just do so with other \nweapons; with other guns, knives or objects.\n  The simple fact is that the assault weapons ban only attacks the \ncosmetic features of a gun, banning some guns even though they function \nexactly the same as hundreds of other semi-automatic firearms.\n  It is also worth noting that we are not talking about the fully \nautomatic firearms or machine guns that many Americans view as assault \nweapons--the Uzi and the AK-47--they were already banned by previous \nlaws. Nor are we talking about any firearms that are readily or easily \nconverted to fully automatic firearms. Sale of such firearms is already \nbanned under current federal law.\n  I recently watched a CNN interview that showed an individual firing a \ngun that was banned under the 1994 law and a gun that is readily \navailable today. Both guns produced the same results with the same \nimpact. The only difference is that one had a different type of grip, \nstock or bayonet lock than the other. Therefore, the banning of these \naccessories is purely cosmetic. The focus should be on criminals not \nguns, and it should be on programs that work, like Project Exile and \nthe Abolition of Parole.\n  I am also concerned that by reauthorizing this gun ban legislation, \nit will serve as a platform inviting added restrictions on Second \nAmendment rights. The current law, then, only makes sense if the \nultimate goal it is to ban more and more guns in the future, something \nI cannot support. This can be seen in several proposals and amendments \nnow before Congress to expand the current assault weapons ban proposals \nthat permanently ban a large number of guns that citizens lawfully use \nfor competition, hunting or self-defense. I have a long and consistent \nrecord of supporting the rights of Virginians and Americans to protect \ntheir families and themselves, and I am committed to protecting those \nrights of law-abiding American citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/01/senate-section/article/S1928-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, last week members of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee heard deeply disturbing testimony about unspeakable \nacts of violence committed against at least 112 of our military \npersonnel deployed in Afghanistan and the Iraq theater. Unfortunately, \nthe acts of violence discussed in the committee were not committed by \nthe Taliban or terrorists, but by fellow American troops who have \nsexually assaulted their female counterparts. This egregious situation \nis unacceptable.\n  Back home in South Dakota, I have met so many female soldiers who \nhave proudly volunteered to serve this Nation. Like their male \ncolleagues, they demonstrate tremendous patriotism and love for \nAmerica. They also share the strong sense of duty and pride in being a \nmember of our great military. They deserve the country's and their \nfellow soldiers' wholehearted respect.\n  Sadly, the Armed Services Committee testimony suggests that too many \nof our women soldiers must be concerned not just about combating\n\n[[Page S1929]]\n\nenemy soldiers, but also about a soldier who is fighting beside her.\n  Over 30,000 brave women answered our Nation's call to duty to support \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. Fourteen of them have given their lives to \nensure that democracy flourishes in a country that has only recently \nbeen liberated from brutality and repression.\n  These soldiers are performing their duties with courage and honor. At \na time when the insurgency and unrest continue in Iraq, these women \ncontinue to defend Iraqi citizens from senseless violence. They should \nnot have to be concerned about having to defend themselves against the \nmost senseless violence of all--sexual assault perpetrated by their \nfellow soldiers.\n  Women make invaluable contributions to our armed forces. In fact, it \nis safe to say that our military could not perform all that we \ncurrently require of it without the service and sacrifices of female \nsoldiers. When we brutalize the very people who are willing to \nsacrifice their life for the defense of liberty and freedom, we harm \nthe institution that protects us all and undermine the principles upon \nwhich this great Nation was founded.\n  What makes last week's reports on sexual assault more distressing is \nthat this is not the first time female service members have come \nforward with allegations that they were raped and assaulted by their \nmale compatriots. We have heard these accusations before the Navy's \nAnnual Tailhook Symposium, the Army's Aberdeen Proving Grounds, and the \nAir Force Academy in Colorado.\n  I commend the women who have come forward to report these \nreprehensible acts. Far too often women suffer in silence, too afraid \nof possible reprisals that may come from reporting a sexual assault. \nThis is true in civilian life and must be doubly so in military life. \nTo help these victims, the military must take immediate and concrete \nsteps to address their needs. We must ensure that victims have access \nto medical care and confidential counseling. If we fail to create an \nenvironment where women feel safe to report their assaults, we risk \nteaching them that, in order to advance their military careers, they \nmust remain silent.\n  I am pleased that the Department of Defense has launched an \ninvestigation into these allegations, and that my colleagues on the \nSenate Armed Services Committee recently heard testimony addressing \nthis issue. Still we must do more. It is imperative that we all \ncontinue to work together to send to send a clear signal to the entire \nmilitary that any sexual misconduct will not be tolerated, and \noffenders will be vigorously prosecuted and punished. It is time to \nensure this issue is given the urgency and attention it deserves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/01/senate-section/article/S1929-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         SGT RANDY S. ROSENBERG\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a special \nperson, SGT Randy S. Rosenberg of Berlin, NH.\n  Tragically, on January 24, 2004, this courageous young soldier, only \n23 years of age, gave his last full measure for our Nation when a \nvehicle-based explosive device detonated near his military vehicle in \nKhalidiyah, Iraq, located in the Sunni Triangle, about 70 miles west of \nBaghdad. Randy and two of his comrades lost their lives in the \nexplosion and six other American soldiers were wounded in the attack \nnear the Euphrates River. At the time of the hostile action SGT \nRosenberg was serving as an infantryman in Company B, 1st Squadron, 9th \nCavalry, a component of Task Force ``All American'' which was \nsupporting Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Randy joined the United States Army in September 1998, after \ngraduating from Berlin High School, where he played hockey and \nbaseball. He completed Basic Training and Advanced Individual Training \nat Fort Benning, GA, and was assigned to Fort Hood, TX, since March \n1999. His awards include the Army Commendation Medal, Good Conduct \nMedal, National Defense Medal, Noncommissioned Officer Professional \nDevelopment Ribbon, Army Service Ribbon, Combat Infantry Badge, Purple \nHeart, posthumous, and Bronze Star, posthumous. This was his second \ntour of duty in the Middle East, having served previously in Kuwait.\n  His wife, Misty, is from Goffstown, NH. His mother and stepfather are \nRick and Sandy Fournier. Sandy works in the Berlin City Hall. His \nsister, Tanya, 15, is a student at Berlin High School. SGT Rosenberg \nalso leaves his maternal grandfather, Saul Rosenberg, and his maternal \ngrandmother, Shirley Gemitti, and her husband, William Gemitti, a \nveteran of the Korean war.\n  Patriots from the State of New Hampshire have served our Nation with \nhonor and distinction from Bunker Hill to Iraq--and Randy served in \nthat fine tradition. Daniel Webster said:\n\n       God grants liberty only to those who love it, and are \n     always ready to guard and defend it.\n\n  Randy was one of those proud and dedicated volunteers who chose to \nserve our Nation, and guard our precious liberty, and for that we will \nalways owe our sincere gratitude.\n  The sudden death of a young person is especially difficult for family \nand friends. In November 1864, President Abraham Lincoln was informed \nby the War Department of a mother who had lost five sons in the Civil \nWar. He wrote the mother:\n\n       I feel how weak and fruitless must be any word of mine \n     which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss \n     so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain from tendering you the \n     consolation that may be found in the thanks of the Republic \n     they died to save.\n       I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of \n     your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of \n     the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours \n     to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.\n\n  Family, friends, and fellow soldiers will no longer be able to enjoy \nthe company of SGT Randy S. Rosenberg. Strangers will never have the \nopportunity to know his friendship. Yet memories of this young patriot \nwill last forever with those who were fortunate enough to have had the \nopportunity to know him. May God bless Randy Rosenberg.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/01/senate-section/article/S1929-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  A horrendous crime occurred 4 years ago today in Richmond, VA.

The Presidential aspirant and \nself-proclaimed graduate ``of the Michigan of the East'' stood on the \nsteps of the Student Union and called for the creation of a program \nthat would enable college graduates to serve their Nation as part of a \n``greater purpose'' rooted in service.\n  Forty-three years later, this program, the Peace Corps, has been a \nresounding success. Seeking to promote world peace and friendship by \nsending American volunteers to participate in community service in \nvillages and towns across the world, this program addresses the \ncritical shortage in technical capacity that many parts of the world \nface. Further, it fosters increased cultural understanding. Peace Corps \nvolunteers, witting or not, represent their Nation while abroad and \nupon returning home help promote increased global awareness here as \nwell.\n  President Kennedy, in his inaugural address, called for a ``grand and \nglobal alliance'' to fight tyranny, poverty and disease. With over \n7,500 current volunteers in 71 nations, the Peace Corps has been a key \npart of this alliance. Since its inception, over 170,000 volunteers \nhave worked in 137 nations in a variety of programs. An increasing \nnumber of Peace Corps volunteers are over 60\n\n[[Page S1930]]\n\nyears of age. In fact, this year there is one 84-year-old volunteer. \nThat said, our Nation's college campuses are still the largest source \nof Peace Corps volunteers. Our universities are ``immense reservoirs'' \nof talent and idealism, and each year thousands of college students \nseek to join the Peace Corps in hopes of pursuing a difficult yet \nrewarding task.\n  Last week, the Peace Corps released a list ranking the schools that \nprovided the largest number of graduates accepted to the Peace Corps \nthis year. Two schools from my home State, the University of Michigan-\nAnn Arbor and Michigan State University, were ranked fourth and eighth \nrespectively in terms of the numbers of volunteers they provided. Since \nthe inception of the program, these schools are ranked fourth and fifth \noverall in terms of the number of total volunteers that they have \nprovided to the program. Both schools have worked to instill an ethos \nof volunteerism and service in their graduates, and for that they are \nto be commended.\n  All Peace Corps volunteers, regardless of their alma mater, deserve \nour respect and gratitude. By giving of themselves, they take concrete \nactions to improve the lives of countless individuals around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/01/senate-section/article/S1930-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ROBERT HARRIS\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \ncelebrate the 95th anniversary of the Detroit Rescue Mission \nMinistries. This very successful faith-based organization began as a \nfood assistance program and over the years has broadened its scope to \ninclude 13 different ministries to combat problems such as \nhomelessness, substance abuse, hunger and teen pregnancy.\n  The Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries provides food, shelter and \nspiritual guidance to more than 725 people a day and donates over \n75,000 articles of clothing to the poor annually. The organization also \nprovides over 500,000 meals and 146,000 nights of emergency shelter \nannually.\n  The Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries has consistently met the \nchanging and growing needs of the Detroit community by partnering with \nchurches, schools, and social and governmental agencies. The Christian \nGuidance Center, one ministry of the Detroit Rescue Mission, operates \nin cooperation with the Michigan Department of Corrections and provides \nindividual counseling, group therapy, substance abuse support, \nrehabilitation groups, and social activities for Detroit area \nprisoners.\n  A pioneer in the field of serving the less fortunate, the Detroit \nRescue Mission Ministries established the ``Genesis Houses,'' one of \nMichigan's first longer term residential facilities. In addition to \nsheltering the homeless, these homes provide food, clothing, advocacy \nand referral services.\n  Understanding the importance education plays in reducing poverty, the \nDetroit Rescue Mission established the Teen Moms Program, which \nprovides housing to teen mothers who are enrolled in high school, GED \ntraining or junior high. To further educational opportunities, the \nOasis Library furnishes residents with access to knowledge and \nfacilitates computer literacy skills.\n  I know my Senate colleagues join me in offering our congratulations \nand sincerest appreciation to the Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries on \nits 95th anniversary. We recognize and thank the dedicated staff and \nvolunteers who have made the organization a success and offer our \nsupport as they continue to work to fulfill their mission of rebuilding \nthe inner city one life at a time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/01/senate-section/article/S1930-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JESSICA LOWELL\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I honor Reverend Michael Jones, who \nis the senior pastor of Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church in \nSt. Louis. I was moved to do this after recently attending a wonderful \nservice at the church in celebration of the 10th anniversary of \nReverend Jones becoming pastor.\n  Reverend Jones accepted a call into ministry at Friendly Temple in \n1979, and he worked for several years under the tutelage of his \ngrandfather, Reverend R.F. Davis. After his grandfather's passing, he \nwas commissioned to serve as senior pastor in 1994. During Reverend \nJones' 9 years as senior pastor, the church has been very active in \nmeeting the needs of the community around it, helping to feed the \nhungry, house the homeless and educate the unskilled to prepare them \nfor jobs.\n  Friendly Temple also has a jail ministry, an alcohol and drug \nministry and a youth ministry, among others, which seek to provide a \nhand up to many of society's most troubled members. In all its efforts, \nthe church reaches out to people with a message of rebirth, renewal, \nrestoration, revival and resurrection based on the teachings of the \nGospels. That is because Pastor Jones and the leaders of the church are \ncommitted to the glory service of their Lord and Savior.\n  Reverend Jones and his wife Phyllis are proud parents of three \nchildren, Kawonza, Mike and Joshua. In addition, Reverend Jones has a \nbachelor's degree in business management and marketing management and a \nmaster's degree from Covenant Theological Seminary in General \nTheological Studies.\n  I commend Reverend Jones and the congregation of Friendly Temple \nMissionary Baptist Church for their outstanding service to the \ncommunity. His message of hope and strong moral values is an \ninspiration and a blessing to all of us. I am honored to share his \nsuccesses with my colleagues, and I wish him and his congregation all \nthe best for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/01/senate-section/article/S1930-5", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/01/senate-section/article/S1930-6", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1930-S1931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages\n\n[[Page S1931]]\n\nfrom the President of the United States submitting sundry nominations \nwhich were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/01/senate-section/article/S1931-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               2004 NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY--PM 67\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am transmitting the 2004 National Drug Control Strategy, consistent \nwith the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of \n1998 (21 U.S.C. 1705).\n  Two years ago, my Administration issued its National Drug Control \nStrategy setting forth a balanced approach to reducing drug use among \nteenagers and adults. The Strategy set ambitious two- and five-year \nperformance-based goals: (i) to lower the rate of drug use by 10 \npercent over two years; and (ii) to lower the rate by 25 percent over \nfive years. The success of the Strategy can be measured by its results.\n  I am pleased to report that we have exceeded our two-year goal of \nreducing drug use among young people. The most recent survey shows an \n11 percent drop between 2001 and 2003 in the use of illicit drugs by \nteenagers. Among teens, some drugs--such as LSD--have dropped to record \nlow levels of use. For others, we are seeing the lowest levels of use \nin almost a decade.\n  Despite this good news, drug addiction continues to challenge far too \nmany Americans. Addiction to drugs destroys ties of trust, family, and \nfriendship, and reduces all the richness of life to a single \ndestructive desire. Almost every American has known someone who has \nfollowed the self-destructive path of addiction. Too many Americans \nwant to change a family member's behavior, but are afraid of causing \ndivision and, perhaps, estrangement.\n  Our Strategy proposes a remarkable and unprecedented array of drug \ncontrol programs, treatment initiatives, and media campaign efforts. \nBut more than any program, it seeks to engage the desire of all \nAmericans to make this a better Nation, facing down the lie of \naddiction, and offering the hope of recovery.\n  My Administration will continue to place a high priority on reducing \ndrug addiction in America. I ask for your continued support in this \ncritical endeavor.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to promote better health for young people through \nFederal matching awards for physical education programs of excellence, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, as we have all heard, childhood \nobesity has reached epidemic proportions in our country. 30 percent of \nchildren between the ages of 6 and 11 are overweight, and 15 percent \nare obese. The same is true for kids between the ages of 12 and 19. And \nthe number of overweight children has increased 382 percent in 6-11 \nyear olds and 258 percent in 12-19 years old since 1974.\n  According to a 2001 report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices, a poor diet and sedentary lifestyle are estimated to cause \n310,000 to 580,000 deaths a year due to cancer, heart disease, stroke, \nand diabetes. Obesity is second only to the 418,000 smoking-related \nfatalities as the leading cause of preventable deaths in the United \nStates.\n  And unfortunately, this obesity epidemic hits our country at the same \ntime that state governments are cash-strapped and education programs \nare being cut. In my State of Florida, that means that physical \neducation programs, among other programs, are discarded as non-\nessential. Specifically, in Duval County, where Jacksonville is, 29 \nelementary schools have no formal physical education programs. Five \nyears ago, there were just five schools with no programs.\n  To stem this horrible trend, I'm introducing legislation to encourage \nState, school districts and schools to provide physical fitness \nprograms in their schools. Through the President's Council on National \nFitness those schools that receive recognition either as Physical \nFitness State Champions, Active Lifestyle Model Schools or Physical \nActivity and Fitness Demonstration Programs, will be eligible for \nFederal matching funds. This will encourage other schools and other \nschool districts to strive for these distinctions because the Federal \nGovernment will reward them for their efforts.\n  It is imperative that we continue to provide our children physical \nwell-being instruction so that our teachers are teaching alert and fit \nstudents each day.\n  Recently, I had the opportunity to visit a wonderful elementary \nschool in Duval County named the Alimacani Elementary School. The \nphysical education instructor, Jan Tipton, showed me their facilities \nand they were marvelous. I even rolled up my sleeves and did some pull-\nups.\n  The enthusiasm I encountered in that school for physical education \nwas amazing. All of our young people should be given the opportunity to \nbuild strong minds and bodies at school through regular physical \nactivity.\n  For these reasons, I hope that my colleagues will support passage of \nthis legislation this Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON:\n  S. 2151. A bill to encourage the development and integrated use by \nthe public and private sectors of remote sensing and other geospatial \ninformation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I proudly introduce the Remote \nSensing Applications Act of 2004. Remote sensing technology is utilized \nto map and monitor the surface of the globe. The data we recover \nthrough remote sensing equipment contributes to our ability to evaluate \nand measure a wide scope of variables. The Federal Government \nincorporates remote sensing data to accomplish many critical tasks from \nmonitoring global food supply and environmental developments to \nenhancing our national security initiatives.\n  The Landsat program, for example, has collected and distributed a 32-\nyear continuous record of the land surfaces of the world. The program \nhas become so successful that a significant portion of the program's \nbudget is recovered through outside data-sales.\n  Despite the overwhelming success of our remote sensing programs, many \nstate, local, and tribal government may not be familiar with the data \nor how to apply the data to meet local needs. In addition, there \nremains significant opportunities for private industry to develop \nspecialized and profit making adaptations based on remote sensing data.\n  The Remote Sensing Applications Act directs the United States \nGeological Survey to invest in pilot projects to explore the integrated \nuse of sources of remote sensing information to address State, local, \nregional and tribal needs. This legislation emphasizes the need to \ndevelop greater commercial applications for this data and provides the \nUSGS important opportunities to develop public-private partnerships.\n  The Remote Sensing Applications Act of 2004 will build upon the many \nsuccesses of our remote sensing mission. By investing in adequate \ninfrastructure and by making the appropriate tools available, we can \nfirmly preserve our nation's leadership in remote sensing technologies. \nBy enhancing opportunities to use this technology to more fully address \nthe needs of State, regional, local, and tribal governments, as well as \nthe needs of private industry, we may maximize the global effectiveness \nof our remote sensing programs. Accomplishing these goals through \npublic-private partnerships has the added benefits of creating new jobs \nand new markets that may ultimately reduce or replace the need for \nfederal financing or remote sensing policies.\n  I encourage the Senate to fully consider this important legislation \nand to work expeditiously to enact it into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/01/senate-section/article/S1935-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2634.

I rise to speak to an amendment to address the issue of \ntort reform. While today, the Senate is debating tort reform for the \ngun industry, I wish to take a few moments to raise the issue of tort \nreform with regard to another industry--the health care profession.\n  My father dedicated his life's work to medicine as a surgeon \ngynecologist. As a youngster, I watched first-hand how he caringly \nwatched over his patients. As a result of my father, I have always had \na great deal of respect for the medical profession.\n  For one reason or another, though, I did not follow in my father's \nfootsteps. Rather than become a doctor, I became a lawyer.\n  Upon graduation from law school, I served as a law clerk for Judge E. \nBarrett Prettyman of the United States Court of Appeals for the DC \nCircuit. Subsequently, I worked as a Federal prosecutor and then moved \nto private practice with a major law firm.\n  I have direct experience with two professions--the medical profession \nand the legal profession. I admire both professions and believe the \noverwhelming majority of doctors and lawyers are dedicated people who \nwork hard to serve their patients and clients.\n  Soon, the Senate will vote on S. 1805, legislation that provides \ncertain legal protections to the gun industry. Legal protections which \nare denied almost across the board to every other industry in the \nprivate sector, including the medical profession.\n  Proponents have argued that this legislation is necessary because \nlawsuits are driving gun dealers and gun manufacturers out of business. \nWell, the same is happening to our doctors.\n  Doctors, nurses, and other health professionals are leaving the \npractice of medicine due to the astronomical costs of malpractice \ninsurance and due to the constant battle against frivolous lawsuits and \nrunaway jury verdicts. In my view, if we are going to protect the gun \nindustry from lawsuits, we at least ought to provide some measure of \nprotection for doctors and nurses as well.\n  We have all heard the real stories from doctors about the rapidly \nincreasing cost of medical malpractice insurance. In some States, \nmalpractice insurance premiums have increased as much as 75 percent in \n1 year. As a result, the fact is that those doctors, unable to afford \never-increasing premiums, are leaving the profession altogether and \npatients are losing access to quality health care.\n  I have received numerous letters from medical professionals in the \nCommonwealth of Virginia that share with me the very real difficulties \nthey are encountering with malpractice insurance and the consequences \nof this problem. Let me read part of one those letters that was sent to \nme by a doctor in Virginia. The doctor writes:\n\n       I am writing you to elicit your support and advice for the \n     acute malpractice crisis going on in Virginia. . . . I am a \n     48-year-old single parent of a 14 and 17 year old. After all \n     the time and money spent training to practice Ob-Gyn, I find \n     myself on the verge of almost certain unemployment and \n     unemployability because of the malpractice crisis. I have \n     been employed by a small Ob-Gyn Group for the last 7 years. . \n     . . Our malpractice premiums were increased by 60% in May \n     2003. . . . The prediction from our malpractice carrier is \n     that our rates will probably double at our next renewal date \n     in May 2004. The reality is that we will not be able to keep \n     the practice open and cover the malpractice insurance along \n     with other expenses of practice.\n\n  Out of respect for this doctor's privacy, I will not share the \ndoctor's name, but I do keep her letter in my files. Unfortunately, \nthough, this doctor's experience is not unique.\n  Both Time Magazine and Newsweek have thoroughly detailed the crisis \ndoctors are facing across America.\n  In June of 2003, Time Magazine had a cover story on the affects of \nrising malpractice insurance rates. The story, entitled ``The Doctor is \nOut'' discusses several doctors, all across America, who have had to \neither stop practicing medicine or have had to take other action due to \nincreased insurance premiums.\n  One example cited in Time's article is the case of Dr. Mary-Emma \nBeres. Time reports:\n\n       Dr Mary-Emma Beres, a family practitioner in Sparta, N.C., \n     has always loved delivering babies. But last year Beres, 35, \n     concluded that she couldn't afford the tripling of her \n     $17,000 malpractice premium and had to stop. With just one \n     obstetrician left in town for high risk cases, some women who \n     need C-sections now must take a 40-minute ambulance ride.\n\n  Dr. Beres case makes clear that not only doctors are being affected \nby the medical malpractice insurance crisis, patients are as well. With \nincreased frequency, due to rising malpractice rates, more and more \npatients are not able to find the medical specialists they need.\n  Newsweek also recently had a cover story on the medical liability \ncrisis. That cover story was entitled, ``Lawsuit Hell.'' I was \nparticularly struck by the feature in this magazine about a doctor from \nOhio who saw his malpractice premiums rise in one year from $12,000 to \n$57,000 a year. As a result, this doctor, and I quote from the article, \n``decided to lower his bill by cutting out higher-risk procedures like \nvasectomies, setting broken bones and delivering babies even though \nobstetrics was his favorite part of the practice. Now he glances \nwistfully at the cluster of baby photos still tacked to a wall in his \noffice, `I miss that terribly,' he says.''\n  While these stories are compelling on their own, the consequences of \nthis malpractice crisis can even be more profound.\n  On February 11, 2003, Ms. Leanne Dyess of Gulfport, MS, shared with \nboth the HELP Committee and the Judiciary Committee her very personal \nstory about how this crisis has affected her.\n  Ms. Dyess told us how on July 5, 2002, her husband, Tony, was \ninvolved in a\n\n[[Page S1938]]\n\nsingle car accident. He was rushed to the hospital in Gulfport where he \nhad head injuries and received medical attention. Tony could not be \ntreated at the Gulfport hospital because they did not have the \nspecialist necessary to take care of him. After a 6 hour wait, he was \nairlifted to the University Medical Center. Today, Tony is permanently \nbrain damaged.\n  According to Mrs. Dyess, no specialist was on staff that night in \nGulfport because rising medical liability costs had forced almost all \nof the brain specialists in that community to abandon their practices. \nAs a result, Tony had to wait 6 hours before the only specialist left \nin Gulfport could treat Tony to reduce the swelling in his brain.\n  Without a doubt, the astronomical increases in medical malpractice \ninsurance premiums are having wide-ranging effects. It is a national \nproblem, and it is time for a national solution.\n  The President has indicated that the medical liability system in \nAmerica is largely responsible for the rising costs of malpractice \ninsurance. The American Medical Association and the American College of \nSurgeons agree with him as does almost every doctor in Virginia who I \nhave discussed the issue with.\n  The President of the AMA, Dr. John Nelson, has publicly stated, ``We \ncannot afford the luxury of waiting until the liability crisis gets \nworse to take action. Too many patients will be hurt.''\n  The American College of Surgeons concurs by stating, ``More and more \nAmericans aren't getting the care they need when they need it. . . . \nThe `disappearing doctor' phenomenon is getting progressively and \nrapidly worse. It is an increasingly serious threat to everyone's \nability to get the care they need.''\n  Let me state unequivocally that I agree with our President, with the \nAMA, with the American College of Surgeons, and with the vast majority \nof doctors all across Virginia. That is why I am offering my amendment \ntoday.\n  My amendment is simple, like other measures that have come before the \nSenate, my amendment provides a nationwide cap on damages in medical \nmalpractice lawsuits.\n  My amendment differs from other measures that have been voted on in \nthe Senate in one key aspect--whereas these other bills would have \napplied to doctors, nurses, insurance companies, drug companies, and \nothers, my amendment is solely limited to the caring medical \nprofessionals who take care of each and every one of us when we need \nmedical care.\n  It is a common sense solution to a serious problem.\n  Now that I have laid out the amendment, I would like to reiterate one \nimportant point. The gun immunity bill provides broad protection to gun \nmanufacturers and gun dealers in both federal and state court. The bill \nis aimed at protecting the manufacturers and dealers from lawsuits that \nresult from the criminal or unlawful use of a firearm. The basic idea \nis that if a manufacturer or dealer follows the statutory law in the \nmanufacturing and sale of a legal product, they should not be held \nresponsible for the actions of a third party.\n  While some may claim that this gun immunity bill might be an \nimportant component of tort reform, in my opinion, health care \nliability reform is even more important. We must protect the medical \nprofession and the patients it serves.\n  How can we give near absolute protection from litigation for one \nindustry, the gun industry, and do absolutely nothing for another \nindustry that is solely dedicated to saving lives?\n  Let's ask ourselves, in the event that a bullet from a firearm is \nshot into an innocent victim, is our healthcare system prepared to help \nthat victim? Without healthcare liability reform, it may not be, as \nthere might not be the appropriate doctor in the area to tend to the \npatient. That is why my amendment goes hand-in-hand with the gun \nimmunity bill.\n  So now it is up to my colleagues in the Congress. It is their choice. \nIf we are going to give legal protections to the gun industry, all I \nsay is let's give it to the doctors as well.\n  If this choice is given to the American people, there is no doubt \nthat the doctors would win by a 100-1 margin.\n  Now, I clearly recognize my situation. I want to compliment the \nleadership of both the majority and the minority. They were eminently \nfair. They explained to me the situation, and I am not able to obtain a \nvote on my amendment tonight. It comes as a matter of considerable \ndisappointment to me. Nevertheless, I think there are times when \nfrankness and honesty have to be shared. Under the current \nparliamentary situation on this bill, it is not possible for me to \nachieve the vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the magnificent communications I have \nreceived from a number of groups, physicians and their organizations, \nthat have strongly supported the initiative the Senator from Virginia \nhas taken on their behalf, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             College of American Pathologists,\n\n                                    Northfield, IL, March 1, 2004.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: The College of American Pathologists, \n     a medical specialty serving 16,000 pathologists and the \n     laboratory community, supports your amendment, the Protecting \n     the Practice of Medicine Act. This amendment would ensure \n     that patients have continued access to quality, affordable \n     health care by addressing excessive medical liability costs \n     that are threatening pathologist and other physician \n     practices.\n       Physicians are finding that liability insurance is no \n     longer available or affordable. Double digit rate increases \n     coupled with withdrawals of liability insurance providers \n     from the market have forced nearly thirty percent of \n     pathologists to look for new coverage. Your amendment \n     includes key elements of effective reform, such as caps on \n     non-economic and punitive damages, expert witness standards, \n     and preventing excessive attorney contingent fees to maximize \n     the recovery for patients. No limits would be imposed on \n     economic damages and states would be able to maintain their \n     own laws limiting damage awards.\n       Again the College supports your amendment and applauds your \n     leadership on this important issue. We look forward to \n     working with you to enact meaningful medical liability reform \n     that will strengthen our health care system and benefit \n     patients.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                    E.

John Warner,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: The American College of Obstetricians \n     and Gynecologists (ACOG), an organization representing nearly \n     46,000 physicians, thanks you for introducing S. Amdt. 2624, \n     the Protecting the Practice of Medicine Act, an amendment to \n     S. 1805, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. We \n     appreciate your commitment to resolve the medical liability \n     crisis facing this nation and protect access to needed health \n     care for our nation's women and children.\n       ACOG is deeply committed to resolving the medical liability \n     crisis--our number one legislative priority. The crisis is \n     severely jeopardizing women's access to ob-gyn care and \n     worsens with each passing day. Many obstetricians no longer \n     deliver babies, while many others are driven out of the \n     practice completely. And future generations of moms and \n     babies are at risk as fewer and fewer medical students choose \n     to become ob-gyns.\n       We are pleased that your amendment contains proven and \n     effective reforms, including a cap on non-economic damages, \n     limits on the number of years a plaintiff has to file a \n     lawsuit, and fair allocation of damages in proportion to a \n     party's degree of fault, as well as important expert witness \n     qualifications.\n       It is clear that the Senate presents unique challenges to \n     passing comprehensive legislation. It is important that every \n     effort to focus the Nation's attention on this important \n     issue is taken. Congress must pass, and the President must \n     sign, legislation that will resolve this crisis for all \n     physicians.\n       ACOG will do everything to end the medical liability \n     crisis, which is destroying this nation's health care system. \n     We look forward to continuing to work with you in the future \n     on this top priority.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Ralph W.

John Warner,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: On behalf of the 66,000 Fellows of the \n     American College of Surgeons, I am pleased to offer our \n     support for amendment titled Protecting the Practice of \n     Medicine Act. Outrageous medical liability premiums are \n     driving more surgeons from practice and making access for \n     patients more difficult than ever before.\n\n[[Page S1939]]\n\n       We are grateful that you have taken the lead in sponsoring \n     this necessary medical liability reform amendment that \n     promises protections for both patients and physicians. Not \n     only does its assure injured parties full compensation for \n     medical expenses and lost wages, but it also promotes a \n     speedy resolution of claims and directs monetary awards to \n     the patient.\n       Surgeons, in particular, have been targeted by skyrocketing \n     medical liability premiums, with some increasing by as much \n     as 300 percent. Many surgeons are being forced to retire \n     earlier, stop providing high-risk procedures, or move to \n     states where strong medical liability reforms are in place.\n       While we are offering our support for this amendment, we do \n     have some concerns with the subrogation language. We hope \n     this issue can be resolved as we work with you to move \n     medical liability reform legislation closer to becoming law.\n       We appreciate your effort to advance medical liability \n     reform through the United States Senate. If we can be of \n     assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                      Thomas R. Russell, MD, FACS,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             American Osteopathic Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 27, 2004.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: As President of the American \n     Osteopathic Association (AOA), I write to thank you for \n     introducing the ``Protecting the Practice of Medicine Act'' \n     (S. Amdt. 2624). The AOA, which represents the nation's \n     52,000 osteopathic physicians, support the provisions \n     contained in your amendment and applaud your continued \n     efforts to reform the nation's medical liability system.\n       The nation's health care delivery system and patient access \n     to quality and timely health care are damaged greatly by the \n     out-of-control medical liability system. As a result of this \n     crisis, patients in Virginia and numerous other states, face \n     the stark reality that their physician may not be available \n     to them at their time of need.\n       Osteopathic physicians are dedicated to providing quality \n     care to their patients. However, many of our members find it \n     difficult to secure professional liability insurance. Those \n     fortunate enough to secure a policy face premiums that are \n     largely unaffordable. As a result, our members are forced to \n     limit the services they offer their patients, move their \n     practices to states with meaningful medical liability \n     reforms, or simply retire from the practice of medicine. \n     Regardless of the decision made, patients are the ones who \n     suffer. They lose access to physician services, they lose \n     access to trauma centers, they lose access to hospitals--\n     plain and simple, patients lose.\n       It is our opinion that the medical liability crisis is the \n     greatest danger facing the health care delivery system. For \n     this reason, professional liability insurance reform remains \n     the top legislative priority for the AOA. Beyond access \n     problems, the liability crisis is a leading contributor to \n     the escalating costs of health care in this country.\n       The AOA and the American public support the enactment of \n     meaningful and comprehensive medical liability reforms in the \n     United States Senate. Please do not hesitate to call upon the \n     AOA and our members for assistance in your efforts on this \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Darryl A. Beehler, D.O.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 American Medical Association,\n\n                                                February 27, 2004.\n     Hon.

Warner,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: On behalf of the physicians and \n     medical students of the American Medical Association (AMA), I \n     am writing to support your proposed medical liability reform \n     amendment to S. 1805, the ``Protection of Lawful Commerce in \n     Arms Act.''\n       We are particularly pleased to see that your amendment \n     would establish a $250,000 Federal cap of non-economic \n     damages in medical liability suits against physicians, \n     hospitals, and other health care professionals and entities. \n     The legislation would provide states the flexibility to set \n     equal or lower caps on non-economic damages. It would also \n     protect those states that limit the amount of total damages \n     (including economic and non-economic damages) that may be \n     awarded in a lawsuit.\n       We deeply appreciate that your bill includes many of the \n     medical liability reforms that are part of the comprehensive \n     reforms that have proven effective in California and are \n     found in H.R. 5.\n       We are concerned, however, that language in the amendment \n     that relates to the collateral source/subrogation provision \n     and the ERISA cause of action/scope of preemption provision \n     could disadvantage patients and physicians. We would value \n     the opportunity to continue to discuss these concerns with \n     you.\n       The AMA applauds you for your leadership in offering this \n     amendment and for highlighting the continued and urgent need \n     for medical liability reform at the Federal level. We look \n     forward to working with you toward our mutual goal of \n     enacting comprehensive Federal reforms, including a $250,000 \n     cap on non-economic damages.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Michael D. Maves, MD, MBA.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I feel very strongly that we have to recognize, as a \nnation, that the medical profession must, at some point in time, be \ngiven protections not dissimilar to those protections sought in this \nparticular legislation. In this humble Senator's view, I feel it is far \nmore important that the medical profession be cared for now, and it \nshould be the top priority. The situation is, though, that I cannot get \na vote on my amendment. I feel this vote would be a very strong one, if \nI could get a vote, because I have stripped out all other beneficiaries \nthat were included in previous efforts, such as insurance companies and \ndrug manufacturers. I have limited it purely to physicians and nurses. \nI think they need help now because they are not able to deliver that \nquality of medical care they want to give to Americans throughout the \nfifty states.\n  With a great sense of disappointment I say that tonight I will not \nwithdraw the amendment, it will remain, but under the standing order it \nwill, unfortunately, expire automatically. I say to my colleagues, \nthough, that I will continue this fight another day.\n  I ask unanimous consent to place in the Record the full text of the \nstatement I made Friday on the Senate floor in support of my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/01/senate-section/article/S1939-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1939-S1942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          EXEMPTION TO S. 1805\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Before the Senator from Virginia leaves the floor, I \nexpress to him my gratitude for his willingness to do what he has just \ndone, which is to accept the facts that exist tonight, not because he \nlikes them but because he realistically has understood there is no \nalternative. I have always admired my friend from Virginia. He has \nspoken out in support of the principle which is also included in my \namendment. Although he did not say this to me personally, I know he \nwill not mind me sharing this with the body. He also wanted to make it \npossible for me to have an opportunity for a vote tomorrow, if not an \nup-or-down vote, at least on a motion to table. I thank him for his \nexpression of support to me personally and his willingness to help make \nit possible for me to have a vote tomorrow.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for those remarks. We \nhave been together in the Senate for 25 years. We have a responsibility \ntogether on the Armed Services Committee and so we know how to work \ntogether. I intend to support the distinguished Senator from Michigan \nin his efforts. The fact is, it is a good amendment and I urge all \nMembers to take a look at the amendment of the Senator from Michigan. I \nthank the Senator from Michigan for his personal comments. No one works \nharder for people than the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia and all \nthose in leadership who made it possible for this amendment to be voted \non tomorrow afternoon and before final passage. This is a very \nsignificant amendment we will be voting on tomorrow.\n  It has been stated by the manager of the bill--and now I am reading \nhis words--that we must insist the law be clear, unambiguous. That the \nofficer--here an officer who was injured by a weapon--have a day in \ncourt if he is harmed--here I am skipping over a few words to get to \nthe point--by someone who through negligence has caused a firearm to \nget into the hand of a criminal.\n  The amendment we will be voting on tomorrow afternoon makes it very \nclear lawsuits will be permitted if the defendant's own gross \nnegligence and own recklessness was a proximate cause of somebody's \ndeath or injury. The Senator from Idaho has said on a number of \noccasions people should not be held liable for somebody else's criminal \nact. I do not disagree with that. What my amendment says is someone can \nbe liable for their own recklessness and their own negligence. I make \nit clear in my amendment we are talking about gross negligence.\n  A number of cases have been referred to during the debate on this \nbill. One of the cases involves the so-called Bull's Eye Shooter Supply \nCompany. We had a situation where a gun dealer was allegedly reckless \nin terms of failing to\n\n[[Page S1940]]\n\nsecure his inventory and over and over again there were losses from \nthat inventory, and the DC shooters who killed so many people, Muhammad \nand Malvo, got one of those guns.\n  But for the negligence and recklessness of that gun dealer, they \nwould not have gotten those guns. That is the allegation in the \nlawsuit. So it is not Muhammad's and Malvo's criminal act that is the \nissue in this lawsuit in the State of Washington. It is the \nrecklessness and negligence of the gun dealer that is the issue in that \nlawsuit.\n  The court there was faced with a motion to dismiss and the court \nruled it was the alleged reckless or incompetent conduct of \ndistributing firearms which was the cause of action, not the criminal \nactivity of Muhammad and Malvo, and that but for that reckless and \nincompetent conduct in distributing firearms, the killing would not \nhave occurred. So my amendment makes clear what I think should be clear \nin this law, or any law, which is reckless or grossly negligent conduct \non the part of a defendant, if it is the proximate cause of somebody's \ndeath or injury, may be grounds for civil liability.\n  That is very separate from saying somebody is responsible for \nsomebody else's criminal conduct. This is making somebody responsible \nfor their own conduct which, of course, is the whole purpose of our \ntort law.\n  Tomorrow we are going to have an opportunity to make that clear in \nthe bill on which we are going to be voting. It might be argued that \nthe bill we are voting on says if you are negligent per se, you can be \nheld accountable. That is fine. Negligence per se means if you violate \na statute or violate the law.\n  But what happens if you are not violating a statute or law but that \nyou are still reckless or you are still grossly negligent? What if you \nare not violating a criminal law or a statute but you are just simply \nreckless in the way in which you do not maintain your inventory and you \ndo not secure the weapons you are selling? Most negligence, most gross \nnegligence, and most recklessness is not based on a violation of law. \nIt is based on a violation of a standard. We set forth those standards \nin gross negligence and recklessness in this amendment to make sure the \npeople who are going to be subject to civil liability are people whose \nown gross negligence, whose own recklessness is the proximate cause of \nsomebody else's injury or death.\n  It is simply not right that we say somebody whose gross negligence or \nrecklessness has caused injury or death to someone else should not be \nliable unless they have also violated a statute.\n  The lawsuit filed by Detective Lemongello and Officer McGuire, the \ntwo injured police officers who were shot by a gun sold to a straw \npurchaser, alleged negligence on the part of the seller of that gun. \nThe court denied a motion to dismiss the suit. This isn't a junk \nlawsuit. It is based on the alleged negligence of a gun dealer. But the \nbill before us would require it also to allege that the dealer violated \na statute.\n  It is not right that people who have been injured or killed by the \nreckless or grossly negligent conduct of a gun dealer or manufacturer \nmust also prove that the dealer or manufacturer violated a statute.\n  Individual responsibility has always been at the heart of good tort \nlaw and my amendment will keep it at the heart of the tort law that we \nare apparently going to be writing in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 5 minutes of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Again, I thank all of those who made it possible for me to \nget to a vote tomorrow afternoon on a rollcall. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nYork is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am rising in support of the amendment \nwe will vote on tomorrow on continuing the assault weapons ban. I am \ncarrying this amendment along with Senator Feinstein, who passed the \nbill in the Senate in 1993. I was the lead sponsor in the House as well \nas the two of our colleagues from the other side of the aisle, Senator \nWarner and Senator DeWine, and many others.\n  When we passed the assault weapons ban in 1993, there was a great \ndeal of concern. The arguments against the ban were two: One, that the \nbill would cause to be confiscated weapons far beyond the 19 banned \nweapons, the Uzis and the AK-47s; and, two, that it would not be \neffective.\n  We now have 10 years of evidence and the evidence is clear that \nneither of those worries about this bill have proven to be true. We \ncannot report a single instance where a nonassault weapon was \nconfiscated, an overreaching Government, ATF, or whomever went in and \nconfiscated hunting rifles or, frankly, other than the 19, weapons that \nwere not on the list. We were careful in the bill. We named 670 \ndifferent guns used for hunting, protection, and sports shooting that \ncould not be touched. But it is even new guns that have come out since \nthen. There has not been a single complaint of which I am aware.\n  Second, the bill has been effective. In all gun crimes, the percent \nof assault weapons that are used has gone down to one-third of what it \nwas. A little more than 3.5 percent--I think it is 3.75 percent of \ncrime guns were assault weapons back before 1993. In the last 10 years, \nit has gone down to 1.2 percent.\n  Law enforcement is strongly for our bill for the simple reason they \ndon't want to be outgunned on the streets. They don't want one of our \nlatest criminal problems, gangs, to have Uzis and AK-47s while they are \nshooting back with their 9 mms. The bill has worked.\n  As a result, the American people are overwhelmingly in favor of the \nassault weapons ban. Mr. President, 77 percent of the voters are for \nit; 21 percent against; even among gun owners, 66 percent for, 30 \npercent against. So the bill has overwhelming support.\n  You would think it would be renewed and renewed rather quickly, but \ninstead it is hanging by a hair. If I had to bet--and I have been \nwhipping this bill for the last week--there will either be a tie or it \nwill pass by one vote or it will fail by one vote. This bill is neck \nand neck. All it does is renew this controversial but successful piece \nof legislation for another 10 years. In fact, it is an exact replica of \nthe previous bill.\n  Many of us would have liked the bill to go further, to cover weapons \nthat are semiautomatic assault weapons but are not covered by the bill. \nManufacturers have come out and created new weapons around the 19. But \nin deference to those who worry that the Government will expand \nunreasonably search and confiscation, so to speak, of these weapons, we \ndidn't do it. So we are simply asking to renew the 19 different types \nof assault weapons.\n  Just to show, these weapons that were banned can never be used for \nhunting. They can never be used for target practice. They can't be \nused, really, in self-defense unless you are reckless and wild, because \nthey were designed by armies for use in military combat. In other \nwords, they didn't have to be terribly accurate. They had to have \nstrong firepower and be able to fire a whole lot of bullets in a very \nshort time. Names such as AK-47, Uzi, TEC-9, and Streetsweeper--these \nare weapons of mass devastation. They are very efficient killing \nmachines. They are appropriate on the field of battle but not in a \nreasonable country where there is a right to bear arms--which I believe \nin but not an unlimited right to bear any arm whatsoever.\n\n  I would say to my colleagues, my adversaries, because that is what \nthey are really, in the NRA, no amendment is absolute. I believe in the \nfirst amendment. I cherish it. But there are a lot of limits on first \namendment rights. Judge Oliver Wendell Holmes said you can't wrongly \nscream ``fire'' in a crowded theater. That is an imposition on my \ncomplete rights of free speech but it is a reasonable limitation.\n  The same on the second amendment. I tell you I resent those on the \nleft who want the first amendment to be expanded as broadly as possible \nand then say the second amendment has to fit through a pinhole. There \nis a right to bear arms but it is not an unlimited right to bear arms. \nShould anyone be able to buy a tank or a bazooka? Of course not.\n  Here is an AK-47. It is the most widely used assault weapon in the \nworld. It is a very good military machine. It comes with a 30-round \nammunition clip capable of being fired as fast as the operator can pull \nthe trigger. The faster you can move your finger, the more\n\n[[Page S1941]]\n\npeople you can kill. With a little practice, a shooter could kill an \nentire basketball team in seconds. That is not what we want and no one \nwould use this weapon for hunting. No store owner or homeowner would \nuse this for self-defense. They are not even accurate. They just fire a \nlot of bullets.\n  How about the next one, the Uzi? This was designed originally as a \nsubmachinegun. It comes with a 32-round ammunition magazine capable of \nbeing fired as fast as the operator can pull the trigger. It is easy to \nhide because of its compact design and it is very reliable. Why? \nBecause the Uzi was made for the Israeli Army. Not for the Bloods or \nthe Crips or the MS-13 or any of the violent gangs that love to use \nthese weapons.\n  There is the TEC-9. We don't have a chart of it. It is similar; 30- \nto 36-rounds, easily convertible into a machinegun.\n  Perhaps the most scary of all, is the Streetsweeper. The \nStreetsweeper--here it is--can fire twelve 12-gauge shotgun shells in \nless than 15 seconds. That's right, shotgun shells, not regular \nammunition. Anyone who knows guns knows a shotgun sprays wide with \nshot, rather than fixing on a narrow target with a single bullet. That \nis what makes the Streetsweeper's capability remarkable. It is not part \nof the right of the average citizen to bear arms.\n  So the bottom line is this is a reasonable bill that has been \nsuccessful. There is no, let me repeat, no civilian use for the 19 \nweapons banned by the assault weapons ban.\n  Pre-ban assault weapons continue to plague our streets. A couple of \nweeks ago in my city of Albany, NY, my State, the Albany Police \nDepartment suffered its first death of a police officer since 1987. LT \nJohn Finn, a highly decorated well-regarded officer and 13-year veteran \nof the Albany PD was shot on December 23, 2003, 2 days before \nChristmas, by a criminal using a pre-ban assault weapon, an American \nArms AP 9 mm. On February 12, Officer Finn succumbed to his wounds and \ndied.\n  That is all we are trying to stop, not impinge on the rights of gun \nowners. Police organizations, law enforcement are for us; the FOP, the \nInternational Brotherhood of Police, Major Cities Chiefs of Police, \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police, Hispanic-American Police \nCommand Officers, many other groups. I ask unanimous consent to have \nthe list printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The International Brotherhood of Police Officers; the Major \n     Cities Chiefs of Police; the International Association of \n     Chiefs of Police; and the Hispanic-American Police Command \n     Officers Association.\n       Groups which represent our State and local municipalities, \n     who see first hand the bloody violence that assault weapons \n     can cause, likewise support this bill.\n       They include: the National League of Cities; the National \n     Association of Counties; and the United States Conference of \n     Mayors.\n       Renewing the Assault Weapons Ban makes so much sense that \n     organizations which represent the doctors and nurses who see \n     gunshot victims in emergency rooms every day likewise support \n     this bill. They include: the American Academy of Family \n     Physicians; the American Public Health Association; the \n     National Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems; \n     and the Physicians for a Violence Free Society;\n       It makes so much sense that organizations which represent \n     victims of gun violence and other crimes in society likewise \n     support this bill. They include: the Family Violence \n     Prevention Fund; the National Coalition Against Domestic \n     Violence; and the National Network to End Domestic Violence.\n       Renewing the Assault Weapons Ban makes so much sense that \n     organizations which represent just regular mothers, fathers, \n     children and families across America strongly support this \n     bill, like: the Mothers Against Violence in America; and the \n     Child Welfare League of America;\n       Even religious organizations like the National Association \n     of Catholic Bishops and the American Academy of Episcopal \n     Churches support renewing the ban.\n\n  Finally, more then 100 mayors across America have written to Senator \nFeinstein or myself in support of this bill.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Finally, the tactics.\n  As I said, this bill is hanging by a thread. The vote is neck and \nneck.\n  I would first ask any of you out there in America who are listening \nto support this ban and to call your Senator. Let them know how you \nfeel because most Americans are overwhelmingly for the bill.\n  I would say to our President down at the other end of Pennsylvania \nAvenue: Please. You said you support renewing the ban. Step up to the \nplate. Help get it passed.\n  One thing the American people are upset with these days is when any \npolitician says one thing but then does another. To say we shouldn't \namend the immunity bill, to say do not lift a finger and help get this \nban passed when it is so close, will make the American people, in my \nopinion, justifiably think the President doesn't want it to pass.\n  I would again renew my plea to the Vice President that he be \navailable tomorrow. There may well be a tie vote, and he has been a \nloyal and true servant to the President. We ask him to sit in the Chair \nyou are now sitting in, Mr. President, and cast that vote in favor of \nrenewing the ban.\n  I hope my colleagues will look into their consciences.\n  I understand there is a lot of misinformation about this bill. I \nstill have people occasionally who come to me in my State and ask, Why \ndo you want to take away my gun rights? I believe in the right to bear \narms. I have opposed abolition of the second amendment, like some of my \ncolleagues from New York on the House side have argued should be done. \nBut if you do not have reasonable laws within the confines of amendment \nrights, our country wouldn't function.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to look into their consciences because we \nare going to need every vote we can get here to not allow the assault \nweapons ban to expire, which would be a step backward in America--a \nstep backward for law enforcement, a step backward for safety and, \nfrankly, a step backward in the political discourse of civility and \nrationality we all prize.\n  I urge support of the amendment Senators Feinstein, Warner, DeWine, \nand myself will be offering for a vote tomorrow morning at 11:30.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOhio is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I spoke earlier today in favor of an \namendment we have offered which the Senator from New York is talking \nabout; that is, the assault weapon ban. It is a very simple amendment. \nI don't intend to talk about it this evening other than to say this is \nmerely a reiteration of status quo--a law that has been on the books \nnow for 10 years, and a law that has the support of law enforcement \nofficers across this country. It is the right thing to do from a law \nenforcement point of view. This Congress should in fact continue this \nlaw in effect. This is truly a law enforcement vote. I commend my \ncolleague from New York for his comments.\n  Let me speak tonight about three different items.\n  First, very briefly, I would like to support the Levin amendment \nwhich will be voted on tomorrow. I thank my colleague from Michigan for \nhis leadership on this issue. His amendment is a simple, modest \namendment. It would merely allow injured victims to bring cases of \ngross negligence or recklessness against irresponsible gun dealers \nwithout the unreasonable restrictions of the gun liability bill that is \nin front of us. That is fair. It is justice.\n  I have already spoken about what I consider to be the drastic attack \nthe underlying bill makes on ordinary negligence cases and on this \nselect group of victims in our society. It is wrong. As my colleagues \nknow, cases of gross negligence or recklessness require even greater \nwrongdoing by irresponsible people before liability can be found. This \namendment merely restores the ability of parties injured as a result of \ngross negligence or recklessness to have their day in court. I implore \nmy colleagues in the Senate when Senator Levin's amendment is offered \ntomorrow to vote in favor of it.\n  I rise this evening also in support of Senator McCain's amendment \nwhich will also be voted on tomorrow. This amendment is known as the \nGun Show Loophole Closing Act of 2003. Senators Lieberman, Reed, and \nmyself are the original cosponsors of this commonsense amendment, an \namendment that aims to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and out \nof the hands of children.\n  The United States Constitution guarantees the rights of gun owners. \nWe all believe strongly in the second amendment. As a former prosecutor \nin Greene County, Ohio, I have learned the best\n\n[[Page S1942]]\n\nway to protect the rights of law-abiding citizens and reducing illegal \nand often fatal use of guns is to pass and enforce tough laws that \nseverely punish criminals who use them. I have tried to do that \nthroughout my legislative career.\n  I have consistently supported measures to keep firearms from getting \ninto the wrong hands and efforts that increase the punishment of those \nwho use firearms in the commission of a crime. I believe the Gun Show \nLoophole Closing Act helps achieve this goal.\n  For the most part, our current system is working. Under the existing \nBrady bill, when a purchaser buys a gun from a licensed dealer, he or \nshe must undergo a background check through the Federal Government's \nNational Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, into which \nStates feed records of certain criminals and others not qualified to \nown a gun. NICS has up to 3 days to inform the dealer as to whether the \nbuyer is qualified to purchase a gun. But 95 percent of these checks \ncome up with an instant or near instant response allowing or \ndisallowing the purchase immediately. So a decision can be made. The \nperson can get their gun.\n  This amendment simply applies the same commonsense check to all gun \nshow sales. Right now, there is no statute requiring that all sellers \nat gun shows run these checks on potential gun buyers. Yet according to \nFederal officials, gun shows are the second leading source of illegal \nguns recovered from gun trafficking investigations.\n  By leaving this loophole open, by not requiring all gun show sellers \nto run NICS checks, we are presenting gun traffickers and other \ncriminals with a prime opportunity to acquire firearms. This is \nterrifying. This is unacceptable. In common language, we have a \nsituation where someone can walk into a gun show, look around, look for \na licensed firearm dealer, and find a firearm dealer. If they buy a gun \nfrom that person, there will be a check run. But if they do not want a \ncheck run on them, all they have to do is find someone at the gun show \nwho is not a licensed firearm dealer. At most gun shows they can find \nthat person. They just have to look around. They will find them. Guess \nwhat. They do not have to have a check run.\n  If you are a criminal, if you have a felony conviction, or worse yet, \nif you are a terrorist, you go to a gun show and you find someone who \nis not a registered firearm dealer and you buy their gun and there is \nno check done. That is a classic definition or classic example of a \nloophole.\n  Following the attacks on September 11, for example, news reports \nsuggested that al-Qaida produced a handbook in which it advised \nterrorists to purchase firearms at gun shows in the United States. \nOther media reports indicate that suspected terrorists have exploited \nthis loophole to acquire firearms. It is imperative now, more than \never, to enact legislation to protect our citizens from this potential \narea of terrorist exploitation.\n  This amendment is simply common sense. Regardless of where firearms \nare purchased, whether at a gun shop or a gun show, the laws should be \nthe same. It seems silly if you go to a gun show to buy a gun, the \ndetermination as to whether you will have to undergo a background check \nis wholly dependent upon how you purchase a gun; that is, you could buy \na gun from one seller and be subjected to the government's Brady check. \nBut if you walk a few feet away, you can find another seller, give them \nsome cash, they would be willing to give you a gun, and that gun would \nnot be subject to a check and that seller would not be subject to a \ncheck. You would walk away with a gun and totally be unchecked. Don't \nwe think that criminals know this? Of course they know it.\n  It is like having a metal detector at the front entrance of our \nbuilding but leaving the back door wide open for anyone to pass \nthrough. Don't we think that under that circumstance, someone with \nnefarious intentions would simply use the back entrance? That would \nmake our attempt at security completely illusory. Indeed, not only \nwould there be no greater security whatever, we would be paying a lot \nof money to do absolutely nothing, nothing other than giving hard-\nworking Americans a false sense of security. That certainly makes no \nsense and would not under those circumstances.\n  That is the exact same thing that is going on with the gun show \nloophole. People with these nefarious intentions know they have a back \ndoor to getting guns without any threat of a background check. Thus, \nthis Government, spending millions of dollars on a sophisticated system \nof background checks to check the background of people who voluntarily \nchoose to be checked, they go in, buy the gun, they voluntarily choose \nto be checked, but the system totally misses those who, with very \nlittle effort, choose to evade it.\n  That is a waste of the American people's money. At the same time, it \ngives them a false sense of security. We need to provide the American \npeople with the security they deserve and for which they are already \npaying. This amendment, the McCain amendment, that we will vote on \ntomorrow, closes the gun show loophole in a way that respects the \nsecond amendment and also respects an honest law-abiding American's \nright to buy and sell guns and to attend gun shows. That is good law. \nIt is good policy. It makes good common sense. That is why I support \nthis amendment and urge my colleagues to join me tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/01/senate-section/article/S1942-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1942-S1944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 HAITI\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I will discuss tonight the situation in \nHaiti. I have come to the Senate many times in the past to discuss the \nsituation in Haiti. Over the last 9, 10 years since I have been in the \nSenate, I have traveled to Haiti 13 or 14 different times. Haiti has \nbeen on the front page of the papers now and in the news for the last \nseveral weeks. The situation certainly reached a climax this weekend.\n  Once more, Haiti is at a crossroad. Once more, the U.S. troops, U.S. \nMarines, are back in Haiti. I commend President Bush for taking \ndecisive action and sending the Marines into Haiti to stabilize the \nsituation in this poor country. We have 20,000 Americans who live in \nHaiti. This country is in our own back yard. The President made the \nright decision.\n  But if we are to avoid this happening again and again and again, \navoid the necessity of sending U.S. troops back to Haiti time and time \nagain, avoid seeing the boat people coming toward the United States, \navoid having to see the very sad scene of the U.S. Coast Guard having \nto pick these poor, miserable people up on the high seas and take them \nback to Haiti, if we are to avoid this in the future, and if the people \nof Haiti are to have any hope, then this country and the international \ncommunity has to now take some very bold and radical steps.\n  Now is the time to change the future and to do some things \ndifferently. We have to do them in conjunction with the new coalition \nHaitian Government. The Haitian Government, by the way, cannot include \nand should not include the thugs, the drug dealers, the bad people who \nare part of this group of rebels who were marching on Port-au-Prince. \nThese are not good people. They cannot be part of the government. But \nthere are many good people in Haiti who can be a part, and are going to \nbe a part of the new coalition government.\n  Briefly, in the time remaining in the Senate, I will make a few \nsuggestions. These are suggestions made in regard to the long-term \nhealth of Haiti. They are this idea of bold and innovative and radical \nchange of things that need to be done. First is trade. Congressman Clay \nShaw and I have introduced in our respective bodies a bill, S. 489, a \ntrade bill, a very modest bill. It would not cost any American job. It \nmight cost some jobs in Asia, but certainly it would not cost any jobs \nin the United States. It would create some jobs in Haiti, give them \nmodest trade preference.\n  It was not too many years ago there were 100,000 assembly jobs in \nHaiti. Today, there are only about 30,000. This bill would create very \nquickly, probably 60,000 or 70,000 jobs in Haiti, assembly jobs. \nHaitian people are an industrious, hard-working people. Anyone who \nknows anything about Haiti will tell you that. These jobs would be \ncreated very quickly. For each job that is created, each one of those \nindividuals would support many people and their families. Haitian \npeople want the same thing that people in this country\n\n[[Page S1943]]\n\nwant. They want to be able to make a living, to support their families, \nfeed their children. This bill would go a long way to do that.\n  Second, the Haitian Government has inherited this new government, \nwill inherit from past governments from years and years ago, a debt to \nthe international community of $1.17 billion. Let's do something bold. \nLet's get together with the international community and say that debt \nneeds to be forgiven. Let's get rid of it. Don't saddle this government \nwith that debt. That is bold. That is different. We have done it in the \npast. The international community did it as far as wiping away some of \nthe debt for Nicaragua, another very poor country in this hemisphere--\nnot as poor as Haiti--but we did it a few years ago. It needs to be \ndone for Haiti if this Government of Haiti will have a chance.\n  Third, we have to put resources in and work with the new Government \nof Haiti in regard to the rule of law, and to start with the courts. We \ncan have free elections and try to bring back democracy, and have \ndemocracy, but there is nothing more important--frankly, nothing \ntougher--than to develop a court system that respects the rule of law.\n  Why is the rule of law important? Well, one reason it is important \nis, if you are going to have foreign investment in the country, if you \nare going to get people, companies to put money into a country and to \ninvest and create jobs--which is what you have to have; you have to \nhave jobs--then they have to be able to have some assurance that when \nthey make an investment, their investment will be protected. You only \ndo that through the rule of law, and you do that by having honest \njudges and cases that can be processed in court.\n  We can do that by mentoring the judges, by helping create the system \nin their country, the magistrates. We need to put extra effort into \nthat. We have the ability in this country to do it. We have good \nprograms through our Justice Department and State Department. We have \ndone it in other countries. We can do it there.\n  In relation to the police, we were making very good headway a few \nyears ago in Haiti. We brought into Haiti some great Haitian-American \ncops from New York City and Chicago and LA. They went down to Haiti. \nThey mentored the new, young recruits, and things were working. I saw \nit myself. You should have seen the pride when I talked to these \nHaitian-American policemen from Chicago and LA and New York. They were \nso proud of what they were doing.\n  Unfortunately, President Aristide allowed it to become political. It \nthen started to become corrupt, and all that good work started to go \ndown the drain. That work can be revised. Some of those policemen who \nwere trained are still in the country. Some of them were fired, kicked \nout by the politicians. They can be brought back. We can retrain some \npeople, and that can be reconstituted, because Haiti has to have a good \npolice force.\n  This time it is going to have to be separated somehow from the \ngovernment politicians. It is going to have to be independent. It is \ngoing to have to respect the rule of law and not be politicized.\n  Fourth, we are going to have to restore aid to the government. A few \nyears ago, when we became very disenchanted--what our Government did \nwith the Aristide regime, I believe understandably so--we stopped \ngiving any aid to the government. We gave aid to the NGOs and to the \nnonprofits and to the charitable organizations down there. I happened \nto think it was the right thing to do, and I supported that. But what \nthat meant was, the government institutions suffered.\n  Today, with the new government that is starting to emerge in Haiti, \nwe have to nourish that because if the institutions in a country do not \nflourish, it is hard to have democracy. So we have to reinstate, now, \nour direct aid. And other countries have to do the same. We are in this \nwith other countries. They have to reinstate their direct aid. We have \nto reinstate our direct aid to the Government of Haiti so they can \ndevelop their institutions, whether they are the courts or the police \nor the other basic institutions of the country.\n  Fifth, Haiti is one of the most deforested countries in the world. It \nis a country that suffers from depleted topsoil. We have to work with \nthem to develop better agricultural practices.\n\n  All the people are fleeing the countryside, going to Port-au-Prince, \ngoing to Cap-Haitien, creating more and more slums, with more and more \npeople who cannot be fed, with more and more crime and all kinds of \nproblems that you see with slums in cities.\n  That trend can only be reversed if people have a way of making a \nliving and farming. So our economic development has to be focused on \nagriculture and good practices. USAID has to work with other donors \naround the world to focus on that.\n  Haiti is a relatively small country of 8 million people; it has \nhardly any topsoil left. It is deforested. The emphasis has to be put \non sustainable agriculture and economic development.\n  Finally, we have to continue our assistance. The international \ncommunity has to continue the assistance. We have to continue our \nassistance on all the good work that is being done in Haiti, including \nthe amazing work in regard to fighting the AIDS problem in Haiti. AIDS \nis a huge problem, but there are excellent doctors who are working on \nthat problem. Dr. Pape and Dr. Farmer are doing very wonderful work \nthere.\n  So we have to be bold; we have to be radical, if we do not want to be \nback in Haiti in a couple more years with the Marines again.\n  Haiti is in our backyard. It will always be in our backyard. It will \nnever be of strategic importance to the United States, but it will \nalways be of importance. It will always be a country we will have to \ndeal with. If not for humanitarian concerns--and I think it should be; \nI think we should worry about their humanitarian concerns--we will \nalways be there because of the reasons I have mentioned.\n  No other nation in our hemisphere has a higher rate of AIDS than \nHaiti. No other nation in our hemisphere has a higher infant mortality \nrate or a lower life expectancy rate than Haiti. No other country in \nour hemisphere is as environmentally strapped as Haiti.\n  Despite its radical differences, Haiti remains in our own backyard. \nIt is intrinsically linked to the United States by history, geography, \nand humanitarian concerns. It is linked to us by illicit drug trade and \nthe ever-present possibility of droves of incoming refugees. Haiti's \nproblems are--whether we like it or not--our problems.\n  To assure progress, Mr. President and Members of the Senate, we--\nRepublicans and Democrats--in Congress need to join forces and approach \nHaiti with a united, bipartisan front. Haiti's dire humanitarian and \neconomic crisis transcends partisan politics. Moreover, the United \nStates must work with the international community over the long haul \nbecause any improvements will require a serious, sustained long-term \ncommitment.\n  Conditions in Haiti will not change overnight. We must remain, \nthough, committed to Haiti for as long as it takes for reforms to take \nroot and for a democratic system of government to emerge.\n  Ultimately, the United States cannot ``fix'' Haiti, nor can the \ninternational community. But we can improve the situation, and we can \nhelp Haiti begin to help itself. Clearly, Haiti is at a pivotal point \nin its history, and so is the international community. We can either \nchoose a path that builds upon Haiti's tentative democracy or choose a \nroad that will lead to yet another dictatorial regime. This time, let's \nget it right. This time, let's not blow it.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Thank you, Mr. President. I commend my friend and \ncolleague from Ohio for his eloquent and very thoughtful statements on \nboth the legislation before the Senate as well as the situation in \nHaiti. I commend his wisdom to the rest of my colleagues, as I will \ntake it upon myself.\n\n[[Page S1944]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/01/senate-section/article/S1942-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1942-S1944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 HAITI\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I will discuss tonight the situation in \nHaiti. I have come to the Senate many times in the past to discuss the \nsituation in Haiti. Over the last 9, 10 years since I have been in the \nSenate, I have traveled to Haiti 13 or 14 different times. Haiti has \nbeen on the front page of the papers now and in the news for the last \nseveral weeks. The situation certainly reached a climax this weekend.\n  Once more, Haiti is at a crossroad.

Mr. President, I wish to change the subject to another \nimportant matter that has arisen, because recently President Bush \nannounced his support for a constitutional amendment which would define \nmarriage.\n  While our majority leader, Senator Frist, wisely observed, last week, \nthat one does not want to knee-jerk or respond too quickly to changing \nthe Constitution--and I certainly agree with that observation--the \nSenate Republican Conference chairman recently said he hoped the \namendment would pass out of the Judiciary Committee and be before the \nfull Senate by mid to late April. So much for not knee-jerking or \nresponding too quickly to amend the Constitution.\n  This is one constitutional amendment that evidently is being put on \nthe fast track. I ask my colleagues to compare that timetable with the \nproposed constitutional amendment to ban the burning or desecration of \nthe American flag, which I support, which has been proposed for the 3 \nyears I have been in the Senate. No votes scheduled on that. No \nstatement by the President about the need to protect the American flag.\n  For almost as long as that, there has been a proposed constitutional \namendment to protect the rights of victims of violent crimes, which I \nalso support. No vote planned on that. No statement from the President \non protecting the victims of violent crimes--just a budget that cuts \nfunding for local law enforcement programs, including almost \neliminating the COPS program that puts more police officers on streets \nin cities and sheriffs in rural areas, in Minnesota and across the \ncountry, to prevent violent crimes.\n  It certainly shows the priorities of this President and the Senate's \nmajority that protection of the American flag and of the rights of \nvictims of violent crimes are set aside, while the constitutional \namendment to define marriage gets this priority treatment.\n  In my opinion, it is the wrong priority and the wrong policy. The \nproposed constitutional amendment on marriage is un-American, un-\nChristian, and unwise. It is the wrong approach. We need to find a \nbetter answer. We also need to avoid the mean, ugly, dehumanizing, and \ndivisive debate that a constitutional amendment would require. We owe \nthe American people much better than that.\n  In the Bible, Jesus says, ``Render unto Caesar the things which are \nCaesar's, and render unto God the things that are God's.'' Many of the \nChristian religions' marriage ceremonies proclaim marriage as an \ninstitution created by God. I agree. So let us leave the definition of \nmarriage to the various religions as they interpret the Word of God, \nand Congress, the Federal Government, any government in this country, \nshould keep its hands off of marriage. It belongs to God. That follows \nthe words of Jesus and it also follows the founding principle of this \ncountry, the freedom of religion, the separation of church and state.\n  Surely this body doesn't intend to tamper with that bedrock principle \nlong enshrined in our Constitution, the free exercise of religion. It \nis the civil side of this overlapping term called marriage that we can \nand should concern ourselves with. First, we should clear up the \nconfusion being caused by the dual usage of the word ``marriage'' to \napply to both a religious ceremony and a legal contract. Let's find a \nterm like ``marital contract'' or ``legal union'' or ``matrimony'' to \ndescribe the civil relationship for everybody. It will be perhaps a \nlittle awkward at first, as word changes always are, but they are far \neasier than constitutional amendments, and far less destructive than \nthis one would be.\n  Yesterday I was having lunch with my father, a wonderful man whom I \nlove dearly. He expressed his concern about gay marriages, and then I \nexplained some of the real-life rights and protections involved, like \nproperty transfers, inheritance rights, or hospital visitations. He \nsaid, ``I am for all that.'' That is the distinction which must be \nmade. Not everybody will agree with my father about all of that. \nHowever, most Americans, I believe, would consider those issues \ndifferently and feel differently about them than about the term ``gay \nmarriage,'' which should not be forced upon them.\n\n  We have a choice. We can lead the consideration of these very \npersonal, very sensitive, and very controversial matters toward a \nhigher plain of respectful, rational discussion and resolution or we \ncan drag them through divisive, destructive, and dehumanizing \ndemagoguery on the Senate floor. Obviously, some people--starting, \nevidently, with the President of the United States--believe it is to \ntheir political advantage to do the latter. That is really a shame.\n  Our Constitution should be above Presidential politics; it should be \nabove partisan politics; it should be above any politics at all. It is \nthe greatest document on governance ever written by the human race in \nall of recorded history throughout the world. Since the first 12 \namendments were quickly added, it has been amended only 15 other times \nin the past 200 years. Those amendments were either to adjust how our \nGovernment functions, such as the direct election of Senators, or the \nsuccession after the death of a President, or as amendments to extend \nthe founding principles of this country of life, liberty, and the \npursuit of happiness to all our citizens fully and equally, like the \nabolishment of slavery, giving women the right to vote, and providing \nequal protections to all of our citizens.\n  The Constitution doesn't define the Ten Commandments or the Golden \nRule. It doesn't define war, peace, family values, spiritual growth, or \neven good and evil. It is big hearted, not mean spirited. It unites \nrather than divides us. It expands human liberties, protects human \nrights, and it treats all of us as equals. Our Constitution affirms the \nbest of the human spirit, tolerance, and acceptance of differences, and \nthe rights of each of us as human beings--not the worst of human \nnature, prejudice, and hatred.\n  The proposed amendment on marriage is the worst. It is that mean \nspirited, degrading, and divisive. It is un-American and it is unworthy \nof our Constitution. It is also un-Christian.\n  I am not going to dwell on this point, but as a Christian I am \noffended by those false prophets who cloak their arguments with \nbiblical references that simply do not exist. I recently reread the \nfour Gospels of the New Testament--actually, the entire New Testament, \nthe King James version. I cannot find anywhere that Jesus Christ \ncondemns homosexual relationships or gay marriages. He makes no mention \nof them at all. Twelve times he condemns adultery. Six times he opposes \ndivorce. No one is proposing a constitutional amendment to ban adultery \nor divorce.\n  What Jesus does say repeatedly is to love thy neighbor as thyself. \nOne of the ten great commandments is: ``Love one another as I have \nloved you. By this, people will know thee as my disciple.''\n  Jesus did not say to love only thy opposite sex neighbor, or love \nonly thy same race neighbor, or love thy just like my neighbor. He \nsaid, ``Love thy neighbor as thy self.'' He also said to beware of \nfalse prophets who appear like sheep, but inwardly are raving wolves. \nHow do you tell them apart? He said by those who preach love versus \nthose who preach hatred. A simple test.\n  This proposed constitutional amendment spews hatred and that is why \nit is un-Christian. This amendment is un-American, un-Christian, and it \nis unwise. It is ugly, divisive, and destructive. Some people like to \npromote the so-called culture wars. They try to build themselves up by \ntearing other people down, try to make them seem immoral or bad or \nwrong for being the way God made them, or however one comes to be who \nhe or she really is.\n  Ugly, divisive, destructive, hateful--that is what this debate will \nbecome right here on the Senate floor and spread all across America by \nfalse prophets who claim the moral high ground while they reach down \ninto the emotional cesspool and hurl their slime at decent and innocent \nhuman beings--our fellow citizens.\n  As I said earlier--and I will close by saying it again--we have the \nchoice and the obligation to do better than that. We can and we must \naddress these issues and the people affected by them respectfully and \nresponsibly. We can render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's and \nrender unto God the things that are God's. We can leave marriage to \nGod, treat it as a religious ceremony under the terms and conditions \nestablished by religions and, as\n\n[[Page S1945]]\n\nGovernment, leave those matters to God.\n  We can define the legal union of two people as a marital contract or \nmatrimony or some other term, and either allow the States to define \nthose terms, benefits, and protections of that contract or do so \nourselves. I prefer we do the latter, consistent with the equal \nprotections clauses in article 4 and the fourteenth amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution for everyone, by passing laws, not a \nconstitutional amendment--laws which define a legal union or a marital \ncontract for everyone but which leave marriage as a separate province \nof religions.\n  By following this course, we will judge not that we shall not be \njudged; we will condemn not that we shall not be condemned. For it is \nsaid that with the same measure that we mete withal, it shall be \nmeasured to us again.\n  The Founders of this country were wise enough not to inscribe their \ncondemnations into the Constitution. Senators for over 200 years have \nbeen wise enough not to insert their religious interpretations or their \npersonal condemnations into our Constitution. We would be most unwise \nto do otherwise.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/01/senate-section/article/S1945-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
