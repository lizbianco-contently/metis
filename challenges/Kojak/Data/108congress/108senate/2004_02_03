Mr. President, under a previous order, we will be in \nmorning business until 10:30 a.m., as mentioned. At 10:30 we will begin \nthe highway bill. As mentioned yesterday, it will be very important to \naddress this bill and spend the appropriate time this week and through \nnext week with the objective of completing this bill by the end of next \nweek. It is a very important bill in terms of supporting our \ninfrastructure throughout this country, in terms of providing that \ninfrastructure to support our economy, and also to create jobs. It is a \nvery important bill.\n  The relevant committees met yesterday. Some of those committee \nmeetings will be affected by the closure of the office buildings today, \nbut we will have further announcements on the committee meetings a \nlittle bit later this morning.\n  We will be here today, and I do encourage Members to make their \nopening statements today. We will have a comment shortly on the policy \nluncheons today within the next several minutes after I speak with the \nDemocratic leader.\n\n\n                             ricin finding\n\n  I will comment very quickly--because there are a lot of questions and \na lot of news reports--as most people know, in midafternoon yesterday, \na powder that was ultimately determined to be ricin was found in my \npersonal office building. Everything was handled in a very appropriate \nway in terms of the screening tests that have been established, and \nultimately, after a series of tests of what are called specificity and \nsensitivity tests, confirmatory results came back last night at around \n9:30 that this was ricin.\n\n  There will be a lot of discussion in the news and around here as to \nwhat ricin is. As I mentioned last night, it is a type of what we call \na toxin or a poison. It is not a virus, and it is not a bacteria, so a \nlot of people say it is not biological, but it is made from a castor \nbean. Somebody, in all likelihood, manufactured this with an intent to \nharm, and this is a criminal investigation that will be underway.\n  As everyone knows by now--or we hope they know--we made a decision, \nbased on the procedures that are quite thorough and comprehensive, to \nclose the three Senate office buildings today. Meetings have continued \nthrough the night and today over the course of this morning thus far. \nFurther decisions will be made about reopening those buildings. The \nreal purpose of that is that the mail be addressed in an appropriate \nway in those buildings.\n  Let me also say that all air sampling and all environmental studies \ntoday are negative with the exception of what was found in that single \noffice at that site.\n  With that, I think I will stop to say we will have our activity here \non the floor of the Senate. The Capitol Building is open today, and \nindividual committee chairmen will be announcing what the plans are \nwith hearings that were scheduled today in the Senate office buildings. \nMost of those will be closed.\n  At this time I will turn to the Democratic leader. We will likely be \nmaking other announcements over the course of the morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/03/senate-section/article/S383-8", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, let me first express the sentiment that I \nknow is shared by the entire Senate family in expressing our concern \nand our admiration for Senator Frist and his staff. Having been through \nthis ordeal in another form a couple of years ago, I know the \ndifficulty it presents personally to staff and to families of staff, \nand I know we are probably in a better position to confront these \nchallenges today than we were 2 years ago. But we speak with one voice \nin expressing our concern for those staff and our optimism about our \nability to successfully confront this challenge as we did 2 years ago.\n  I know this has been a long 24 hours for the majority leader. He had \na late night the night before, and then last night it would not \nsurprise me if he got no sleep at all. So he is working on little \nsleep, and I appreciate his report this morning.\n  Obviously, we have a number of decisions to make over the course of \nthe day, and I will consult with him. I do hope, to the extent it is \npracticable, that we use this opportunity to continue the debate on \nhighways. We do not have a lot of time, and I know each day is valuable \nfrom that perspective. But we also want to be practical, recognizing if \nthe offices are closed, it will be hard for Senators and their staff to \ndo work related to the highway bill. I look forward to consulting and \nworking with the distinguished majority leader as we deal with the \nnecessity this situation has presented to us.\n  Mr. President, I know colleagues on both sides of the aisle are \ninterested in the schedule. I know the majority leader had announced \nthat there will be caucus lunches. I want to make sure people \nunderstand, we will have our normally scheduled caucus lunch today. \nBoth the Democrats and Republicans will be meeting. They will be held \nin the same location.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/03/senate-section/article/S384-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PROVISION FOR EMERGENCY AUTHORITY\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I was recollecting, as I came in, we had another majority \nleader from Tennessee, Howard Baker--the Democrat leader was Robert \nByrd; both distinguished friends and colleagues--and there had been an \nexplosive device put outside the Capitol one evening, something that \ncould not be done today because there are changes in our security. But \nthe majority leader recessed that evening--it was going to be a late-\nnight session. We adjourned a little earlier than we anticipated \nbecause we had worked out something and needed time for drafting and \nworked out a logjam we had, and there was an explosive device put out--\nand the distinguished Presiding Officer remembers this time very well \nbecause he was also serving here, as I was, at the time--blowing out \nboth the Republican and Democratic cloakrooms. There would have been \ngreat casualties had we been there. The next morning, as I recall, \nnearly 90 Senators were sitting in their seats. We came back in \nbasically to say: Nothing is going to close us down.\n  So I commend my dear friend from Tennessee and my dear friend from \nSouth Dakota for opening up this session. I think this is a symbol of \ndemocracy throughout the whole world. Certainly in our country, the \nmost obvious symbol of democracy is this Capitol Building. Every time \nwe stay open, as we have after 9/11 and everything else, it \ndemonstrates the leadership of our two leaders but also of the devotion \nto democracy we see in this Chamber.\n  That is all I am going to say. That is why I am here this morning. I \nwanted to compliment both of the leaders for opening up this session.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday I spoke to the Senate \nrelative to my assessment of the responsibility for the attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001, some of the lessons learned from those attacks, and \nthe status of the implementation of those lessons. I explained that my \nview was that those terrible events would have been prevented if our \nnational intelligence community had been better organized and more \nclearly focused on the problem of terrorism. And if the Congress and \nthe President had drawn on those lessons learned from the tragedy of 9/\n11 and initiated reforms of the intelligence community, we might well \nhave avoided some of the embarrassments of the flawed intelligence on \nweapons of mass destruction or the misleading use of that intelligence \nwhich formed the basis of the war against Iraq. Today I would like to \ncontinue my discussion of those lessons that we should have learned and \nimplemented.\n  As chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for most \nof the 107th Congress, I had the honor of cochairing a bipartisan, \nbicameral committee charged with investigating the events of the \nintelligence community and their activities before and after the \nattacks of September 11. We set out to determine whether or not there \nwas anything more we could have done to prevent the attacks and, \nspecifically, if our intelligence community had problems that needed to \nbe corrected.\n  The importance of our task was well understood. The 9/11 attacks were \nnot the work of a crazed individual but, rather, were the result of a \nsophisticated plot carried out by a group of 19 terrorists and an \nundetermined number of facilitators who prepared for the execution of \ntheir plot over a period of almost 2 years. We can, we must, improve \nour ability to detect and disrupt plots of this nature. We can do so by \nensuring that our intelligence-gathering networks are operating in an \noptimal manner and that any flaws in our intelligence community are \naddressed as quickly and effectively as possible.\n  Our committee identified a number of problems with our current \nintelligence-gathering system. We followed up with recommendations on \nhow to fix these problems. By conducting this inquiry, making these \nrecommendations, Congress not only assumed the responsibility for \ndetermining what happened before and after September 11 as related to \nour intelligence community, but it also assumed a responsibility \nrelative to the implementation of the recommendations.\n  The American people will respond to future terrorist attacks by \nasking: What did we learn from the previous attack and how has that \ninformation been used to give the American people greater protection? \nThey have the right to ask this question and we have an obligation to \ngive them a good answer: What have you done with the information and \nthe lessons learned? How have you implemented those lessons in a way to \ngive me and the American people a greater sense of security?\n\n  So far, we have not made acceptable progress toward providing an \nanswer to the American people. In fact, if we had to give it today, it \nwould not be an answer of which we would be proud.\n  A large number of the problems identified by the joint inquiry and a \nseries of commissions which preceded the joint inquiry have not been \naddressed. In my previous statement, I discussed those recommendations \nwhich related specifically to the issue of counterterrorism. This \nmorning, I would like to address those recommendations which deal with \nthe structure of the intelligence community.\n  Our national intelligence community is beset by a number of serious \nproblems. There is a lack of leadership at the top and the absence of a \ncoordinated national intelligence policy that gives us agencies with \npriorities, missions, and resources that do not necessarily complement \none another.\n  As an example, in December of 1998, the Director of Central \nIntelligence, the man who has the statutory responsibility for the \ncoordination of all of our various intelligence agencies, told senior \nmanagers of the CIA that he considered the United States to be at war \nwith al-Qaida and that the intelligence community, all of its agencies, \nworking in a coherent manner, should devote as many resources as \npossible to combating that terrorist organization.\n  While this statement might seem to be a positive step, a step in the \nright direction, our joint inquiry found that the DCI was either unable \nor unwilling to enlist other intelligence agencies in this effort. The \ntroops either didn't hear or simply ignored the bugle call of war.\n  The lack of consistent, coordinated priorities is paralleled by a \nlack of consistent, predictable funding as well as the lack of internal \naccountability. This shortage of resources meant that the intelligence \ncommunity simply did not have enough personnel to perform all the \nfunctions that were needed. This left the intelligence community ill-\nprepared to deal with the rapidly changing terrorist threat.\n  One of the reasons for the unpredictability and decline of funding of \nthe intelligence community was the mistaken belief that the end of the \ncold war yielded a peace dividend for the American people when it came \nto defense spending, including a reduced need to spend money on \nintelligence.\n  Mr. President, in fact, the change from the single focus on the \nSoviet Union and its allies to the current world of diverse, constantly \nchanging, emerging threats such as weapons of mass destruction and \ninternational terrorist groups has increased demand and, therefore, the \ncost of intelligence.\n  The first recommendation made by our commission urges the creation of \na Cabinet-level director of national intelligence, appointed by the \nPresident and subject to Senate confirmation. We made this our first \nrecommendation because we think it is the most important recommendation \nand one that can do the most to prevent another 9/11 tragedy. I \ngratefully recognize the excellent work of Senator Feinstein in \nchampioning this issue.\n  The director of national intelligence would be responsible for \nestablishing consistent priorities for all of our national intelligence \nagencies and assuring that these agencies work together, rather than \nindependently, by coordinating budgets and resources and managing \ninteragency relationships. We made this recommendation because of the \nobvious need for strong leadership in our intelligence community.\n  It is clear that prior to 9/11 our intelligence-gathering agencies \nhad no comprehensive strategy for counterterrorism. Intelligence \npriorities were inconsistently formulated and applied throughout the \nvarious agencies and were not effectively leveraged through interagency \ncoordination. The joint inquiry report offers specific details of FBI \nsupervisors who thought there was no need to pay attention to Saudi \ncitizens in the United States while at the same time the CIA was \ntracking suspected Saudi terrorists around the world.\n  The director of the national security agency, which is responsible \nfor our electronic eavesdropping, described the problem of unclear \npriorities when he said: ``We had about 5 number 1 priorities.''\n  Although the Director of Central Intelligence is normally the head of \nthe intelligence community, in practice he\n\n[[Page S386]]\n\nhas functioned as the head of one of those agencies, the CIA, with \nlimited influence over other organizations. The limited ability of the \nDirector of Central Intelligence to mobilize other intelligence \nagencies in the war against al-Qaida is a tragic example of this point. \nBefore 9/11, personnel in many intelligence agencies--particularly the \nFBI--had not even heard his statement on the topic, let alone acted \nupon it.\n  The DCI does have some budgetary authority, but it cannot be \nexercised effectively without the cooperation of the Department of \nDefense since many intelligence agencies are run through the Department \nof Defense. It is therefore necessary to appoint a strong director of \nnational intelligence who is not the head of any specific intelligence \nagency. This is a recommendation which has been consistently made by \ncitizens, commissions, and governmentally appointed commissions which \nhave reviewed the intelligence community in the recent past.\n  So far, Congress and the administration have not acted on this first \nrecommendation and indeed appear to be moving in the opposite \ndirection. The recent creation of an Under Secretary of Defense for \nIntelligence will serve to further separate the Defense Department from \nthe civilian intelligence agencies rather than improving cooperation. \nLegislation has been introduced to accomplish this \nnecessary restructuring, but as of this date it has not had a hearing \nbefore the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\n  This is an issue which now sits upon the shoulders of the Congress. \nIf we fail to act, we will be held accountable when the next \npreventable terrorist act occurs.\n  Another important recommendation was No. 11, which called for the \nrecruitment and development of greater numbers of quality intelligence \npersonnel. Obviously, the need for more counterterrorism training is a \nmajor part of this recommendation, as is the need for more linguists \nand an expanded intelligence community reserve corps that could provide \nrelevant expertise when special circumstances arise.\n  The committee also recommends an expansion of education grant \nprograms, such as the national security education program. Included \namong the suggestions for improving the workforce was one calling for \nlegislation that instills the concept of jointness or interoperability \namong the various agencies. This is similar to the 1986 Goldwater-\nNichols Act, which applied the concept of jointness to the military. \nOne way jointness has been instilled in the military is by having \nservice members serve tours of duty with another service or in a \nmultiservice command. This reform is widely recognized as having \nsubstantially improved our military's ability to fight and win wars, as \nwas so dramatically demonstrated in Iraq.\n  In the intelligence community, there is too much isolation among \nintelligence agencies and between those agencies and the users of \nintelligence. As an example, the intelligence community, having \nexamined the likely means of attack by al-Qaida, identified hijacking \nof commercial airliners to be used as weapons of mass destruction as a \nparticularly significant part of the arsenal of al-Qaida. However, the \nFederal Aviation Administration was not notified of this new form of \nthreat. Therefore, the training and protocols of flight crews had been \nto not attempt to resist hijackers but, rather, to succumb until the \nplane was on the ground and then let other law enforcement and \nprofessionals attempt to negotiate with the hijackers, and that was the \nform of action that was still in place on September 11.\n  Possibly, had the FAA been aware of this new threat of taking command \nof a plane not for economic or political purposes but to use it as a \nweapon, airlines would have been better prepared to deal with this \nparticular generation of hijackers. We need our intelligence community \nto substantially improve its capability in the same way that the \nmilitary has.\n  By working and training on a joint basis, intelligence agencies can \nconserve resources and help personnel gain an appreciation for a wider \nvariety of intelligence-gathering tactics and techniques. If this \nrecommendation had been implemented earlier, it could have reduced our \nvulnerability.\n  Our joint inquiry found that a shortage of staff was a near universal \nproblem for intelligence agencies before 9/11. For instance, at the \nCIA's counterterrorism center, employees were required to work \nextremely long hours with no relief. Overworking these critical \npersonnel made them less effective and lowered their morale to the \npoint where retention had become a problem. Problems similar to that of \nthe CIA's counterterrorism center existed at the FBI, the National \nSecurity Agency, and the shortage of Arabic linguists at the National \nSecurity Agency became especially pronounced. Linguists continue to be \nin short supply, in part because qualified linguists cannot be trained \novernight.\n  Counterterrorism training has been stepped up in other areas, but \nraising our capabilities to an adequate level will still require more \npersonnel with enhanced and expanded training.\n  The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 included \npilot programs for training students who will form the future of the \nintelligence community.\n  No legislation regarding jointness has yet been passed despite the \nclear, positive results achieved by previous efforts in similar and \nrelevant parts of the Federal Government.\n  The joint terrorism task forces set up by the FBI have had some \nsuccess in bringing together officials from different agencies. It was \none of these groups which was responsible for the capture of Zaccaria \nMoussaoui, the so-called 20th hijacker. If more of these task forces \nhad been set up before 2001, and if those that did exist had all the \npersonnel they needed to be effective, we can only imagine what might \nhave been accomplished, what might have been prevented.\n  Recommendation No. 12 regards our national intelligence budget and \nsuggests several measures to ensure our investments in intelligence \nprovide maximum benefits. It calls for more flexibility in the budget \nto be accompanied by greater oversight and raises the idea of a cost-\nbenefit analysis by an independent agency.\n  It also urges the President and the Congress to develop a budget that \nincludes a sustained, long-term investment in counterterrorism to \nreplace the unpredictable funding stream that currently exists. \nProviding the intelligence community with an adequate level of base \nfunding would obviously increase budget stability and assist in long-\nterm planning.\n  Contrary to that, for the past several years, counterterrorism \nprograms have been funded primarily through supplemental appropriations \nwhich were often in response to a specific event, such as the September \n11 tragedy, and therefore the supplemental appropriations varied \ngreatly from one year to the next.\n  Intelligence officials who were interviewed by our joint inquiry were \nunderstandably critical of this system since it makes it more difficult \nto plan sustainable counterterrorism programs. This dynamic still \npersists, despite its obvious flaws, despite its obvious contribution \nto the increased--the unnecessarily increased--vulnerability of the \nAmerican people.\n  There have been significant increases in our intelligence budget, but \nin 2003, a substantial portion of our counterterrorism budget still \ncame from supplemental appropriations.\n  Another problem with the intelligence budget is the way it is tied to \nthe Defense Department's budget. During the 1990s, we made significant \ncuts to the Defense Department budget, and the intelligence budget was \ncut proportionately.\n  While the end of the cold war meant we could reduce the size of our \nArmed Forces, intelligence requirements actually increased due to the \ndiversification of the threat. In addition, greater budget stability in \nour efforts to fight terrorism would be better served by greater budget \nflexibility. It is currently quite difficult for intelligence officials \nto shift resources from one priority to the other as circumstances \nrequire. Even small adjustments require prolonged formalized approvals.\n  For instance, a number of CIA officials were aware of the need for \nmore agents in Afghanistan prior to 2001 but were unable to reassign \nresources away from other priorities. The Director of the National \nSecurity Agency has discussed similar problems. The 2004 Intelligence \nAuthorization Act permits the\n\n[[Page S387]]\n\nDirector of Central Intelligence to authorize the employment of \nadditional civilian personnel if he believes this is necessary.\n\n  This is a small step in the right direction, but more flexibility is \nstill needed. This flexibility must be accompanied by increased \ncongressional oversight.\n  It became apparent during the course of our joint inquiry that the \nintelligence community does not have a clear idea of how much money it \nspends on counterterrorism, and accounting methods vary among the \ndifferent agencies.\n  In light of this, it seems appropriate that a cost-benefit analysis \nfrom an outside agency would be very helpful, but so far no real \nefforts have been made to undertake such a step.\n  Recommendation No. 15 suggests that the President and the Congress \nevaluate and consider revising the intelligence classification process. \nThis task would pursue the twin goals of expanding access to important \ninformation and assuring that classified intelligence information is \nnot disclosed inappropriately.\n  The current system of intelligence classification is not the result \nof a thoughtful, open debate, but is, rather, the product of a series \nof Executive orders rooted in cold war mentality and issued with little \nor no consultation of Congress.\n  Many people with extensive knowledge of the system have suggested \nthere is a tendency toward too much secrecy and that this has had a \npredictably negative effect on the flow of information.\n  There was an interesting column recently in the New York Times \ntalking about one of the core problems within the Government of Saddam \nHussein prior to the war, and that was that all parts of that society \npracticed secrecy and deception; that the army deceived Saddam Hussein \nas to just what it was doing to prepare for war; scientists deceived \nSaddam Hussein as to the state of their development of weapons of mass \ndestruction; Saddam Hussein attempted to fool the people of Iraq, and \nour intelligence agencies were fooled by all of the above.\n  Allowing an increase in a curtain of secrecy to fall over the \ninformation of our United States agencies will have the same effect the \nveil of secrecy did in Iraq, and that is to make us less secure, more \nvulnerable because we have not shared information in a way that can \nincrease our security.\n  By treating so much of this information as treasure to be guarded, \nintelligence agencies can actually reduce the information's usefulness. \nBy reducing biases toward excessive secrecy, Congress and the President \ncan help make sure more information gets to the people who need it, \nparticularly those such as first responders, local government, law \nenforcement officials, and Federal agencies, such as the Federal \nAviation Agency.\n  There is a suspicion among many Americans--and I believe it is \njustified--that classification is being used to shield politically \nembarrassing information from public scrutiny, as was the case with the \ninformation on the role of foreign governments in the September 11 \nattack.\n  Unfortunately, little progress has been made so far in the task of \nreviewing the use of classified information, particularly in the area \nof intelligence. The Intelligence Authorization Act requires the \nPresident to report on the barriers to sharing classified information. \nCongress has not yet given serious consideration to this important \ntopic.\n  Another very important recommendation issued by the joint committee, \nwhich has also been largely ignored, is recommendation No. 16, which \ncalls for a new standard of accountability in the intelligence \ncommunity. Given the continued and increasing use of intelligence \ninformation in our national policymaking, whether it is to fight \nterrorism, to determine the true capability of a potential adversary, \nor to reduce the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, it is \ncritically important that we have accountability mechanisms in place \nthat review intelligence agencies' failures in order to learn from \nthose mistakes. To date, no personnel in intelligence or other affected \nagencies has been sanctioned as a result of the tragedy of September \n11.\n  It is also true that no one has been sanctioned for the apparently \nincorrect intelligence assessments upon which the case to go to war in \nIraq was predicated. Weapons of mass destruction alleged to exist in \nIraq have not been found and, according to David Kay, our lead \ninvestigator, it is unlikely they will ever be found. This raises in \nstark terms the responsibility of the President to determine who is \naccountable for intelligence failures and what should be the \nappropriate sanction of those responsible.\n  It is as though the chairman of the steamship company that owned the \nTitanic put all of the blame for the tragedy on the iceberg and \ndeclared that was the end of it; the captain of the ship would be let \noff scot-free.\n  At the same time, it is unclear if any rewards or recognitions have \nbeen given for outstanding performance in the intelligence community, \noutstanding performance such as that of those who contributed to the \ncapture of Saddam Hussein.\n  If we want our intelligence agencies to be as good as they can be and \nthey must and should be, then we must assure that they have systems in \nplace to reward exceptional performance and to deal with bad \nperformance appropriately. Currently, there are no systems performing \nthis function and all attempts to bring accountability to our \nintelligence-gathering programs have been made in an ad hoc manner. We \nmust demand that the intelligence community establish standards of \naccountability since reliable intelligence is critical to our security \nas citizens and our credibility as a nation.\n  The last recommendation I would like to address today is No. 17. This \ncalls for the removal of inappropriate and obsolete barriers between \nintelligence and law enforcement agencies engaged in counterterrorism. \nIt advises the administration to report to Congress regarding the \nremoval of these barriers so that Congress can take whatever \nlegislative actions are appropriate.\n  Our joint inquiry found that the various agencies engaged in \ncounterterrorism have been surprisingly reluctant to share information \nwith each other. Example: In the months before the September 11 attack, \nthe CIA was aware of two terrorists associated with al-Qaida, Khalid \nal-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi. These two terrorists had attended a \nplanning session in Malaysia, a session at which both the attack on the \nUSS Cole, which was to occur in November of 2000, and the attack on the \nWorld Trade Center, the Pentagon, and the failed effort that ended in a \nfield in Pennsylvania had been discussed.\n  Both of these terrorists attended a planning conference for purposes \nof proceeding with those two terrorist attacks, and then acquired visas \nfor travel to the United States, because the CIA had not informed law \nenforcement or border protection agencies of the threat posed by these \nindividuals. The FBI and other agencies did not seem to have received \nthis information which could have helped disrupt the 9/11 attack.\n  Similarly, the FBI prevented its agents from participating in an \neffort to track down these terrorists on the grounds that this was not \na job for criminal investigators. The FBI was reluctant to share \ninformation regarding counterterrorism because of concerns about legal \nbarriers preventing collaboration between intelligence and law \nenforcement agencies. These concerns sprang partly from an overly \nrestrictive Department of Justice policy and partly \nfrom misunderstanding among agents regarding the law. Sharing of \nintelligence information with law enforcement agencies was seen as \nparticularly difficult, almost taboo. This was a clear contradiction of \nthe law that existed prior to September 11.\n\n  Legal considerations also seem to have impaired information sharing \nby the National Security Agency and the CIA as well. However, these \nagencies, particularly the CIA, were also motivated by an overly \nzealous desire to protect sources. While protecting sources and methods \nis certainly an important goal, these sources and methods are not very \nuseful if we cannot effectively use the information they provide to us.\n  From a legislative point of view, significant progress has been made \nin this area. Congress has passed legislation removing legal \nrestrictions regarding\n\n[[Page S388]]\n\nthe sharing of intelligence information. Agency heads have updated \nobsolete and inappropriate guidelines. Intelligence community personnel \nnow seem to have a much clearer picture of what methods and actions are \navailable to them.\n  Unfortunately, while the legislative barriers to information sharing \nhave been removed, the fact is that effective information sharing is \nstill not taking place between intelligence and law enforcement, and \nthis is a special problem between Federal intelligence and law \nenforcement agencies and State and local law enforcement.\n  I frequently hear complaints that agency culture, habit, and inertia, \nhave preserved problems that should have been solved, making this yet \nanother area in which the lessons of 9/11 have not been learned and not \nbeen applied effectively.\n  September 11 was a wake-up call. It alerted us to the fact that our \nintelligence agencies were not performing at the level required during \nthis era of terrorism. We have just received our first report card. The \nreport card is to tell us how well we have done since September 11 in \napplying lessons learned to the greater protection of the American \npeople. We have received a grade of F. The false assertion of large \nstockpiles of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq demonstrates that we \nhave not yet made the reforms to our intelligence agencies that are \nrequired.\n  The next report card will come when we have the next intelligence \nfailure. The President and the Congress will both be held accountable \nif we have not acted on these necessary reforms to protect the safety \nof the people of America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida for his extraordinarily enlightening and very helpful \ndiscussion in this series of speeches he is giving this week. I think \nwe would all do well not only to listen but to read and to thoughtfully \nconsider much of what he has shared with us. He speaks with experience \nand extraordinary credibility, and I applaud him for taking the time \nand making the effort that he has to bring this important issue before \nus in a meaningful way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/03/senate-section/article/S388-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S388-S389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IRAQ INTELLIGENCE COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the vital interest of our national \nsecurity is critical to our understanding of the degree to which we can \ncope with the circumstances involving the intelligence failure we have \nnow experienced over this past year or more. Two important voices have \nbeen added to the growing chorus, raising questions about the accuracy \nand the veracity of the allegations the administration used to take \nthis country to war. Just yesterday Secretary Powell made clear the \nimportance of the prewar claims, suggesting that the case for war was \nmuch weaker without the allegations of existing stockpiles of weapons. \nWhen asked whether he would have recommended an invasion last year if \nhe knew then what he knows now, Secretary Powell said:\n\n       I don't know, because it was the stockpile that presented \n     the final little piece that made it more of a real and \n     present danger and threat to the region and to the world.\n\n  A year ago this week, Secretary Powell made a lengthy presentation to \nthe United Nations Security Council about the grave threat posed by \nIraq's weapons of mass destruction. The Secretary of State did not \nspeak of ``weapons of mass destruction-related program activities,'' \nbut of existing stockpiles--existing stockpiles of horrendous weapons \nand the means to deliver them. In large measure because of the alarming \nassertions by Secretary Powell and similar claims by President Bush, \nVice President Cheney, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, National Security \nAdviser Rice, and many other senior administration officials, a \nmajority of Congress voted to give the President the authority to send \ntroops to wage war against Iraq.\n  Late last month, Secretary Powell had something decidedly different \nto say. For the first time since his U.N. presentation he explicitly \nacknowledged the strong possibility his claims about Iraq's weapons \nwere untrue, telling reporters on his trip to Georgia:\n\n       . . . what the open question is: how many stocks [the \n     Iraqis] had, if any? And if they had any, where did they go? \n     And if they didn't have any, then why wasn't that known \n     beforehand?\n\n  A few days later, Dr. David Kay, Chief Weapons Inspector in Iraq \nuntil a couple of weeks ago, told the Armed Services Committee here in \nthe Senate the administration's prewar intelligence on Iraq was, in his \nwords, ``all wrong.'' While several nonpartisan experts have reached \nsimilar conclusions about our intelligence and raised concerns about \nthe accuracy of the administration statements on this issue, hearing \nSecretary Powell and Dr. Kay, two of this Nation's most respected and \nknowledgeable officials, speak in this manner, has raised some \nquestions at home and abroad about the foundation of the \nadministration's case for going to war against Iraq.\n  Given the significance of these questions, a broad, thorough, \nnonpartisan review of both the intelligence community's assessment of \nthe threats posed by Iraq and the administration's use of this \ninformation is essential to restoring the trust of the American public \nand the international community in this administration and in the \nintelligence system itself.\n  The reason is clear. The most effective means to counterterrorism and \nthe many other national security challenges facing this Nation today is \nby gaining and maintaining the support of the American people and \nassembling a international coalition. Accurate, unimpeachable \nintelligence is one of the most crucial tools the President has at his \ndisposal for rallying the American people and the world. If the \nPresident is to successfully convince Americans of the need to send \ndaughters and sons into harm's way and urge our allies to support \nAmerica's course of action, our intelligence must be seen as absolutely \ncredible and accurate. National security experts of both parties \nhave begun to warn that the lack of any weapons of mass destruction in \nIraq after the administration's grave predictions in the runup to the \nwar is undermining America's credibility, not only on Iraq but on other \nnational security challenges as well.\n\n  For example, the United States increasingly believes that North Korea \nhas used the last couple of years to create additional nuclear material \nand weapons. However, officials in South Korea and China have raised \nquestions about these conclusions, in part by pointing to our \nintelligence community's failures in Iraq. This failure to reach a \nconsensus on the threat posed by North Korea has greatly complicated \nefforts to effectively confront a nation that already possesses nuclear \nweapons and has been characterized as the world's greatest weapons \nproliferator.\n  Given these stakes, one would think the President would be the first \nto demand a full and complete accounting of the accuracy and use of \nIraq prewar intelligence. Yet up until this past weekend, the President \nhas stubbornly insisted there was nothing wrong with that intelligence \nor the alarming assertions that he and senior administration officials \nmade in the days leading up to the start of the war in Iraq. In a \nremarkable about-face this past week, administration officials said \npublicly that the President will support the establishment of an \nindependent commission, provided he appoints the commissioners and \ndefines the scope of their work. As in other instances, the \nadministration is apparently seeking to both convince the America \npublic it supports a thorough investigation at the same time it stacks \nthe deck against such an investigation effort ever occurring.\n  Although one of the major questions that needs to be addressed is \nwhether senior administration officials exaggerated the nature of the \nthreat to Iraq, the President is attempting to make the case that \nactions by these officials are best investigated by a commission whose \nmembers are appointed by and report to those very officials in the \nWhite House.\n  There is little reason to believe a commission appointed and \ncontrolled by the White House will have the independence and \ncredibility necessary to investigate and bring closure to these crucial \nissues. Consider this: At the same time the Secretary of State was \nsuggesting that it was an open question whether Iraq had any weapons of \nmass destruction and the chief weapons\n\n[[Page S389]]\n\ninspector in Iraq was concluding that Iraq did not have any stockpiles \nof weapons before the war, Vice President Cheney was on national radio \nstill suggesting that it was just a matter of time until such weapons \ncould be found.\n  If the President's senior advisers are still arguing that the prewar \nintelligence was right, can the American people be certain that \ncommissioners handpicked by the White House to undertake an \ninvestigation defined by the White House will follow the facts wherever \nthey lead?\n  It would be a shame to have such an important commission start its \nwork under the shadow of such doubt. We can avoid ever having to ask \nthose questions by forming a truly independent commission that can rise \nabove those concerns. I strongly believe the Congress can and should \nestablish a truly independent commission to examine the collection, \nanalysis, dissemination, and use by policymakers of intelligence on \nIraq. Twice the Senate has voted to establish just such a commission \nthat would be given access to all relevant information, appointed on a \nbipartisan basis by the congressional leadership of the House and \nSenate. I voted for this proposal both times.\n\n  Although supporters of this commission fell short both times, I \ncontinue to believe that after putting our troops in harm's way we owe \nit to them to get to the bottom of this question. We owe them a truly \nindependent investigation, conducted in the same way that our Armed \nForces carry out their duties every day in Iraq, with honor and with \nintegrity. I fear the process being started by the administration is \nneither, but it is not too late to establish a commission of which we \ncan all be proud.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator be good enough to yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. First, I thank the Senator for an excellent statement.\n  Earlier today the Armed Services Committee had meant to meet. We were \ngoing to have Secretary Rumsfeld up before the committee. I intended to \nask him two or three questions on the issue of intelligence, but since \nthe Senator is on his feet now, I am wondering if he would be willing \nto respond to a question or two and help clear this up in my mind.\n  What we have now, as I understand it, is the intelligence agencies \nsaying that they provided the intelligence to the administration and \nthat they were not intimidated. I intended to ask the Secretary whether \nhe was aware of the Defense Intelligence Agency's own intelligence \nreport that stated--and I am quoting. This has been published. It was \ndeclassified and published in the news sources--this is the Defense \nIntelligence Agency:\n\n       . . . there is no reliable information on whether Iraq is \n     producing and stockpiling chemical weapons, or where Iraq \n     has--or will--establish its chemical warfare agent production \n     facilities.\n\n  That was in September of 2002. Yet a month later, just as Congress \nwas about to vote, the National Intelligence Estimate stated very \nprecisely that:\n\n       Iraq probably has stocked at least 100 metric tons and \n     possibly as much as 500 metric tons of chemical weapon \n     agents--much of it added in the last year.\n\n  I was just wondering, if I can raise this point, here we have the \nDefense Intense Intelligence Agency giving one report. Then, if we look \nat the State Department Bureau of Intelligence, this is what the State \nDepartment Bureau of Intelligence concluded:\n\n       The activities we have detected do not . . . add up to a \n     compelling case that Iraq is currently pursuing what INR \n     would consider an integrated and comprehensive approach to \n     get nuclear weapons . . . INR considers the available \n     evidence inadequate to support such a judgment.\n\n  The Department of State, Bureau of Intelligence.\n  Mr. KYL. Could we have regular order?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Regular order. I believe I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may yield for a question but not \nfor a statement.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am making the predicate. If the Senator from Arizona \nis not pleased with it, that is his problem.\n  The third intelligence report was the Department of Energy disagreed \nthat the famous tubes were for nuclear weapons. The State Department's \nIntelligence Bureau also concluded that the tubes were ``not intended \nfor use in Iraq's nuclear weapons program.''\n  Finally, Greg Thielmann, retired State Department official, who \nserved as director of the Office of Strategic Proliferation and \nMilitary Affairs in the Bureau of Intelligence, said last July:\n\n       Some of the fault lies with the performance of the \n     intelligence community, but most of it lies with the way \n     senior officials misused the information they are provided.\n\n  He said:\n\n       They surveyed the data, and picked out what they liked. The \n     whole thing was bizarre. The Secretary of Defense had this \n     huge Defense Intelligence Agency, and he went around it.\n\n  I just ask, are these the kinds of questions that we hope an \nindependent kind of commission might be helpful to resolve? When the \nadministration's own Defense Intelligence Agency, the State Department \nagency, and the Energy Intelligence Agency came up with similar \nconclusions as Dr. Kay prior to the time the Senate voted on this \nissue, don't you think the American people are entitled to know what \nthe facts are, not just the intelligence information made available but \nhow it was used by the administration and by the President?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the question, as well as the \npredicate offered by the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The answer is yes, I am troubled by one fact that is now undeniable. \nThat fact is, we were given bad information, information that now is \nmuch clearer than it was 6 months or 12 months ago, information that \nmany of our colleagues have used repeatedly on which to base decisions \nfundamental to their interpretation of circumstances and ultimately the \nvote they cast on the resolution committing this country to a course of \naction.\n  I was troubled by a report I read just this morning that there are \nmany in the intelligence community who are becoming increasingly \nangered and frustrated that all of this responsibility has been put on \ntheir shoulders. The report by one intelligence officer was: ``We did \nour job. We reported the information. It isn't us.''\n  My question is, If it is not the intelligence community, who is \nresponsible? Why did we get bad information? Was it the collection and \nanalysis or was it the use of that information once it was collected \nand analyzed? We do not know the answer to that today. But we do know \nour best opportunity for collecting the answers to the questions posed \nby the Senator from Massachusetts is an independent counsel.\n\n  What does it say of the independence of those potential commissioners \nwhen someone is suggesting to them, we want you to take this job to \ninvestigate us; we want you to have the authority to investigate us, \nwith the implication that the detrimental consequences of an adverse \ninvestigation could weigh heavily on the commission itself.\n  I don't think there is any doubt about the need for independence, \nabout the need to look at past precedent when we have established \ncommissions of this kind. We need to know beyond a shadow of a doubt \nthat this commission will have the opportunity to go wherever the facts \nlead them.\n  The way the President and this administration are proposing this \ninvestigation be done flies in the face of past precedent, with that \ncloud that hangs over any investigation that could not be as open, \nhonest, and ultimately successful as it needs to be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding that under the previous unanimous \nconsent I am recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/03/senate-section/article/S389-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S389-S391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           U.S. INTELLIGENCE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the minority leader, Senator \nDaschle, as well as my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, \nfor raising this timely and important question about intelligence. I \nalso salute Senator Bob Graham of Florida, who announced his \nretirement. His departure will be a great loss to this institution.\n\n[[Page S390]]\n\n  I was fortunate enough to serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee \nwhich Senator Graham chaired, and I still continue that service. He was \nan extraordinary leader, not just on that committee but when it came to \nthe policies of protecting America. His has been a clarion voice from \nthe beginning that the war on terrorism continues unabated and should \ncontinue despite the diversion of Iraq. We still have a war on \nterrorism, much broader in scope, that has to be considered on a daily \nbasis.\n  I come to the floor and want to be careful of the words I say. I do \nnot want to disclose anything I have been told in the Senate \nIntelligence Committee. That is certainly the policy which should be \nfollowed by every member of that committee. We are given a rare \nopportunity to see the intelligence community and its work from inside. \nBecause we are given that opportunity, we are warned not to share that \ninformation. So the points I am about to make relate exclusively to \nthat information which has been made public and declassified. It raises \nan important issue.\n  All of this information points in one direction. What happened to the \nUnited States of America prior to the invasion of Iraq relative to \nweapons of mass destruction of that country represents, in my mind, the \ngreatest failure of intelligence in America since the fall of the \nSoviet Union. Recall, not that long ago, when our intelligence \ncommunity and those in charge of national defense and security failed \nto see the collapse of the Soviet Union, a superpower, our premier \nenemy for decades, until it actually happened. Despite all of the \nmillions of dollars and thousands of people, we missed it.\n  Here we have a similar situation. Prior to our invasion of Iraq, we \nwere told by the intelligence community they had identified--and this \nis unclassified, declassified information--they had identified 550 \nsuspected sites within Iraq where we would find weapons of mass \ndestruction. And the level of certainty for each of those sites was \ndifferent, but for a discrete number of those sites the intelligence \ncommunity told us: We believe that when we go into Iraq and go directly \nto this location, we will find weapons of mass destruction, nuclear \nweapons, chemical and biological weapons.\n  So I asked Dr. Kay--and others have as well--after you had completed \nyour investigation, after you had looked at those sites, what did you \nfind? And the answer was: Nothing, nothing whatever.\n  We accumulated this information; we said, through our intelligence \nsources, we have 550 known locations; and we were wrong in every \ninstance.\n  How can that be? How can the intelligence community have missed it?\n  The second element, the unmanned aerial vehicles, flying over \nlocations, mapping different things, viewing different locations, \nprepared, if necessary, to fire on hostile situations--these unmanned \naerial vehicles were identified by the intelligence community and the \nadministration as a threat not only to the Middle East but to the \nUnited States of America. We were told these unmanned aerial vehicles \nwould be used to deliver chemical and biological weapons against the \nUnited States of America.\n  I can state now in published reports we know that the UAVs were not \ndesigned for this purpose. We missed it completely. Sadly, I can say \nthere is additional information which has not been disclosed which also \ncasts doubt on that conclusion.\n  Why is it important? Because Members of the Senate were called to the \nWhite House, asked to vote for the use-of-force resolution, and told \nthat the reason for the necessity of an invasion was the unmanned \naerial vehicles and their threat to the United States of America. They \nwere given partial information--in fact, misleading information--about \nthe danger associated with the unmanned aerial vehicles.\n  All of this raises serious questions, questions Senator Daschle and \nothers have addressed. This is what it comes down to: This should not \nbe a matter of either the Democrats in the Senate or the Republicans in \nthe Senate protecting their President. I will say this: If an open, \nhonest, independent investigation finds anything was done wrong under \nthe Clinton administration leading up to this intelligence failure, so \nbe it. If they find anything wrong in this intelligence operation under \nPresident George W. Bush was responsible for this breakdown, so be it.\n  The American people deserve an honest answer. They are more concerned \nabout the safety and security of America than they are about the \npolitical safety and security of any President. And that is exactly the \nway it should be.\n  Now, more than ever, intelligence is critical. Since 9/11 we \nunderstand the war on terrorism and its success by the United States \ndepends on solid intelligence, acted on responsibly by political \nleaders. We need to ask these hard questions, and we need the panel of \nan independent commission that will come up with the answers.\n  Senator Jon Corzine, my colleague from New Jersey, has been proposing \nthis independent commission for months. I have supported it. Many have \nresisted it, saying we do not need it. Well, thank goodness, after Dr. \nKay's report, even the White House has conceded we need this \nindependent commission. I think, frankly, we need it now more than \never.\n  We need sound and solid intelligence gathering. We need it to be \nevaluated in a proper fashion, and we need the political leaders in \nAmerica to deal with it in a responsible way. We must ask the hard \nquestions, whether this has been done leading up to the invasion of \nIraq, and continuing with our war against al-Qaida and terrorism \nelements all across the United States of America and around the world.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator very much for his clear, as usual, \nlaying out of this issue. I want to pick up on the word \n``independent,'' ``independent commission.''\n  Does my friend agree that to get to an independent commission, all \nthe members should not be appointed by the administration that has just \nbeen part of this error?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from California, it is important \nthat this be viewed as a nonpartisan effort. In order for that to \noccur, we either need to find those people who are beyond reproach from \nthe political side or make certain there is an appointment on both \nsides, Democrats and Republicans working together.\n  Why in the world would we allow this commission to go forward under \nthe shadow of suspicion that it has a partisan agenda? We do not need \nthat. As a country, we do not need that. Once and for all, we need to \nturn to men and women who have served this country, and served it in \nterms of our national defense, and who have no political agenda, who \nare really focused on the defense of our country.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would agree with that because otherwise I do not think \nthe American people will trust the commission. If the commission were \nto be appointed by, say, the majority leader of the Senate--certain \nMembers--and then the Democratic leader of the Senate, that is another \nexample. We could get a couple from the House Democrats, House \nRepublicans, and then the President, and not an artificial date: By the \nway, you can't come back and talk to us until 2005 after the election. \nThe American people are very wise.\n\n  So I am really glad the President, as you said, has come around to \nsay we need to take a look at this. But I think the way he is \napproaching this does not pass the smell test for a lot of my folks \nback home.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from California, there is another \nelement, and that is this matter involving former Ambassador Joe \nWilson, and his wife, who was serving this country in an intelligence \ncapacity and whose identity was disclosed to columnist Robert Novak as \npart of political retribution.\n  I can tell you, having spoken to people who have given their lives to \nthe intelligence community, and risked their lives for America on a \nregular basis, they were angry and demoralized by this leak from the \nWhite House.\n  I think in order to get the proper answers to the important questions \nabout the role of the intelligence community, we should try to make it \nas nonpartisan as possible, try to bring in the professionals who are \nviewed by both political parties as people of respect and people who \nask the right questions, so the intelligence community will come \nforward with honest and objective answers.\n\n[[Page S391]]\n\n  The bottom line is not who wins this political battle in the hearts \nand minds of the American people. The bottom line is, who will win in \nterms of America's national security and defense. We need sound and \nsolid intelligence now more than ever. The President's admission last \nweek that there was a failure of intelligence leading up to the \ninvasion of Iraq has really called on all of us to rise above party.\n  I think the Senator from California and the Senator from South Dakota \nare moving in the right direction toward an independent, bipartisan, \nand nonpartisan approach. I hope we do get this done quickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, there are 10 minutes allocated to the \nmajority.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the majority be \ngiven an extra 5 minutes in morning business; 5 minutes for Senator \nKyl, 5 minutes for Senator Lott, 5 minutes for Senator Chambliss.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the assistant \nminority leader for that request.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/03/senate-section/article/S391-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S391-S393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think we need to respond to some of what \nhas been said here this morning because the implication is very \ndisturbing. It is not just that some of the intelligence of the United \nStates--and by the way, all of the other intelligence agencies around \nthe world might not have been totally accurate--but that somebody might \nhave been misleading us. That is the charge. That is the implication. \nIt leads to this notion we could not trust the President to look into \nwhat might have been wrong with the intelligence, that there is a \n``shadow of suspicion'' here.\n  Well, the shadow of suspicion is being cast by our colleagues on the \nother side by the innuendo that is throughout the comments they have \nbeen making here this morning and that we have read elsewhere. I think \nthat is a very bad thing. Especially when our troops are fighting \nabroad trying to win this war on terror, to suggest that not only is \nthe intelligence we are gathering not entirely accurate but that there \nwere deliberate attempts by people in the administration to mislead the \nAmerican people, and to mislead the Congress, that, I think, is what is \nvery disturbing.\n\n  What are some of the strains of that? I heard one of them on the \nradio this morning: Well, Vice President Cheney went down to the CIA \nand talked to them. He must have been trying to intimidate them to come \nup with some preordained conclusion to sort of cook the books a little \nbit.\n  There is no evidence of that whatsoever. David Kay has discounted \nthat as a possibility. Nobody from the intelligence agencies, under \nquestioning, has suggested that was the case.\n  Indeed, the question is, if the Vice President had not gone down to \nthe intelligence agencies and asked the tough questions of the CIA \npeople, and said, are you sure you are correct about this, then our \nfriends on the other side would be complaining the administration did \nnot even bother to doublecheck the information. So when politics are \ninvolved, you cannot win. But I do not think we should allow these \nsuspicions from the political side of things to dictate the kind of \naction we take.\n  Another question: Secretary Powell went to the CIA. I think he spent \nsomething like 3 days with them, with these people going over and over \nand over the evidence, saying: Are you absolutely certain of this? And \nremember, before he made his presentation to the United Nations, he \ntook some of the material out, some of the material he did not think \nwas verifiable, that they could not nail down well enough. He wanted to \nmake sure what he took to the United Nations was solid.\n  The Vice President and the Secretary of State are not the only people \nwho have been involved. We have intelligence from other countries, such \nas the Israelis, the British. We have the United Nations itself, and \nthe inspectors who came back with their reports.\n  At the end of the day, the reason why the international community \npassed resolutions asking for Saddam Hussein to comply with his \ncommitment to come clean on what he had was because the whole world \nthought he had these weapons of mass destruction.\n  Now, since then, we have not been able to find everything. We have \nfound some things. But one of the things we have not found are the \nchemical artillery shell warheads. We thought those were going to be \nused against our troops. Every day the war occurred, we were briefed on \nthe so-called red line, the point at which we thought the Iraqis were \ngoing to shoot artillery shells with chemical weapons at our troops. \nOur troops had to put on all the heavy equipment in order to try to \nfight through that if, in fact, the attack occurred, and there was some \nsurprise when it did not occur. We had to, of course, bomb the \nwarehouses we thought it was in. We bombed the artillery pieces. We \nsent millions of leaflets to the commanders saying: Don't you dare fire \nchemical weapons at our troops or we will take you before the criminal \ncourt when this is all done. We disrupted their command and control, \nand we thought that is what prevented them from firing those artillery \nshells. But the point is, we thought they had them. We thought they \nwere going to be used against our troops.\n  This was not a matter of the President or the Vice President or \nanybody in the administration trying to mislead anybody. Maybe the \nintelligence was not entirely accurate, but I urge my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle, in conducting this debate, to try to do it \nfrom the higher plain, not from the suspicion that the President of the \nUnited States is trying to deliberately mislead the American people, \nbut to acknowledge maybe there was something wrong with part of our \nintelligence and that is worth looking into.\n  That is precisely what the President has said he wants to have done \nbecause obviously he is just as concerned about this as anybody else \nis. It is for that reason he has asked for an investigation into the \nintelligence to find out whether it was correct, if it wasn't, why not, \nand what can we do about that in the future.\n  I urge my colleagues, in conducting this debate, let's do so from a \nhigher plain than one in which we sow the seeds of politics and blame \nand suspicion, as has been done around here. We can conduct this debate \non a much higher plain than that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe I have 5 minutes under the \nunanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank Senator Kyl and Senator Reid for making sure we \nhave this time. I, too, think we need to sober up a little bit and look \nat the facts of what is involved.\n  First, it is an election year. Politics will come into play in \neverything we do. I don't mean that necessarily critically of us or \neither side. It is a fact. I suspect that it is having a hand in what \nwe are seeing now.\n  Secondly, the fact is, we do have some problems with our intelligence \ncommunity. It is not new. It didn't come up over the last 10 months or \nthe last 10 years. It probably goes back to the mid-1970s when we had \nthe Pike and the Church commissions that forced changes in the \nintelligence community from which we have never quite recovered. That \nis when we started getting away from human intelligence and relying on \nsatellites and computers and technology. That is a big problem.\n  We can go back and point to things we didn't know or information we \nshould have had back in the 1980s and 1990s that we didn't have. For us \nto take a look at our intelligence community and ask questions about \nwhy they have not done some things or they have gotten some things \nwrong is perfectly legitimate. The most important question should be, \nwhat are we going to do about it? Instead of pointing the finger of \nblame, trying to put some scalp on the wall and say: We nailed somebody \nbecause this information may not have been completely accurate, we \nshould ask: What did we know? Did we need to know more? Were there \ninaccuracies? If so, what were they, and what are we going to do about \nit? Do we need to completely reconstruct our intelligence community?\n\n[[Page S392]]\n\nDo we need to make some changes at the head of some of these agencies? \nI don't know yet. But that should be our approach because we are going \nto need our intelligence community. We need it this very day.\n  Senator Kyl was making the point. Our troops are in the field today \nall over the world, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan. They are \nworking with the intelligence community today to try to make sure they \nknow what is going on and what is happening, what the threats are. We \ndon't want to undermine them. At the same time, if we are going to make \nimprovements or changes, the sooner we can do it, the better.\n  The other thing is, what did we know. It is almost as if there were \nno weapons of mass destruction. We knew they had weapons of mass \ndestruction--chemical, biological. They tried to get nuclear \ncapability. We know they killed their own people. They used chemical \nweapons on the Iranians. I was talking to a constituent this morning \nwho was in Bazra back in the early 1990s, who talked about how simple \nit was to produce chlorine gas. Yet if you looked at the plant, you \ncould be told, this is just a plastics plant. But it is very simple to \nmake chlorine gas. It is very toxic, and that was what was used, I \nbelieve, against the Iranians. So we know they had these weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  Did they dismantle them, destroy them? Where did they destroy them? \nWhy did Saddam Hussein give out bad information? Was he being lied to? \nYes. Was he lying to the world community? Yes. There are all kinds of \nproblems or questions such as that.\n  Did they move these weapons to Syria, Iran? We know they had them. \nThat is a fact. We still don't know exactly what happened to them, and \nthat is a danger.\n  What are we going to do about it? Let's become a government of \ncommissions. It is really easy. Pass it off to a commission--the base-\nclosure procedure, the 9/11 investigation, Social Security, \nintelligence. Let the Congress just say: We know nothing; we see \nnothing; we hear nothing. Let's let somebody else do it.\n  By the way, I have watched these commissions. Just because you have \nRepublicans and Democrats, are you going to call them independent? How \nabout an independent commission set up by the President that might have \npeople who weren't clearly Republican or Democrat? How about experts on \nintelligence, people who have been at the CIA and the FBI, people who \nare not identified in the political area? If you want a real \nindependent commission, that might be the way to do it.\n  I have another question: Why don't we do our own work? What do we \nhave the intelligence committee for? The more I am on there, the more I \nthink maybe we should not have it the way it is presently constituted. \nWe are not going to wait for the Senate Intelligence Committee to put \nout its report. We are not going to wait on the House, bipartisan, \nSelect Intelligence Committee to put out its report. No, we are going \nto rush pellmell and create a commission before we even see the report.\n  I suspect the report from the Senate Intelligence Committee is going \nto be more aggressive than a lot of people might think. I think we are \ngoing to ask a lot of legitimate questions. How about letting the Iraqi \nsurvey team, the group that is out there still looking, do their work. \nBut, no, it is a political year. We are going to use this to question \nall kinds of people.\n  The President got information on which he relied. The Senate got \ninformation it relied on. If there was inaccurate information, we ought \nto find out why and determine what we are going to do about it. We need \nto back off a little bit because we are dealing with people's lives. \nHow we act in the intelligence area is going to be very important in \nthe next few months.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from \nMississippi for including me in this time because this is the most \ncritical issue, obviously, facing not just the administration but the \nAmerican public today. It is an issue which has already been adequately \naddressed, but it is not a new issue.\n  The fact of failures within the intelligence community is not \nsomething newly discovered. We knew following 9/11 that there were \ndeficiencies within our intelligence community that probably allowed \nSeptember 11 to happen. What have we done since that time?\n  As the Senator from Mississippi said: It was time to step up to the \nplate after 9/11, fix the problems. That is what we did in a bipartisan \nway, and we have done that since that point in time.\n  Now we are moving into an election year, and we are seeing sniping \nfor political reasons and not solving problems for the right reasons. \nThe problem continues to be out there, the problem of deficiencies \nwithin the intelligence community. It is not new. It is the same \nproblem. It is a little bit different area.\n  We, as Members of this body and as Members of the House of \nRepresentatives, have an obligation to the American people to find out \nwhat went wrong. But let's not politicize it. Let's figure out what was \nwrong. By the way, when you look at the deficiencies in our \nintelligence community and you try to point the finger at them, you \ncan't stop there. If you are going to point it at our intelligence \ncommunity, what about the French intelligence community that believed \nexactly the same thing as our intel community? What about the German \ncommunity, the British community? Every intelligence agency in the \nworld had the same information and the same facts that we had.\n  Our President was presented with the facts that every other head of \nstate was presented, but it was the Americans who were the target of \nthe bad guys around the world. It was the Americans who were the \nvictims on September 11 and were the potential victims thereafter. Our \nPresident exercised good, sound judgment based upon the information \nthat he had and based upon the information that every other head of \nstate had.\n  We can talk about the fact that we ought not to politicize the \ncommission but we have, in fact, politicized the issue. There is a \nmajor, fundamental difference in trying to say that intelligence was \nfaulty and at the same time trying to intimate that this administration \nexercised misleading acts. That is something entirely different, and \nthat is an issue that we can debate long and hard. But it is simply not \na fact substantiated by any of the evidence. Whereas the fact that \nSaddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction had been \nsubstantiated time and time again since 1992, as the Senator from \nMississippi delineated. It has been substantiated by intelligence \ncommunities from every other country in the world up until the time the \nIraqi conflict began. There was no misleading on the part of this \nadministration based upon the facts with which they were presented.\n  Let me address one item in particular that the Senator from Illinois \nstated. He and I both serve on the Intelligence Committee. This issue \nrelative to the UAVs and the possible--I emphasize ``possible''--use by \nSaddam Hussein of UAVs to distribute biological weapons being an issue:\n  He knows good and well that we received information that indicated it \nwas a possibility. We don't know for sure that was their intention, but \nwe know good and well that it was a possibility.\n  So we could go down the line item by item with each of the statements \nthat have been made. I will go back and conclude with what the Senator \nfrom Mississippi said. We can argue and take 10 minutes on each side to \ndiscuss this, but what the American people expect is leadership. What \nthis administration is exhibiting is leadership. This body ought to do \nthe same. We ought to exercise leadership to the American people \nbecause that is what we were sent here to do. We could come together \nand say we know what happened; now let's find the answer; let's figure \nout what the solution is to the problem at hand within our intelligence \ncommunity in a bipartisan way, and nobody disputes that is the way we \nought to act.\n  I say what we need to do is quit debating the issue and move forward \nnow with finding out what the problem was, and let's do what is in the \nbest interest of the American people, and that is continue to work hard \nto make America a safe place.\n\n[[Page S393]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/03/senate-section/article/S393-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSAFE, ACCOUNTABLE, FLEXIBLE, AND EFFICIENT TRANSPORTATION EQUITY ACT OF \n                        2003--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If a State wishes to participate in \n     the review process, the State must require all such State \n     agencies with jurisdiction by law to be subject to and comply \n     with the review process to the same extent as a Federal \n     agency.\n       [(g) Assistance to Affected State and Federal Agencies.--\n       [(1) In general.--The Secretary may approve a request by a \n     State to provide funds made available under chapter 1 of \n     title 23, United States Code, or for a public transit project \n     made available under chapter 53 of title 49, United States \n     Code, to the State for the project, class of projects, or \n     program subject to the coordinated environmental review \n     process established under this section, to affected Federal \n     agencies, including the Department of Transportation, to \n     State agencies participating in the coordinated environmental \n     review process, and to federally recognized tribes, to \n     provide the resources necessary to meet any time limits \n     established under this section.

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have been yielding to Members on other \nsubjects. I was glad to do so, but we were supposed to be on the \nhighway bill for discussion about an hour ago. It is my wish not to \nrecognize anyone, so long as we have speakers on the highway bill. I \nunderstand I get primary recognition, and I can't do this as managed \ntime, but it is my desire to recognize the ranking member of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee for whatever time he should \ntake, and immediately following that, the Senator from Ohio, Mr. \nVoinovich.\n  Before Senator Jeffords talks, let me say, again, as I did several \ntimes yesterday, how much I appreciate his cooperation in working \ntogether on this very difficult bill and coming to the point where we \nare today.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator. I echo those words with respect to \nthe chairman's cooperation as well. It has been a pleasure to work with \nhim and his staff. I am glad we are where we are now.\n  I wish to speak briefly on yesterday's incident that apparently \ninvolved ricin. First, I thank Majority Leader Frist for his calm and \nprofessional approach to this matter. I also thank the Capitol Police, \nthe Attending Physician, and everyone who assisted in responding to \nthis incident.\n  As many of my colleagues know, my personal office is adjacent to \nSenator Frist's office on the first floor, and my committee staff is \nlocated across the hall from Senator Frist, so we were hit twice as \nhard on this episode.\n  Nearly a dozen of my staff members were quarantined last night and \nlater decontaminated. They did not get home until after 2 in the \nmorning. I would like to say a special thank you to them. Thankfully, \neveryone is feeling fine, and they don't appear to have any ill \neffects.\n  We should not have to go through this type of episode as we go about \nour business every day, but, unfortunately, these are the times we are \nliving in.\n  I am hopeful we will get to the bottom of who is responsible, close \nthis chapter, and return to our normal routines as soon as possible. \nIncidentally--and I may be getting a little paranoid--we are the only \noffice to have also been involved in the other episode because we moved \nfrom Hart to Dirksen this year. I want to warn everyone, watch where I \nam. You may save yourself some problems.\n  Some 2\\1/2\\ years ago when I assumed the leadership of the Committee \non Environment and Public Works, I set my sights on reauthorization of \nthe Nation's Surface Transportation Program. I recognized this to be \nthe most challenging task confronting the committee.\n  I have spent these last 2 years working with my colleagues, meeting \nwith Americans, and studying the Nation's transportation needs. I have \ntraveled the country visiting local communities and seeing firsthand \nour many national transportation challenges.\n  My observations on the road were reinforced by our committee's \nhearing process. The committee and our Transportation Subcommittee held \n11 public hearings and sponsored three roundtable discussions to \nprepare for renewal of the Nation's Surface Transportation Program. We \nheard from over 100 witnesses from 30 States, representing over 60 \norganizations. The process generated a hearing record of over 1,500 \npages.\n  What I heard is our current national program is working well; that we \nshould refine it and not replace it. Our national transportation policy \nmust serve the public good. In my view, the outcomes we seek are a \nstrong economy, safe and healthy communities, and a clean environment. \nA balanced transportation system is necessary for us to attain these \ngoals.\n  The success of our Surface Transportation Program will rest on four \nfundamental pillars.\n  Asset management is the first pillar. We must maintain and preserve \nour infrastructure investment. We cannot allow highways and bridges to \ndeteriorate.\n  Access and mobility is the second pillar. Most Americans now live in \nmetro areas, and most metro areas are congested and getting worse. We \nneed to focus on these problems.\n  The third pillar is freight and trade. The value of trade and tonnage \nof goods moved in this country is enormous and growing. We need new \nfacilities to accommodate this growth.\n  The fourth pillar is safety. We must continue the progress we have \nmade over the last 10 years reducing the rate of highway fatalities and \nwork now to reduce the actual number of lives lost on our roadways.\n  In partnership with our chairman, Senator Inhofe, and with the \nleaders of our subcommittee, Senators Bond and Reid, we have helped \nconstruct a bill, SAFETEA, on these pillars. SAFETEA retains the \nstrengths of our current national transportation program while \nenhancing its effectiveness to deal with the challenges facing our \nStates and communities.\n\n[[Page S510]]\n\n  The bill meets highway system needs for strong growth in a manner \nthat increases assistance to every State and every region. It is funded \nat a level of $255 billion that will enable the States to improve road \nand bridge conditions.\n  The bill will generate millions of well-paying jobs since every \nbillion dollars spent on the highway program can generate up to 47,500 \njobs. These jobs come at a time of great economic need in our \ncommunities.\n  A well-funded safety title is also included. It features a new \nprogram--Safe Routes to Schools--to protect children as they walk or \nride their bikes to school.\n  Significant growth in congestion mitigation and air quality funding \nwill help States improve air quality, reduce pollution, and address \ncongestion. The bill makes it easier for States to mitigate project \neffects on habitat and wetlands, and retains and expands popular \nprograms such as enhancements, recreational trails, and scenic byways. \nThe increased intermodal flexibility set forth in the bill will allow \nStates, if they wish, to improve freight handling and movement. But \nfundamentally, this massive transportation bill is about people.\n\n  It is about making it easier to commute to work; making roads safer \nfor our families; preserving scenic beauty for future generations; \nhelping our children get to school safely; moving freight efficiently \nand cheaply; and making America better.\n  Working with my colleagues, I have done my level best to write a bill \nthat is fair to all States and regions of our country. I am committed \nto maintaining the legacy I inherited from my dear friends and former \ncolleagues, Pat Moynihan and John Chafee. I look forward to completing \nthis job, working with Chairman Inhofe, with the leaders of the other \nauthorizing committees, and with all my fellow Members to produce \nlegislation that will build a strong America.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to support S. 1072, the Safe, \nAccountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2003.\n  First, I congratulate Senators Inhofe, Bond, Jeffords, and Reid, and \ntheir staffs on the impressive work they have done to put together a \nbipartisan bill. The fact this is a bipartisan product means we can \nactually get something done. It is a process of which I am glad to be a \npart as a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  Lately, all I have heard in the media and even from some of my \ncolleagues is this is going to be a very difficult year to get anything \ndone. I hope this bill and bipartisan spirit is an indication of the \nprogress we can make this year for the American people. To borrow from \none of my mottos as Governor: Together we can do it. And the other \nmotto is the Ohio motto: With God, all things are possible.\n  This is one of the most important pieces of legislation Congress will \nconsider this year. Although recent economic reports indicate positive \njob growth in the Nation as a whole, manufacturing jobs, including in \nOhio, continue to experience slow growth and prolonged unemployment.\n  In recent months, I have met with workers, small business owners and \nmanufacturers throughout Ohio. They all have the same thing to say: \nGood, high-paying manufacturing jobs are leaving Ohio. Many of these \ndisplaced workers would be productively employed on construction \nprojects.\n  We have an opportunity with the highway bill not only to improve and \nrepair our crumbling highways and bridges but to create and to let \nfolks know that we know they are hurting. I will never forget when I \nwas mayor of the city of Cleveland back in 1983. President Reagan and \nCongress realized the pain the people in this country were experiencing \nand Congress passed the emergency jobs bill, including an increase in \nthe gas tax which stimulated tremendous highway construction jobs \nduring 1983 and into 1984.\n  According to the American Road and Transportation Builders \nAssociation, ARTBA, employment in the transportation construction \nindustry was down in July of 2003, during the peak of the construction \nseason, compared to July 2002. Specifically, there were 12,100 fewer \nworkers on project sites over the last year, a decrease of 3.7 percent.\n  In Ohio, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, heavy \nconstruction jobs were up slightly from last year. However, there were \nstill on average 3,500 fewer jobs in 2003 than in 2000 when they were \nat their peak. Investing in our Nation's transportation infrastructure \nthrough a 6-year reauthorization bill will create hundreds of thousands \nof jobs and move our sluggish economy down the road to recovery.\n  The transportation construction industry generates more than $200 \nbillion in economic activity and helps sustain 2.5 million jobs in the \nUnited States each year. According to the U.S. Department of \nTransportation, every $1 billion invested in highway construction \ncreates 47,500 jobs and generates more than $2 billion in economic \nactivity. It is also estimated that every dollar invested in the \nNation's highway system generates $5.70 in economic benefits, including \nreduced delays, improved safety and reduced vehicle operating costs. \nThis is a 6-to-1 return on investment. This has to be one of the best \ninvestments that the Federal Government can make.\n  We also need to ensure that we are investing adequate resources into \nour transportation infrastructure. According to the Federal Highway \nAdministration's 2002 Conditions and Performance Report, the average \nannual investment level needed to make improvements to highways and \nbridges is projected to be $106.9 billion through 2020. This amount is \n65 percent higher than the $64 billion of total capital investments \nspent by all levels of government in 2000. There is just no question \nthat the need is there.\n  The average annual investment level necessary to maintain the current \ncondition and performance of highways and bridges is projected to be \n$75.9 billion to 2020. This amount is 17.5 percent higher than capital \nspending in 2000. Nationwide, 162,000 bridges are structurally \ndeficient or functionally obsolete, and 160,000 miles of highway \npavement are in poor or mediocre condition. Americans pay approximately \n$49 billion a year in extra vehicle repairs and operating costs due to \nroad conditions. That is $255 a driver in this country. In addition, \nthe average urban rush hour driver spends almost 62 additional hours a \nyear stuck in traffic. Congestion is responsible for 5.7 billion \ngallons of wasted gasoline each year. Wasted fuel and low productivity \ndue to traffic congestion costs the U.S. economy nearly $70 billion \nannually. In other words, this legislation will help reduce our \nreliance on oil, improve our environment, and relieve the stress and \nroad rage that we see so often throughout our country.\n\n  Nearly 43,000 people were killed on America's roads in 2002. Poor \nroad conditions were a factor in one-third of those fatalities. The \nFederal Government predicts highway fatalities will grow to nearly \n52,000 by 2009, absent any new Federal investment in highway safety. \nStudies report that every $1 billion invested in road improvements \nsince 1950 has helped prevent 1,400 premature deaths and nearly 50,000 \ninjuries, as well as help save over $2 billion in health care, \ninsurance, lost wages, and productivity costs.\n  If we continue to ignore the upkeep and allow the deterioration of \nour infrastructure, we risk disruptions in commerce and reduced \nprotection for public safety, health, and the environment. In my view, \nit is the responsibility of Congress to ensure that funding levels are \nadequate and efficiently allocated to the Nation's priority needs.\n  In 1998, Congress recognized the importance of the Nation's \ntransportation system through the enactment of TEA-21, a 6-year bill \nthat increased Federal investment in highways and transit by nearly 40 \npercent to $218 billion. Under TEA-21, my State received a 23 percent \nincrease in transportation funding. Ohio's share of highway funding \nalso increased under TEA-21 to 90.5 percent of its share of \ncontributions to the trust fund. When I took office as Governor in \n1991, Ohio's share was less than 80 percent. ISTEA took us to 85 and \nTEA-21 to 90.5.\n  As chairman of the National Governors Association, I was involved in \nnegotiating TEA-21 and lobbied Congress and worked with Bud Shuster to \nensure that all highway trust fund revenues were spent on \ntransportation.\n\n[[Page S511]]\n\nTEA-21 dedicated nearly all highway gas taxes to transportation funding \nand guarantees that States will receive at least 90.5 percent of their \nshare of contributions to the fund.\n  I also fought to even out highway funding fluctuations and assure a \npredictable flow of funding to eliminate the peaks and valleys that we \nexperienced on the State and local level under ISTEA. TEA-21 achieved \nthis role with record guaranteed levels of funding, and I am glad to be \nin the Senate at this time to work on reauthorizing this important \nlegislation.\n  The administration's 6-year surface transportation reauthorization \nproposal, the Safe, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act, \nwould provide $247 billion, including $201 billion for highway and \nsafety programs and $46 billion to transit programs. On November 12, \n2003, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved $255 \nbillion in contract authority for highways over the next 6 years, or an \naverage of $42.5 billion annually.\n  Again, one of my top priorities for reauthorization is to increase \nthe minimum rate of return for donor States from 90.5 percent to at \nleast 95 percent. In May 2003, Senator Carl Levin and I, along with \nHouse Majority Leader Tom DeLay and Congressman Baron Hill, introduced \nlegislation, the Highway Funding Equity Act of 2003, to increase donor \nStates' minimum rate of return to 95 percent.\n\n  Currently, there are 144 sponsors of this bill in the House and 22 \ncosponsors in the Senate. It has been a pleasure to lead this effort on \nbehalf of the SHARE, States' Highway Alliance for Real Equity, \ncoalition in the Senate. SHARE believes all States have highway \ninfrastructure needs that surpass available resources. For this reason, \neach donor State seeks to get back as much of the taxes paid by its \nmotorists as possible. SHARE's objectives are to increase the size of \nthe guarantee to 95 percent and to apply the scope of the guarantee to \nall dollars being distributed to the States.\n  I commend Chairman Inhofe, Senator Bond, Senator Jeffords, and others \nnot only for their hard work in writing this bill but also for \nincreasing the guaranteed share of all donor States to 95 percent by \n2009, while balancing limited resources and the needs of the States. It \nis a very difficult job, but if one really looks at what has been done, \nit was a Solomon-like job and they should be congratulated for it. I \nhope other Members of the Senate are respectful of the fact that it was \nan intellectually honest effort on our part to try to remedy a problem \nthat we have had for too long around this country.\n  Specifically, my State is going to receive $2.2 billion, which is a \n38 percent increase over the 6-year period, compared to the last 6 \nyears under TEA-21. We lost billions of dollars compared to other \nStates, because we are a donor State--over the last number of years. \nThe total amount of funding Ohio will receive over the next 6 years is \nmore than $8 billion. Much of this additional funding is due to Ohio's \nincreased share of the highway trust fund dollars.\n  Another of my priorities for increasing highway funding and improving \nequity is to no longer penalize States that consume ethanol-blended \nfuel to help reduce our national dependence on imported oil. Last year, \nI cosponsored language written by Senator Grassley and reported out of \nthe Finance Committee that would transfer 2.5 cents of the Federal tax \non ethanol-blended fuel from the general fund of the Treasury to the \nhighway account of the highway trust fund and replace the 5.2-cents-\nper-gallon reduced tax rate for ethanol-blended fuel with a tax \ncredit. This was also in the Senate-passed energy bill.\n\n  As a result, the same Federal tax will be collected and deposited \ninto the highway trust fund, regardless of whether a gallon of fuel \ncontains ethanol. The Ohio Department of Transportation estimates that \nenactment of this legislation will restore up to $170 million annually \nto the State of Ohio.\n  I congratulate the Finance Committee for coming up with the revenue \noffsets to reach the outlays of $231 billion to pay for highways over \nthe next 6 years. I urge the Senate to support the committee's \nrecommendations.\n  This morning I congratulated Senator Grassley, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, for getting in there and finding the dollars and the \noffsets so we can talk to our colleagues about supporting this \nlegislation as something fiscally responsible.\n  When gasohol contributions are included, Ohio's highway funding over \nthe next 6 years will increase more than $3.1 billion, 54.2 percent \nover TEA-21 for a total of $8.9 billion. The surface transportation \nreauthorization bill is extremely important to Ohio, which has one of \nthe largest surface transportation networks in the country. Ohio has \nthe 10th largest highway network, the 5th largest volume of traffic, \nthe 4th largest interstate highway network, and the 2nd largest \ninventory of bridges in the country.\n  There are also 62 public transit systems serving 59 of Ohio's 88 \ncounties. In 2002, these systems made approximately 138.6 million \ntrips. Ohio has the Nation's 4th largest rural transportation program, \nthe 5th largest bus fleet, the 9th most transit vehicle miles traveled, \nand the 10th overall highest ridership in the country.\n  This bill, if enacted, will meet the essential needs of the entire \nsurface transportation system of my State. It will also create \nthousands of jobs and provide a significant boost to Ohio's economy. I \nam very proud that Ohio approved a motor fuel tax increase in 2003 that \nwill ensure an annual $250 million new construction program for the \nnext 10 years, while maintaining bridge and highway conditions. With \nadditional Federal funds, the Ohio Department of Transportation has set \na goal of having a $5 billion, 10-year Ohio construction program \nentitled Jobs and Progress Plan, dedicated to addressing Ohio's most \npressing congestion, safety, and rural access needs.\n  The plan is predicated on Congress enacting legislation to correct \nthe ethanol penalty which reduces Ohio's transportation revenue and \nincreases donor States' minimum rate of return to 95 percent, and \nprovides an increased level of investment in the Nation's highways and \nbridges. This highway bill achieves all of those goals. It is a bill \nthat is very important to my State and its economy.\n  As a result, a half billion dollar a year new construction program in \nour State would employ approximately 4,000 construction workers \ndirectly and create another almost 10,000 indirect highway jobs.\n  Ohio's Jobs and Progress Plan would help finance several major \nprojects throughout the State, including a $350 million project to \nrebuild I-75 in Dayton, a $400 million project to begin rebuilding the \nCentral Viaduct, or as we call it in Cleveland, the Dead Man's Curve, \nand a $600 million project to improve I-70 and I-71 in Columbus. The \nplan also calls for $60 million annual investment to address high-crash \nlocations, as well as funding to address freight corridors such as U.S. \n24 and U.S. 30 in northwest Ohio. Too many people have died on these \nhighways.\n\n  This is a jobs bill. In addition, the Ohio Department of \nTransportation has $164.3 million worth of projects that are ready to \ngo. These are projects ready to go if the money were there. The 128 \nprojects on the shelf include major reconstruction, resurfacing, bridge \nreplacement and repair, traffic signals, signs, culvert construction, \nguardrail rebuilding, pavement marking, and preventive maintenance. If \nthis funding were made available, approximately 1,300 direct and some \nalmost 3,500 indirect jobs would be created in the State.\n  Finally, I have several comments about the environmental, planning, \nand project delivery provisions of the bill. As chairman of the Clean \nAir Subcommittee and the past chairman of the Transportation \nSubcommittee, I understand full well the importance and significance of \nthe overlap between highway planning and air quality.\n  When I began my term as Governor, 28 Ohio counties were in \nnonattainment for ozone. I spent considerable effort to get them into \nattainment. In addition to working with utilities to reduce their \nemissions, I implemented an automobile emissions testing program called \nE-check to help bring Ohio's counties into compliance. At that time, \nOhio was one of only a few States to have an enhanced auto emissions \ntest in its urban areas.\n  That all came about because we were trying to comply with the Clean \nAir Act. This program was a success. According to the 1997 EPA report, \nvolatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides, which are a major \ncomponent in\n\n[[Page S512]]\n\nthe formation of ozone and are emitted by cars and trucks, have been \ndramatically reduced from 1970 to 1996. Emissions of VOCs were reduced \nby 49 percent, NOX by 26 percent. Additionally, air toxins \nin Ohio were reduced from approximately 381 million pounds in 1987 to \n144 million pounds in 1996.\n  Due to these reductions, all 88 counties have met the national air \nquality standards. But this has not been an easy battle. The E-Check \nprogram has been criticized because it required vehicle owners in \nsmoggy areas to pay for annual emissions testing and to make the \nnecessary repairs. Due to its unpopularity, Ohio's General Assembly \npassed a bill revoking the program. However, I stood up for the program \nand vetoed the bill because I believed it was an important and \nnecessary step to cleaning up Ohio's air. That veto, by the way, was \nnot overridden.\n  I believe hard choices such as these are important. The conformity \nprogram has helped encourage cleaner air, and transportation planning \nhas benefited from coordination with the air quality planners. As \nrequested by Federal, State, and local officials, this bill makes \nimportant improvements in the conformity process by synchronizing \nplanning and conformity timelines and requirements. So I congratulate \nthe chief sponsors again.\n  I am also pleased that this bill modifies the Congestion Mitigation \nand Air Quality Improvement Program, called CMAQ, to include the \nnonattainment areas for the fine particulate matter standard--PM2.5--\nand the 8-hour ozone standard. EPA will make designations for both \nthese standards this year, and these areas will need all the help they \ncan get to attain the new standards.\n  While these are two areas in which I believe we have made progress, I \nam a little disappointed with the metropolitan and statewide planning \nand transportation project delivery process in this bill. I don't think \nthese provisions will do much to expedite the project delivery process \nand, quite frankly, actually create a more burdensome process than \nunder current law.\n\n  As a former Governor, I was frustrated at how long it took to do a \nhighway project from beginning to end. As Senator, I have wanted to do \nsomething meaningful on this issue, since I was chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure and, in fact, we held \na number of oversight hearings on the implementation of the \nstreamlining provisions included in TEA-21. One of my top priorities \nfor this reauthorization is to enact efficient transportation project \ndelivery that will actually expedite the project delivery process.\n  Regulations implementing these provisions were disappointing and \nlater scrapped. I regret that we have wasted an opportunity to realize \nthe benefits of the expedited process that was envisioned 6 years ago, \nthe 1309 process. In other words, we talked 6 years ago, in the TEA-21, \nthat we were going to streamline the process and put a provision in the \nlaw that said we should do it. After 6 years, fundamentally nothing has \nhappened--after 6 years.\n  The transportation project delivery process provisions in this bill \nthat we are going to consider, as I say, are disappointing because I \nthink they are going to do little to expedite the project delivery \nprocess, given that the bill requires State and local planning agencies \nto meet process burdens that are even more burdensome than in the \ncurrent law.\n  Do you hear me? They are more burdensome than in the current law, \nwhich we were trying to change and improve during the last 6 years.\n  I hope we can fix these provisions on the floor with the support of \nAASHTO, ARTBA, AGC, and the American Highway Users, and many State and \nlocal government organizations.\n  Furthermore, one more thing I am concerned about is one of the most \nsignificant elements of environmental streamlining missing from this \nbill, and that is to reform the process known as section 4(f). This \nprocess causes more delay in my State than any other planning or \nenvironment review requirement. I will bring that situation to the \nattention of my colleagues during debate on this bill.\n\n  This is a good bill. I urge my colleagues to support S. 1072. The \ncurrent surface transportation authorization expires at the end of this \nmonth. People are waiting. They want it passed. They want to see the \njobs. The time to act is now.\n  Nationwide, this bill would create 2.8 million new jobs, including \n106,000 new jobs in Ohio. This is important jobs-creation legislation \nthat will put hard-working Americans back to work and jump-start our \nsluggish economy, especially States like Ohio, where our economy is \nstill struggling.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I see the minority leader. I certainly \ndefer to the minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma. I am \nhappy to accommodate the order at whatever time someone may come to the \nfloor. I have a few comments to make as we begin this debate.\n  Let me express our gratitude to the two managers of the bill and \nother Members of the Senate who have put so much effort into this \nlegislation. We have come a long way. I am grateful to them for \nproducing a bill that merits strong bipartisan support.\n  The debate on this bill is long overdue. We have already lost 90,000 \njobs by our inability to pass the bill last October. At a time when we \nhave lost 3 million jobs over the last several years, we cannot afford \nto keep losing jobs. We had the first meager job increase just last \nmonth with 1,000 jobs across the entire Nation. The importance we can \nput on job creation with this legislation should not be underestimated.\n  Now that the Senate has begun the debate on the bill, we need to \nensure it goes forward in a bipartisan fashion--the way this \ninstitution has worked on legislation similar to this over its long \nhistory.\n  If we ultimately pass a transportation bill into law, it is expected \nto create 830,000 jobs over the next 6 years. These would be good jobs \nfor Americans, jobs in engineering, in the environment, in \nconstruction--good jobs in all States.\n  In addition to jobs, there is another critical reason to be moving \nforward on this bill. Yesterday, there was a lot of talk about the $520 \nbillion Federal budget deficit, a very troubling figure. But there is \nanother deficit we have not talked much about yet and that is in our \nNation's infrastructure. Our Nation's transportation infrastructure--\nour roads, highways, transit, ports, and rail lines--is a thread that \nholds our Nation together to make it possible to have a free and open \nsociety, which is suffering a remarkable deficit, one that can be \naddressed with the passage of this legislation.\n\n  Our transportation infrastructure impacts what we do every single \nday, and most of the time it is simply taken for granted and \nunrecognized.\n  Over 30 percent of our roads and highways are now considered in poor \nor in substandard condition. Over 30,000 of our Nation's bridges are \nfunctionally obsolete or structurally deficient. The transportation \nbill reported out of the Environment and Public Works Committee will \naddress this infrastructure deficit.\n  Likewise, we need to ensure this transportation bill is intermodal \nand includes provisions to improve the conditions of rails and ports. \nRail lines in the United States alone require $7 billion each and every \nyear just to maintain them. Our Nation's transit programs are a \ncritical and interconnected portion of our transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  I am particularly pleased Finance Chairman Grassley and Ranking \nMember Baucus included as a part of the financing provisions reported \nfrom the committee yesterday a provision which treats transit in a \nsimilar manner to highways. It was the right decision to go forward \nwith some symmetry on transit and highways. Both receive funds from the \nhighway trust funds. I applaud Senators Grassley and Baucus for doing \nso.\n  I am pleased we are finally working on this bill in the Senate. As I \nsaid, Senators Inhofe and Jeffords need to be complimented, along with \nSenators Bond and Reid, for the hard work and leadership they have \nshown in getting us to this point. I look forward to moving ahead in a \nbipartisan fashion to do not only what is needed but what is required \nto address our transportation infrastructure deficit.\n  If we go forward in that fashion with that goal, we will not only \nimprove the condition of our infrastructure but create hundreds of \nthousands of needed jobs and improve the condition of our country, as \nwell.\n\n[[Page S513]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the minority leader for the \nexcellent statement. We have a new chart on job opportunities which \ntalks about the cumulative effect when a job is offered--say a \nconstruction job on a bridge or highway--and what that does to the rest \nof the economy. It is about 2.8 million jobs as opposed to some of the \nfigures we have been using, one-fourth of that number. It is very \nsignificant.\n  The Senator from Ohio gave an excellent statement also. The State of \nOhio, in terms of new job opportunities, is No. 5 in the Nation under \nthis bill. The Senator has done an excellent job. I am sure the people \nof Ohio are very appreciative of the job opportunities that will be \nthere as a result of the legislation we hope to pass in the next few \ndays.\n  The Senator from Ohio, who has vast experience in clean air, was a \nbreath of fresh air when he came in, someone who really has the \nanswers. He was the chairman of the Clean Air Committee of the National \nAssociation of Governors. His expertise is very much appreciated.\n  Senator Jeffords and others have already mentioned the difficulties \nin putting together a formula, considering the fast-growing States, \nwith a ceiling there. We have some of the small States, such as that of \nthe Presiding Officer, in terms of population, which have to be \nconsidered because even though it is a small population there are a lot \nof roads that have to be cared for. Taking into consideration all of \nthese considerations was not easy.\n  However, when we compare what we have done with what has been done in \nthe past, I am very proud of it. The equity bonus program replaces the \nminimum guarantees.\n  Now, I have been criticized for the way I simplify my explanation of \nminimum guarantees, but it is pretty accurate; that is, we took a \npercentage of the total amount of money and gave it to each State until \nwe got 60 votes, not caring too much what happened after that. We took \ninto consideration all the issues we have been talking about.\n  The bill does four things, essentially. It takes care of the donor \nStates. I have been part of a donor State for as long as I can \nremember, certainly as long as I have been in the Senate. We were down \nbelow 80 percent, and as mentioned by the Senator from Ohio, ISTEA, \nthen TEA-21, and now with this bill, we are up to 95 percent.\n  Streamlining provisions is very important. It is important we have \nmoney to spend on road construction, but also we can get the maximum \nout of the dollars we do spend. We go a long way to making this a \nreality.\n  The third major area is that of safety. We have talked about the \nnumber of deaths on the highways. It has to be addressed. That is why \nwe named this SAFETEA, with many safety provisions, at the same time \nallowing the States to come, recognizing they know more about their \nStates than we do in Washington.\n  And lastly, the area of freight movement.\n  With that, it is my desire throughout the day today when there are \nnot speakers to be heard on the highway bill to go through this, \nsection by section, and see specifically how these things are handled.\n  If any Members who come to the floor want to be heard on the highway \nbill, I will suspend. Of course, we will break in 20 minutes for our \npolicy luncheon.\n  I start with section 1101, the authorization of appropriations. We \nare talking about $255 billion in contract authority over the next 6 \nyears. This was difficult to come up with. At the same time, we have \n$56.5 billion contract authority in transit, for a total of $311 \nbillion, considerably more than the Budget Committee originally came up \nwith, considerably more than in the President's budget.\n  And we have received, only yesterday, the President's budget message. \nI think, however--and I did talk to the President yesterday--when he \nrealizes fully the great work the Finance Committee did--the fact that \nwe now have the offsets necessary to do this without increasing the \ndeficit--the President is going to be more supportive than he has been \nin the past.\n  So this represents an overall increase of 31 percent over TEA-21. The \nlink between a robust economy and a strong transportation \ninfrastructure is undeniable. The movement of people and goods is one \nof the foremost indicators of a growing economy and job creation.\n  The President recommended a funding level of $200 billion for \nreauthorization. Given the critical infrastructure and safety needs of \nthe program, we thought it imperative to authorize a higher level of \nfunding for the coming 6 years.\n  I recall a study that was made--and I do not have the exact figures, \nbut the amount of money even that we are suggesting right now merely \nmaintains where we are today. It was discussed by the minority leader \nthat we have a bridge crisis, and I was wanting to interrupt him to say \nthat my State has the distinction of having the largest percentage of \nfunctionally obsolete bridges. We are hoping to correct that with this \nbill.\n  On the other end of the spectrum, the House Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee has introduced a bill funding highways and \ntransit at $375 billion, which is considerably over our $311 billion. \nHowever, achieving this astronomical figure would require raising gas \ntaxes by 13.5 cents per gallon during the next 6 years, in addition to \nutilizing a number of other costly new financing measures.\n  The vote before you today recognizes the realities of available \nrevenues without the need for increasing gas taxes, and, I might add, \nor increasing the deficit. It is designed to make the most of every \navailable dollar to produce better and safer roads by creating \nthousands of new jobs every year and stimulating the national economy.\n  In that regard, the Department of Transportation estimates that every \n$1 billion of Federal transportation funds translates into 47,500 jobs. \nBy the way, that is not a fictitious number. We have had several \nstudies that were done. We realize it is accurate. However, when you \nsay new job opportunities, it is about four times that. If someone \ntakes a construction job, that person is buying more goods and \nservices, and that means manufacturing is going to go up and there are \ngoing to be many other jobs. So this figure is a very conservative \nfigure.\n  We estimate that the SAFETEA will increase the size of the job market \nby 700,000 but create over 2 million new employment opportunities. I \nthink that is what we need to be talking about.\n  Section 1102 is an obligation ceiling. The principle that was used to \ndevelop obligation limitations was to minimize the gap between the \nOBLIM or obligation limitations in contract authority levels. This \nempowers the States to utilize as much available contract authority as \npossible while still providing them maximum flexibility.\n  We were able to achieve a total obligation limitation of $238 \nbillion. This is what was recommended in the Reid-Bond amendment that \ncarried this Chamber with 79 votes. This is consistent with that \namendment to the budget resolution. So there was a lot of hard work \nfrom the Finance Committee and the leadership of Chairman Grassley and \nRanking Member Baucus, and I thank them for the great work they did.\n\n  Section 1103 is the apportionment section. In addition to the overall \nincreases experienced by all programs, the bill makes important changes \nto the apportionment of a few specific programs. Under TEA-21, the \nadministrative expenses of the Federal Highway Administration were \nfunded as a takedown from the various core programs. This bill \nrecognizes the separate importance of costs associated with the \nadministration of the overall highway program. Therefore, the bill \nfunds Federal highway administrative expenses as its own separate \napportionment protecting the authority of the individual core programs \nor the autonomy of the individual core programs and the administrative \nfund itself.\n  Of the amount designated for program administration, the Secretary of \nTransportation is also given the authority to transfer an appropriate \namount for the administrative expenses of the Appalachian Highway \nDevelopment System.\n  As a result of the 2000 census, 46 new metropolitan planning \norganizations or MPOs have been established throughout the country and \nare now eligible\n\n[[Page S514]]\n\nfor Federal transportation planning funding.\n  We have devoted a lot of time and a lot of attention in this bill to \nplanning as well as to assisting States in doing what they do best, \nalso, which we will get to in a later section. To respond to this \nexpanded need, we have increased the program set-aside for MPOs from 1 \npercent under ISTEA to 1.5 percent, along with the overall increase in \nprogram funds which will help to address the growing transportation \nplanning needs.\n  TEA-21 used a minimum guarantee. I have been talking about this, and \nthat really constituted a percentage. And it is just not the way this \nshould be done. We wanted it in our formulas, and we wanted it in an \nattempt to get our donor States up to 90.5 percent. We used a minimum \nguarantee calculation to guarantee that States received back at least \n90.5 percent--that is what they did in TEA-21--90.5 percent of their \npercentage contribution to the highway trust fund.\n  The Minimum Guarantee Program was driven by the political \ndistribution known as the 1104 table. I will not go into that because \nthis is somewhat redundant. We have talked about this in the past. It \nwas purely politically driven.\n  To contrast that, the new Equity Bonus Program does away with the \ntable in TEA-21 which determined each State's percentage share of the \ntotal highway fund, the political table to which I have been referring. \nRather than have a State's return be set by a politically driven table, \nthe Equity Bonus Program determines each State's return by first \nrelying on the program distribution formulas. The equity bonus \ncalculation identifies a justifiable nexus in equity between the \nunderlying formulas and responsible balanced growth for donor and donee \nStates alike.\n  If a State fails to reach the minimum return in any year based on the \nformulas, that State would receive an equity bonus award in addition to \ntheir formula. It should bring them up to the required level. I cannot \nthink of a better and more equitable way of doing this.\n  While we allow the formulas to work under the new Equity Bonus \nProgram, we also recognized that there would be some inequities if we \nallowed the formulas to be the sole factor in distributing dollars to \nthe States. In order to increase the minimum rate of return for donor \nStates, while ensuring an equitable transition for donee States, rates \nof return are subject to an annual growth ceiling to smooth out the \nphase-in of the increased minimum returns.\n  This accomplishes two goals: It keeps the cost of the Equity Bonus \nProgram affordable; secondly, it ensures that donee States are still \nable to grow so that there are no States with growth less than 10 \npercent in dollars. I repeat that. Of all 50 States, every State gets \nat least an increase of 10 percent.\n  Now, I have heard from a lot of the people whose State falls into the \ndifferent categories. One is the category of a fast-growing State, and, \nobviously, they would prefer that the ceilings not be there so they \nwould bump into them. But if you do not do that, then you would hear \nequally from some of the older States, such as New York and \nPennsylvania, that would have to pay the price if we did not have some \ntype of a ceiling.\n  For donor States, the effect of the growth ceiling is that a State \nwith a rate of return above 90.5 percent in 2003 will reach a 95 \npercent return sooner than a State that received only a 90.5 percent \nreturn, or below, in 2003. The closer a State was to 95 percent in \n2003, the sooner it will reach 95 percent.\n  Conversely, those States at 90.5 percent in 2003, such as my State of \nOklahoma, would likely take longer to reach 95 percent. The time it \ntakes a State to reach 95 percent depends on how much equity bonus \nfunding the State receives and how much faster than the national \naverage that State is increasing its contributions to the highway trust \nfund. That is taken into consideration as a part of this formula.\n  Recognizing that States with a lower tax basis due to low population, \nsuch as the State of Wyoming and others, or low income face an added \nchallenge of maintaining the transportation infrastructure, the bill \nsets their TEA-21 rate of return as a minimum for future years.\n  Section 1105 is the revenue aligned budget authority, or RABA, as we \nhave referred to it. The huge 2003 negative adjustment in the revenue \naligned budget authority made it clear that some changes were needed in \nthe RABA calculation in order to provide greater stability and more \naccurate predictions and less fluctuation in coming years. This is \ntrue. The States can get so much more for their dollars if they can \npredict into the future how they are going to use those dollars and \nwhat those dollars are going to amount to.\n  As I have indicated before, I believe the underlying principle of \nRABA is an important fiscal policy that highway expenditures should be \ntied to highway trust fund revenues.\n  The bill modifies the RABA calculations so that annual funding level \nadjustments are less dependent on future anticipated receipts and more \ndependent upon actual receipts to the highway trust fund. If the RABA \nadjustment in any fiscal year is negative, the amount of contract \nauthority apportioned to the State for that year will be reduced by an \namount equal to the negative RABA. However, if the balance of the \nhighway trust fund is greater than $6 billion, then there will be no \nnegative RABA adjustments.\n  Section 1201 is the infrastructure performance and maintenance \nprogram, or IPAM. There is a lot of interest in this program, \nobviously. The IPAM program is intended for ready-to-go projects that \nStates can undertake and complete within a relatively short timeframe. \nAs a result, States are given 6 months to obligate IPAM funds. We \ndesigned this discretionary program to promote projects that resulted \nin immediate benefits for the highway system's condition and \nperformance while avoiding long-term commitments of funds. The program \nalso provides further economic stimulus to the economy and provides a \nway to aid in spending down balances in the highway trust fund.\n  That is very important right now. We are very sensitive to the \nsomewhat job crisis. We have seen our economy on its way up again. \nHowever, there is a lag between economic recovery and the jobs. IPAM is \ngoing to give more construction sooner, provide more jobs and more jobs \nsooner. Then, of course, when you put the new job opportunities factor \nto that, that is going to be very meaningful to job recovery in \nAmerica.\n  The States may obligate funds for projects eligible under Interstate \nMaintenance, National Highway System, Surface Transportation System, \nHighway Safety Improvements Program, Congestion Mitigation and Air \nQuality Improvement, or CMAC, and the Highway Bridge Program. Eligible \nprojects under IPAM include the preservation, maintenance, or \nimprovement of existing highway infrastructure and operational \nimprovements to address recurring highway congestion.\n  Section 1202 is the future of the surface transportation system \ntitle. In order to be prepared for future reauthorizations of this \nlegislation, we require the Secretary of Transportation to perform a \nlong-term investigation into the surface transportation infrastructure \nneeds of the Nation.\n\n  Specifically, the bill directs the Secretary to look at: the current \ncondition and performance of the interstate system; the future of the \ninterstate system in 15 years or 30 years or 50 years; expected \ndemographics and business uses that impact the surface transportation \nsystem; the effect of changing vehicle types, modes of transportation, \ntraffic volumes, and fleet size and weights--we have seen such a \ndramatic change in the types of vehicles that we drive that we never \ncould have anticipated back when we were putting together ISTEA or one \nof the previous programs--possible design changes; rural, urban, \ninterregional, and national needs; improvements in emergency \npreparedness; real-time performance data collection; and future funding \nneeds and potential approaches to collect those funds.\n  What we are saying is, we are trying to prepare for the future. It is \nimportant what we do for the next 6 years, as we go through this \nreauthorization. I think we have done a good job with that. But things \nwill happen 6 years from now that we cannot anticipate.\n\n[[Page S515]]\n\nThat is what the Secretary of Transportation will be looking at and \ncoming back with, so we will be able to anticipate some of the things \nwe will be looking at 6 years from now.\n  A very important section is 1203. That is the freight transportation \ngateways, freight intermodal connections. Freight movement in America \nis expected to grow dramatically in volume and value over the coming \ndecades. Throughout the reauthorization hearings, the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee heard concerns about inadequate freight \nfacilities, insufficient capacity, and insufficient connections.\n  The GAO recently released a report, dated October 2003, a little over \na month ago, regarding freight transportation, recommending strategies \nneeded to address planning and financing limitations. The report noted \nthat the major challenges to freight mobility all shared a common \ntheme--congestion, including overcrowded highways, freight specific \ncheck points.\n  Additionally, the GAO reported two main limitations that stakeholders \nencounter in addressing these challenges. The first related to the \nlimited visibility that freight projects receive in the planning and \nprioritization process. S. 1072 directly addresses this problem by \ncreating a freight transportation coordinator at the State level to \nfacilitate public and private collaboration in developing solutions to \nfreight transportation and freight gateway problems. This is one more \narea where we will have an increased emphasis on States.\n  The bill also ensures that intermodal freight transportation needs \nare integrated into project development and planning processes. The \nsecond limitation that the GAO found was inhibiting stakeholders was \nthat Federal funding programs tend to dedicate funds to a single mode \nof transportation or nonfreight purpose, thus limiting freight project \neligibility among some programs. S. 1072 deals with this problem as \nwell as making intermodal projects eligible for STP and NHS funding.\n  The Freight Gateways program found in this bill promotes intermodal \nimprovements for freight movement through significant trade gateways, \nports and hubs, and intermodal connections to the national highway \nsystem. States and localities are encouraged to adopt new financing \nstrategies to leverage State, local, and private investments in freight \ntransportation gateways, thus maximizing the impact of each Federal \ndollar.\n\n  The Freight Gateways program is funded from a set-aside of 2 percent \nof each State's NHS apportionment. However, in the spirit of State \nflexibility and ensuring that funds go to the areas of greatest need, a \nState is not required to spend the 2 percent of their NHS apportionment \nif they can certify to the Secretary that their intermodal connections \nare adequate. I think this is a recognition that the States do know \nmore about their needs than the Federal Government. That is one of the \ntrends of this.\n  I know we are ready to recess. I yield to my colleague Senator \nJeffords for the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I will take very little time. I commend the chairman \nagain and all the staffs, his and mine, for the incredible amount of \nwork they have put into this effort.\n  Mr. INHOFE. They are even talking to each other now.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes, right. It is fantastic. We know also that we have \na long way to go. The work you have done and my staff has done, all of \nus, has placed us in a great position to start. But now it is the \nopportunity for all the Members to check carefully to see how their \nStates are doing and maybe make some improvements. We know we will have \na number of amendments. We have a long way to go, but I think we are \noff to a great start. I expect we will have a great finish.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would agree with those comments. However, I think we \nhave the basic formula, and this is something for which I am going to \nbe fighting because once you break into this and change the formula, \nthat is going to change every State. That is something we have spent \nover a year now working out to get as much equity as possible. We look \nforward to the input from Members who are not on the committee.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. They should all have the opportunity, and I know we \nwill provide it. I think we have done a great job, so there should not \nbe too much problem.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, 12:30 has arrived and we are planning to \nbreak.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/03/senate-section/article/S515-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I know this is a day when we are having \ndiscussions about the highway bill, the transportation measure, and the \nhighway portion of it. I appreciate the opportunity to share with my \ncolleagues some of my thoughts on the work that has gone on. As I \nindicated yesterday, there will be a number of very important \namendments. We hope to overcome the technical difficulties which make \nit impossible for Members to get to their offices so that they can \npresent the amendments.\n  We have heard from a number of Members who are concerned because they \nare not getting enough in the bill, but, frankly, this bill has much in \nit to commend, and we are looking forward to working in a cooperative \nmanner to get this bill passed.\n  We have lost valuable time, obviously, as we had to get cloture \nyesterday and we are working under the constraints of the ricin \npresence today. So we are a bit delayed.\n  I reiterate, I appreciate and commend the great work of Senator \nInhofe, chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, \nthe ranking member, Senator Jeffords, and my partner on the \nTransportation Subcommittee, my ranking member, Senator Harry Reid of \nNevada. They have done an excellent job.\n  I believe the committee reported out a bill, S. 1072, the Safe, \nAccountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2003, \nwhich we know as SAFETEA, which accomplishes several very important \ngoals.\n  First, safety. Safety in this authorization is for the first time \ngiven a prominent position, being elevated to a core program. Our bill \nmirrors the administration's proposal continuing our commitment to our \nmotoring public's safety. This is accomplished by providing much needed \nfunding to reduce highway injuries and fatalities, all without the use \nof mandates.\n  A key component of the bill before us will go a long way to saving \nlives by providing funds to States to address safety needs at hazardous \nlocations, sections, and elements. This includes roadside obstacles and \nunmarked or poorly marked roads that may constitute a danger to \nmotorists, bicyclists, pedestrians, and other highway users.\n  We know in my own home State of Missouri that inadequate roads delay, \ndeny, and derail economic development opportunities. But most \nimportant, inadequate highways kill people. We have more than three \ndeaths a day on Missouri's highways. I think a large number--at least a \nthird and perhaps more--of those are attributed to inadequate \ninfrastructure.\n  When there is traffic of 10,000, 15,000 to 20,000 cars a day on a \nnarrow two-lane road, there are going to be people passing when they \nshould not and they run into other people head on.\n  I have lost friends. I know too many families who grieve the loss of \nloved ones. I can point out roads in Missouri where one can drive not \nvery far and see white cross after white cross put up as a reminder \nthat some lost their lives on those roads. They lost their lives \nbecause the traffic was heavy. Very often, someone not from the area or \neven not from the State has come in and is not familiar with the road \nand they pass where they should not. They meet someone else head on, \nand that is a tragedy. Several weeks ago, I attended the funeral of the \nhusband of a former staffer of mine who has been incapacitated. He was \nkilled on a two-lane road. It was a terrible tragedy and an unspeakable \nloss.\n\n[[Page S516]]\n\n  We heard numerous testimony from the administration that nearly \n42,000 people are killed on our roads and highways each year. I think \nthe bill reflects a continued commitment to making not only investments \nin our infrastructure but also to the general safety and welfare of our \nconstituents.\n  The second feature of this bill which is very important is equity. \nWhile previous authorizations have talked about equity, our bill \ncarefully balances the needs of the donor States while also recognizing \nthe needs of the donee States.\n  For those who may not be familiar with the terminology, donor States \nsuch as Missouri and Oklahoma are ones that get less than a dollar back \nfor every dollar they put in. Donee States are ones that get back more \nthan a dollar for every dollar they put in. We are seeking to get a \nbetter return on our money, realizing that in this bill we cannot \novercome the inequities between the donor and donee States.\n  There are many sections in the bill I am proud of supporting. One of \nthe most important facts is all donor States will receive a 95 percent \nrate of return at least by the end of the authorization. These States \ninclude Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, \nIndiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, \nMissouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, \nTennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Washington. There are 24 States \nin total. These have been getting less than 95 cents in the past and \nwill be getting up to 95 cents.\n  My home State of Missouri, like many of the donor States mentioned, \nhas some of the worst roads in the Nation. According to a survey, \nMissouri has the third worst roads. Fifty-nine percent of its roads are \neither in poor or mediocre condition, requiring immediate repair or \nreconstruction. Missouri also has the second worst bridges in the \nNation.\n  I guess I ought to remind people the one State that ranks even worse \nthan Missouri is our neighboring State, Oklahoma, the State of the \nchairman of our committee. So obviously we have an interest in bringing \nabout some repair and some safety improvements.\n  During the reauthorization of TEA-21, the previous currently extended \nhighway authorization, donor States did not think it was possible to \nachieve a 95 percent rate of return. Under our proposal, we are able to \nget them there--get all of us there. However, I am aware some of the \ndonor States are concerned that they hit the growth caps and they do \nnot achieve a 95 percent return in the first year. We were unable to \nbring all donor States up as early as we might have wished due to \nbudgetary constraints and balancing the needs of the donor States with \nthe needs of donee States. For this reason, as the donor States grow, \nthe donee States see a gradual decline to bring greater equity between \nthe States.\n  I am proud to tell all Senators from all States, however, that every \nState will grow at least 10 percent over the funding provided in the \ncurrent bill TEA-21. This new bill, SAFETEA, also addresses several \nenvironmental issues such as the need to ease the transition under the \nnew air quality standards. The conformity process is better aligned \nwith air quality planning, as well as streamlining the project delivery \nprocess by providing the necessary tools to reduce or eliminate \nunnecessary delays during the environmental review stage.\n  The third aspect of the bill which I think is very important is there \nis a sufficient level of growth. The administration proposed, in my \nview, an insufficient level of growth for our Nation's aging \ninfrastructure. The reason for offering the Bond-Reid amendment, which \nwas adopted on the budget amendment in this body with 79 votes last \nyear, was because the administration's SAFETEA proposal came in at only \n$200 billion for highways. During the last year's budget debate, I, \nalong with Senator Reid, offered an amendment to fund highways at $255 \nbillion over 6 years, and that was supported by a vote of 79 to 21. I \nam pleased to report that the bill we have before us follows the Bond-\nReid amendment providing a 31 percent increase in funding over TEA-21. \nWhile this is not as high as some might have wanted, we are able to \nachieve this goal without raising fuel taxes.\n\n  Last, I think it is important to note that this is a jobs bill. The \nDepartment of Transportation estimates that every $1 billion in new \nFederal investment creates 47,500 jobs, or more. Accordingly, in 2009 \nour comprehensive 6-year bill at $255 billion will sustain over 2 \nmillion jobs.\n  According to the Associated General Contractors, the same $1 billion \ninvestment yields $500 million in new orders from manufacturing and \n$500 million spread through other sectors of the economy. Construction \npay averages, at $19 per hour, 23 percent higher than the private \nsector average. Failure to enact a 6-year bill will deprive us of the \n90,000 jobs that would be created.\n  Another accomplishment of our package is it will ensure that \ntransportation projects are built more quickly because environmental \nstakeholders will be brought to the table sooner, environmental issues \nwill be raised earlier, and the public will have better opportunities \nto shape the projects. Projects more sensitive to environmental \nconcerns will move through a more structured environmental review \nprocess more efficiently and with fewer delays. The bill also ensures \ntransportation projects will not make air worse in areas with poor air \nquality while giving local transportation planners more tools and elbow \nroom to meet their Federal air quality requirements.\n  This bill will put transportation planning on a regular 4-year cycle, \nrequire air quality checks for projects large enough to be regionally \nsignificant, and reduce the requirements for other projects.\n  In addition to the benefits of this bill, I want to discuss a couple \nof specific items. I think these benefits are clear, and I think they \ncommend the bill to anyone who is interested in good highways, safety, \nand jobs.\n  There is an amendment that was adopted in the committee which I find \ntroubling. It was adopted in the committee without my support. The \nHighway Stormwater Discharge Mitigation Program requires 2 percent set-\nasides from highways. That is about $1 billion. It is a mandate that \ntells States what they have to do with their highway money.\n  I was hoping we would not get into mandates such as that. It is a \nmassive environmental program. As the occupant of the chair knows, \nthere are tremendous needs for environmental investment, particularly \nin clean water, safe drinking water, and other water needs. But this is \na highway bill and I do not think it makes sense to tell all the States \nthat they are going to have to set aside 2 percent of the funds \napportioned to each State under the surface transportation program for \nuse only on storm water mitigation activities in a new section 176.\n  I think the bill as introduced more than adequately addresses the \nissue of contaminated runoff from highways while also protecting \nStates' flexibility to manage their programs to meet their individual \nneeds. The bill as introduced increases State flexibilities and \nopportunities to address storm water pollution in two ways.\n  First, it makes storm water projects eligible under the National \nHighway System program, whereas under current law these projects are \nonly eligible under the STP program.\n  Second, the underlying bill extends eligibility to storm water \nmitigation projects that are not tied to ongoing reconstruction, \nrehabilitation, resurfacing or restoration, only to an existing Federal \naid highway. Therefore, the States have the flexibility. The States \nwith storm water problems will know they have those problems and they \nwill have the flexibility to direct the money to storm water. They have \nmuch greater flexibility. The bill as introduced allows those States \nthat choose to do so to use their highway money for storm water. The \nStates that have other means for addressing storm water and need the \nmoney for roads can use it for roads.\n  I think we ought to address the problems on water issues, clean water \nand safe drinking water, but let's stay with the highway bill and not \ntry to shoehorn a new environmental program into it.\n  While roads certainly contribute to contaminated runoff, the \nappropriate place to address storm water runoff is in the context of \nother clean water programs through the water infrastructure bill. If \ngas receipts increase, it\n\n[[Page S517]]\n\ncould exceed the amount we provide EPA to address all other clean water \nprograms combined without ever assessing if this is the best place to \ndevote funds.\n  To me, this could be a serious problem for States where there is not \nstorm water. We have storm water problems in Missouri. We just need the \nflexibility. We don't need a mandate. There are other States that do \nnot have storm water problems and they should not have to deal with it.\n  Another item that is important: Many of my colleagues will recall \nthat in 1974, specific Federal money for grade crossing safety was \nfirst established, the Rail/Highway Grade Crossing Safety Program. A \ndetermination was made by Congress that at least one-half of the funds \nprovided for the crossing program should be utilized for the \ninstallation of protective devices--flashing lights, gates, bells, and \nthe circuitry that operates these devices.\n  The rationale for these provisions was to assure that the constrained \nfunds made available by Congress would not just be ``saved'' to install \ncostly grade separations. Instead, Congress wanted to assure that the \nfunds would enhance safety in the broadest possible way through the \ninstallation and upgrade of crossing warning devices at many more \nlocations would be possible if the funds were reserved mostly for \ncrossing separations, particularly in rural areas of the country.\n  The committee adopted an amendment in markup that did three things. \nIt increased funding for the section 130 program from $100 million to \n$200 million. It included specific funding for other hazards and grade \nseparations. But it also eliminated the current law provision that \nrequires at least one-half of the section 130 funds be available for \nprotective devices.\n  In an effort to assure that the maximum level of safety be realized \nat the highest number of grade crossings throughout the United States, \nthe current law provision of section 130 that says at least one-half \nthe programs be used for protective devices I think should be restored \nto the program.\n  The section 130 program has a very credible safety performance \nrecord. When measured as a percentage of reduction in accident \nfatalities since its inception, the grade crossing program has been the \nmost effective highway safety program. This record of accomplishment \ncertainly justifies maintaining the existing programmatic structure of \nthe program. I hope the Senate will be willing to restore the current \nlaw requirement for one-half of the section 130 program for grade \ncrossing protective devices.\n\n  Let me just tell you my experience in Missouri. There are 3,879 \npublic highway/rail crossings and 3,011 private highway/rail crossings. \nOnly 1,629 of the public highway/rail crossings in Missouri are \nequipped with active warning devices, flashing light signals and/or \ngates--about 42 percent. The remaining 58 percent are referred to as \npassive crossings and are equipped with crossbuck signs only.\n  Missouri installed 212 active warning devices between 1997 and 2003 \nand spent nearly $24 million on these projects from section 130 funds.\n  Currently, the Highway/Rail Crossing Safety Program in Missouri is \nrequired by the Federal Highway Administration to spend $1,999,000 \nannually for protective devices and the same amount for hazard \nelimination. The protective device money can only be used to install \nlights, gates, signs, and/or pavement markings at highway/rail \ncrossings. The highway hazard funds have more flexibility to them and \ncan be used to build a grade separation, close a crossing, improve the \nroadway at or near a crossing closure in order to reroute traffic.\n  It is important to maintain funds in the hazard elimination category \nso our Department of Transportation and departments of transportation \naround the country can continue to work with local communities on \ncrossing closure projects and corridor projects.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to \naddress these vitally important programs. I see our other members, \nleadership members of the EPW committee, are here to address these \nissues.\n  With that, I will yield the floor and thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding we do not have \nanyone to speak on the highway bill. There are several people who \ndesire to speak on other matters. We will have no objection, although \nif we get back on the bill we would like to enjoy some type of \npriority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, actually my intention was to speak in \nfavor of the highway bill and compliment our colleagues for the \nconstruction of this legislation, but I did also want to comment on \nseveral other issues. I will be relatively brief. If others present \nthemselves to the Senate who wish to speak at length on the highway \nbill, I will accommodate that.\n  At a time when our economy has had a pretty tough time, the one \ncertain way to produce jobs is through a highway bill. This is the kind \nof legislation that invests in the infrastructure of our country, and \nwe know exactly its consequences. It produces jobs and it produces them \nvery quickly all across this country. The construction and the \nmaintenance of roads and bridges and the basic investment in \ninfrastructure in this country is a certain way not only to expand the \neconomy but to expand our job base.\n  In recent years, we have had a slowdown in the economy. Now we see \nwhat is called a ``recovery,'' but the recovery does not include a \nrecovery of U.S. jobs. That is a major deficiency and a serious \nproblem. I believe the legislation brought to the Senate today that \nwill be debated for some while dealing with a new highway bill is \nimportant legislation for this country.\n  At a time when we have record budget deficits, if we were really \nproducing an accounting system that worked the way it should work, most \nMembers of the Senate would recognize this bill is funded by money that \nis put in a trust fund. When people drive up to the gas pumps and fill \ntheir tank, they are paying an excise tax. There is a specific purpose \nfor this excise tax, and that is to improve the roads, bridges, and \ninfrastructure of the country. It is important to understand we raised \nthe money for this, by and large, through an excise tax.\n  I know there is debate about formulas and other issues, but, in my \njudgment, Senator Inhofe and Senator Jeffords have done extraordinary \nwork in bringing this bill to the Senate. I like the bill and intend to \nsupport the basic construct of what they have done.\n  While I mention this bill is largely paid for with excise taxes, the \ntax on gasoline and other similar excise taxes--when you fill up your \ntank you are paying a tax and expect that to be invested in America's \nroads and infrastructure--we have in the rest of Government, in a \nbudget released yesterday by the President, serious deficiencies.\n\n\n                         The President's Budget\n\n  Let me mention in the construct of discussing various spending \nissues, the budget released yesterday is a roadmap and a series of \nchoices by the President. I heard the President say last week before he \nreleased this budget that, with respect to Federal budget deficits, he \nneeded action by Congress. It is important to note that the budget \ndeficit requested by the President in his own submission yesterday was \nthe largest deficit in this country's history of budgets submitted by \nPresidents. This fiscal year, we are now told by the President and by \nhis own budget in this fiscal year, the budget deficit will be over \n$520 billion. That, clearly, is a failure of fiscal policy and a \nfailure of choices.\n  I have said repeatedly the President's construct of fiscal policy \njust does not add up. I come from a small town and a small school, but \nmathematics works the say same way in a small school or big school as \nin a big town or a small town: Two and two equals four. In budgets \nwhere we talk about trillions, two and two still equals four. We cannot \nincrease defense spending substantially, increase spending on homeland \nsecurity substantially, cut taxes again and again and again, and tell \nthe American people it will all work out; that we will just grow \nsufficiently; and it will all be just fine.\n  It is not all just fine. In the middle of all of this we ran into a \nrecession, an attack against this country on 9/11, the requirement to \nwage a war against terrorism. But then at the same time the\n\n[[Page S518]]\n\nPresident is saying, let's increase spending and let's cut our revenue.\n  The slowest member of my high school class would have understood \nwhere that ends up. It ends up in the largest deficits in history. The \n$520-plus billion deficit is, actually, by the way, a faulty number as \nwell because that is taking all the Social Security trust funds and \nusing them to show that number. The Social Security trust funds also \nbelong over here. They are required to pay for Social Security benefits \nin the future and they are being saved for that purpose, and we ought \nnot include them in this operating budget. For that reason, the current \nbudget deficit is somewhere around $660 billion this year. That is the \namount of money that our children and their children will be obligated \nto pay in the future.\n  There is an urgency and a seriousness that I don't see represented in \nthe budget the President sent to us yesterday. In his budget, he \nproposes a very large Federal budget deficit. But his budget also says, \nI will request zero spending for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. At \nthe moment, we know we spend $5 billion a month for operations in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, a little over $1.25 billion a week. Five billion a \nmonth is $60 billion a year. And what does the President say it will \ncost in this budget? Zero. So this budget is not an honest reflection \nof what he is going to spend, either.\n  Frankly, I don't understand that. I don't understand why a budget \ncomes with no plan to fix the serious and urgent problems and, in fact, \nwill miss the mark on what we will actually spend by well over $200 to \n$300 billion.\n  Last year at this time the President said he thought the Federal \nbudget deficit for the year we are in would be $307 billion. Well, it \nis not. It is well over $200 billion more than that 1 year later.\n  My point is, this is off the track and out of kilter. It needs \nleadership from the President and the Congress to fix it. It starts \nwith the first step, which is a budget document that honestly reflects \nwhat is going to happen to the best of our ability. The budget document \nsent to us, regrettably, is a political budget, not a budget document. \nWe need to do better than that.\n  On the issue of spending, I also want to discuss the February 2, Wall \nStreet Journal article, page 1, ``Halliburton Hits Snafu in Billing on \nKuwait.'' It says that as a contractor for the Federal Government, \nwhere the taxpayers pay the bill, Halliburton, was billing the \ntaxpayers for 42,042 meals every day but they were only serving 14,000 \nmeals a day. What is it called? A ``snafu.'' They are overbilling us by \n$16 million and it is called a snafu.\n  I am sorry, not in my hometown. This is either the sloppiest \naccounting in the world by a contractor that should not be doing the \nwork or it is cheating. One or the other. It is not a snafu.\n\n  The fact is, we are throwing money at these problems. We are \ncontracting with companies without bids, and the result is the American \npeople are being overcharged. This, too, is contributing to \noverspending and an increase in Federal budget deficits.\n  Let me make one more point about overspending and budgets. The one \narea in which the President recommended an increase in funding--I was \nsurprised, as I was looking through the small details, cuts in funding \nand things that affect Indian children's health, for example, or Indian \nchildren's education--the one area where the President recommended some \nincreased funding was in the wild horses and burros program. He \nactually put a few million extra in that program.\n  I was looking at that. We have 39,000 wild horses and burros, and I \nlike horses--by the way, I grew up raising horses--39,000 wild horses \nand burros. Do you know how much the program costs to maintain wild \nhorses and burros? Forty-one million dollars requested by the \nPresident. That is over $1,000 per horse or burro. They could have \ntheir own apartment in my hometown for that.\n  I don't understand. This is all about choices and priorities. I just \npulled one little issue where increased spending exists, wild horses \nand burros.\n\n\n  The Food and Drug Administration and the Cost of Prescription Drugs\n\n  Mr. President, let me finally make a point about something that was \nannounced in the last 2 days by the Food and Drug Administration. While \nthis does not relate to the Federal budget, it relates to the budget of \nevery American dealing with the cost of the price of prescription \ndrugs.\n  The Food and Drug Administration campaign to warn against Canadian \ndrugs. It says: ``Next week the FDA will begin a campaign saying it is \ndangerous to import drugs from Canada.''\n  I am sorry, this is the Food and Drug Administration which is \nsupposed to be a regulatory agency. It is supposed to regulate, not \nrepresent, the pharmaceutical industry. Yet here we have the FDA doing \nall it can to try to tell the American people that importing \nprescription drugs from Canada is unsafe. It is total nonsense.\n  The Canadians have the same chain of custody as we do. The same pill, \nput in the same bottle, made by the same company, is sent to a pharmacy \nin Winnipeg and is sent to a pharmacy in Pembina, ND. The pills are not \ndifferent because they are identical, both FDA approved; the difference \nis price. And often the American is paying double, triple, or 10 times \nthe price that is charged in Canada.\n  We pay the highest prices in the world, and it is unfair. Those of us \nwho are developing plans by which we would have our pharmacists or our \nconsumers access the identical prescription drug for a much lower price \nfrom Canada are now confronting the FDA, which seems to be working full \ntime for the pharmaceutical industry.\n  I wish Mr. McClellan would take a look at his job description because \nthere is not any way on Earth he can describe a system in which--for \nexample, in the one I propose, North Dakota pharmacists, in a pilot \nproject, buying from licensed pharmacists in Canada FDA-approved \ndrugs--there is not any way the FDA can credibly suggest there is a \nsafety issue. There is no way they can credibly suggest that. Now, they \nmay try, but if they do, they are not being honest with the American \npeople.\n\n\n     The 9/11 Commission and an Independent Commission to Evaluate \n                    Intelligence with Regard to Iraq\n\n  Finally--I know my colleagues are waiting to speak--I want to mention \ntwo things about commissions. The 9/11 commission is now meeting. It \nhas a May deadline. That needs to be extended. It has had to issue \nsubpoenas to this administration to get information from the \nadministration about events prior to 9/11. What on Earth could people \nin the administration be thinking about requiring the issuance of \nsubpoenas to get them to cooperate?\n  Besides the issue of subpoenas, they still have not gotten adequate \ncooperation from the White House for interviews and information they \nwant. I believe the time for the commission ought to be extended. I \nalso believe the administration ought to comply fully with all the \nrequests for information immediately. I do not, for the life of me, \nunderstand why an independent commission investigating 9/11 and the \ninformation that led up to it should have any problem getting any \ninformation from anyone in this Government. It makes no sense to me.\n  And finally, the issue of an independent commission to evaluate the \nintelligence with respect to Iraq. Mr. Kay, the former chief weapons \ninspector, says our intelligence community failed, failed the \nPresident. He should have said failed the Senate, failed the Congress, \nfailed the American people. What happened?\n  The President is suggesting an independent commission that he \nappoints. I do not support that. I do not think the executive branch \nshould or could investigate itself, even with a commission they \ndetermined independent, especially when they select the commission.\n  There should be an independent commission as a matter of Federal law, \nand this Congress ought to pass legislation that authorizes it and \nfunds it. And we ought to do so soon. The safety and security of this \ncountry depends on good intelligence.\n  We are told by Mr. Kay that the intelligence community has failed \nthis country. We need to urgently get to the bottom of it.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say later. The Senate, I believe, \nis on an abbreviated schedule today for a number of reasons. I know my \ncolleague, Senator Kennedy, wishes to speak, so I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n[[Page S519]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                       Education and Health Care\n\n  Mr. President, I want to make a brief comment about the impact of the \nbudget in two important areas; that is, how it relates to the education \nof the children in this country and, secondly, how it relates to the \nissues of health care and health care coverage.\n  Just about every age group will be hurt by this budget. This budget \nhurts children, hurts our economy, and I believe, it hurts our \ndemocracy.\n  The latest Bush budget does not help young children start school \nready to learn. It does not fund public school reform and improvement. \nIt does not extend college opportunity. It does not train workers for \nnew jobs that are needed because of the Bush Administration's poor \nstewardship of this economy.\n  For young children and parents, the President's budget cuts the very \nsound Even Start literacy program. This program helps not only children \nlearn to read but it helps their parents learn to read. By helping \npreviously illiterate or barely literate parents and children learn to \nread at the same time, you see a quantum increase in both groups' \nacademic achievement and accomplishment. It has been one of the most \nsuccessful programs we have in terms of expanding literacy in this \ncountry. That program is eliminated by the Bush budget.\n  Over 1 million children and parents will not get Even Start literacy \ntraining under the Bush budget. For children in grade school, once \nagain, the President has reneged on his pledge to leave no child \nbehind. This budget leaves over 4.6 million children behind. They will \nnot get better teachers or smaller classes or after-school help they \nwere promised.\n  In fact, every year President Bush has been in office, he has \nshortchanged by greater and greater amounts his promise to fund the No \nChild Left Behind Act.\n  In 2002, President Bush shortchanged No Child Left Behind by $4.2 \nbillion; in 2003, $5.4 billion; in 2004 by $7.6 billion; and this year \nby $9.4 billion. In total, President Bush has broken his No Child Left \nBehind promise by over $26 billion since the day it was signed into \nlaw.\n  That law provided reform in the education of our K through 12th \ngrades. But what we understood when we passed the law was that if we \nwere going to have reform in our education system we had to fund it. \nThat was what was at the heart of the No Child Left Behind Act, the \nconcept of resources for school reform and improvement, and why it had \nvery broad bipartisan support.\n  If we had reform, in terms of better trained teachers and after-\nschool programs that provided supplementary services, curriculum \nreforms, and the range of different types of parental involvement, and \nthe kind of help and assistance for those needy schools that needed \nhelp and assistance, it was going to require resources to bring the 9 \nmillion children, who are the children who are basically the target of \nNo Child Left Behind, up to proficiency over a 12-year period, and all \nof them had to be included.\n  That was the agreement. That is why we spent a good deal of time in \nthose negotiations working out what was going to be actually the \nauthorization, because we knew those funds were going to be necessary \nto be able to achieve those kinds of reforms. We find out now it has \nbeen $26 billion short since the time that law was signed.\n  This budget eliminates 38 different education programs. It eliminates \nthe gifted and talented education. It eliminates the dropout prevention \nprograms. We have schools in this country where they have 30 or 40 or \neven 50 percent of their children who drop out between the 8th grade \nand the 12th grade. It is even higher in a number of different schools \nthat I know about. We have about 540,000 children who drop out every \nsingle year.\n  The attempt in terms of No Child Left Behind Act was to try to reach \nout and find these children and move them back into the education \nsystem. When you eliminate any of the dropout prevention programs, you \nare basically giving up on hundreds of thousands of children. We know \nwhat happens to these children if they are not challenged or helped or \nassisted or given a helping hand to get back into the education system.\n  One of the most successful new ideas in education has been in the \nareas where you have very large schools, to try and break those schools \ndown to create smaller schools within the larger schools. It has been \nextraordinarily successful.\n  I visited those schools myself in a number of cities in this country. \nI can remember visiting them in Chicago, as well as in my own city of \nBoston. We have seen the difference that has made in terms of moving \ninto what we call the ``smaller schools,'' which get smaller class \nsizes, more intensive kinds of relationships between the teachers and \nthese children. We have seen it has demonstrated to have a marked \nimprovement in terms of academic achievement and accomplishment. \nDespite all the research on the value of small schools, President Bush \nwants to eliminate support for smaller learning communities. It just \ndoesn't make sense.\n  Another program which has had a very significant success has been the \nStar Schools Program. What we recognized in many States, even including \nmy own, when the State budget is cramped, it is difficult enough to get \na well-trained teacher in physics or in the more advanced science \nareas. Nonetheless, you will have some very gifted and talented \nchildren in that school who have an aptitude for math or for science, \nand the Star Schools Program basically said, with the establishment in \nthe school of what it costs--approximately $1,500 for a receptor--you \nhave a very highly trained educator who teaches those children by \ndistance learning.\n  They can teach 2,000 or 3,000 children and provide help to maybe a \nhandful of children in a particular school district who have a great \naptitude in math and science but do not have the kind of academic \nteacher who can help them. The Star Schools Program has been invaluable \nin many different parts of the country. The technology reviews have \nshown that these children can learn almost as well with this kind of \ninstruction as they can with a teacher in front of them. That program \nhas effectively been eliminated.\n  For the college students, I refer to the Department of Education \nFiscal Year 2005 Budget Summary. Since this President took office, \npublic college tuition is up 26 percent, according to the College \nBoard. Yet the Bush budget provides zero increase for Pell Grant \nstudent aid. On page 52 of the Administration's Education Budget \nSummary, it says, Pell grants: 2003, $4,050; 2004, $4,050; 2005, \n$4,050. That zero increase in the face of rising tuition. No help. The \naverage income of a Pell recipient is $15,000. These are gifted, \ntalented, hard-working young people who can get into any school, any \ncollege in the country, who have to struggle by nature and by \ncircumstances. That Pell grant has been a lifeline to them in terms of \ntheir ability to go on to school and to college. And what is the answer \nof the administration to these young people: Go out and borrow more. \nSee what you can do with your repayments to the banks.\n  That is bad education policy, and it makes very little sense.\n  For those out of work or in jobs but seeking to upgrade their skills, \nthis budget adds $250 million for community college, but at the same \ntime the Bush administration has cut $900 million in job training \nprograms over the past three years. For similar programs, they are \ngoing to get $250 million, but with the other hand we're going to try \nto take $900 million. It just doesn't make sense.\n  So whether it is the very young children, whether it is the children \nwho are going K-12, whether it is the children who are going to \ncollege, or whether it is the men and women trying to get new job \ntraining, these programs, which I believe are a national priority, have \nbeen reduced.\n  If any one of my colleagues at any time went to any hall anyplace in \nAmerica and asked the American people how much out of a dollar of \nFederal money is being spent for education and what would they like it \nto be--I have done that several times--they will find out, after \nnational security, which is No. 1, they talk about Medicare and Social \nSecurity--that is right up there--and right after that comes education. \nThey hope it is 20 percent, 15 percent, 18 percent. Then when they\n\n[[Page S520]]\n\nfind out that it is about 2 percent, less than 2 percent and declining, \nthey are absolutely appalled. Not that money answers everything, but \nthe money is a reflection of a national priority.\n  This business about making choices, $2.4 trillion in this budget and \nshortchanging the investment in education of our children, that is what \nthis is. I would be glad to debate it in very considerable detail with \nany of my colleagues and will at any time.\n  I want to add a word with regard to the health care situation, the \ngeneral concerns that I find in traveling around my own State. People \nare concerned primarily by two issues. One is the cost of health care \nand the other is whether they can find affordable coverage in health \ncare insurance.\n  There is virtually nothing in this budget in terms of controlling \ncost. We gave up a great opportunity when we passed the alleged \nMedicare reform bill to permit the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to actually negotiate with the drug companies like the \nVeterans' Administration can to bring lower costs to our seniors. But \nthat proposal was rejected by the administration and by the Republican \nmajority. As a result, we have seen the continued escalation of cost, \nand costs will continue to rise. There is virtually nothing in this \nlegislation to do anything about getting a handle on health care costs.\n  And with regard to health insurance coverage, we see we have cut \nMedicaid. A million people who qualify for Medicaid are going to be off \nMedicaid. Half of those are going to be children, the poorest of the \npoor. A half a million are going to be without the Medicaid coverage \nthat provides very good coverage for the children. National priorities? \nThere are close to a trillion dollars in tax breaks in this budget, but \ndenying Medicaid coverage to 500,000 children, the neediest of the \nchildren, that is a matter of choice.\n\n  We will have a chance to debate it. We are now just talking about \nwhat is in the President's proposal.\n  The insurance industry and the trade associations did very well in \nthe budget. Health savings accounts will benefit, which are products of \nthe insurance companies. Health savings accounts get about $24 billion \nover a 10-year period with the initiative in this budget. Association \nhealth plans will do very well for the trade associations, even though \nthose plans will mean an increase in the cost of premiums for health \ninsurance for others. Then we have the proposal for tax credits for \nhealth insurance. That is really some proposal. The budget includes a \nproposal to give a $1,000 tax credit for health insurance to an \nindividual--but the coverage actually costs $4,000. The budget also \nproposes giving families a $3,000 credit, but a family policy costs \nnearly $10,000. That is like throwing someone who is in the river \nneeding help a 4-foot line, when they need a 10-foot line to save them. \nJust try to find a family health insurance policy that is worthy of its \nname for $3,000 in this country. We know that is completely \nunrealistic.\n  Finally, when we talk about fighting disease, take AIDS or TB, there \nis a cut of some $356 million for CDC. Two major bioterrorism programs \nhave been cut $144 million. These programs provide the assistance to \ncontain a bioterrorist attack locally. You need the initial help to the \nprimary responders, who are police and firefighters and nurses. Then \nyou need to contain a disease outbreak. For that, we need to help our \nhospitals and our other health clinics in order to contain disease \noutbreaks so they do not spread. That is particularly important, as \nanybody who has listened to the experts on bioterrorism will tell you. \nThose programs have been seriously cut.\n  Then the most amazing reduction is the CDC cut, $364 million, when we \nare confronting the danger of SARS, Ebola, other dangers that come from \ncountries all over the world.\n  Under Dr. Gerberding, who has been an outstanding public servant at \nthe Centers for Disease Control, CDC has been extraordinary in \nprotecting the American people and people all over the world. The \nbudget provides a reduction in support for the CDC. We are having a \nhearing in our committee on mad cow disease, in the HELP Committee this \nweek. You name it, there is another disease that comes from overseas \nevery day, and our front line of defense is the CDC. They have some of \nthe most talented experts in the world in that agency, and the budget \nundermines it in a significant way. It makes no sense.\n  We will have a chance to debate these issues later as we consider the \nfull budget. For the average American, who is concerned about their \njob--and they are concerned about their jobs because they find out, \nwith all of the uncertainty about our economy, that they lose their job \nand they know if they are able to find another job, they will be paid \nabout 22 percent less, average, nationwide than the job they are \nholding--if they are able to find one. They are uncertain about their \njobs, and they are uncertain about what is happening in schools with \ntheir children. This budget does little about that uncertainty. They \nare uncertain whether they will be able to save enough to send their \nchildren to college. That is because of the proposals of the \nadministration to eliminate overtime.\n  We have to understand the amount that is earned on overtime has been \nused day in and day out to pay tuition for working families for their \nchildren who go to college, or to pay a mortgage. So people are worried \nabout the economy. They are worried, if they are unemployed, that their \nunemployment insurance has been lost. They are worried about that. If \nthey are among the 1 in 7 Americans who are making the minimum wage, \nthey realize they haven't gotten any increase in the last 7 years. \nWhere is anything about that, or anything about education, or anything \nabout health care for the children? It has been missing in that budget. \nBut the trillion dollar tax break for the wealthy is included. It is \nthe wrong priority.\n  The American people are going to reflect on these misguided \npriorities as they watch our votes when we debate the budget in the \nSenate. If they don't do it then, they will do it in November.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I spoke earlier to the Senator from \nOklahoma and he indicated one of his colleagues, the Senator from \nPennsylvania, may be coming to the floor, and perhaps also the Senator \nfrom Arizona. I wanted to defer to them because we want to go back and \nforth.\n  Mr. INHOFE. He is in the cloakroom. May I inquire about how much time \nthe Senator from Illinois would like to have?\n  Mr. DURBIN. About 20 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. We will go back into a quorum call, then, until the \nSenator from Pennsylvania arrives.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is fine. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe pending highway bill, and also to offer legislation on the \nAbandoned Mine Reclamation Program Extension Reform Act of 2004.\n  The highway bill is pending, and tomorrow Secretary of the Interior \nNorton will be in Harrisburg to announce the President's program. The \nadministration has made available this statute for introduction which \nshould be done on a timely basis this afternoon since there will not be \nmorning business tomorrow because of the Joint Meeting of Congress.\n  First, my comments are directed toward the highway bill. Yesterday, I \nvoted against cloture--that is, voted against cutting off debate--\nbecause of my view that there ought to be more consideration to the \nbill before we proceed to take up the bill itself.\n  I am concerned about the total cost of the bill in light of the \nposition of President Bush's administration where there have been \nconcerns raised about\n\n[[Page S521]]\n\nthe total cost because we are facing such a large deficit this year. I \ndo believe that infrastructure--highway construction, mass transit, and \nbridge repairs--is indispensable for economic growth and economic \ndevelopment, but in the very complex Federal budget all of these \nmatters have to be prioritized.\n  We are looking at a budget next year of $2.4 trillion, where there is \na projected increase of close to 10 percent--9.7 percent--for homeland \ndefense, 7 percent for the Department of Defense, and less than 1 \npercent for discretionary spending.\n  I am concerned about where we are heading on all of those lines, with \nvery heavy emphasis of concern about a deficit which is projected in \nexcess of $500 billion.\n  We faced these problems in the past. I am in my 24th year in the \nSenate, and it is not unusual for us to be facing very difficult \nproblems. Two years ago, we did not even have a budget resolution, a \nmatter of some considerable concern on the political scales where the \nDemocrats were in control and we did not have a budget. Last year, we \nhad major problems in the appropriations process. As it is well known, \nwe did not pass the omnibus bill until last month. So we are not \nunaccustomed to having major problems as we look forward to the budget.\n  I am comforted by the famous words of Winston Churchill that somehow \nwe always muddle through and that democracy--paraphrasing Churchill \nagain--is a terrible system except compared to all others. I believe we \nwill be able to work through the budget problems we have.\n  Notwithstanding the economic problems, we now see an upturn, and I \nthink we are heading for better days on the economy. I think that will \nhave a very profound effect on the deficit in the long run. It is \ndifficult to realize, or surprising, perhaps I should say, that less \nthan 3 years ago we were projecting a $5.6 trillion surplus in 10 years \nand we were talking about paying off the national debt. Then an \neconomic downturn, facing two wars--one against al-Qaida and one in \nIraq--we have had very substantial problems. But we have a very \nproductive country, we have a great work ethic, and I think we will \nhave an economic rebound. I think that will have a very profound effect \non easing the difficulties of the deficit.\n  Notwithstanding those factors, we are looking at a tough deficit, and \nI think more consideration needs to be given on this bill as to how we \nare going to face the overall problems and establish priorities.\n  With respect to the allocations in this bill, I believe that my \nState, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is not being dealt with \nappropriately, not being dealt with fairly. My colleague, Senator \nSantorum, and I wrote to the distinguished chairman of the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works on January 28 listing the concerns we \nhave. I realize there has not been sufficient time for the chairman to \nrespond to this letter, but that is part of the concern.\n  Senator Santorum and I wrote this letter as soon as we could after we \nknew what was in the highway bill and knew how Pennsylvania was going \nto be treated. Again, I am not unaware that it is a very difficult \nmatter to make allocations among 50 States and it is not possible to \nsatisfy everyone. I have heard quite a number of my colleagues express \nconcerns that their States were not being appropriately treated. But I \nbelieve that when the facts are analyzed, Pennsylvania ought to have \nmore of a share of this highway bill, or even more of a share of a \nreduced highway bill, if the bill were to be pared down to come within \nthe confines of what the President has in mind for the highway bill.\n\n  The allocation that Pennsylvania has is the fourth lowest increase, \nan increase of 19.54 percent over the 6 years. With that limited \nincrease, Pennsylvania will not even be able to keep up with inflation.\n  Pennsylvania has a very extensive highway system. It is the fourth \nlargest highway system among the 50 States. It has some 40,500 miles of \nState highway, totaling more highway miles than New York and New \nEngland combined. It has some 25,000 bridges, and the highway system in \nPennsylvania--a frost belt State, an older State by contrast with the \nexpansion of the South and the West--has found the highways very \nheavily used and subject to very difficult weather conditions.\n  Eighty-eight percent of the nearly $300 billion worth of goods \ndelivered from inside Pennsylvania each year arrive on the State's \nhighways. Pennsylvania's highways are the prime routes for delivering \ngoods imported from ports across the mid-Atlantic region.\n  We have many interstate highways. When calculating the appropriate \nshare of highway funding, due consideration ought to be given to the \nusage of the highways. If you take some States and areas--Florida, for \nexample, or Maine, or the State of Washington, or southern California--\nthose areas are not as heavily transited. But Pennsylvania has major \ninterstates both east-west and north-south: Routes 80 and 90, Route \n480, Routes 95, 81, 79, 83, in addition to a vast complex of highways \nacross the State.\n  It is my view that Pennsylvania ought to have a higher allocation and \nought not to be limited to an allocation which will be less than the \ninflation rate over 6 years.\n  There has been some justification offered on the basis of the \ncontention that Pennsylvania had a very large share in the past when \nCongressman Bud Shuster was the Chairman of the House Transportation \nand Infrastructure Committee. It is certainly true that the ways of the \nHouse and the ways of the Senate accord some special consideration for \npeople who are chairmen, who can establish the mark, but I do not think \nthat Chairman Shuster's departure from the House of Representatives \nought to be used as the basis for saying Pennsylvania ought to be \nreduced in its share.\n  When one takes a look at the allocation for Pennsylvania, the rate of \nincrease is the fourth lowest among the 50 States. Nobody can deny that \nPennsylvania ranks very high among the States which service the \ncountry. Traffic coming from the west coast goes through Pennsylvania; \nsome of it on the Pennsylvania Turnpike but a great deal of it on \nInterstate 80, some on Interstate 90. There is tremendous traffic north \nto south on Interstate 81, and I-95 is a major highway transiting the \neast coast.\n  It is my hope that before this bill is finished we can have an \nadjustment. I know other Senators are equally concerned as am I. The \nvote I cast against cloture to cut off debate yesterday was in the \nnature of a protest vote. I had no illusions in casting the vote. I did \nso late in the proceeding when the requisite 60 votes had already been \nachieved for cloture, so there was no doubt that my vote was not going \nto be determinative or influential. The cloture was going to be \nimposed.\n  I have heard many complaints from my constituents who are very \ndissatisfied with the allocation both as to highways, which affects \nbridges as well, and transit. I cast that protest vote. I still think \nwe ought to be considering both of those factors. One factor is what is \nthe appropriate priority taking into account the views of President \nBush on the increase in expenditures on this bill over what had been \nallocated or what has been considered appropriate by the President and \nfactoring in the priorities we have on the budget which we are now \nconsidering. I hope yet to be able to support this bill, but I am not \ngoing to support a bill which does not treat my State fairly.\n  My vote and the votes of others who have similar views may not be \ndispositive because there is great public interest in this bill as a \njobs bill, very important on the infrastructure to facilitate transit \nboth on the rail lines and on the highways. But fair is fair and I \nthink there have to be some significant modifications to the total \namount of this bill, the priorities established, and how Pennsylvania \nis treated.\n  Mr. President, I believe I have already asked unanimous consent that \nthe text of the letter from Senator Santorum, Senator Inhofe, and \nmyself, dated January 28, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nthe comments I made on the highway bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S522]]\n\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 28, 2004.\n     Hon. James M. Inhofe,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Chairman Inhofe: We are writing to express our deep \n     concerns with the recently released highway funding formula \n     to be used in the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient \n     Transportation Equity Act of 2003 (SAFETEA) proposal. Were \n     this proposal to be enacted, it would have a significant \n     negative impact on Pennsylvania.\n       Pennsylvania is a key gateway connecting New England and \n     the Northeast to the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic. As such, our \n     roads are by no means limited to Pennsylvanians but are often \n     used by cars and trucks from around the country. Pennsylvania \n     has the fourth largest highway system among the 50 states, \n     with 25,000 bridges and 40,500 miles of state highway, \n     totaling more highway miles than New York and New England \n     combined. Furthermore, Pennsylvania's highways are the prime \n     routes for delivering goods imported from ports across the \n     Mid-Atlantic region. Truly, Pennsylvania is the ``Keystone \n     State'' when it comes to moving goods from East-to-West and \n     North-to-South in our region.\n       In addition to heavy use, the extreme weather conditions of \n     the Mid-Atlantic region have taken their toll on \n     Pennsylvania's highway system. 46 percent of the \n     Commonwealth's roads are in poor condition, while 42 percent \n     of the Commonwealth's bridges are structurally deficient. \n     Such conditions have a tremendous economic impact: driving on \n     Pennsylvania's roads in need of repair costs motorists $2.4 \n     billion each year in extra vehicle operating costs; traffic \n     accidents and fatalities cost Pennsylvania drivers an \n     additional $2.7 billion annually; and congestion leads to \n     costs totaling $2.3 billion per year.\n       Under your committee's proposal, Pennsylvania's funding \n     increases at the fourth lowest rate among all the states. It \n     is unlikely the proposed 19.54 percent increase over six \n     years will keep pace with inflation, amounting to a cut in \n     Pennsylvania's highway funding. Such meager levels do not \n     account for Pennsylvania's disproportionate needs.\n       In light of the infrastructure maintenance needs, \n     population, and geographic location of our commonwealth, we \n     find it completely unacceptable for Pennsylvania to be a \n     donor state in the final year (FY2009) of the SAFETEA program \n     and are convinced that the funding levels in other years are \n     insufficient in light of Pennsylvania's place in our national \n     highway network. While we will continue to work on highway \n     and transit issues and will likely be supportive of many \n     provisions in the SAFETEA bill, we could not support a final \n     SAFETEA bill that so unfairly shortchanges Pennsylvania.\n       We strongly believe that highway funding must be based in \n     large part on the impact each state's transportation system \n     has on its region and the nation and that a national highway \n     program should direct federal funding to national needs. We \n     welcome the opportunity to work with you to address this \n     matter so that Congress can enact positive federal \n     transportation policy this year.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n     Rick Santorum.\n\n  (The remarks of Mr. SPECTER pertaining to the introduction of S. 2049 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. In conclusion, I compliment the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Inhofe. I know how hard he has worked on this bill. \nI know how many people have come to him with concerns. That is one of \nthe vicissitudes of being a chairman. I get the same treatment when I \npost my bill on the subcommittee for Labor, Health, Human Services, and \nEducation and I post my bills on Veterans' Affairs.\n  I compliment Senator Inhofe and the ranking member, Senator Jeffords, \nfor what they have done here. It is a major matter, bringing a highway \nbill to the floor. It is my hope that, working together as Senator \nInhofe, Senator Jeffords, Senator Santorum, and I have always done, we \nwill be able to at least reconcile some of these concerns.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I listened with great interest. I think he \nhas some excellent points, I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania. He \nextensively quoted Churchill. I would like to add another quote to \nthat:\n\n       Truth is incontrovertible. Ignorance can deride it, panic \n     may resent it, malice may destroy it, but there it is.\n\n  I say that because there are some things--It is only natural when the \nSenator from Pennsylvania is not serving on the committee that he would \nnot be quite as familiar with the development of the formula as perhaps \nsomeone who is on the committee. So I would like to respond to a couple \nof points because I really believe we have a very fair formula.\n  First of all, the formula Congressman Shuster put together is the \nbasis for this bill. I happened to serve in the other body in the \ncommittee under Congressman Shuster back during the development of TEA-\n21. During that time, of course, he was pretty notorious getting a lot \nfor his State. I understand that. I should be more that way myself.\n  But I would only like to suggest--if staff would be good enough to \nhold this chart up--this is Pennsylvania. Over here, take 1384 in the \nred, that is the average amount for each year. If you took all 6 years \nin the TEA-21 and averaged them out, that would be the amount. That \nwould be $1.3 billion. Then, if you watch each year as it goes up, you \nend up with a substantially higher amount.\n  Let's compare that, if we may, with California. I saw an op-ed piece \nby the senior Senator from California in which she was very \ncomplimentary of the way this worked. If you look, you see they end up \nin almost the same place as Pennsylvania does percentage wise. But it \nall comes in the last year. That is because they are a donor State. In \norder for the large donor States to be able ultimately to reach 95 \npercent, it has to be done in the last year. I think we all understand \nthat.\n  But when you compare the two charts, I would say if she is satisfied, \nthen the Senator from Pennsylvania should be elated.\n  I would like to share one other thing, too. I chair the committee. If \nyou take the total amount of road miles that we have in Oklahoma \ncompared to Pennsylvania, it is almost the same, when you take out the \ntoll roads. Of course, we are not dealing with toll roads here.\n  With the same number of road miles, each year Pennsylvania gets 3.5 \ntimes as much as Oklahoma gets. If anyone should be complaining, using \nthat as a criterion, I should be the one.\n  I think it is very important you share with your constituents some of \nthe things that are in this bill and how well I believe Pennsylvania is \ntreated.\n\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania talked about bridges. According to the \nsurveys that have been taken by the Department of Transportation, \nOklahoma's bridges are No. 50 in the Nation--way behind Pennsylvania. \nThese are things that need to be corrected. Many of these things will \nbe corrected in this bill.\n  So I would only say formulas are very difficult. There is no magic \nformula that is going to make everyone happy. I remember the formulas \nin TEA-21 and ISTEA, and there were complaints from many States on \nthose. No formula is going to satisfy everyone, but I honestly believe, \nwhen I look at Pennsylvania and compare it to California or Oklahoma or \nsome of the other States, that they are very well cared for.\n  With that, I yield to any questions the Senator might have.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, just a comment or two. I did compliment \nthe Senator from Oklahoma, the distinguished chairman, for being so \nwell prepared. Perhaps he should have charts on all the States. I don't \nknow. Perhaps he would have charts on the States where you anticipate \ndifficulty or others on a comparative basis. But this Senator is not \nlikely to be satisfied, as a general matter, with what satisfies the \nSenator from California. I think if we check the voting records of \nSenator Inhofe and Senator Specter and the junior Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer, we will find Senator Inhofe and Senator Specter \non one side and Senator Boxer is on the other side a lot more times \nthan not.\n  So, I will take a look at the charts and I will take a look at the \nstatistics. I do agree with the chairman that it is a complex matter.\n  The first opportunity I have to review it is once I see the bill and \nI will make the analysis with California, and with Oklahoma. I have \nsome substantial familiarity with Oklahoma because I have traveled the \nhighways of Oklahoma a great deal. As the Senator from Oklahoma knows, \nI am a native of Kansas and went to the University of Oklahoma and \ndrove that highway from Wichita to Norman on many occasions. To my \nrecollection, it was a pretty good highway, but that has been a while \nago.\n  But I again complement the Senator from Oklahoma, the chairman, on \nhis\n\n[[Page S523]]\n\ndiligence, having the charts. We will take a very close look at it. The \nSenator from Oklahoma and I have worked together on many matters in the \nyears we have worked in the Senate together. We approach this in the \ninterests of our States, as we should, but also understanding the needs \nof other States.\n  We will try to come to at least some sort of accommodation as we work \nthrough the bill. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from \nPennsylvania. I in no way want him to misinterpret the comments I made \nas being critical of his analysis. Formulas are very difficult. TEA-21 \nis something we know was totally politically driven. That was a \npercentage of the total amount of money, so when they got up to 60 \nvotes they could just shut the door and say: Fine, we have our bill. We \ntried not to do that, take consideration of donor/donee status, fast-\ngrowing States.\n  By the way, you heard the senior Senator from Texas yesterday talking \nabout her dissatisfaction with what Texas was doing. When it gets down \nto it, under this formula or any other formula, if you do something for \na fast growing State that keeps bumping up against the ceiling, you are \ngoing to be having a problem. If you try to correct that, it is going \nto go into the donee States, of which of course Pennsylvania is one.\n\n  It is a difficult choice. We spent a whole year working on this and I \nhope you have a chance to really look at it closely.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I might ask the chairman, you say \nPennsylvania is a donee State? We are a donor State here in the final \nyear of your bill.\n  Mr. INHOFE. OK, in the first year, right now, you are a donee State.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We have been a donee State. If I hadn't been a donee \nState--for those who do not follow the terms, a donor is one who gives \nmore than the State receives. Senator Kyl is bowing. Arizona is in that \nstatus. A donee State is one which receives more than it contributes.\n  Had we really been a donee State throughout the six years of the \nbill--and I understand it was a slip of the tongue, or at least for 1 \nyear, not the whole projection. But had I been able to hold the \nchairman to donee status, I would have withdrawn all my remarks and \nstricken them from the Record.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I was referring to 2003, where it is a very substantial \ndonee State, recognizing it goes up and down.\n  By the way, Oklahoma has never been a donee State. Oklahoma was \nbumped against the ceilings: 73 percent, 80 percent, and then 90.5 \npercent, and of course we are looking forward to getting up to 95 \npercent, as I am sure the Senator from Arizona is going to share that \nenthusiasm.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Oklahoma makes up for donee status with \nits football team.\n  Mr. INHOFE. On occasions, yes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. When you comment about Pennsylvania being a donee State, \nthat is for the existing bill, not the entirety of the one we are \nvoting on now. We are a donor State in the last year, which is the \nreason for my exchange. I think the exchange has been useful. I see \nSenators waiting.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Penn State and the University of Oklahoma \nhave had their share of victories and now it is time for somebody else \nto have their fair share.\n  I appreciate the hard work of the chairman, the Senator from \nOklahoma. I make it very clear I join those who recognize the need for \nimprovement of our highways. There is not a road in my State that could \nnot stand some improvement. As a very fast growing State, Arizona needs \nto add to our highway miles.\n  I appreciate the fact that there is a need to create jobs, and \nhighway construction certainly can help to create jobs in this country. \nHowever, it has always been the case that we prioritized because \nMembers would literally ask for everything they could possibly get in \nthe way of funding for their States. We have had to set limits. There \nis, after all, a limit on the amount of Federal revenue available for \nall good projects. Certainly, highways are no more important than \neducation or health care or national defense or many of the other \ncategories which also compete for the Federal dollar.\n  So while we acknowledge there is a need for a highway bill and that \ncan have some jobs benefits, that should not be the driving force in \nterms of the competition with dollars for other worthwhile projects. We \nhave to set a limit, particularly in this case where we have over a \nhalf trillion dollar deficit, according to the OMB; we have to be clear \nwe do not spend more than we are taking in.\n  The reason this is a bad bill, and why I oppose it, first, it spends \nfar too much money. Second, it spends more money than we collect in \nrevenues from the gas tax. Third, it is very unfair to States such as \nmine, which are donor States. Arizona has always contributed far more \nthan it has gotten back, and under this bill that gets even worse for \nthe next 5 years.\n  Let me discuss each of those items very briefly. We start from the \npremise that we do need highways. We also have a huge budget deficit. \nTherefore, we have to clearly be sensitive about the kind of bill we \npass. In this regard, the Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary Snow, \nand the Secretary of Transportation, Secretary Mineta, yesterday \nnotified the Senate that they would recommend a veto of this bill if it \nraises the gas tax or other Federal taxes or draws money from the \ngeneral fund. They wrote that the bill ``should not use any mechanism \nthat conceals the true costs to Federal taxpayers. Highway spending \nshould be financed from the highway trust fund, not the general fund of \nthe Treasury.''\n  The bill before the Senate violates this principle in a significant \namount, by billions of dollars. Therefore, if my Senate colleagues \ninsist on going down the road of passing a bill that violates the \nprinciples that the President has laid out, we risk having the \nPresident veto this bill. At a time when we have this large Federal \nbudget deficit, it seems to me we ought to be joining with the \nPresident in trying to prioritize our spending and constraining it to \nat least the amount of revenue we take in, a balanced budget approach. \nThat is the way we have done it in the past, and that is the way we \nshould do it now.\n  Just the highway portion--and I make it clear there is a mass transit \nportion of this bill that has not gotten out of the committee of \njurisdiction, the Banking Committee, and in terms of funding it is in \nthe neighborhood of $50 billion; it could be more or less and I do not \nmean to be tied to a specific figure, $49 billion or 50 billion; I will \nleave that part out of the discussion because that part is not complete \nuntil we know the actual numbers--but the highway portion, the amount \nthe Federal Government has to spend over the next 6 years, is $231 \nbillion. This is what the Bond-Reid amendment from last year in the \nbudget resolution called for the Senate to fund. The House is looking \nat a number far higher than this. I even heard today that some people \nin the administration are looking at a number above this.\n\n  In any event, the number that the Finance Committee yesterday raised \nrevenue for was $231 billion. I sit on the Finance Committee and our \njob is to try to figure out what kind of revenues we are getting, and \ntherefore, whether we could pay for $231 billion of highway funding. \nWhat we learned was that the gas tax, the use tax, that funds highway \nconstruction, is only going to bring in $196 billion during that same \nperiod of time. So the bill that the Senate said we should try to fund \nexceeds the amount of revenues by $35 billion.\n  Now, there are four choices. We can reduce the amount we had hoped to \nbe able to spend last year when we did not have this big Federal budget \ndeficit number staring us in the face, and now that we know the size of \nthe deficit, acknowledge that we were just a little bit too optimistic \nlast year; we were a little bit too forward leaning, shall we say, and \ntrim back to suit the revenues that we are actually going to be \ncollecting. That is the first thing we could do. That is what we should \ndo and what any family would have to do.\n  Because we are the Federal Government, we could raise taxes to make \nup that difference. I don't think that will happen. The President says \nhe would veto the bill if that happened.\n  We could just go into greater deficit. But on both sides of the aisle \nI think\n\n[[Page S524]]\n\nthat would be met with great opposition. We do not want to increase the \nsize of our Federal budget deficit.\n  That leaves the other alternative, and that is to take money from \nother areas in the budget and apply it to highways, to take general \nrevenue funds, funds that might be spent on defense or homeland \nsecurity or education or medical care, for example, to take that money \naway from those programs and spend it on highways instead. That is what \nis being proposed.\n  But it gets worse because the effort that is undertaken here is to \nconfuse the American taxpayer into thinking that it is highway-related \nrevenues. It is not. What the Finance Committee concluded yesterday was \nthat we could legitimately come up with--and I acknowledge this and \nhope to construct the addition of the funds--that we could come up with \nabout $214 billion in revenues that was, in fact, legitimately \nconnected, money that was connected to highways or to the trust fund.\n  For example, there is $196 billion from gas taxes. There is an \nargument that we should be able to count the interest earned on the \ntrust fund balances as part of the trust fund that is currently \ndeposited in the general fund. Most would say that we can legitimately \ntransfer that from the general fund and put it into the trust fund and \ncall that trust fund money, and I agree with that.\n  I will not get into detail, but there are four or five other areas \nlike that. Some might be a little questionable in some people's eyes, \nbut at least in my view, you could justify $214 billion in revenues, in \nreal money, being transferred from the general fund to the trust fund, \nbut which we could legitimately contend should not belong in the \ngeneral fund, it should belong in the highway trust fund. That is $214 \nbillion. That leaves a $17 billion deficit. That is just on the amount \nwe were trying to mark up of $231 billion.\n\n  So how do we make up the other $17 billion? By sleight of hand, which \nis why I voted against the bill. We came up with phony money, money \nthat does not really exist but which, for the purposes of paying for \nthis bill, we are going to count in an accounting technique.\n  There are two key pieces: one $9 billion and the other $8 billion. \nThe $9 billion fund comes from something called the ethanol exemption. \nThe gas tax is 18.4 cents but for ethanol we give a 5.2-cents-per-\ngallon exemption. We say you do not have to pay that tax. The Finance \nCommittee bill proposes to convert this exemption into a tax credit. \nBut under the new system, even if the money comes in, it will be sent \nright back to the taxpayer when they seek a refund for it, when they \nseek to apply for the ethanol tax credit, so the net result is that, \neven though the Government may collect the money for an instant, it \ngoes right back to the taxpayer who paid it and there is no money, \nthen, to be put in the highway trust fund. So what we have is the \nGovernment will collect 5.2 cents it does not currently collect, it \nwill theoretically send that to the taxpayer, and as soon as the \ntaxpayers ask for the refund of the credit, the general fund of the \nTreasury sends the money back. So no new money has been raised. We \ncollected it; we gave it back. But in the meantime, through an \naccounting gimmick, we say that the trust fund is 5.2-cents-per-gallon \nricher. And that amounts to $9 billion over this 6-year period of \ntime. But there is no new money. So that is fraudulent. It is wrong for \nus to suggest we are actually paying with real money for that part of \nthis bill.\n\n  The other is called the fuel tax exemption, and it relates to an \nexemption that is provided to tax-exempt entities, such as cities and \nStates and schools and churches. They do not pay the gas tax. They \nreceive either a full or a partial exemption from the gas tax.\n  So the Finance Committee bill just credits the highway trust fund as \nif it had received those taxes, even though the funds will never have \nactually been received. That is $8 billion over 6 years. It reminds me \nof that old riddle Abe Lincoln used to ask. He said: If you call a tail \na leg, how many legs does a dog have? And he would always fool the \nkids, and they would say five. And he would say: No, four. Calling it a \nleg doesn't make it a leg.\n  Well, calling this money part of the trust fund does not make it part \nof the trust fund because it is not ever going to be collected. It is \nan accounting gimmick. So when the Secretary of Transportation and the \nSecretary of Treasury write in the letter that they are going to \nrecommend a veto of the bill if it uses mechanisms that conceal the \ntrue cost to the Federal taxpayers--they go on to say: Highway spending \nshould be financed from the highway trust fund, not the general fund of \nthe Treasury--I think this is exactly the kind of thing they had in \nmind.\n  How does the General Treasury make up this $17 billion? You cannot \npay for highway construction with fake money. You have to pay with real \nmoney. So you take that money out of the general fund and you somehow \nhave to make that up in the general fund. Do they make it up with a \nhighway user fund or fee? No. Instead, there are a series of tax \nchanges that have nothing to do with highways. Some close down abusive \ncorporate tax shelters, the kind that Enron had used. And there are \nsome other kinds of changes like that--nothing that has anything to do \nwith transportation or highways. Some of these tax changes, by the way, \nare actually good tax changes and, in fact, we should make the changes, \nbut they should be used to fund other things in general revenue that \nare traditionally funded by such mechanisms. They should not be \ntransferred from the general fund to the highway trust fund, thus \nbreaking a precedent that has held ever since the beginning of highway \ntransportation.\n  My view is we should be very clear that by breaking this precedent, \nby using the general fund against what the Secretary of Treasury warned \nus, that we would be opening up the possibility that the highway fund \nor highway spending would be basically unconstrained by any mechanism \nwhatsoever. It would be a honeypot of projects and ways for Members to \ngo home and brag about how much they brought home to their States or \ntheir districts with no financial constraint because no longer would it \nbe pegged to the amount of revenues we received through the user fees, \nfrom the people who actually used the highways.\n  So if we go down this road, I think there will be no end to the claim \nwe will make on general revenues for highway projects. And I think it \nis a very bad precedent for us to undertake.\n  So, first of all, we are spending too much money. Secondly, we are \nnot funding it in the proper way. We are now going to be spending \ngeneral revenues to fund the deficit.\n  The third thing I want to say is that this is not fair to some \nStates. You might imagine that one of them is my State. I am going to \ndescribe this very briefly. And with the indulgence of the chairman of \nthe committee, since our offices are closed down right now, I do not \nhave access to the specific information which I wanted to bring to the \nfloor. I am going to say this generally, and then, when we have access \nto that data, I will come back to the floor with the specific \ninformation.\n  But a bit of history: Arizona has always been a donor State, meaning \nthat Arizonans send a dollar in tax revenue for highways to Washington, \nand we get back 70, 80 cents. In the last few years, we have gotten \n90.5 cents. Just a few years ago that was 83 cents, as I recall.\n  A lot of the donor States put their foot down and said: Look, we, at \nleast, ought to get 90 percent of what we send. And that is when the \n90.5 cents was put into effect. Arizona is a fast-growing State, the \nfastest growing State in the Union. We have huge new infrastructure \nneeds, including highways. We have large areas of Federal land. Only 12 \npercent of the land in our State is privately owned. The rest is owned \nby a governmental entity. We have huge border infrastructure financing \nrequirements. We are now trying to build a new bridge over the Colorado \nRiver, below the Hoover Dam, with our sister State of Nevada. We have \nhuge expenses with our highways.\n  Yet instead of getting back an amount of money that would be \ncommensurate with those needs, Arizonans send a dollar to Washington \nand get back 90.5 cents.\n  When the debate about the new highway bill began, we had some thought \nthat perhaps we would finally get to\n\n[[Page S525]]\n\nthe point where we could be treated fairly relative to other States. \nBut, unfortunately, this was not to be the case. In a very general way, \nwhat happened was this: The Senator from Oklahoma, and others, with \nvery good intentions, said we want to try to bring all of the States we \npossibly can up to 95 cents on the dollar. And they set out to try to \ndo that.\n  But what they soon learned was there are some States with needs \ngrowing so rapidly, with populations growing so rapidly--States such as \nArizona, Texas, Colorado, Florida, the fastest growing States--these \nStates are growing so rapidly that it would cost a lot of money to be \nfair to them. In other words, we are behind the other States now. We \nare donor States, and to try to bring us up to parity with those States \nwould cost a lot of money because we are so far behind.\n  Now, if we had been treated fairly in the past, this would not be a \nproblem because, presumably, we would be like everybody else--right \naround the norm. But we have not been treated fairly in the past, which \nis why we are so far behind.\n  Now they are saying: Because you are so far behind, and it would cost \nso much to let you catch up, sorry, we are going to take care of \neverybody else, but you all have to stay that far behind for 5 more \nyears. That, I suggest, is not fair.\n  Now, it might have been fair to say to folks: Look, we can't get to \n95 cents on the dollar. Maybe we can get to 93.5 cents for all of the \nStates. I don't know what the exact number was--93, 94, perhaps, \nsomewhere in that neighborhood. If all the States had been brought up \nto the same level, then that might be where it is--92, 93, \n94, somewhere around in there. But, instead, they decided to go to 95 \ncents for most of the States, and then, for four or five of the States \nthey say: Sorry, we are not going to bring you up to speed for the \nfirst 5 years of this program. Perhaps in the sixth year we will try to \nget you to 95 cents.\n\n  Well, in the meantime, every one of those 5 years the gap will grow \nwider. And because our populations are growing, because our \ninfrastructure needs are increasing disproportionately to these other \nStates, because we have been behind for so many years--and, therefore, \nhave a backlog that a lot of the other States do not have--instead of \ngradually being brought up to where the other States are, we are \nbasically being left in the dust. That is not fair.\n  Now, if you only do that to about five States, you can still \nguarantee your bill gets passed because you do not need their votes. \nThis is all about vote counting. This is the way the highway formula \nwas always developed. And I commend my good friend and colleague, the \nchairman of the committee, for noting the fact that in the past that is \nthe way the formula has been derived. That is why his State and mine \nand a lot of others suffered for a lot of years.\n  But I suggest that since there now seems to be a will to make things \nright--again, I commend him for that--that we should make it right for \neverybody, not just for those States where we can afford to make it \nright. In fact, I would argue that we really ought to start with those \nStates that have been on the short end of the stick all these years. We \nshould start with the States that are the furthest behind, start with \nthe States, such as Arizona, that have so much further to catch up.\n  If we have money to add to the amount of money that donor States get, \nwhy shouldn't we start with those States that have the biggest \npopulation growth and infrastructure needs and have received \nrelatively, therefore, the smallest amount of money in the past?\n  Well, I guess you only get 8, 10 votes out of those States, so we \nstart from a different premise. I do not think it is fair. That is the \nthird reason I have to oppose this bill and why my friends in Arizona \nare basically saying to me: We can understand why we have to spend more \nmoney on homeland security and fighting the war on terror and on \nfighting in Iraq, and so on. We can understand why there are some other \nbig needs that perhaps could get an increase in funding, such as \neducation and the Medicare prescription drug bill last year. But we \nwill be darned if we are willing to continue to send our money to \nWashington to be spent by other States when we have such large needs \nhere. And they basically tell us, because you have so many needs, we \ncannot afford to bring you up to speed with everybody else and, \ntherefore, you are going to have to wait 5 years.\n  I cannot go back to my friends in Arizona and say: Gee, I am sorry \nbut that is just the way it is in Washington; they expect me to do \nsomething about it.\n  So I hope my colleagues who support this bill will indulge me, and \nthose others, and put themselves in my place and ask what they would do \nif they were in this position and not give us too hard a time when we \nask questions that may be difficult and make sure that from a \nparliamentary point of view, we use all of the options we have to try \nto convince our colleagues the bill should be made more fair than it \nis.\n\n  I would be happy if all of us received less money by reducing the top \nnumber of this bill down to an amount we can afford, say $214 billion, \nor to simply reauthorize the existing spending levels for 1 year until \nwe can go back and get this formula right. I would favor either of \nthose two solutions today. I raised them both in the Finance Committee \nyesterday. Both were defeated. But I would opt for either one of those.\n  What I can't agree to is a bill that spends far too much money, funds \nit with general revenues for the first time, and is blatantly unfair to \nStates such as Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me say how much I always enjoy the \njunior Senator from Arizona. We were both elected to the other body in \nthe same year, 1986. We both came here to the Senate in 1994. Neither \nof us is shy about the fact we are conservatives. He has heard me say \nmany times that conservatives in some areas are pretty big spenders--\nthat is, national defense and infrastructure--believing that is really \nwhat we are supposed to be doing in Washington.\n  I don't think you can find a State that has had more road problems \nthan my State of Oklahoma. It is kind of a going joke there. Each \nholiday, so many people come for Thanksgiving, and they say: We could \nalways tell when we got to Oklahoma because of the roads. We always \nknew when we left Arizona and got over to Oklahoma because the roads \naren't nearly as good as they are in Arizona.\n  I would suggest a couple of things are worthwhile talking about. I \nhave a chart. I want to help the Senator from Arizona when he goes \nhome. I will let him take this chart home. When you look at Arizona, \nkeeping in mind that the average State increase under SAFETEA is 35.6 \npercent, that is 40.23 percent. That is a huge amount over the average. \nThe Senator from Arizona says it is because they have been on the short \nend of the stick for a long period of time. I can identify with that \nbecause being from the State of Oklahoma, we were at the very bottom. \nWe had to come up by virtue of formula to 77 percent, to 80, then to \n90.5, and now hopefully to 95. So that is a very large amount of money.\n  If you look in the far left of this chart, you have what Arizona \naveraged under TEA-21. That was $463 million. Then it shows each year \nthereafter, for the next 6 years, what happens by comparison. With all \nthe difficulties we have in working on any kind of a formula, the \nSenator from Arizona and I have talked about the complexities of \nformulas. We have donee States, donor States, fast-growing States, low-\npopulation, low-density States. Consequently, to come up with some kind \nof a formula that takes care of all that, we took all of those things \ninto consideration.\n  Contrast that with TEA-21. In TEA-21, they had a formula as a base, \nbut they had a percentage. Every State had a percentage. When they \nfinally got up to 60 votes, that was it: We don't care what happens to \nthe rest of you. We have our 60 votes.\n  We didn't try to do that. That would have been easier, I suppose. I \nwould probably be making the same number of people mad, but nonetheless \nwe didn't do that. We tried to use the logical things to take into \nconsideration in developing the formula.\n\n  The Senator talks about a veto. I know this is just a difference in \ninterpretation. The Senator from Arizona is on the Finance Committee. I \nam not on it. Consequently, I went to the chairman, Senator Grassley, \nand I said to\n\n[[Page S526]]\n\nhim, some time ago: This is what I feel we need to do. It is up to the \nFinance Committee to figure out how we get there.\n  The Senator from Arizona ran over it pretty exhaustively, and I bow \nto his superior intelligence in terms of the finance package because he \nis on the committee. But when I look over the fuel tax fraud \ncompliance, that is something that came along a little bit later. I \nthink that is real. My staff says that is a conservative figure, the \n2.5 cents and the 5.2 cents on ethanol.\n  The interest, you agree, should go back to the highway trust fund. \nSpending down the balance is reasonable. I can remember back when we \nhad balances of $18 billion in the highway trust fund. I spent 8 years \nin the other body on the Public Works and Transportation Committee \nwhere we started chipping away on that. And we all know the reason that \nwas there to start with. It goes back to the Lyndon Johnson days, when \nthey were trying to make it look as if the money they were going to be \nspending was not going to have huge deficits. So they said, let's just \ngo ahead and apply that when we are drawing up our budget. We have \nchanged all that, and we are making great headway in spending that down \nto a reasonable level.\n  The $6.5 billion, everybody does agree, is reasonable and I am sure \nthe committee did also. Then on some of the clarifications on the \ntransfer of the gas guzzler tax to the highway trust fund, it should \nhave been there to start with. What we are trying to do is undo some of \nthe damage that has been done to the trust fund over the years. We are \ndoing that with this bill.\n  As far as a veto is concerned, let me share something that goes into \na little more detail than the Senator from Arizona did. We have a \nletter here that expresses the current feelings, dated February 2, just \na couple days ago. And in this letter from Secretary Mineta, this is \nthe administration's position. They said, yes, we recognize we need \nmore money for infrastructure. That is something we all agree and they \ncertainly agree is necessary. They said, if you can get to the Bond-\nReid amount without doing three things, then we would support you.\n  No. 1 would be you would not be increasing gas taxes. We are not \ngoing to increase gas taxes. Secondly, we are not going to play around. \nYou know the games you come up with. Let's have a bonding program. You \nand I both know most of these bonding programs are nothing more than \nborrowing in some way from the future and encumbering future revenues. \nOr third--this is our biggest controversy with each other--that highway \nspending should be financed from the highway trust fund, not from the \ngeneral fund of the Treasury. I grant you, the last item you talked \nabout is coming from the general fund. I contend it should not have \nbeen. It should have been in the trust fund to start with.\n  That is an argument you and I could have a disagreement on, but I \nlook at it perhaps with a little bit of bias, sitting on the committee \nand saying: All right, Finance Committee, if you can come up with this, \nthis is what is best for America. I felt they did. And the chairman has \ntold me he believed they did. We had Senator Thomas on the floor, who \nis one of your colleagues on the committee, who I think is favorably \ndisposed to the results of the work of the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the chairman yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Of course.\n  Mr. KYL. As to the first items you mentioned, we are in total \nagreement. Those were items that should have been added to the trust \nfund, and they make up the difference between the $196 billion in gas \ntax revenues and the $214 billion. So there is no disagreement there. \nBut as to the last two items, you could argue that the schools and \nchurches and States and cities should have been paying the gas tax all \nalong and that if they do pay it, it should go to the highway trust \nfund. That is true. You can argue that. But we are not going to collect \nit from them. We are not going to make them pay.\n  I suppose what you could say is, from now on churches and schools and \ncities and States have to pay the gas tax. And when they pay it, it \nshould go to the highway trust funds. We are not saying that. We are \ngoing to deem that they have to pay it, but they don't actually have to \npay it. There is no real money there. It is the same thing with the gas \ntax credit on ethanol. There the tax is actually going to be collected \nbut then remitted. So the Government has it for a few days, but when \nthey apply for credit, it goes back. Once again, we are going to credit \nthe trust fund with the money, but it doesn't in fact get the money.\n\n  That is why the Finance Committee had to use creativity in finding \nthese other corporate loophole closings and applying the revenue \nderived from that to make up the difference in the $17 billion or so. \nSo it is not revenue we should have been collecting all along and \nputting into the highway trust funds. You can argue whether we should \nhave been collecting it or not, but it is not revenue we are going to \nbe collecting in the future from the cities and schools, for example. \nWe are going to have to get it from the corporate loopholes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate the response. I know the Senator to be very \nsincere. The time that we spent--we are talking about 12 months we have \nbeen anguishing over this issue to come up with something that is fair. \nIt is not perfect. It is better than it was under TEA-21. We went to \nthe Finance Committee and said: Can you get us there? It is my \ninformation that we got there and, consequently, I still stand behind \nthe bill. We have an honest disagreement on that.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask the chairman to yield. This has to do with the chart \nyou showed and the percentage increases. When you talk about percentage \nincreases, I start to smile. You can always make a point with a \npercentage. I can remember when I was an associate in a law firm and I \nwould be making, let's say, a salary of $25,000 a year. The senior \npartner was making $150,000 a year. We both get a 3-percent increase in \nour salary and he would say: That is fair. In fact, I will tell you \nwhat; I will take a 3-percent increase and I will give you a 4-percent \nincrease.\n  At first, I would say that sounds all right. Then I said, wait a \nminute, you get 3 percent on $150,000 and I get 4 percent on $25,000. I \nthink the gap is widening, not narrowing here. When I got to be more of \na senior person in the law firm--and certainly with my Senate staff \nnow, I always try to give the people at the bottom a higher percentage. \nOtherwise, the gap continues to widen. We see on the chart here how bad \nthe pink or red numbers are, where Arizona is today. I appreciate you \npointing that out. It is deceptive to suggest that since we are going \nup, we ought to be happy.\n  In terms of real dollars, the States that have collected more money \nin the past than Arizona, which have been donee States and haven't had \nthis huge gap, are making far more in terms of the collections each \nyear than Arizona will. You can show that it is going up, but the \naverages don't help Arizona. It is like the saying, how deep is the \nMississippi River? The average is 6 feet, but if you get in the middle, \nyou are in very deep water. Averages really don't count.\n  I would rather be the $150,000 senior partner getting a 3-percent \nincrease than a $25,000 associate getting a 5-percent increase. That \nis, in effect, what Arizona is being offered.\n  Mr. President, I criticize the product. I do not criticize the \nchairman or other members of the committee. I know this is hard. \nEverybody is looking out for their own States, obviously. You cannot be \nfair to everybody and everybody's view. I appreciate that. So the \ncomments are, I hope, in no way to be considered a reflection on the \ngood faith of the people who are trying to do the work. My point is \nthat I cannot stand here and represent the interests of my State with \nthe kind of unfairness that I think is inherent in the bill, and that \nis simply, as the chairman said, something on which we are going to \nhave to disagree.\n\n  I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest that, as the Senator from \nArizona returns home, he ignore the 40-percent increase and go home and \nsay $1.11 billion new dollars. Perhaps they can relate to that.\n  I know Senator Corzine wants to speak and several others want to be \nheard but not necessarily on the highway bill. At the appropriate time, \nI will ask unanimous consent that there be a period for morning \nbusiness.\n\n[[Page S527]]\n\n  Before I do that, I see the chairman of the subcommittee is here. I \nask Senator Bond if he has anything further to say insofar as the \nhighway bill is concerned.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the chairman, the good Senator from \nOklahoma. He is doing a wonderful job. I have been listening to the \ncomments of our friend from Arizona and I understand his concerns. In \norder to achieve equity, in order to get the bill passed, we were only \nable to give certain States, under the formula, an increase that maybe \nin all rights was not adequate. But anybody who gets a 40-percent \nincrease is certainly doing better than most.\n  I have driven the highways in Arizona, and I know that my colleague \nfrom Arizona does an excellent job representing his State. I hope the \nadditional $1.118 billion will be a help.\n  This is a problem we always face on the highway bill. I don't know \nany State that cannot make a compelling case that they have needs that \nare greater. The chairman of the full committee and I are sitting on \nthe first or second and third worst roads and the first and second \nworst bridges in the Nation. I am not getting a 40-percent increase. I \ncan tell you in detail about friends who have been killed on the \nhighways in Missouri because there was too much traffic--10,000, 15,000 \ncars a day on narrow two-lane roads. This is a huge problem.\n  The State of Oklahoma is a major Southwest-to-Midwest freeway. My \nState is in the center of the States. When you look at a map that shows \nthe truck traffic and you identify the major corridors by red lines, \nthe center of Missouri is a big red spot, and St. Louis is a big red \nblotch on the map; there is that much congestion.\n  We were very proud to have the first interstate in the Nation under \nPresident Eisenhower's bill, starting through St. Charles, MO. That is \nthe good news. But the bad news is that the road is badly out of shape, \nand there is not enough money in this highway bill even to make a \nbeginning on repairing it. The Missouri Department of Transportation \nmay be able to make some improvements. We are giving them some options \non how to deal with it in our State, but it is clearly a pressing need.\n  I can make a case that Missouri is the demographic center, because as \nmany people live north of us as south of us, and as many people live \neast of us as west of us. The national traffic flow is through the \nState. We have needs. We don't increase at 40 percent, but we had to \nstay with the funding formula because this is a compromise. We are \ntrying to take care of everyone and meet the needs that are pressing, \nmeet the highest priority needs, and we were not able to do it.\n  We want to work with our good friend from Arizona. We understand his \nconcerns and we thank him for his kind comments. Again, I will have to \nsay that the effort we put in was a lengthy effort and much \ncompromise--nobody got really all they need, which, unfortunately, is \nthe nature of a compromise.\n  Again, I appreciate the comments made. I hope all of us can get \ntogether and move quickly. We are ready to offer an amendment. I gather \nwe are urged to wait until tomorrow morning. If others have amendments, \nI hope we can be open for business tomorrow and get going because there \nare lots of pressing amendments and there are issues that need to be \nvoted on. I hope we can get up and running and begin a very important \ndebate and have votes on these amendments. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri. I also \nwould like to say that it has been a very difficult task developing \nthis legislation. While it seems as though all some colleagues want to \ntalk about is the formula in terms of money, there are many other \nissues we dealt with--environmental issues, streamlining issues, safety \nissues, issues that are of paramount concern to everyone. A compromise \nwas made on all of those issues--some I don't like, but we did \ncompromise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/03/senate-section/article/S527-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on an issue about which I \nhave spoken a number of times and which I passionately believe needs to \nbe addressed--frankly, it is one that is well past the maturation stage \nwhere it should have been addressed--and that is an independent look at \nour intelligence operations, particularly as they relate to the pre-\nIraqi invasion and how conclusions were drawn, so that can speak to the \nAmerican people about the facts we had.\n  It is an issue which I think is essential to the national security of \nthe American people. If we don't learn from our mistakes, we are bound \nto make those mistakes again. It is high time we have gotten around to \nit.\n  In the past few days, the administration and the world have come to \nunderstand and acknowledge on a broad basis the colossal intelligence \nfailures that led us to war, a war that may have led to good ends, but \nthe Nation clearly didn't come to those conclusions on the basis of the \ninformation we now seem to be discovering.\n  There is a question about means to an end that I think is pretty \nsimple in the kinds of discussions I think all of us have in the \nfamilies and in the communities in which we live. I don't think we want \nto get into a position where means justify ends when they don't relate \nto them. I just point that out as some of this discussion has evolved.\n  On January 8, Secretary of State Colin Powell addressed the lack of \nconnection between Iraq and al-Qaida, stating;\n\n       I've not seen a smoking gun, concrete evidence about that \n     connection.\n\n  We were told something different.\n  Then the President, in his latest State of the Union Address, \nreferred only to weapons of mass destruction and related program \nactivities, whatever that is--a far cry from the active nuclear program \nand stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons warned of in his last \nState of the Union Message in 2003.\n  It was last week's testimony from David Kay, the man responsible for \nthe weapons search in Iraq, that finally brought this matter to \nmaturity and captured the attention of the Nation, the administration, \nand the world, and that has really changed the whole context of this \ndebate and discussion.\n  Dr. Kay, a man who told us last fall that Iraq's nuclear programs \nwere only at the most rudimentary level, told the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee there was no evidence of stockpiles of chemical or biological \nweapons.\n  David Kay has made an important recommendation--one that I think has \nbeen obvious for a number of months--that an independent inquiry be \nestablished so that the American people, so that the allies of the \nUnited States and those who would work with us, so that all of us who \nare involved in policymaking know we have the facts that allow us to \nmake good decisions so that we are not committing the lives of our men \nand women in our military to efforts that are based on false premises, \nwhether those are intentional or unintentional.\n  We need to have the right answers, and that recommendation apparently \nhas now led--some might say forced--the President to announce he will \nname a panel to look at the intelligence issues related to Iraq.\n  I welcome the President's reversal on this critical need, and I \nsuspect we will\n\n[[Page S528]]\n\nsee a reversal of support for that concept among my colleagues, about \nwhich there have been some healthy debates in the last months.\n\n  This is about the Nation's national security, make no mistake. We \nneed to understand on a collection basis, on an analysis basis, and, \nyes, on a use basis, just exactly how we got to the kinds of \nconclusions we did. The means need to be understood so that we can \nconnect them with the end, so that we don't make the same mistakes \nagain and again.\n  I have serious concerns, however, at least from early reports about \nwhat the details of the President's plan for this commission will be, \nthat the response is inadequate--I think seriously inadequate. This \nneeds to be an independent commission.\n  How do we get to an independent commission? How do we make certain \nthat the judgments we get are not designed or at least limited to only \na mission defined by those we are actually looking at? And second, will \nthat commission be allowed to explore the use of intelligence, or the \nmisuse, if you will?\n  I haven't seen the details. I don't think any of us have. We are \nreading press reports. But if they are true, it would give the \nappearance that we don't want to have a commission that is going to \ndeal with the fundamental crux of a lot of these questions. Quite \nobviously, if we don't deal with the crux of the questions, then are we \ngoing to get results that create credibility with the American people, \nwith this body, with the world, on whom we need to count to do things \nas we go forward? Are we going to get to those kinds of conclusions?\n  If that is not the case, then I don't think we are headed in the \nright direction. I am very afraid we are moving into something that may \nsatisfy a call for a commission to investigate our intelligence, but \nnot yet at the fundamental problems that led us to this particular \ndecision in Iraq, but also can be and may have well been replicated in \nother areas.\n  I actually think the President is right to talk about it in a broader \ncontext. It is just an issue of, sequentially, which one do we look at \nfirst. Even by the inspection on the ground, we are told that 15 \npercent of the issues haven't been examined on the ground in Iraq. We \nneed to deal with where our men and women are being killed now, as \nopposed to putting off and putting together all of these various \nissues.\n  We have what some people might say is a tactical issue with respect \nto Iraq and a strategic problem with our intelligence operations in a \nmore general context. Fine, we should look at a broader scope of issues \nto get to the restructuring of our intelligence operations, but we need \nto deal with the reality of, how did our intelligence serve us so \npoorly, how were the conclusions so far off the mark? Was there a \nproblem with collection? Was there a problem with analysis? Or was \nthere a problem in selectivity and use of the intelligence provided?\n  As I said, it was last summer when I first offered legislation to \nestablish an independent commission. I think we ought to get to a truly \nbipartisan, independent commission, one that is not unlike what we see \nwith the 9/11 Commission, headed by the former Governor of New Jersey, \na Republican, who is doing, in my view, an incredible service to our \nNation. It is a diligent, independent, bipartisan approach to find out \nthe facts that led to that tragedy with which all of us live each and \nevery day, whether it is in your local hometown, like it is the case in \nmine, or whether it is in the broader context of the Nation.\n\n  Given the fact that we have had Presidential claims that Iraq had \nsought to purchase uranium in Africa, which could not be justified or \nsubstantiated by intelligence, is enough to ask the question whether \nintelligence was properly used. It clearly was not, because the \nPresident himself has denied that that should have been in the State of \nthe Union.\n  So how did that intelligence get misused? How did that come about? \nSimilarly, with regard to the aluminum tube issue, on which a whole \nhost of folks have spoken out both publicly, and I have read some \nthings privately, that call into question whether that was ever a \nviable concept for intelligence to be used as one of the justifications \nfor entering into this conflict.\n  How can that happen? We need to have certainty and independence in \njudging how we got to the collection, the analysis, and the use of the \nintelligence. I think that is important if we are going to go forward \nwith certainty and credibility with regard to our efforts in using our \nintelligence for proper and effective policy formulation in the years \nahead. We need it so we can speak to the world with credibility, and it \nwill not take place, in my view, if we do not have that independent \ncommission.\n  So I want to reemphasize the point that use of the information is \nalso very important. We have seen time after time, and opinion after \nopinion, of a number of people, outside of the David Kay remarks, that \nmuch of the use has actually been disputed within the intelligence \ncommunity. I cite in particular an officer from the State Department, \nGregg Thielmann--and I will try to get his particular title--who has \nmade the assertion that we are basically operating under faith-based \ninterpretations of a lot of information. He goes back and cites the \nNigeria uranium and the use of aluminum tubes, disputes about \nstockpiles that were reported, and many elements of different \nperspectives with regard to the intelligence that was available to \npolicymakers.\n  How did we get such a one-sided view? I think some people would argue \nit might be misuse. Some may argue it is selectivity. I think we need \nan independent commission so we can get to the bottom of these. I think \nwe need to understand how the administration could make public \nstatements that contradicted some of the analysis or failed to \nincorporate the balance that was actually involved in the communities' \nreports. Why did these reports Congress mandated under the very \nresolution that granted the President the authority to go to war \ninclude some of those unsubstantiated claims I talked about? Were \nmembers of the intelligence community pressured to produce analyses \nthat conformed to the administration policies? They even set up an \nextra body within the Defense Department to derive points of view that \nwould be used in the Defense Department independent of traditional \nagencies that are involved in the intelligence. Did the administration \nofficials seek to bypass that normal process by cherry-picking?\n  I think all of these questions are real and they are ones that need \nto be independently analyzed. There are plenty of outside experts. I \nthink a lot of people have heard about the Carnegie Endowment study \nthat reported last week, and I quote:\n\n       Administration officials systematically misrepresented the \n     threat from Iraq's WMD and ballistic missile programs.\n\n  They may not have all of the information. That is why we need a \ncommission to straighten this out and to give us all confidence that we \ncan go forward.\n  I spoke about Mr. Thielmann, who was the former director of the \nOffice of Strategic Proliferation and Military Affairs in the State \nDepartment. He is incredibly offended by the difference between the \ninformation he saw and presented to the Secretary of State, as the one \nwho is responsible for collating that, and what he has seen stated in \nthe public. So how did those kinds of differences come to pass? Why are \nwe dealing with such discrepancies?\n  The commission I proposed would be established by law independent of \nany executive orders to change its mission, change its role, change its \nscope. Its members would be selected by the leadership of both parties, \nbalanced, kind of like the 9/11 Commission which I think people would \nargue as being very independent and is on the right track; receive an \nindependent budget so there would not be issues about how thoroughly \nthey might be able to pursue particular avenues of research; and would \nbe directed to examine every aspect of this critical problem; obviously \nall elements of the collection, all elements of the analysis, and all \nelements of use from top to bottom, from our intelligence operatives to \nthe White House.\n  By the way, in my view, Congress looks to provide the checks and \nbalances that are expected through our constitutional offices.\n  I think this commission should be thorough and we need an end result\n\n[[Page S529]]\n\nthat gives us all confidence that when we make decisions that send \n120,000, 130,000 or 150,000 of our men and women into battle that they \nare fighting a war based on information that was intended to give pure \nadvice as best understood. I do not think the looking back--20/20 \nhindsight is always better, but looking back, one has to question \nwhether the claims that Saddam Hussein posed a dire and immediate \nthreat to the United States were real. It is important that we have a \nfull examination, particularly when there were other alternatives that \nwould not have necessarily cost American lives, such as continued \npursuit of U.N. inspections which were claimed to have been \nineffective, further diplomacy pointless, when in fact apparently all \nof those efforts at U.N. inspections and other things had actually been \nsuccessful. There has been a huge failure, one that is very real in the \nlives of the families who have given up their sons and daughters, and I \nthink one that morally requires we have an independent, bipartisan \ncommission that gets to answers independently of any of us who have \nbeen involved in the decisionmaking, because if we do not have that I \nthink we are going to always have questions of credibility as we go \nforward.\n  So I hope we can work together. I certainly intend to offer either on \na stand-alone basis or in an amendment format an additional opportunity \nto support a truly independent and bipartisan commission that can get \nto the bottom of something I think is fundamental to the national \nsecurity of this Nation, and make sure all of our sons and daughters \nare fighting wars and protecting America with the kind of information \nthat is there for the best interests of us executing our policies, not \nfor the best execution of our political desires.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I want to answer some of the concerns raised \nby my colleague from New Jersey. Basically what he is describing is the \nIntelligence Committee. For 8 months, our staffs have interviewed over \n200 people. They have gone through thousands of pages of documents. We \nhave investigated all of the charges and all of the concerns that have \nbeen raised.\n  There will be a preliminary report provided to the members of the \nIntelligence Committee on Thursday. Starting afresh with another \ncongressional commission is not warranted. The report of the \nIntelligence Committee has not been seen.\n  There are certain things that we know we have seen supported. I \nbelieve everybody believes David Kay is credible. When he testified \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee on January 28 this year, he \nsaid: I think the world is far safer with the disappearance and the \nremoval of Saddam Hussein. I have said I actually think this may be one \nof the cases where it was even more dangerous than we thought. I think \nwhen we have the complete record you are going to discover that after \n1998 it became a regime that was totally corrupt, individuals were out \nfor their own protection. In a world where we know others are seeking \nWMD, the likelihood at some point in the future of a seller and buyer \nmeeting up would have made that a far more dangerous country than even \nwe anticipated with what may turn out not to be a fully accurate \nestimate.\n  There is no question about it not being a fully accurate estimate. \nThis is one of the areas where I think all of us would agree, we did \nnot have as good intelligence as we should have. We didn't have as good \nintelligence in the 1990s, when we should have. And President Clinton, \non February 17, 1998, said:\n\n       If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force our \n     purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat \n     posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program.\n\n  Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, a day later, said:\n\n       Iraq is a long way from here but what happens there matters \n     a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue \n     state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons \n     against us or our allies is the present greatest security \n     threat we face.\n\n  Sandy Berger, the National Security Adviser, said on that same day:\n\n       He will use those weapons of mass destruction again as he \n     has 10 times since 1983.\n\n  All of the people who are making these statements have access to the \nintelligence information that we as Senators get. We realize, based on \nwhat David Kay stated, that we badly underestimated the ballistic \nmissile capability. As a matter of fact, Senator Graham of Florida was \nprescient in a letter he wrote. In a letter dated December 5, 2001, \nsigned by many others, he said:\n\n       There is no doubt Saddam Hussein has reinvigorated his \n     weapons program. Reports indicate biological, chemical and \n     nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to prewar \n     status. In addition Saddam continues to redefine ``delivery \n     system'' and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile \n     program to develop long range missiles that will threaten the \n     United States and our allies.\n\n  That one was right on the mark because that is what we found.\n  What are the needs? Obviously, when there are not people who speak \nArabic, when we do not have unofficial agents in the country, we are \nmissing out on one of the important elements of a good intelligence \nprogram. But, you know something. It is not just Iraq. We didn't know \nhow far Libya was along until Muammar Qadhafi, not wanting to be pulled \nout of a spider hole by an American soldier standing over him with a \ngrenade, decided he would come clean. We were unaware of how far Iran \nhas gone. And, clearly, prior to the first gulf war, we did not know \njust how far advanced Saddam Hussein's programs were.\n  We also know--and David Kay was clear about this--that we cannot \naccount for weapons of mass destruction that he had. There didn't have \nto be a large stockpile. A suitcase full of anthrax or ricin, or even a \nhandful, can be a great terrorist weapon, and we will be lucky if we \nfind that small amount, particularly after you look at the lengthy \nprogram of denial, deception, and destruction in which he engaged.\n  There is a lot of intelligence that was lacking with respect to \nSaddam Hussein. We have to do a better job. The purpose of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, one of five or six committees already \ninvestigating it, is to find out not only what we lacked but also to \nrecommend changes because the one area on which we would agree is that \nwe have to have a better system of intelligence. What we learn is going \nto put us on that track.\n  I know the staff has worked hard. I am looking forward to the report. \nI will be surprised if it does not confirm what David Kay says and lay \nout some recommendations. The President has a responsibility as well. \nWe have an oversight responsibility. If he wants people to look at it, \nto tell him how to improve it: Good luck. Go ahead. But we have the \nIraqi Survey Group, internal investigations, and I believe probably the \nbest investigation is what the Senate Intelligence Committee has done.\n\n  I apologize. I know my colleague from Illinois wants to speak so I \nwill yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Will the Senator from Missouri be willing to take a \nquestion with regard to the Senate Intelligence effort?\n  Mr. BOND. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. CORZINE. First of all, I compliment him. I am quite supportive of \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee doing a total rundown on both the \ncollection and the analysis that led both to the Iraq situation and \nsome of the failures he mentioned with regard to Iran and Libya and \ndifferent points of view. God knows the Pakistani dissemination of \ntechnology we have read about in the newspapers in recent months is a \npretty horrific proliferation issue about which I think all of us \nshould be concerned.\n  But there is this fundamental issue of whether intelligence has been \nmisused and whether we are getting the checks and balances in looking \nat the collected and analyzed information. Are we looking at the full \nrange of possibilities?\n  I ask my colleague from Missouri, am I correct that the chairman of \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee said that studying the use of the \nintelligence information was really not part of the efforts the Senate \nIntelligence Committee would take on in this process? I think the \nrecord would be specific. But is that the case or not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, to respond to that question, what the \nIntelligence Committee looks at is what is the intelligence that was \ngathered. There\n\n[[Page S530]]\n\nhave been some suggestions that the intelligence was influenced or \ncolored by pressure from the administration. David Kay said absolutely \nnot. He said he talked to the analysts, there was absolutely no \ninformation--there was absolutely no information--and he said that \nreally the intelligence community owes an apology to the President--and \nI would say to the American people--for not having done it better. But \nthey are dealing with a very inexact science.\n  If you follow what other elected officials had said prior, during the \n1990s, 2001, 2002--what they were saying shows that they used the same \nintelligence. We are looking at the intelligence, the national \nintelligence estimates and all those things. We look at it, and if you \nwant to second-guess, if you want to argue that we should not have gone \ninto Iraq, I think David Kay answers that and says the world is far \nsafer. It was a much more dangerous situation than we thought.\n  Yes, there are errors. There are areas where we overestimated his \ncapability. There are areas where we underestimated his capability. But \nthe fact remains that Saddam Hussein had so much weaponry, it is going \nto take 18 months just to destroy it. He still may have chemical and \nbiological weapons. We look at what the intelligence is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized in morning \nbusiness for 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say at the outset I commend my \ncolleague from New Jersey, Senator Corzine, who came to this floor \nseveral months ago and said we need an independent commission to look \nat the intelligence that led up to an invasion of Iraq, and the use of \nthat intelligence, and called for a vote on that issue. I don't \nremember the final outcome of that vote, but I know I stood with him \nbecause I thought it was the right thing to do. Many people on our side \nof the aisle and the other side of the aisle resisted that suggestion, \nsaying the Senate Intelligence Committee would be able to do this \ninvestigation.\n  But the Senator from New Jersey has hit the nail on the head. Senator \nRoberts, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, made it \nclear long ago that our committee, the Senate Intelligence Committee, \nwould not look into the use of intelligence but, rather, whether it was \naccurately gathered and presented to the policymakers. That is a \ncritically important question and one that would be part of any valid \ninvestigation.\n  But equally important, if not more, is whether or not that \ninformation, once given to the policymakers, was honestly communicated \nto the American people. I can think of nothing worse in this open forum \nof government than to have the suggestion that there were \nmisrepresentations made to the American people on something as critical \nas a decision to invade a sovereign nation. That is the question before \nthe Senate.\n\n  This week's Newsweek cover story is based on Dr. David Kay's \ntestimony last week before Congress. It has pictures of the leaders of \nthe Bush administration and the quote from Dr. Kay, ``We Were All \nWrong.''\n  The obvious question is, Where was the error made? Was it just in the \ncollection of intelligence data or was it in the portrayal of that \ndata, the description of that data to the American people? That is a \npainful question and a delicate question but an important question.\n  Senator Corzine has said for many months we need to have people come \nand ask that question, both questions, in an honest and bipartisan way. \nI salute him for his leadership on this issue. I know he has been \nfrustrated by the rejection of the Senate for his proposal, but now it \nis full circle. Now, even the President, who once opposed him, says it \nis time to move to a commission.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CORZINE. It seems to me it is absolutely essential we understand \nhow the President of the United States can put those 16 words--which \nwere in absolute conflict with the information that generally was \navailable in the Intelligence Committee, if I read that properly--into \nthe State of the Union Message of 2003 with regard to aluminum tubes \nand with regard to uranium and then later the whole discussion, \nparticularly Secretary Powell's presentation to the U.N. of the use of \naluminum tubes. This was also in very strong contradiction to much of \nthe information that is now available. We could go on, with unmanned \naerial vehicles and a whole series of other issues.\n  So somehow or another there were disputes about the response that one \nshould make with regard to collection and analysis of data. And that \ngets at the fundamental question of how did we use or misuse the \nintelligence that was presented. To not come up with an answer that is \ncredible to the American people, credible to policymakers in this body, \nand credible to our allies and the world community is a failure of \nleadership on our part. It becomes absolutely essential that any \nindependent commission needs to deal with the use, not just the \ncollection and analysis.\n  Is that how the Senator from Illinois feels?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, which is why I supported the early resolution. I \nhope the Senate will return to that. I hope we can find a way to choose \npeople who are fair arbiters. There is a fear on the other side that \nsomething will be done to embarrass the administration before an \nelection, especially a feeling we should let the chips fall where they \nmay. Can't we find people in this country--I think we can--who will be \nhonest, dispassionate, and nonpartisan?\n  At issue is not just a question of who comes out ahead on the \npolitical ledger sheet. The question before the Senate is one of the \nmost important elements for America's national defense and security. If \nwe had planes being flown in Iraq that were crashing, if we had tanks \nthat could not shoot straight, if we had a lot of equipment over there \nthat was failing, we would hear very quickly from the press, from the \npublic, from the Pentagon, that we need an investigation.\n  Here we have a failure of something equally important, a failure of \nintelligence. We need to get to the bottom of it. If we are going to be \nsuccessful in any war on terrorism, we need the very best intelligence \nin the world. Clearly, our intelligence failed us in the leadup to the \ninvasion of Iraq.\n\n  We find ourselves today in a situation which is likely to be long \nterm, costing American taxpayers $1 billion a week but, more \nimportantly, continuing to cost American lives. That is a compelling \nreason to move on this with dispatch.\n  I sincerely hope Senator Corzine's suggestion is followed up on as \nquickly as possible.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask the Senator from Illinois if it is not the case \nthat the gathering of intelligence--today, tonight, tomorrow morning, \nyesterday--might be the very function that determines whether our \ncountry is able to determine and prevent a future terrorist attack \nagainst our country; isn't the intelligence-gathering system that \nimportant?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from North Dakota, more important \nthan it has ever been, since September 11. It is only with valid, \ncredible, good intelligence that we are able to anticipate someone who \nis trying to cause harm to the American people or to strike us in our \nterritory or to, frankly, attack our special interests around the \nworld. Intelligence is a critical part of our national defense.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I inquire if the gathering of intelligence is so \ncritical--and the Newsweek magazine describes it as a failure in the \ndescription by Mr. Kay, the top weapons inspector--if, in fact, it is a \nfailure, then I would expect that the President of the United States, \nthe Congress, and the American people would demand, on an urgent basis, \nthat we figure out what happened, what is wrong, and how to fix it. Not \nlater, now. The safety and security of this country depends on it.\n  With respect to the issue of intelligence, we ought to now \nunderstand, having the vision in the rearview mirror, the issue is not \nwhat we think but, rather, what we know when a country changes a \ndoctrine, as the President did, with respect to preemptive attacks. If \nyou talk about preemption\n\n[[Page S531]]\n\nyou better know things rather than think things.\n  I went back and reread the presentation to the United Nations by the \nSecretary of State. When he made that presentation, I thought to \nmyself, that is a masterful presentation. And what he did, \ninterestingly enough, is say: We know the following; we know the \nfollowing; we know. And he put pictures up and he put up pieces of \ninformation--we know this from human resources; we know this from \ninspections; we know this from satellite photos.\n  They did not know it. What he said we knew turns out to have been \nfundamentally wrong.\n  So it seems to me the President, the Congress, and the American \npeople ought to demand on an urgent basis there be an independent \ncommission to find out what on Earth happened and how do we fix it.\n  Let me make one final point, if I might. Can there really be an \nindependent commission, when a President, who did not want a commission \nin the first place, and said in recent weeks he did not want a \ncommission, now will say our executive branch and our administration \nwill create a commission that is independent? Can that really be a \ncommission? Or is it not the case that a truly independent commission \nwould be one that follows the course that we usually follow on urgent \nissues, and that is, we put in law, a law from Congress, that creates \nand funds a commission and creates a truly independent body to take a \nhard look at what happened.\n\n  The executive branch cannot possibly have a commission that \ninvestigates itself. This is not about politics. There is no political \nway to talk about safety and security of the American people and our \ngreat reliance on intelligence.\n  This is not about Republicans or Democrats. This is about the future \nof this country and getting it right. It is critically important.\n  The Senator from New Jersey and what he has been talking about for \nmonths about this independent commission is right on the mark, as is \nthe Senator from Illinois. I am pleased to join him in this discussion \nabout how important intelligence really is.\n  I ask that 10 minutes be added to the Senator's allocation for his \npresentation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think the Senator said something important in relation \nto the September 11 commission, a commission which is headed up by \nformer Republican Governor Kean of New Jersey, which has asked for an \nextension of time, so on a bipartisan basis they can ask all the \nquestions as to whether or not we did anything wrong that led up to \nSeptember 11, and what we could have done to prevent it.\n  Former President Bill Clinton said to a gathering of Senators, I am \nprepared to testify before that commission. I am prepared to cooperate \nwith them completely. If there was any shortcoming or failing in my \nadministration, so be it. It is more important that the American people \nknow that we have done everything in our power to make this a safer \nnation.\n  That should be the attitude of all Members. We should swallow our \npolitical pride and say this is not about partisanship. If an error was \nmade by any President, Democrat or Republican, which has put us in \nharm's way or endangered America's security, don't we deserve to know \nthat? The fact that the Senate Intelligence Committee has drawn a line \nand said they are not going to even ask the question as to whether the \nintelligence was misused by any member of the Bush administration tells \nme they are being politically protective. They are protecting the \npolitical interests of the White House instead of the paramount \nconcern, which should be protecting the American people.\n  I hope, frankly, there is an independent commission that asks hard \nquestions of those in the Clinton administration and President George \nW. Bush's administration and any administration that might have some \nbearing on the intelligence capacity of America and on the protection \nof this great Nation. I thank the Senators who joined in on this \nimportant issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/03/senate-section/article/S531-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S531-S535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE PRESIDENT'S FISCAL YEAR 2005 BUDGET\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I came to the floor to address President \nBush's fiscal year 2005 budget. This budget was presented to Congress \nyesterday. It has been characterized by the Concord Coalition, and \nothers, as one of the most irresponsible Federal budgets to have been \nfiled. It continues President Bush's failed tax policies, \nunfortunately, at the expense of Social Security and Medicare. It \nshortchanges funding for schools. It shifts the burden of paying for \nenvironmental cleanup from the polluters to ordinary taxpayers. And it \nhurts States in the Midwest, such as my own State of Illinois, that are \nfacing terrible budget situations. It imposes new Federal mandates \nwithout providing adequate Federal funds.\n  The budget is a fundamental reversal of the very things the President \nsaid his administration stands for. It is not compassionate, it is not \nconservative, and, sadly, it is not credible.\n  Why is it not compassionate? The President's budget again fails to \nprovide full funding for No Child Left Behind. This was the premier \neducation policy of the Bush administration, supported, on a bipartisan \nbasis, by this Senator and many others on the floor, with the \nunderstanding that as we identified the weaknesses and shortcomings in \npublic education, we would come forward with the money to help the \nstudents reach the level of testing where they should be.\n  Now we find in Illinois and States across the Nation that test scores \nshow that kids need help, and the Federal Government continues to say: \nTake the test, announce whether you are a failing school or a \nsuccessful school, and we will provide you with less money than we ever \npromised.\n  During the debate on No Child Left Behind, Senator Paul Wellstone of \nMinnesota sat behind me. He opposed the program from the start. He \nsaid: You are going to create a program where the tests become the \nobject of education rather than learning. Unfortunately, because the \ntests create such high stakes, many teachers will have no recourse but \nto teach to the test, thus dampening the enthusiasm to learn, the \ncreative element that is part of education.\n  That was Paul Wellstone's point. I said: Paul, I disagree with you. \nTests are about accountability. We have taken tests all through our \nschool years, and we should hold our students accountable, our teachers \naccountable, our school boards and others accountable through testing. \nSo I disagreed with him on that premise.\n  Then he added: But I will tell you something else. When it comes to \nproviding the Federal resources that you are going to promise, I'll bet \nthey won't be there. When the schools need them, they won't get the \nhelp from the Federal Government to improve the education of our \nchildren.\n  Unfortunately, as I have traveled around Illinois, I am afraid former \nSenator Paul Wellstone was right on both counts. We are finding more \nand more teachers and principals and school boards complaining that \nthey are spending more and more time focusing on tests, doing their \nlevel best to avoid being branded a failing school and facing sanctions \nfrom the Federal Government. And when they find some students who are \nnot meeting the test standards, they are hard pressed to come up with \nthe tutoring that is necessary, the afterschool programs or summer \nschool programs to bring these kids back in the mainstream and to bring \nthem up to the level where they should be.\n\n  So what do we find in this budget from President Bush when it comes \nto his premier policy on education? The law in No Child Left Behind \nauthorized $34.3 billion in funding to school districts in this next \nfiscal year--$34.3 billion. The President's budget only provides $24.9 \nbillion. The President's budget falls short by over $9 billion of \nkeeping its promise to the American schools and people that we would \ngive them a helping hand so that the kids could move forward in their \neducation.\n  In Illinois, a State which is facing a deficit, which is causing a \nlot of hardship, we are going to lose over $250 million which would \nhave come to us had the President put in his budget a request for funds \nadequate to fund his premier policy for education. So in Illinois we \nare facing a mandate, No Child Left Behind, and no funds to pay for it.\n  Well, I can tell you, school districts around my State can think of a \nlot of\n\n[[Page S532]]\n\nways to help their students, ways that do not involve the test we are \nsending them. Unfortunately, they do not have the resources to deal \nwith it. But they deal with the test, paid for by the Federal \nGovernment, and do not have the resources to help the children.\n  When it comes to housing, the President's budget eliminates entirely \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development's HOPE VI Program--the \nonly Federal program that focuses on revitalizing the Nation's most \ndistressed public housing developments. The Chicago Housing Authority \nreceived $105 million in direct HOPE VI grants in fiscal year 2001 and \nhas also given approval to issue another $291 million worth of bonds.\n  HOPE VI provides grants and unprecedented flexibility to address \nhousing and social service needs. In Chicago, these grants were to be \nused to demolish 4,500 aging public housing units and to replace 1,675 \nunits with new ones in public and mixed-income housing.\n  In most States, including my own State of Illinois, we are facing a \nterrible housing shortage. Working families are struggling to find \nsafe, decent places to live. If we do not provide a helping hand to \nthese working families, these families, with their children, will be \npushed into housing situations which, sadly, are going to be very \ndifficult for them to cope with. This decision by the administration to \neliminate HOPE VI funding, to say we cannot afford this limited Federal \ncommitment to help with public housing, is going to be an expensive \none.\n  The President's budget also will provide $12.7 billion in additional \nFederal funding for Medicaid between the current fiscal year and 2009. \nThat sounds good: an additional $12.7 billion for Medicaid, but there \nis a catch. The President's plan requires that Medicaid funding remain \nbudget neutral over a 10-year period. In other words, in 2011, 2012, \nand 2013 money going to the States will have to be reduced by the \namount that they were compensated in higher payments early on in budget \nyears. Who can believe in these outyears the cost of medical care will \ngo down?\n  So as the costs go up, the States are going to be asked to give up \nmoney that was paid them years before. That is not going to provide \nhealth care for a lot of families, particularly lower income families \nand those who cannot afford health insurance--unfortunately, a growing \nclass in our society.\n  When it comes to veterans benefits, for the second year in a row the \nBush administration proposes that veterans pay a larger share of their \nhealth care costs.\n  All of us come and praise veterans, as we should, the men and women \nwho risk their lives for our country, some of whom I have seen recently \nat Walter Reed Hospital, and many you find returning from Iraq and \nAfghanistan. We are all there at the parades to shower them and their \nfamilies with praise for their contribution to America. But our \nspeeches are cheap and our words are hollow if we do not follow through \nwith support for veterans programs.\n  The President, in his budget, proposes increased fees for some \nveterans, including a $250 annual enrollment fee and an increase in \nmonthly pharmaceutical copayments. Congress rejected both of these \nproposals in recent years. The Bush administration comes back demanding \nthem in their budget.\n  I might say a word, too, about the global AIDS commitment of the \nPresident. I thought the President spoke for this country and our \nvalues when he stood up a year ago in his State of the Union speech and \nsaid: Let's commit $15 billion over a 5-year period of time to fight \nthe global AIDS epidemic. But for the second year in a row, the \nPresident's budget fails to meet his rhetorical promise to the world. \nIt falls short of his full commitment.\n  The President proposes $2.8 billion, which is again short of the $3 \nbillion annual commitment over 5 years. Furthermore, the President's \nbudget proposes to cut our contributions to the Global Fund to Fight \nAIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. He cuts it by two-thirds, from $550 \nmillion this year to just $200 million in the upcoming year. The \nproblem grows. Our commitment to it recedes and backs off. That does \nnot help.\n  When it comes to the environment, in the proposed Bush budget, the \nenvironmental programs sustained the second largest reduction of any \nsection of the budget, after agricultural programs. For the first time \nsince 1981--almost 22 years now--line items for environmental programs \nwere reduced for two consecutive years.\n  The President's budget will make taxpayers pay for even more of the \ncost of cleaning up toxic waste sites in the Superfund Program. \nIllinois has 40 such contaminated sites that are not to be cleaned up \nbecause Superfund is broke. The President refuses to fund it, and the \nPresident refuses to hold the polluters responsible. It means that \naverage taxpayers and families across my State will have to pay for \npollution caused by industries that are let off the hook by the Bush \nbudget.\n  The President is asking for $1.38 billion for the Superfund Program \nthis year, all of which will likely come from general revenues because \nthe administration has refused to reinstate the polluter pay program.\n\n  To pay for that increase, the President proposes cutting clean water \nfunding from $429 million to $94 million. Last year the Bush \nadministration proposed a 79-percent decrease in the same program.\n  In agriculture, this is the area hit hardest by the Bush budget. This \narea sustained the largest cut with a reduction in discretionary \nspending of 8.1 percent and conservation programs are the first \ncasualties. That is unfortunate, because preserving our soil and water \nresources are absolutely critical to the future of farming and critical \nto those who believe that we have a stewardship responsibility for the \nland. That responsibility is not met.\n  The President's budget proposal imposes deep cuts in the COPS \nProgram, a program started under the Clinton administration, which has \nbeen wildly successful. Cities and counties and local units of \ngovernment, States as well, have come to the Federal Government and \nwith a very simple application form brought more men and women in \nuniform onto the streets of America, making it safer. President Bush's \nfiscal year 2005 budget proposes no funding specifically for the hiring \nof officers and instead provides $17.6 million for community policing \ndevelopment initiatives, whatever that means.\n  Even if all of this funding were used to hire law enforcement and \nschool resource officers, it would be a 91-percent cut from the fiscal \nyear 2003 funding level. In Illinois, during fiscal year 2003, COPS \nhiring grants provided funding for 123 full-time police officers. A cut \nof 91 percent that the President proposes would mean 111 fewer police \nofficers patrolling Illinois neighborhoods and schools. This is a step \nin the wrong direction. This program is not only popular; it is needed.\n  When it comes to homeland security, we can do better than the Bush \nbudget. In Illinois, 671 law enforcement agencies have directly \nbenefited from funding made available through the COPS Program since it \nwas created in 1994. Since that time, over $410 million in COPS grants \nhave been awarded to my State. These grants have funded 5,832 \nadditional police officers and deputies, as well as additional school \nresource officers who break up gangs and try to find out when children \nwho have problems attending school have much bigger problems at home \nthan even teachers realize.\n  The President's 2005 budget request for homeland security includes \n$3.6 billion in the Office of Domestic Preparedness. This funding \nrequest represents a 19-percent overall decrease from this year, when \n$4.4 million was available. So we see that in areas of homeland \nsecurity, this budget makes cuts.\n  I am very concerned about this budget. I am also concerned about the \nfact that this is not a conservative budget. How can you claim to be \nconservative, as President Bush says he is, when his budget is swimming \nin more than $500 billion worth of red ink? Let me show you some charts \nwhich graphically tell the story.\n  Every minute the Bush administration spends $991,000 more than it \ntakes in. A few years ago we had a budget surplus under the Clinton \nadministration. The number was $236 billion. A few years later, under \nthis administration, we are anticipating a deficit of $521 billion. So \nthat is a swing of $757 billion from surplus to deficit. It gets worse.\n  We have asked the President year in and year out: How can you justify \nthis?\n\n[[Page S533]]\n\nLook at the quotes from the President and this administration. He said \nin 2001:\n\n       [We] can proceed with tax relief without fear of budget \n     deficits. . . .\n\n  Sadly, he was wrong.\n  In 2002, the President said:\n\n       [O]ur budget will run a deficit that will be small and \n     short-term. . . .\n\n  That is certainly not the case. We are facing recordbreaking \ndeficits.\n  In 2003:\n\n       Our current deficit . . . is not large by historical \n     standards and is manageable. . . .\n\n  Wrong again.\n  In 2004:\n\n       The deficit will be cut in half over the next five years. . \n     . .\n\n  Clearly, he is going to be wrong again on that projection.\n  Then you take a look at the claim that he will cut the budget deficit \nin half and you see that it is not credible. By 2009, the operating \ndeficit is likely to be far larger than $237 billion. This is the \ndeficit claim. This is the Social Security surplus which will be \nincluded in regular spending for our Government so that the President \nreaches his goal nominally when, in fact, he is doing it at the expense \nof Social Security.\n  The Medicare surplus will be raided for $23 billion. The alternative \nminimum tax, which I predict will be the biggest single family tax \nissue this Congress faces over the next 5 years, to even fix that would \ncost $55 billion by 2009.\n  And then, of course, we have the additional cost for war. Isn't it \ninteresting that the President's budget doesn't include the cost of the \nwar in Afghanistan and in Iraq, nor does it include increases in \nhomeland security? So the deficit we are talking about doesn't even \ntake into account the billion dollars per week we are spending on that \nwar effort.\n  Let me tell you how the President will maintain his spending when he \nruns out of money. President Bush's budget hides the full story. Every \npenny of the Social Security surplus will be spent by this \nadministration under their proposed budget plan. The amount of Social \nSecurity surplus saved between 2005 and 2014: Zero. The amount of \nSocial Security surplus spent in that same period of time: $2.4 \ntrillion. Instead of strengthening Social Security and Medicare as the \nbaby boomers arrive, President Bush's budget plan will make them weaker \nthan ever in our history.\n  Let me also take a look at what happens with the Bush budget when you \nlook at the full story. The President said repeatedly in his State of \nthe Union Address that the key to our economic prosperity is to make \nhis tax cuts permanent. I think, frankly, the first round of tax cuts \nwere not advisable and were unwise. Not because we didn't need a tax \ncut and a stimulus but because the majority of the tax breaks went to \nthe wealthiest people in America. The President has said we have to \ncontinue on that course, continue to give tax breaks to the highest \nincome Americans.\n  Sadly, if we follow the President's advice and make those tax cuts \npermanent, take a look at what this means in terms of the long-term \nbudget picture: a $1.6 trillion, 10-year cost to extend the tax cuts. \nHow can this be sensible, prudent, or conservative? It is a spending \nspree and cutting spree that fails to take into account the ultimate \ncost.\n\n  I mentioned the cost of the AMT reform, the alternative minimum tax. \nJust 3 or 4 million people are currently paying this tax. But the way \nit is geared to take into account inflation, millions more will be \nbrought in to pay this tax. In fact, many families are going to learn \nthat they are paying more in alternative minimum tax than any other \ntax. You can expect to hear from them. The President ignores this \nreality. The cost of reform of this alternative minimum tax goes \nthrough the roof if we don't do this and do it quickly. Sadly, there is \nno suggestion that we even consider the problem.\n  Incidentally, when you take a look at the amount provided in \nPresident Bush's budget for ongoing military operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and the war on terror, there is zero provided. So in \naddition to the budget document we are considering, we will have a \nsupplemental appropriations bill much later in the year which will add \non more spending which we must have to sustain the troops in the field. \nHow much: $280 billion is the anticipated cost between 2005 and 2014--a \nhidden cost which the Bush administration doesn't want to deal with \ndirectly in their budget document.\n  The gross Federal debt, assuming extension of Republican tax cuts on \na permanent basis, AMT reform, and defense policies, $15.1 trillion in \n2014. What a wonderful and glorious gift we are leaving our children \nand grandchildren. We are spending them into a debt that, frankly, they \nare going to have to deal with for the rest of their natural lives.\n  What do the Bush administration's irresponsible fiscal policies mean? \nBy 2009, each person will have a share of the national debt which will \ntotal $35,283. So the President says for the average family: We will \nsend you a check for $300 or $400 for each member of the family, and we \nwill give you a little bit of a helping hand.\n  What he doesn't tell you is that, at the same time, he is mortgaging \nthe future of this country. For what? For tax cuts for wealthy people.\n  How do we pay off our debt in this country, how do we sustain it, if \nwe are spending $991,000 a minute more than we are bringing in as the \nBush budget proposes? There is only one way to sustain our economy and \nto pay off that debt. That is to borrow money. Which countries come up \nto the window and want to buy the securities to fund America's debt? \nTake a look at the list. The top 10 countries holding America's \nnational debt: Japan, $526 billion; China, $144 billion, United \nKingdom, $112 billion. The list goes down the line.\n  Isn't it interesting that the countries that are holding our national \ndebt in many instances are the same countries that have substantial \ntrade surpluses with the United States? In fact, the two fit together. \nWhen China, for example, which now has an inordinate trade surplus with \nthe United States, wants to make good on the extra dollars they have, \nthey buy securities and pay off our national debt in that regard. So we \nend up beholden to the banking systems in these countries that, \nfrankly, are holding America's debt. They have a powerful position. \nThat has become a reality. In order to fund this debt--the largest \ndeficit in our country, a debt that will grow to record proportions--we \ndo two things. We borrow all the money in the Social Security trust \nfund and from the Medicare trust fund, and then we turn to nations \naround the world and ask them to buy the securities to sustain our \ndebt. That is the future which the President is suggesting to us.\n\n  During the course of the State of the Union Address, the President \nsaid at one point--I remember it well--that manufacturing jobs are \nincreasing. I can say to the President, whether it is the State of \nIllinois or Iowa or Michigan, manufacturing jobs are not increasing. \nThey are increasing in China. We have lost 20 percent of our \nmanufacturing jobs in the last 5 years, and in Illinois there is no end \nin sight.\n  Sadly, as you see the shrinking of our economy in each State, with \nmore than 3 million jobs lost under the Bush administration, you \nunderstand that we are not only spending ourselves into long-term debt, \nwe are not getting what is essential for America, and that is \nstrengthening our economic base, making certain that our schools are \nthe best, that we are training our children for the quality jobs of the \nfuture, making certain businesses have a helping hand from Government \nto help meet their health insurance obligations to employees, making \ncertain that our trade laws are enforced in a fair way.\n  I am a Democratic Senator who has voted for free trade in the past. I \nbelieve globalization is as inevitable as gravity. But we have to \nunderstand that simply entering into a trade agreement is no assurance \nthat the other party--other country in this case--will live up to the \nterms of the agreement. We have seen case after case--steel is a \nclassic example, where countries such as Brazil, Japan, and Russia \nstarted dumping steel in the U.S. By ``dumping,'' I mean selling it at \nlower than the cost of production. They were not only trying to bring \nin dollars from the U.S.; they were trying to close down the American \nsteel industry. Sadly, they were successful, to some extent.\n\n[[Page S534]]\n\n  What does it mean today to us to have fewer steel companies and fewer \nsteelmaking jobs? Let me give you one illustration. Today, in Iraq, \nthere are 8,400 Humvees that our troops are using in the field. These \n8,400 vehicles are special problems for us because they are not \nequipped with armored plating. If you go to Walter Reed and meet the \namputees and injured soldiers, many will tell you: Senator, do \nsomething to make the Humvees safer.\n  So when I went to the Department of the Army and said, ``What are you \ngoing to do about the armored doors needed on Humvees?'' they said, \n``It is our highest priority.'' I asked them how they would make them. \nThey said they are going to turn to arsenals in Rock Island and \nAnniston Depot and contract it out. I asked: How long will it take to \nmake 8,400 armored doors and get them there as quickly as possible to \nprotect our soldiers? They said: If we work night and day, we can get \nit done in 1 year. One year? During World War II, we were building \nbombers every 12 hours and ships every 30 days, and we need a year to \nbuild 8,400 sets of doors to protect these Humvees?\n  I was incredulous and asked why. They said: Senator, we only have one \nsteelmaking plant left in America, which is in Pennsylvania, which has \nthe capacity to make the steel we need for the armor on these doors. \nThere is one left in America.\n\n  When countries violate trade agreements and dump steel in the U.S., \nruin our steel industry, close down the businesses, kill the jobs, \nendanger retiree benefits--after that happens, we find ourselves in \nthis situation where we need steel, the best in the world need it \ndesperately, and we cannot make it in the U.S.\n  When the President talks about a strong America in the future, it \ninvolves education and job training and helping businesses pay for \nhealth insurance but also enforcing trade agreements. I supported the \nPresident's tariffs on steel as the only way to answer this dumping of \nsteel. Are we going to quit now, since the WTO has threatened they will \nimpose $2 billion in tariffs? I hope not. Frankly, I think we need to \ntake a more aggressive stand when it comes to building our economy and \njobs for the future.\n  Don't tell me we are in a recovery. A jobless recovery is no recovery \nat all. Families who are still unemployed and cannot meet the basic \nobligations to keep their families together are not families that are \nbetter off just because productivity is higher in America. We need a \nstronger economy that has good growth, including jobs. Right now, we \nare far from it. The Bush budget doesn't move us in that direction. It \nis not a credible budget, a compassionate budget; it is not a \nconservative budget; it is a testament to a failed economic policy, \nwhere the U.S. economy is not back on its feet, where we continue to \nsee people losing their jobs, where good-paying jobs are going \noverseas, and little or nothing is being done.\n  That will be an issue which drives this electorate in this election, \nas it should. As we review the budget, I hope Members of Congress will \nstep back and realize that making tax cuts for the wealthy permanent \npolicy in this country will guarantee weakness in Social Security and \nMedicare for generations to come. If that is the reason my colleagues \nbelieve they came to the Senate, then they should stand and cheer this \nbudget. But if they feel a special obligation, as I do and many \ncolleagues do, to Social Security and Medicare, we should demand more.\n  How can you claim to be conservative when your budget is swimming in \nmore than $500 billion worth of red ink? The President is proposing a \npaltry $53 billion in revenue-raising measures to offset the budget's \n$1.3 trillion in tax cuts. And he's proposing changes in the budget \nprocess that will make it harder to increase spending on important \nsocial programs down the road while failing to place similar \nconstraints on Congress's ability to extend tax giveaways to the rich.\n  The cost of extending the tax cuts alone will reach $1.6 trillion \nbetween 2005-2014. Before the end of this fiscal year, Congress will \nhave to raise the debt ceiling--currently at $7.4 trillion once again. \nThe continuation of the administration's policies could produce a \nnational debt of greater than $15 trillion by 2014. Is this fiscal \nconservatism?\n  Even the unofficial voice of the right seems shocked by the fiscal \nirresponsibility of this administration. Talk show host Rush Limbaugh \nweighed in on the gloomy fiscal picture painted by this budget on his \nnationally broadcast radio program. ``Bush has outspent Clinton,'' \nLimbaugh told listeners last Thursday. ``I hate to say this; I'm sorry \nfolks.''\n  And how can you claim to be credible when you increase funding for \nmissions to outer space, provide even more tax breaks for the wealthy \nbut cut money for community oriented policing, for higher education and \nfor critical transportation projects?\n  In 2000, our Nation had a $236 billion surplus; in 4 short years, the \nBush administration has managed to turn that into a deficit for the \ncurrent fiscal year that they project to be $521 billion. CBO estimates \nthe fiscal year 2004 deficit will be closer to $477 billion. Either \nway, that is a striking turn of events, and neither figure tells the \nfull story. Once Social Security is factored out of the budget, the \nOMB's fiscal year 2004 projected deficit soars to $675 billion.\n  The President claims his budget will cut the deficit in half in 3 \nyears. This promise speaks directly to the credibility gap facing this \nadministration. The President simply isn't leveling with the American \npeople; we've heard this story before.\n  In 2001, the President, upon inheriting a fiscally sound house, told \nus that ``we can proceed with tax relief without fear of budget \ndeficits.'' He was wrong.\n  In 2002, when it was clear that this wasn't the case, he told us that \n``our budget will run a deficit that will be small and short-term.'' \nWrong again.\n  In 2003, he said, ``Our current deficit is not large by historical \nstandards and is manageable.'' Once again, wrong.\n  Now he is promising to cut the deficit by half over the next 3 years \nand is focusing his deficit reduction plan on limiting domestic \ndiscretionary spending. That is not a credible solution. Growth in \ndomestic discretionary spending has been almost non-existent over the \npast 2 years. Out-of-control spending did not cause these record \ndeficits. The President's irresponsible tax cuts for the wealthiest \nAmericans did.\n  The OMB's estimates were $134 billion greater than the estimates the \nBush administration used to build support for the program in Congress. \nDemocrats in the House are calling for an investigation into when the \nPresident knew that the number would be much higher than the one used \nduring deliberations.\n  The $521 figure is slightly inflated. No one else is this high. CBO \nis $477 billion. The $521 includes $20 billion in lower revenue \nestimates for fiscal year 2004 just to be ``careful.'' This would \ncertainly make it easier to cut the deficit in half if the baseline \nfrom which you are cutting is artificially inflated tens of billions of \ndollars higher than anyone else's estimates of that baseline.\n  Another component of the credibility gap is that the President is \nengaged in a high-stakes shell game, shifting the actual responsibility \nfor paying for his policies until after he has left town and hiding \ntheir true costs from sight in the current budget.\n  The administration provides no estimates of the cumulative 10-year \ndeficit in this budget, thus masking the real long-term costs of these \npolicies. Groups on the right and the left have estimated that the \nadministration's policies will add over $5 trillion to the federal debt \nover the next 10 years.\n  The budget does not include the full cost of the supplemental \nspending in Iraq that was passed last year, some of which will take \nplace during this fiscal year. We know we will be in Iraq. Why isn't \nall of this money included in the DOD budget?\n  Furthermore, the CBO says that as late as 2009, we may still face \ntens of billions in costs to fight terrorism. Yet, these funds are not \nincluded in the budget either. The President has added $250 billion in \nsupplemental requests since taking office; we can certainly expect more \nof these in the future.\n  The President's budget ignores the impeding retirement of the baby \nboomers, and fails to factor in the full cost of the Alternative \nMinimum Tax relief he requests in this budget.\n  Finally, despite promising during this campaign to make Social \nSecurity solvent, the administration's budget proposals will use every \npenny of the\n\n[[Page S535]]\n\nSocial Security surplus over the next 10 years to pay the bills we are \nracking up today.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will respond to my colleague from Illinois. \nFirst, regarding the budget deficit, and comments made earlier \nregarding intelligence issues, I will find it interesting to see \nwhether those who are so concerned about the Federal budget deficit \nwill back up their words with actions by voting against runaway \nspending.\n  Alan Greenspan, head of the Federal Reserve, says the biggest problem \nis that Congress cannot restrain its bad spending habits. So for \ncolleagues such as the Senator from Illinois--will they vote against \nthe $30 billion in subsidies in the energy bill? Will they vote against \ntwice that much in unpaid for highway funding--that is to say, unpaid \nfor in the highway trust fund? It will be interesting to see how those \nwho complain about the deficits actually vote when it comes to adding \nto the deficit.\n  Remember that last year, when we had a whole series of votes, when \nthe Republican majority finally got a budget passed, we had to defeat a \nwhole series of amendments by our Democratic colleagues--we usually got \n51 or 52 votes--because almost all of the members of the Democratic \nCaucus voted in favor of spending more money in these amendments. We \ndefeated something like $88 billion in spending amendments offered by \nour Democratic colleagues. Thank goodness we did. That amounted to over \na trillion dollars in savings over the 10-year period of the budget.\n  So for my Democratic colleagues to complain about spending and budget \ndeficits and then go on and vote for the projects that they can brag \nabout back home, I think that at least is--shall we call it a \ndichotomy, in any event.\n  What about this business of tax cuts for the wealthy? Actually, I \nhave some statistics here which I think are interesting. It shows that \nthe reduction of the tax rate, the top marginal rate--these are the \n``wealthy'' that our Democratic colleague spoke about--actually, mostly \nhelps small businessowners, the very people who create the bulk of the \njobs in this country.\n  You cannot have it both ways, my friends. You cannot complain on the \none hand that we are cutting taxes for the people who create the jobs \nand then complain we are not doing anything to create jobs. That is \njust exactly what the tax rate reductions on the highest marginal rate \naccomplished. About 78 percent of that savings went to small \nbusinessowners. These are the people who pay at the top individual \nrate. They are subchapter S corporations or partnerships; we call them \nflowthrough entities, which pay at the top individual tax rate. They \nare small business employers. Sixty-two percent of the income tax \nfilers in the top bracket are small businessowners, and 98 percent of \nthe companies are small businesses.\n  According to the Small Business Administration, 75 percent of all of \nthe new jobs are created by small businesses, which would suggest that \nsmall businesses created over 2 million of the 2.8 million jobs added \nsince the start of 2002. How were these small businesses able to create \nthose jobs? They had the capital to invest to do so. How did they get \nthe capital? We cut their marginal income tax rates. Again, they \nreceived, by far and away, over three-fourths of all the relief that \nwent to the top filers, the small businessowners, by cutting that rate.\n  Tax cut for the rich? No. It was for the small businessowners to \ncreate the jobs that have gotten our economy moving again.\n  Let's recall who actually pays the taxes in this country. These are \nInternal Revenue figures, I might add. The top 1 percent of taxpayers \npays over a third of all of the taxes. One-third of all the taxes are \npaid by 1 percent of our population. The top 5 percent of the taxpayers \npay over half, 53.4 percent. So just the top 5 out of 100 are paying \nmore than half of all the income taxes in the country. The top 10 \npercent pay about 65 percent--in other words, almost two-thirds.\n  How much does the top 50 percent pay? Ninety-six percent. In other \nwords, the bottom 50 percent of taxpayers in this country pay less than \n4 percent of the taxes. So divide the taxpayers in this country into \ntwo parts. One of our Democratic colleagues running for President is \nfond of saying there are two Americas out there: the wealthy and not so \nwealthy.\n  Let's take the top 50 percent and the bottom 50 percent. The top 50 \npercent is paying 96 percent of the taxes, and the bottom 50 percent is \npaying less than 4 percent of the taxes. Naturally, if we are going to \ngive a tax cut to taxpayers, you are going to be cutting the taxes of \nthose who are paying most of the taxes. But I wouldn't call these \npeople all rich.\n  As a matter of fact, if you look at the categories, the top 50 \npercent makes $28,528. I wouldn't call that rich. How about the top 25 \npercent? We ought to be getting into the rich category here: $56,000 \nincome a year. Raising a family of four, that is not exactly a big \nincome these days. You can get by on it, but I wouldn't call those \npeople wealthy or ``the rich.''\n  I think we have to be a little bit careful. And I know my colleagues \nwouldn't do this, but there are those outside this Chamber who would \ndemagog this issue saying it is all about dividing America between the \nwealthy and the deserving, the so-called middle class.\n  We appreciate the fact that America is made up of every stripe of \nfolks, and they all contribute in one way or another, but when it comes \nto creating jobs, it turns out if you reduce the highest marginal rate, \nwhich is what we did, what we have done is to reduce the rate for small \nbusinesses which have created the jobs that have gotten the economy \ngoing again. That is the effect of the tax relief that was recommended \nby President Bush and this Congress approved.\n  I suggest we give a little credit to the President for helping to \nstimulate the economy, create jobs, provide economic growth that is \nunparalleled. We had over 8 percent growth in the third quarter last \nyear, and 4 percent in the last quarter. The stock market is doing very \nwell.\n  It seems to me the message ought to be one of hope; that we have \nturned this recession around; that we have reduced taxes. As a result, \nwe are creating jobs and actually things are looking pretty good.\n  If our Democratic colleagues would like to help us keep a lid on \nspending, then stop voting for every amendment that spends more money. \nIt is pretty much that simple, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/03/senate-section/article/S535-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S535-S536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXCERPTS FROM DAVID KAY TESTIMONY\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, with respect to the other subject which I \nwish to briefly deal with, this afternoon several of our Democratic \ncolleagues have criticized the President and the administration and \ninvoked the name of David Kay, a weapons inspector, to make the point \nthat they claim proves the administration somehow misled the American \npeople and the rest of the world in making the case for taking military \naction against Iraq. That is not true. I think it is time people start \nquoting David Kay properly to see just exactly what he said. I am \nbriefly going to do that.\n  I have a few excerpts from his testimony before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee on January 28 of this year. Senator McCain asked him \nthis question:\n\n       [Y]ou agree with the fundamental principle here that what \n     we did was justified and enhances the security of the world \n     by removing Saddam Hussein from power?\n\n  David Kay:\n\n       Absolutely.\n\n  Senator Kennedy asked this interesting question:\n\n       Many of us feel that the evidence so far leads to only one \n     conclusion: that what has happened was more than a failure of \n     intelligence, it was the result of manipulation of the \n     intelligence to justify a decision to go to war. . . .\n\n  David Kay responding:\n\n       All I can say is if you read the total body of intelligence \n     in the last 12 to 15 years that flowed on Iraq, I quite \n     frankly think it would be hard to come to a conclusion other \n     than Iraq was a gathering, serious threat to the world with \n     regard to WMD.\n\n  And WMD, as we know, is weapons of mass destruction.\n  How about its violations of the United Nations resolutions? Somehow \nthe impression has been created that maybe it was just a fraud, that \nIraq\n\n[[Page S536]]\n\nreally wasn't in violation of those resolutions, that somehow the \nweapons of mass destruction never existed. Here is what David Kay said:\n\n       In my judgment, based on the work that has been done to \n     this point of the Iraq Survey Group, and in fact, that I \n     reported to you in October, Iraq was in clear violation of \n     the terms of Resolution 1441. Resolution 1441 required that \n     Iraq report all of its activities: one last chance to come \n     clean about what it had. We have discovered hundreds of \n     cases, based on both documents, physical evidence, and the \n     testimony of Iraqis, of activities that were prohibited under \n     the initial U.N. Resolution 687 and that should have been \n     reported under 1441, with Iraqi testimony that not only did \n     they not tell the U.N. about this, they were instructed not \n     to do it, and they hid material.\n\n  Going on:\n\n       Iraq was in clear material violation of 1441. They \n     maintained programs and activities, and they certainly had \n     the intentions at a point to resume their program. So there \n     was a lot they wanted to hide because it showed what they \n     were doing was illegal. I hope we find even more evidence of \n     that.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from Arizona \ntalking about some of the statements that have been said on the floor \ntoday and really setting the record straight, which I think is very \nimportant.\n  I would like to continue to talk about the President's budget. I \nheard people say the budget is too much; we are going to have bigger \ndeficits. And then I hear people say: Oh, but it is not compassionate; \nwe are not spending enough.\n  What the President of the United States has submitted to Congress in \na budget is very bold, but it is also very simple. The President of the \nUnited States is doing what every family and every small business would \ndo when they are in a budget crunch, when their revenues are not \nmeeting their expenditures. He is prioritizing the spending.\n  He put as his very first priority the national defense of this \ncountry. He raised the spending from last year on national defense by 7 \npercent. He made a priority the homeland security of our country, \nprotecting our homeland. He increased spending 10 percent on homeland \nsecurity needs.\n  He decreased the growth in spending. We never decrease spending in \nWashington, DC. He holds discretionary spending to below 4 percent and \nnonsecurity-related spending to .5 percent--less than the rate of \ninflation.\n  The President is saying we are going to prioritize our family budget \njust like families all over our country are doing. We are going to \nprotect our country in national defense, we are going to protect the \ncitizens of our country in homeland defense, and we are going to cut \nback in areas that are not absolutely necessary.\n  I wish to talk about what the President has done and let the people \nof our country decide who is being responsible in our budgeting.\n  He advances the ongoing efforts in the war on terror by providing \n$1.2 billion for rebuilding Afghanistan, continuing to build the broad \ncoalition. NATO is now in Afghanistan in force to try to defeat that \ncenter of terrorism where the Taliban took hold and was helping al-\nQaida. We are making the commitment and keeping our word in \nAfghanistan.\n  There is $5.7 billion in military and economic assistance to front-\nline States supporting the United States in the war on terror.\n  The President is strengthening and transforming our defense \ncapabilities by providing $402 billion for the Department of Defense, \nan overall 7 percent increase. The President's budget is providing a \n3.5 percent pay raise for our military personnel; improving housing, \nwhich is something that I as the chairman of the Military Construction \nSubcommittee in the Appropriations Committee want to do, working with \nthe President to assure that we have a quality of life improvement for \nour military personnel who are on the front lines every day protecting \nour country and in harm's way in many instances.\n\n  He also provides a 10 percent increase in homeland security. We are \nproviding $5.3 billion for the Transportation Security Agency, a 20 \npercent increase; $6.2 billion for the Coast Guard, a 9 percent \nincrease, because the Coast Guard is being called on today to step up \nto the plate to patrol our borders and our shores. They are doing a \ngreat job and we are making sure they have the capability to do that \njob.\n  It doubles the level of first responder preparedness grants, \ntargeting the high threat areas that face greater risk. These are the \npolicemen, the firefighters, the front line first responders who can \nsave lives if we have another terrorist attack. In many instances, it \nis those people who are outside our Senate Chamber today working on \nperhaps a new terrorist attack that has occurred in the Senate as we \nspeak. The first responders are there trying to go through our \nbuildings, gathering the unopened mail to see if there is any more of \nthis ricin that was found in the Dirksen Office Building. We need to \nprepare those first responders so that everyone in America who might be \nvulnerable will also have an immediate response with trained personnel.\n  It protects our food supply by providing $553 million, a 180 percent \nincrease in funds for a new agriculture and food defense initiative; \n$274 million for a new vital surveillance initiative; $5.1 billion, an \n11 percent increase, for the FBI, to make sure we have the \ncounterterrorism effort that our FBI can give.\n  So these are the defense initiatives and the homeland security \ninitiatives the President of the United States is providing for our \ncountry. That is exactly what I hoped he would do, focus on the big \nthings that only the Federal Government can do to secure our country. \nThat is his first responsibility, and he met the first responsibility \nin the budget that is being criticized today.\n  Let us talk about the discretionary spending. Where are we putting \nthe priorities in discretionary spending? We are cutting back on the \nincreases in discretionary spending but we are holding the priorities \nthat are so important. We initiate a job creation plan. We are looking \nat an economic recovery that is just in its initial stages, but we have \nnot seen the jobs yet. The President is very concerned about people not \nhaving jobs. We are talking about a $250 million grant program for our \nNation's community colleges. These are the places where we can train \nfor jobs in the future. These are places where we can train for the \nhigh-demand occupations that are identified as the places where we can \nput people to work if they have the training.\n  Our community colleges are the unsung heroes and heroines in our \ncountry because they can put people back to work with training. They \ncan take people who have lost jobs in one sector and train them for \nsomething else. There is $333 million to help students make the \ntransition from high school to college.\n\n  He provides for a national energy policy, one of our best job \ncreators, to ensure affordable, reliable energy supply; upgrading our \nNation's electrical grid so we will not have blackouts and brownouts in \nany part of our country; promoting energy efficiency and increasing \ndomestic energy production, which will protect the environment and put \npeople back to work.\n  The budget will also spur job creation by providing more than $20 \nbillion in small business lending and equity programs. Small businesses \nare the economic engine of our country. If we free small businesses and \nhelp them with the capital they need to expand their businesses and \ngrow, we will be able to create the jobs that will stabilize our \ncountry.\n  So through the President's budget we are trying to increase job \ncreation in our country. We will not have a true recovery if we have a \njobless recovery. The President understands and knows that, and he is \ntrying to make sure we address that very important issue.\n  Let us talk about education. President Bush is the education \nPresident. He wants to make the commitments that will allow every child \nto reach his or her full potential in our country. His budget increases \ntitle I funding by $1 billion, 52 percent more than in 2001; it \nprovides $1 billion more for special education, a 75 percent increase \nsince 2001;\n\n[[Page S537]]\n\nit increases funding for early reading programs, a 12 percent increase \nover just last year. The President knows that if you can catch a child \nearly, you will be able to correct that child's reading problems and \nallow that child to absorb the education that allows the child then to \nreach his or her full potential. The budget helps 5 million students \npursue postsecondary education by providing $12.9 billion in Pell \ngrants, an $856 million increase.\n  He is fulfilling his promise to increase the funding for historically \nblack colleges and universities, minority-serving institutions, by 30 \npercent, $394 million by 2005. That is this year's budget. It provides \n$57 billion in direct and guaranteed student loans to postsecondary \nstudents and reforms higher education student aid by raising loan \nlimits for first year students, expanding options to offer courses \nonline and increasing loan forgiveness for those teaching certain \nsubjects in high poverty schools, a great trade, a win for everyone. If \nwe can put teachers in schools that have teacher shortages and forgive \nstudent loans, we will make up the interest that would be paid on those \nstudent loans by giving more children a chance for a quality education.\n  So how can one say the President is not doing right by education when \nhe is focusing on the increases in spending in education that will fund \nNo Child Left Behind, the act we passed to try to increase options for \neducation so that our public school education can compete with private \nschool education and give parents all the choices they could possibly \nneed to do the best for their children?\n  We know every parent has the dream for his or her child that that \nchild will be able to get a great education and send that child off \ninto America, into the world, fully ready to earn a living, raise a \nfamily, and have a good life.\n  Let us talk about health care. Let us talk about what the President's \npriorities are in the budget in health care. The President expands \nhealth care coverage by making it more affordable for small businesses \nto purchase coverage for employees through association health care \nplans. It is very important that we lower the number of uninsured \nAmericans. We can do that by making health care coverage available to \nsmall businesses that want to cover their employees and help their \nemployees but they cannot afford the premiums if they are a small \nbusiness. If we can pass association health care plans, as the \nPresident has requested us to do, we can take millions of Americans off \nthe uninsured rolls. That is what we are asking our colleagues to help \nthe President do.\n  It implements the prescription drug discount card to give immediate \ndiscounts of 10 to 25 percent to cardholders. In the next couple of \nmonths, our seniors will be able to take those prescription cards and \nbuy drugs with a 10 to 25 percent discount. So that is immediate \nhelp. That is while we are also building up a system that will give \neven better choices and more options for prescription drug coverage to \nour seniors. The President's budget will give $600 annually in \nimmediate assistance to low-income individuals to pay for prescription \ndrugs. So the low-income people are going to get that $600 direct, \nimmediate assistance. And then the drug benefit plan should be \nimplemented by 2006.\n\n  The President does provide incentives in his budget that will provide \nimmediate help for our seniors for prescription drug discounts now, and \nto work toward the options that will provide real help for a \nprescription drug benefit for our seniors.\n  Environment: The President has several things in his budget to \nenhance the Nation's supply of clean, affordable energy by increasing \nfunding for clean energy resources, by trying to have more research \ninto hydrogen and fuel cell research and development. He wants a zero \nemissions coal fuel powerplant and he wants to fund development of that \nin this budget he is presenting.\n  He presents the President's Healthy Forests Initiative to prevent the \ncatastrophic wildfires we saw raging through western America. It was \njust horrible to see what was happening in California this last year, \nthe forest fires that were raging and taking people's homes as well as \ntheir property. The President has a $58 million increase to remove \nexcess wood and brush that fuel these fires.\n  He would accelerate the Great Lakes cleanup by providing $45 million, \na fivefold increase over previous levels to clean up the Great Lakes.\n  He tackles the remaining Superfund sites. We all know the toughest \nsites to clean up are these Superfund sites. But he is willing to take \nthis on and increase, by 50 percent, the funding for Superfund cleanup \nso we will be able to get a handle on the worst environmental hazardous \nareas that we have in our country.\n  I have heard all the talks on the Senate floor today that have \ncriticized the President's budget. I think the President has a balanced \nbudget. He is prioritizing where we need to prioritize. He is providing \nfor the national defense for our country. He is providing for the \nhomeland security of our country. He is putting the money in education. \nHe is putting the money into job creation and job training, and he is \nhelping to meet the health care costs of our senior citizens and people \nwho work for small businesses.\n  Our President presented to Congress a balanced budget. Everybody can \nfind something to criticize, something they would not prioritize the \nsame way. But the President is leading and the President has presented \nus a budget that will cut the deficit in half in 5 years while \nmaintaining the homeland security and defense our people have asked him \nto provide. I think we should work with the President to pass this \nbudget and have some budget authority that will keep us from \noverspending and increasing the deficit further.\n  Mr. President, this should be a team, not a critical debating \nsociety. We should be teaming together to help America get through the \nwar on terrorism, fund our priorities, cut the deficits, and be \nresponsible to the people who elected us, as the President is trying to \ndo.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will have a few remarks at the close on \nwhat has been a difficult day, but very positive in many ways as we \nhave come together and faced the challenges before this body and have \nbeen able to conduct very productive and very useful business over the \ncourse of the day in spite of a major distraction on the outside that \nwas magnified and illustrated by the fact that three Senate office \nbuildings closed and people do not have access to a lot of the papers \nin their own offices. In spite of that, we are continuing the Nation's \nbusiness in a very productive way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/03/senate-section/article/S537-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S537-S538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMENDING A FLORIDA IMMIGRATION OFFICER\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank the leaders for giving \nme this time. I want to have the Senate recognize an American citizen \nwho, very likely, prevented the entry into the United States of what is \nsuspected as the 20th hijacker. I want to tell you this story about \nthis immigration officer, who is at the Orlando International Airport. \nHis name is Jose Melendez Perez.\n  Mr. Melendez, a little more than a month before the attacks on \nSeptember 11, 2001, denied entry into the United States at the Orlando \nAirport of a Saudi national who had arrived at the airport from the \nMiddle East by way of London. Federal authorities now believe that this \nman, Mohamed al-Qahtani, was the missing 20th hijacker. He was later \ncaptured in Afghanistan. He is now being held in Guantanamo Bay, a \nplace I have just visited with our four-star general, General Hill, \njust before Christmas to have Christmas dinner with our troops who are \nconducting that operation there.\n  This story is quite an interesting story. It is beginning to get a \nflurry of recognition, and that is just recognition for this great \nAmerican. The fact is, he was just doing his job, but he was so expert \nin it that he stopped the entry into the United States of this person. \nHe alertly denied al-Qahtani entry into the Orlando Airport based on a \ncombination of indicators that suggested he was up to no good. Mr. \nMelendez's experience, training, and instincts served our Nation very \nwell.\n  It is interesting that what he told me, when I met with him last \nFriday to congratulate him, was that he just got\n\n[[Page S538]]\n\na feeling about this guy as he was referred to Mr. Melendez for \nsecondary questioning, since he did not speak English. After \nquestioning al-Qahtani and discovering many holes in his story--holes \nabout why he was there, how long he was going to stay, who was going to \nmeet him--and it is thought, very possibly, that it was the hijacker \npilot of the first plane that went into the World Trade Center who was \nthe guy upstairs to pick him up--Mohamed Atta. We don't know that for \nsure. But also there was the fact that he didn't have a return ticket \nor enough cash to purchase one.\n  After having that uneasy feeling about none of these answers and a \nvery belligerent manner, by the way, by the man being questioned, Mr. \nMelendez put it into his own hands to make the decision that he was \ngoing to have him arrested, put into detention, and sent back the next \nday on a plane. By refusing al-Qahtani entry into the country, Mr. \nMelendez very well may have helped save many additional lives on \nSeptember 11.\n  So this is a proud professionalism in the Immigration Service which \nso often gets nothing but complaints. I think it is time for us to \nstand up and salute Mr. Melendez and his service. He modestly protested \nto me last Friday that he was only doing his job. But we know because \nof the replicated actions of folks like him being done every day, not \nonly in our Border Patrol and other immigration activities, but in the \nState Department and in decisions being made as to whether or not to \ngrant a visa in embassies around this country, and with all of our \nintelligence services as they are making these decisions day by day, \nhour by hour, it is working to protect us.\n  Mr. Melendez has shown us what correct protection of our borders \nlooks like. Now we want to rededicate and congratulate all of the hard-\nworking colleagues at the Department of Homeland Security. We want to \nprovide them with the resources they need to protect our borders and \nthe ports of entry. Dedicated security personnel are not there to make \ntravel more difficult; they are there to make us safer. Mr. Melendez in \nthis instance apparently prevented the compounding of a national \ntragedy on September 11, 2 years ago.\n\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity that I could recognize \na wonderful American, an American who spent 27 years in the U.S. Army.\n  When Mr. Melendez retired, he decided to continue his Federal \nservice, in this case with the Immigration Service. He is a wonderful \nAmerican who has a big family centered in Orlando, with nine \ngrandchildren spread over several cities and some back in his native \nPuerto Rico.\n  I am very proud today to share his story so our colleagues in the \nSenate might also recognize his brand of modest heroism.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/03/senate-section/article/S538-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                             ANGEL ARELLANO\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize Angel \nArellano's efforts in raising funds for the Chaffee Zoo in Fresno, CA.\n  On Thanksgiving Day, after listening to a family conversation about \nthe Chaffee Zoo's financial struggles, Angel Arellano, a 9-year-old \ngirl from Fresno, CA, wrote a letter to the editor of the Fresno Bee. \nHer letter contained $1.00 and urged all Fresno residents to match her \ndonation to help pay for the Chaffee Zoo's much needed repairs. Miss \nArellano's letter expressed her anguish at the animals' precarious \nfuture. She wrote that the animals deserved food, water, and a warm \nhome. Her plea sparked a movement to save the zoo. Her heartfelt letter \ncaught the attention of past and present Fresno residents, inspiring \nthousands of individuals to send donations, ranging from $1.00 to \n$10,000.00. Currently, total pledges and donations have reached nearly \n$180,000.00 and have come from as far away as Great Britain.\n  Angel Arellano's concern motivated people in Fresno and around the \nworld to help save a Fresno institution. Her letter conjured memories \nof past visits to the zoo and reminded people of the joy felt by \nchildren when visiting with family while spending a Sunday in the \nsunshine, enjoying one of Fresno's treasures.\n  Angel is a wonderful example of one person making a difference. To \nher, I say thank you.

A bill to repeal the sunset of the Economic Growth and Tax \nRelief Reconciliation Act of 2001 with respect to the affordable \neducation provisions of such Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am introducing two education tax bills \ntoday. These bills will help us make permanent the $30 billion in \neducation tax incentives that were contained in the 2001 tax bill.\n  The first bill will extend and make permanent the tuition deduction \nthat was enacted in the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation \nAct of 2001, Public Law 107-16, or EGTRRA. A lot of people think we \ndon't spend enough money on education, but they also don't think we \nshould make the 2001 tax cuts permanent. I don't know how they can \njustify that position. The education tax incentives in the 2001 tax \nbill have done a whole lot of good. The tuition tax deduction is \navailable only through December 31, 2005. The cost of the provision for \nthose four years was about $10 billion. So you can see that it was very \nexpensive.\n  For parents struggling to send their children to college, the tuition \ntax deduction has been very important. Some of them probably wish it \nwere set at a higher level, but at between $2,000 and $4,000 depending \non your income, it is still a beneficial tax incentive for the middle \nclass.\n  The second bill that I am introducing today will make the rest of the \nEGTRRA education tax provisions permanent, as well as the deduction for \nteacher classroom materials that was passed in the stimulus package of \nMarch 2002. That provision expired at the end of last year so it is \nvery important that we enact it on a permanent basis and do so as soon \nas practicable.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in sponsoring these bills and will \nagree to consider them and pass them in the Senate in the next month or \ntwo.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2048\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation \nAct of 1977 to reauthorize collection of reclamation fees, revise the \nabandoned mine reclamation program, promote remining, authorize the \nOffice of Surface Mining to collect the black lung excise tax, and make \nsundry other changes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I will introduce legislation which \nis entitled the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Program Extension and \nReform Act of 2004. As I have explained briefly before, I do so because \nthis program is going to be unveiled tomorrow at a ceremony in the \nPennsylvania State Capitol attended by Secretary of the Interior Norton \nin addition to Governor Rendell and a number of other officials. While \nI would like to be present in Pennsylvania for the event, the Senate \nwill be in session and there is important business to be conducted \nhere. So in my absence there, I thought it appropriate to introduce \nthis bill. I had planned to do so tomorrow, but there is a joint \nsession of Congress in the morning and I am advised there may not be\n\n[[Page S542]]\n\nmorning business. So I am taking just a few moments of floor time to \nintroduce the bill now.\n  The Bush administration has already announced the outline of the bill \nso I am not in any way preempting the administration by the \nintroduction of this legislation. As I noted earlier, the \nadministration had made this legislation available to me for \nintroduction in conjunction with others in the Pennsylvania delegation, \nand I am pleased to do so because it will address a very serious \nproblem for my State.\n  By far, Pennsylvania has the most extensive problem of any of the \nStates in the Union, where we have some 250,000 acres which are in need \nof reclamation. Some 2,400 miles of streams are affected on our water \nsupply because Pennsylvania has been so heavily mined. Shortly after I \ncame to the Senate in the early 1980s, a little town in Pennsylvania \nnamed Centralia received national and international attention when a \nyoung man fell into a deep pit and a fire was burning there. It was a \nfire which resulted from an abandoned mine. For those, if any, who may \nbe watching on C-SPAN, these fires rage underground burning unmined \ncoal. This fire was raging. A large hole enveloped and the young man \nfell many feet below the surface of the terrain. Fortunately, he was \nrescued.\n  It was necessary to move the entire town at a very substantial cost \nborne in significant measure by the Federal Government, not entirely \nbecause homeowners could not fully recoup the losses of their houses. \nThis bill will provide some $3 billion to take care of health and \nsafety. It will be a reauthorization to the year 2018 on an \nauthorization bill which is set to expire in September of this year. \nThere will be a phase-out of payments ramped down until the year 2018 \nwhen it is projected that the problem will be solved. This bill will \nimprove the flexibility for the States where they can make a choice of \ntheir projects and make a decision based on where they need to go on \nwater quality.\n  It is obviously a very important matter for the environment, and \nenvironmental protection is a high priority in our country. I am \npleased to see President Bush and his administration move ahead on this \nimportant item. It takes care of all of the smaller States with a \nminimum allocation of some $2 million. There is some assistance for the \nCombined Benefit Fund, which has been established for the benefit of \nthe retired mine workers, where the health and benefit plans had been \nabrogated. We had legislation introduced and enacted several years ago, \nled by the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller, in conjunction \nwith Senator Byrd, which I cosponsored, and we tried to provide for the \nretirement health benefits for the mine workers. This bill will make an \nallocation which will be helpful in that regard. It will not entirely \nsatisfy the matter.\n  As I noted, this is President Bush's top priority in the Interior \nsection of his budget. Secretary of the Interior Norton will tour some \nmines in Pennsylvania. Again, I express my regrets not being able to be \nwith her and the Governor when the event will be held in the rotunda of \nthe State Capitol at 11 o'clock tomorrow. Burt we intend to have a news \nconference here in Washington simultaneously with her announcement \nthere.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2049\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, tomorrow at 11 a.m., the Senate and House \nwill conduct a joint meeting to hear an address by President Aznar of \nSpain. We do ask Senators be in the Senate Chamber at 10:40 a.m. so \nSenators can proceed together to the Hall of the House of \nRepresentatives for that address.\n  At 1 p.m., the Senate will reconvene and resume consideration of S. \n1072, the highways bill. Notwithstanding the\n\n[[Page S546]]\n\nrecent events, it is still my intention to complete action on this bill \nbefore the February recess. Indeed, with the progress demonstrated \ntoday, I believe we can indeed accomplish just that.\n  I do inform my colleagues that rollcall votes should be anticipated \nduring tomorrow's session as we begin the amendment process. I \nencourage Senators to come to the floor to offer and debate amendments. \nIn addition to the highway bill amendments, the Senate may also \nconsider any available judicial nominations tomorrow. We will alert all \nMembers as these votes are scheduled.\n  With regard to the events that have occurred over the course of \ntoday, I do appreciate the patience of all of the Members with the \nrestrictions we have had to put in place in terms of access to papers \nand access to their offices. First and foremost, our attention is on \nthe staff and on the safety of the Senate family, the extended Senate \nfamily that begins with our own employees in our offices and then \nextends out through the Senate community and, indeed, beyond the \nimmediate community here.\n  It has been a difficult day but, as I said earlier, it has given us \nan opportunity to really come together in some remarkable ways. I \ncontrast it with a lot that we had to go through several years ago with \nanthrax, which was a very difficult time as well. It was a separate \nagent, but now another agent has been directed against this body. These \nagents are weapons that kill. People ask, is it terrorism? Was it a \ncriminal act? To me, both of those demonstrate the intent to harm and \nto hurt. Both were acts of terror. The whole purpose is not just to \nphysically harm but also to cause insecurity among people.\n\n  We have learned over the last several years the best way to alleviate \nand tone down that feeling of insecurity when dealing with unknown \nagents--agents that have never been used this way in the history of \nmankind, poisonous toxins or biological agents that for the most part \nwe cannot really see you can see the powder, but you cannot touch it, \nand you know the weapons kill when they get into the immediate \nsurroundings and are directed at individuals--is the pulling together \nand the sharing of information, with openness, holding press \nconferences, using the Blackberries, the computer and the telephone, \nthe personal interaction. Put that together with good information and \naccurate information and things can work out in a smooth way, in a way \nthat allays the great fears we all have when dealing with the new \npowerful agents, we are all more comfortable, more secure, we are all a \nlittle more relaxed.\n  This is very serious business. There is nothing more serious. We are \ntalking about the health and safety and welfare of individuals and, \nthrough those individuals, their families. It extends not just on \nCapitol Hill but the feeling of insecurity around the country.\n  I keep coming back to the individuals and the families. I do want to \nshare with everybody that the individuals in my office are doing fine. \nThe people who happened to go through the office where this powder was \ndiscovered took appropriate procedures on behalf of my staff that went \ninto effect immediately in the response by the police and HAZ-MAT \npersonnel, with appropriate notification all the way up through late \nlast night. I have been very pleased and very proud. They are all doing \nfine. We have had two conference calls today, one bright and early this \nmorning. Many did not get home until 2 or 2:30 last night, after \nwaiting, of course, for some of the latest results. We had a conference \ncall with everyone early this morning before the Senate session and we \njust completed another one. We are providing access to medical \npersonnel and physicians and trying to answer as many questions as we \npossibly can with them. I am mighty proud of them and things are \nlooking fine.\n  It is remarkable also for me to see, having been involved in both of \nthese attacks with toxins, chemical acts and bioterror agents, the real \nintegration and the working together which people do not see. I share \nwith my colleagues our thanks to the various staff members who, \nstarting immediately yesterday and working through today, include the \nUnited States Capitol Hill Police--and they serve on both the Senate \nand the House side--who demonstrated excellent leadership. Their \nexperience and the protocols immediately came together, working very \nclosely with the response team and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  We all asked questions. Yes, you saw a powder, but how far does it \naerosolize? How far does it travel over the Capitol grounds? The EPA \nhas been instrumental over the last day having prepared for this sort \nof event over the last several years.\n  The United States Marine Corps; a lot of people say, What do you \nmean? The United States Marine Corps has been very helpful in the \nprocess of getting things back up and running.\n  The Joint Terrorism Task Force is something we did not even think \nvery much about 3 years ago. And that joint terrorism task force is now \nan organized group. They were prepared for this.\n  The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been working diligently over \nthe last 24 hours with us and the Department of Homeland Security.\n  As a physician, of course, I usually start with recognizing the \nmedical personnel. In all public events, we will have the Senate \nCapitol attending physician there. He, again, walked us through the \nanthrax threat. He has more experience than anybody in the world today \nin terms of a bioterrorist or chemical terrorist attack in an \ninstitution or society such as this, having gone through anthrax and \nnow the ricin attack, and that is John Eisold who does a tremendous \njob. One of his physicians was with my staff constantly all last night \nfrom early in the evening until the early hours of the morning, sitting \nwith my staff throughout, answering questions and reassuring them and \nappropriately advising them and counseling them.\n  The Sergeant at Arms, Bill Pickle, who was not here when we had the \nanthrax attack but who has been here over the course of the year, \nagain, is doing a superb job. He and I have talked to each other at \nleast every hour except for maybe two hours between 4 and 6 early this \nmorning.\n  Secretary of the Senate Emily Reynolds' office right now serves as a \ncentral hotline point and control room in terms of coordination.\n  The list could go on and on. I mention all this because Senator \nDaschle and I have worked over the course of today and we are doing our \nvery best in terms of the communication, getting accurate information \nout, and we are continuing to do just that over the next several days.\n  The Senate has not missed a beat. We have been in session, had a \nproductive day. We are in session tomorrow, for another productive day. \nWe will have a joint meeting of Congress to hear an address of the \nPresident of Spain, a wonderful friend to the United States of America, \nPresident Aznar.\n  Following that, as I mentioned earlier, we will come into session at \n1 p.m. and votes will occur.\n  I mentioned we are moving one committee over to the House side; other \ncommittees will be meeting in the Capitol. I do ask that individual \ncommittee members check with their committee chairman for the location \nof individual hearings. We do have three Senate office buildings which \nare closed: the Hart building, Dirksen, and Russell. All three Senate \noffice buildings will be closed throughout tomorrow. It is primarily to \nfacilitate in the most time-efficient fashion the collection and \nremoval of mail. That is the primary purpose. That is well underway as \nwe speak.\n  With that, I believe I will bring this session to a close. We will be \nback working hard tomorrow and we will be staying in touch with \neveryone over the course of tonight.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, very briefly, I am the only former Capitol \npoliceman here who is a Senator. I have such great respect for the work \nthey do. When I was a Capitol policeman, I did not have near the \nresponsibilities, not even close to what goes on now in this modern \npolice force. We have what I think is, if not the best police force, \none of the best. They are the ones who are really talking about first \nline responders; they are that.\n  The problem occurred with anthrax, or with this ricin; they are the \nfirst to go there. They do it with courage and determination. We see \nthese men and women a lot of times standing at their duty stations and \nsome people wonder\n\n[[Page S547]]\n\nwhat they do. Well, every day they are working--for lack of a better \nway to say it, as happened in the Capitol just a few years ago, they \ntake bullets for us. They are well trained in any aspect of law \nenforcement, as well trained as anyone in the country.\n  I underscore the remarks of the majority leader. We are very proud of \nour Capitol police force.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/03/senate-section/article/S547-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 1 P.M., WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 2004\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
