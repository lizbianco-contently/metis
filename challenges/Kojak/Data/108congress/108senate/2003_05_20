Mr. President, this morning there will be a period of \nmorning business with the time equally divided between Senator Cornyn \nand the minority leader or his designee. Following morning business, \nthe Senate will resume debate on the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill. Two amendments are pending which relate to TRICARE. \nThis morning, the chairman and the ranking member will be working on a \ntime agreement as to when we may dispose of those pending amendments. \nRollcall votes are, therefore, expected prior to the recess for the \nrespective party luncheons.\n  Other Members who intend to offer amendments to the Defense \nauthorization bill are encouraged to notify the chairman and ranking \nmember in order to schedule consideration of their amendments. Senators \nshould expect rollcall votes on amendments throughout the day in order \nto make progress on this important bill. It is hoped that we can finish \nthe bill either today or tomorrow. As a reminder, this week the Senate \nwill consider the debt limit extension under a previous consent \nagreement.\n  Finally, I would add it is hoped that final action on the jobs and \neconomic growth package from conference will be voted on this week. In \nfact, I want to notify my colleagues that it is my intention, as soon \nas we receive that conference report, to bring it to the floor. An \nagreement is being reached between the two Houses on this conference \nreport. I am very optimistic that we will be able to address that this \nweek.\n  We will have a very busy week with the Department of Defense \nauthorization, the jobs and economic growth conference report that I \njust mentioned, the debt limit, and we are working to make progress on \nunemployment insurance which has to be addressed also this week. That \nexpires on May 30. Thus, we are responsible for acting on that as well \nthis week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/20/senate-section/article/S6641-7", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6641-S6642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEDICARE AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have a few opening comments I wanted to \nbriefly mention on an issue we are going to be talking about and \ndebating on the floor during the last 2 weeks of next month; that is, \nMedicare and prescription drugs. At this point, let me make those \ncomments, and then we will proceed with the schedule as planned.\n  It was in 1963 that President John F. Kennedy said, when leading the \nfight to enact Medicare at that time:\n\n       A proud and resourceful nation can no longer ask its people \n     to live in constant fear of a serious illness for which \n     adequate funds are not available.\n\n\n[[Page S6642]]\n\n\n  These are the words I want to stress.\n  He said:\n\n       We owe the right of dignity in sickness, as well as in \n     health.\n\n  Protecting the health of our Nation's seniors was the right thing to \ndo in the early 1960s, and it is the right thing for us to do now. Back \nin 1965, Medicare was designed for the way medicine was practiced at \nthat point in time, and that was to treat acute or episodic illnesses \nthat would bring people to the hospitals. It was not designed at that \ntime, nor could it be designed at that time, to keep up with the \ndazzling innovations, the creativity, and the dynamic discoveries that \nwere being made almost on a daily basis. These great advances have and \nwill continue to transform medicine. We have a structure with Medicare \nthat simply is not flexible enough or adaptable enough to assimilate or \ncapture those great discoveries that are being made. That leads us to \nunacceptable gaps in coverage. One of those gaps has become apparent to \nus all, whether we are seniors or individuals with disabilities, or \nthose of us in the political arena listening very carefully to our \nconstituents. That is the gap for prescription drugs.\n  What seniors deserve is health care security. Unlike in the 1960s \nwhen it was designed--there haven't been that many changes, really, \nsince the 1960s--today that health care security does involve good \npreventive care, access to affordable prescription drug protection from \nthose unexpected catastrophic costs which can reach astronomical \nlevels, and access to the modern technology that I mentioned before.\n  Since it doesn't include all of those things, it has not given the \nsecurity I and I believe all of us believe seniors deserve.\n  If you look at certain technologies such as preventive tests for \nbreast cancer and prostate cancer, it literally required an act of \nCongress before they could be covered by Medicare. We in Congress \nsimply cannot respond, with all of the other responsibilities, to each \nand every innovation that comes through. We simply can't do it.\n  More basic care, such as cholesterol screening in my own field of \nheart-lung cardiology--you all know the importance of cholesterol--is \nnot covered today. In the end, it creates lapses in a very good system. \nMedicare is a very good system, but it is simply not a system that is \nup to date with the quality of care that we could give our seniors \ntoday.\n  I would say that we do have an obligation--I would call it a moral \nobligation--to ensure that Medicare does provide the highest quality of \ncare to our seniors that we are able to provide and which I believe we \ncan provide.\n  The Senate Finance Committee has been working for the past several \nmonths to develop such a plan. We are building on the work of a lot of \npast bipartisan efforts in this body: the Breaux-Frist plan, the House-\npassed legislation, the Senate tripartisan plan of the last Congress, \nand the President's framework for reform.\n  In early June, the Finance Committee will be addressing this matter \nunder the leadership of Senator Grassley, working with Senator Baucus, \nand we will take this proposal to the floor, as amended through \ncommittee, sometime in those last 2 weeks of June.\n  It is my hope and it is my intention to vote on final passage of such \nlegislation before we adjourn for the July 4 Independence Day recess.\n  Once passed, we will begin to provide that prescription drug coverage \nfor seniors and improve that system for health care security for our \nseniors.\n  I do think we need to address this issue in a bipartisan way. This is \na big bill. It is a big expansion of Medicare. It is going to take \npeople on both sides of the aisle to address this important goal of \nprotecting the health of our seniors.\n  I mention all this only because it is so big and so large that I \nencourage my colleagues to start studying and restudying the issue, \neven though we have a very busy week now, and then we have our recess \nduring which we will be with our constituents back at home, and then we \nwill come back to an energy bill, and then Medicare. I want people to \nstart preparing for that right now because it is such a large challenge \nbefore us.\n  Our Nation's seniors are depending on us to do the right thing for \nthem. With the appropriate planning, with the appropriate discussions, \nagain, in a bipartisan way, we will be able to deliver on that promise.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Chair announce morning business. Has that been \ndone?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about the \nrebuilding of Iraq and, more importantly, the creation of a democratic \nIraq.\n  Iraq is situated in the very cradle of civilization. It has an \nancient and colorful history. And although it is easy to overlook now, \nBaghdad itself was once viewed as a center of learning and cultural \nactivity until it was hijacked by the fascist regime of Saddam Hussein.\n  Today, Iraq is a hive of clan warfare, looting, and violent chaos. \nThere are competing political groups, armed criminal gangs, and street \nthugs. The Iraqi people are free of Saddam, but they are not yet free \nof fear.\n  The situation is complex, delicate, and decidedly unpleasant. But \nunless America and our coalition partners act quickly and decisively, \nself-government will be recalled years from now as only a fleeting \ndream for the people of Iraq.\n  I believe there is still hope and opportunity--hope that the free \npeople of Iraq can conquer the anarchy that controls their streets, and \nopportunity to fulfill the promise of a thriving democratic Iraq.\n  That dream may seem far off in Baghdad today, but as John Adams once \nsaid: ``People and nations are forged in the fires of adversity.''\n  In order for Iraq to grow and blossom from the rubble, it requires \nsecurity. It requires order. It requires the rule of law.\n  First, we must begin by ensuring the basic security of the Iraqi \npeople. People must be able to buy food at the market without fearing \narmed robbery or kidnapping. They must be able to worship without \nfearing snipers or skirmishes. Their children must be able to go to \nschool without hearing the sound of gunfire nearby.\n  The Middle East looks like the Old West right now, and we need lawmen \nto help restore the peace. We must eliminate the threats posed by what \nremains\n\n[[Page S6643]]\n\nof the Baathist Party and the common criminals who control the streets \nand highways. We must end the looting and restore the property rights \nof the Iraqi people. We simply cannot construct the foundation of a \npeaceful and just society when there is still no security in Iraq.\n  Dr. Karim Hassan, director general of Iraq's electricity commission \nput it this way: ``Give me security, and I will give you electricity.''\n  The brave men and women of our Armed Forces have done heroic work in \nIraq. I know I speak for the people of my State of Texas, for all \nAmericans, and indeed for all freedom-loving people when I give thanks \nthat the operation in Iraq was concluded swiftly with a minimum loss of \ncoalition lives. But it would be a grave mistake to burden our military \nalone with the job of ensuring security for the Iraqi people. Indeed, \nthat is not their principal mission.\n  After security is restored, a functioning legal system must be \nestablished. There is the immediate problem of establishing a police \nforce. Under Saddam's regime, the police were nothing more than shock \ntroops bent on fulfilling the dictator's tyrannical bidding. Now they \nmust act to protect and defend the people they formerly dominated and \nabused. The police in Iraq are no longer the law, violently expressed; \nthey must now enforce and be held accountable to the law.\n  No system of justice can survive long in the absence of law and \norder, and there can be no democratic Iraqi state as long as \nlawlessness reigns.\n  Secondly, we must help the Iraqi people forge a nation governed by \nlaws, not men. There are multiple proposals being considered for the \nIraqi Constitution. While Iraq is clearly in a state of transition, it \nhas a rich and ancient legal history. These traditions should be the \nfoundation for the laws of this reborn nation, the constitution for a \nreborn Iraq.\n  We should not kid ourselves that we will see a mirror image of \nJeffersonian America circa 1787. The Iraqis will build on their own \nhistorical traditions, a history that stretches all the way back to the \nCode of Hammurabi.\n  Despite our relatively short history, America has one of the longest \nuninterrupted political traditions of any nation in the world. The late \nAllan Bloom once pointed out that what sets America apart is the \nunambiguous nature of that tradition: ``[I]t's meaning is articulated \nin simple, rational speech, that is immediately comprehensible and \npowerfully persuasive to all normal human beings. America tells one \nstory: the unbroken, ineluctable progress of freedom and equality.''\n  There are clear differences between America, where government from \nits inception existed to preserve and protect freedom, and Iraq, where \ngovernment, until recently, existed to limit freedom and serve as the \ninstrument of oppression.\n  Iraq's government must undergo a fundamental change, and a \nconstitution that guarantees basic human rights will go a long way \ntowards changing it. The constitution of Iraq must, like the \nconstitution of America, tell one story.\n  The Japanese constitution of 1947 is one example that can show the \nway. Following World War II, Japan's new constitution placed sovereign \nauthority with the people and their representatives, in place of the \nlongstanding authoritarian system under rule of the emperor. It \nrenounced war as a sovereign right, and required that the country \nmaintain armed forces for purposes of defense and police functions \nalone, not for purposes of aggression.\n  If there is to be a reasonable chance of success for this national \ndemocratic experiment, similar measures must be included in the new \nIraqi constitution.\n  At the inception of this country, George Washington, instead of \nseeking to rule as an emperor, a king, a president for life, returned \nto his Virginia farm, handing over the reins of the fledgling American \nnation at the end of two terms in office. The act was astounding at the \ntime, a political humility unknown since the era of Cincinnatus. It \nprompted his old foe, King George the Third, to call Washington ``the \ngreatest character of the age.''\n  But Washington's actions were no accident. Washington recognized that \nfor America to truly be a nation where the people were sovereign, it \nmust first be a nation of laws.\n  We do not yet know which leader Iraqis will choose. But the identity \nof the democratic leader is far less important in the long term than \nthe establishment of the rule of law, and not men. While leaders come \nand go, it is the law that makes a nation.\n  Third, the Iraqis need a strong and independent judicial system. This \nprocess will be difficult and slow going, but we ignore its importance \nat our peril.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist has called an independent judiciary ``one of \nthe crown jewels of our system of government.'' With tireless effort by \nfreedom-loving Iraqis and their friends dedicated to the cause, I \nbelieve that the same can be true for the new Iraq.\n  The central authority in Baghdad currently exists in a vague and \nindeterminate form, and it is likely that the political climate there \nwill fluctuate frequently over the next few years. The judiciary must \nexist as an independent actor in this process, to enforce basic human \nrights, protect private property, and ensure stable conditions that \nwill lay the foundation for the prosperity and happiness of the Iraqi \npeople.\n  To understand the full measure of Iraq's cruel and inhumane regime, \nyou need look no further than Iraq's mass graves and the packed prisons \nof Baghdad, where the children of Saddam's political opponents were \nimprisoned and viciously abused. Under Saddam Hussein, prisoners were \nroutinely starved, tortured, and murdered. The new government of Iraq \nmust be just and humane, carrying out the duly rendered penalties of a \ncivilized society based on the rule of law.\n  The rule of law will foster and facilitate prosperity that will \nimprove the quality of life for all Iraqis. There is great promise in a \nnation where 60% of the population is under the age of 25, and more \nthan 40 per cent under the age of 14. All that most have known is \nbrutal dictatorship, fear and poverty. Soon, they will know freedom, \nsecurity, and a better life.\n  With the foundation of legally enforced rights in place, Iraq will no \nlonger be a place of fear for travelers or economic investors. As a \nnation, they will once again fulfill the true calling of the Qur'an, \nwhere it is written: ``Be kind . . . unto the neighbor who is of kin, \nand to the neighbor who is a stranger, and to the companion at your \nside, and to the traveler.''\n  The Iraqi people will be free to start businesses and open shops, to \nspeak and to assemble, to experiment and study--all in pursuit of \nbetter lives, rather than the interest of Saddam Hussein or any other \ndespot. Iraq will flourish as a nation of law and order, where the \ninvisible hand of the free market will benefit both the society of Iraq \nand the entire region of the Middle East.\n  The world is watching Iraq closely. And in order for Iraq to grow and \nblossom, in order to ensure the freedom of the Iraqi people, the new \nIraq must be founded on security and the rule of law.\n  I am thankful--as I know my colleagues are--that the armed conflict \nin Iraq reached such a swift end, with so few coalition lives lost. The \ntasks that lie before us in Iraq are in many ways are more complex and \nintricate, and their end is not yet in sight.\n  For the sake of those who risked and lost their lives so that the \nIraqi people might know the blessings of liberty--for the sake of the \npromise of peace in the Middle East--and for the sake of the children \nof Iraq--we must not fail.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the ranking member of the committee and \nmyself are prepared this morning to entertain any amendments that \ncolleagues wish to bring to the floor. I will be on the floor, and I am \nsure my colleague will outline a timetable for the amendments he knows \nof thus far on his side. On my side, there are no amendments that I \nknow of right now. I do urge our colleagues to come forward.\n  The distinguished majority leader and the Democratic leader have made \npossible these 2 days for us to work on this bill. I know my colleague \nfrom Michigan, the ranking member, and I are ready to move right along \non it. At this time, I yield the floor, hopefully for the purpose of my \ncolleague speaking to the amendments he knows of.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I thank my good friend from Virginia. I \nthink the business before us is to dispose of the Graham of South \nCarolina second-degree amendment and then the underlying Daschle \namendment. I do not know if any of the opponents of the two amendments \nare on the floor to speak, but I think we should dispose of those. It \nis my understanding that after those amendments are disposed of, \nSenator Jack Reed will be ready to proceed with an amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Michigan yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. On this side, we are ready for a vote on the Graham of \nSouth Carolina amendment. We ask that vote occur around 11:30 today, if \nat all possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will consult with the majority leader. I will note a \nwillingness on this side to voice-vote the Graham of South Carolina \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. We would not be willing to do that. We want a rollcall vote \non that amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. The time the Senator is recommending would be?\n  Mr. REID. The time would be 11:30 to have a vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  Mr. REID. I think we will probably only need one vote. We would \naccept Daschle by voice if, in fact, the Graham of South Carolina \namendment passes, which I have an indication that it will. In the \nmeantime, staff will work toward that goal with the two leaders and \nother people can come to the floor and offer amendments, which are \ncertainly waiting to be offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the chairman will yield for an inquiry, if we could put \nin a very brief quorum call, I think I would be able to straighten out \nwhich of the other amendments might be offered while we are awaiting a \nvote on the Graham of South Carolina amendment. I need to make two \nquick calls and could then give a report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I understand we are now on the Defense \nauthorization bill. I will speak about a number of matters in the \nlegislation. I also will talk about a couple of amendments I am hoping \nto offer. I deeply appreciate the leadership of Senator Warner and \nSenator Levin. There are few in the Senate for whom I have higher \nregard. I think both of them do an extraordinary job for this country. \nOur country is blessed to have their leadership during these difficult \ntimes.\n  Much of what is in the Defense authorization bill I support. I think \nthey have done quite a remarkable job in bringing that bill to the \nSenate floor. I do, however, want to talk about a couple of areas that \nconcern me and a couple of amendments I wish to offer.\n  Obviously, our first responsibility in this legislation is to support \na strong military for this country. This is a dangerous world. All of \nus understand the uncertainties in the world. We understand especially \nthat our sons and daughters were called upon to go halfway around the \nworld and fight in the country of Iraq. They did so with great skill \nand our thoughts and prayers go with them as well. We understand from \nthat experience what these investments mean for our country, the \ninvestments in military preparedness.\n  Being prepared, making the investments, being able to defend our \ncountry's liberty against terrorists, aggressors, and others, is very \nimportant. The single most important threat that faces our children and \nour grandchildren is the threat of nuclear weapons. If there is a \nleader in this world that has a responsibility to stop the spread of \nnuclear weapons, it surely must be us. It must be the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Some many months ago there was a story, not widely told, about a \nrumor. The rumor was a nuclear weapon had been stolen from the Russian \narsenal and that one nuclear weapon stolen by terrorists from the \nRussian arsenal was to be detonated in an American city. It caused an \nepileptic seizure in the intelligence community: Terrorists stealing a \nnuclear weapon, detonating it in an American city; talk about 3,000 \npeople dying at the World Trade Center; then talk about one nuclear \nweapon killing half a million people in a major American city. That is \nthe specter of what will happen with the threat of nuclear weapons in \nthe wrong hands.\n  It was discovered some time after that rumor was moving around the \nintelligence community that, in fact, they believed it was not \ncredible; a terrorist had not stolen a nuclear weapon from the Russian \narsenal. Interestingly enough, it was not beyond belief of most \nintelligence analysts that it could have happened.\n  We know there are thousands of nuclear weapons in the hands of the \nRussians. We know the command and control of those weapons is not what \nwe would like. We hear rumors and stories about the recordkeeping for \nnuclear weapons in Russia being in a three-ring binder. So we worry \nabout the command and control of nuclear weapons. We think somewhere in \nthis world, between us and the Russians and a few others, there are \nnearly 25,000 to 30,000 nuclear weapons. I will say that again. \nAlthough there is not an exact known number, we expect between 25,000 \nand 30,000 nuclear weapons exist, both theater and strategic nuclear \nweapons.\n  The rumor that one had been stolen by a terrorist and might be \ndetonated in an American city caused great concern. Again, the \nintelligence people apparently felt it was entirely possible that could \nhave happened and, having happened, it was entirely plausible they \ncould have detonated a nuclear weapon in an American city.\n  So with this arsenal of 25,000 or 30,000 nuclear weapons, both \ntheater and strategic nuclear weapons, the question for us, our \nchildren, and their children is: Will someone someday get hold of a \nnuclear weapon, build one, create one, steal one, perhaps? Will those \nterrorists someday have access to one nuclear weapon? Will it be \ndetonated in a city of millions of people? Will it kill hundreds of \nthousands of people? Or before then, will we be a world leader in \ntrying to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, prevent the theft of \nnuclear weapons, improve the command and control of nuclear weapons, \nespecially\n\n[[Page S6645]]\n\nthose in Russia, and begin to reduce the stock of nuclear weapons?\n  Will we do that in our country? Will we send a signal to the world \nthat nuclear weapons cannot ever again be used in anger, cannot ever \nagain be used? The whole purpose of a nuclear weapon is a deterrent. It \nis not to be used.\n  In this legislation before us, we have provisions that talk about the \ndevelopment of new low-yield nuclear weapons. I think that is a \nhorrible mistake. We have plenty of nuclear weapons. Our effort ought \nnot to be to develop new ones. It ought to be to assume the mantle of \nleadership to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and begin the \nreduction of warheads.\n\n  In this bill, there is a provision that talks about the money that \nneeds to be spent to study the development of a new designer bunker \nbuster nuclear weapon. What kind of signal does that send to the rest \nof the world--the United States decides it wants to create a new \nnuclear weapon; it wants to study the design of a bunker buster nuclear \nweapon. We say to other countries we do not want them to have a nuclear \nweapon. We do not want them to develop a nuclear weapon.\n  We are worried about Pakistan and India. They do not like each other. \nThey both have nuclear weapons. We are trying to say to them they \ncannot ever even think about using a nuclear weapon.\n  Yet we are saying nuclear weapons are all right, what we ought to do \nis develop different kinds, develop more, use them perhaps in the \nfuture against terrorists who would burrow themselves into caves. What \na terrible idea. What an awful message for this country to send to the \nrest of the world. The message ought to be we are going to do \neverything that is humanly possible in the United States of America to \nstop the spread of nuclear weapons because our future depends on it.\n  We have a lot of challenges. If, in fact, North Korea is now \nproducing additional nuclear weapons using those spent fuel rods, if, \nin fact, we have a country that has the capacity and is now building \nnuclear weapons and is perfectly willing to sell them to most anybody, \ncan those nuclear weapons end up in the hands of terrorists 12 and 14 \nmonths from now and be used by those terrorists to threaten an American \ncity?\n  The answer is yes. This is a very serious issue. Is the answer to \nthis issue for us to be talking about developing new kinds of nuclear \nweapons so that perhaps we can burrow into a cave somewhere with a \ndesigner bunker buster nuclear weapon? The answer to that is clearly \nno. Our message, it seems to me, as a country, ought to be to the rest \nof the world that we want to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, and we \nwant to reduce the number of nuclear weapons, and we want to in every \nsingle possible way say to the rest of the world nuclear weapons cannot \nbe used, nuclear weapons will not be used.\n  So I am hoping to offer an amendment that will strike that money to \nstudy the development of a new designer bunker buster nuclear weapon. \nWe cannot do that. That makes no sense to me. It is exactly the wrong \nmessage to the rest of the world. Our job is not to begin determining \nhow we can create new nuclear weapons. Our job is to find ways to stop \nthe spread and to begin the reduction of nuclear weapons. We have \nplenty--thousands and thousands and thousands. The Russians have a \nsimilar number. A few other countries also have much smaller numbers. \nOne defection will cause a catastrophe in this world.\n  It just seems to me we cannot be sending a message to the rest of the \nworld that we are seriously wanting now to develop a new kind of \nnuclear weapon to bust bunkers. That is just the wrong message to the \nworld, in my judgment. I know that both the chairman and ranking member \nwill oppose the amendment, but I believe very strongly that this \ncountry has a leadership responsibility to the rest of the world that \nwe are strong, we are going to preserve liberty, we will fight for this \ncountry's right to preserve liberty, but part of that, in my judgment, \nis to produce stability in the world, to say to other countries we \ndon't ever want to see nuclear weapons used again; we want to stop the \nspread of nuclear weapons and we don't want to create new nuclear \nweapons and do not need to create nuclear weapons. Doing so would send \nexactly the wrong message to the rest of the world.\n  There is one other issue on which I know the chairman and the ranking \nmember will disagree. Senator Lott and I intend to offer an amendment \nto strike the base closing round in 2005. The legislation approving a \nnew Base Closure Commission in 2005 was written prior to 9/11. The \nshadow of 9/11 has been long and broad. It has changed almost \neverything. The President came to the Congress and gave one of the most \nremarkable speeches I think I have ever heard a few days after 9/11. He \nsaid: Everything is changed. We now fight a war against terrorism, and \nthat war against terrorism includes a war in Afghanistan, a war in \nIraq, actions in other parts of the world, and a revamping of homeland \nsecurity.\n  The creation and revamping of homeland security in our country, it \nseems to me, says to us that everything has changed. We have a \nSecretary of Defense who wants to dramatically change the entire \nstructure of our Defense Department and our military.\n  So if everything has changed, then how do we proceed with a Base \nClosure Commission in the year 2005 that was developed in prior to \n2001? Some of us believe we need to strike that 2005 base closing BRAC \ncommission, get our breath, evaluate what kind of future we are going \nto have, what kind of base structure we want, both here and abroad, but \ninstead of rushing into a mandate that was imposed prior to 9/11, what \nwe ought to do is remove that mandate and have the flexibility to \nproceed in a manner that is consistent with the new realities since 9/\n11.\n  It is interesting to me that there are so many new realities around \nthe world. We have heavy mechanized divisions in Western Europe. Well, \nI understood why we would have had tank divisions, for example, when we \nhad a Warsaw Pact and Eastern Europe was Communist and we were \nprotecting Western Europe from the invasion of the Communists. But \nthat, of course, is not the case any more. There is no Warsaw Pact. \nEastern Europe is democratic and free in almost all cases, and so it \nought to lead us to ask the question: What are we doing with those \nkinds of divisions in Europe?\n  It seems to me there is a lot for us to evaluate in base closing, but \nif we are going to take a look at where the excess capacities exist in \nour military, let us do it with the background of 9/11, understanding \nvirtually everything has changed long after we decided to have a base \nclosing round in 2005 and the smarter approach for us would be to step \nback a bit, rescind that requirement in 2005, and, with the Secretary \nof Defense and others, try to think through what our new reality is, \nwhat will our new force structure be, what does this new changing world \nrequire of us, and what kind of bases will be required to meet that \nneed.\n  We don't know what the military will look like in 10 or 20 years from \nnow. We don't know how big it will be, what the force structure will \nbe. We don't know where our forces will be based.\n\n  Just recently, we had a callup of the National Guard and Reserve. God \nknows those wonderful citizen soldiers who leave their homes and their \nloved ones. The 142nd Engineering Battalion in North Dakota got 2 days' \nnotice and dug their trucks out of the snow and put them on the road to \nFort Carson, CO. The fact is they were not ready for them at Fort \nCarson, unfortunately, they did not have the capacity on that base to \nhandle the 142nd when they got there.\n  Part of it was because the troops got backed up; they could not go \nthrough Turkey; the ships were backed up; they were not able to move \nsoldiers out of Fort Carson, so we had people being mobilized in the \nGuard and Reserve going to Fort Carson, CO, and they didn't have \nfacilities to handle them at that point.\n  The question is, What needs and requirements will we face in the \nfuture? We don't know. Everything is changing. Everything has changed \nin the last few years.\n  The Secretary of Defense says we should have a base closing round, \none round in 2005 that closes bases, I believe he said, equivalent to \nthe number of bases closed in the first four rounds. I do not see how \nhe or anyone else has the knowledge to understand where we would close \nthose bases at the moment because we don't understand what the\n\n[[Page S6646]]\n\nforce structure will be, what the requirements will be. And that is not \na decision just for the Defense Department. It is also a decision for \nthe Congress.\n  Homeland defense may require more bases, not fewer. Homeland defense \ncombined with the Defense Department and the efforts of both may \nrequire bases in different places, may require us to retain a base that \nin another area might otherwise close, may suggest you close a base in \na circumstance where you otherwise might retain it. We don't know. \nHomeland Security as an agency is less than a year old. We have had \nterrorists exploding bombs around the world in recent days--Morocco, \nSaudi Arabia. The fact is we don't know how all of this comes together, \nand yet we have a mandate for a BRAC round, part of which will begin in \n2004 with respect to the requirements and in 2005 we will have the \ncommission.\n  Let me suggest also, in addition to the fact that I don't think it \nmakes any sense now, in the shadow of 9/11, to continue with the \nrequirement that was imposed prior to 9/11, especially when virtually \neveryone says everything has changed, I don't think it makes any sense \nto stubbornly stick to that requirement. We would be much better off, \nin my judgment, for long-term preparedness and long-term flexibility to \nstrike that provision for the 2005 round.\n  Let me make one other point. We have an economy that is stuttering. \nEverybody understands that. The Congress and the President are \nstruggling to try to find a way to put this economy back together. It \nis not producing jobs. It is losing jobs. We don't have the kind of \neconomic growth we want or need. All of us understand that. We all \nunderstand that.\n\n  Want to talk about a retardant economic growth? Let me tell you what \nthat is. Tell every community in this country with a major military \ninstallation, by the way, if you invest in that community, do not build \nan apartment building now because between now and mid-2005 that base \nmay be closed and you have no certainty it will be there beyond 2005 or \npast; so make sure you do not make that long-term investment. In every \ncommunity where there is a major military installation this stunts \neconomic growth because there is a target on the front: Get out of \nevery military installation in the country. All of them are in play. No \none knows which may remain open or remain closed. This Commission will \nmeet in 2005 and on its own make that decision. Want to stunt economic \ngrowth, retard the ability of the economy to expand? The quick way to \ndo that is to say let's leave in place the 2005 requirement for a base-\nclosing commission.\n  I guarantee, in community after community around this country, we \nhave investors who will not, who cannot possibly make the investment in \nthose communities because that military installation is a big part of \nthe community and its economy and its future and they do not know \nwhether it will be there in the future.\n  At a time when our economy is sputtering, to have that retardant on \nthe economic growth of so many communities in our country, in my \njudgment, is totally counterproductive.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will my colleague be willing to engage in a colloquy?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. WARNER. By way of senatorial courtesy, I bring to the Senator's \nattention the unanimous consent request drafted carefully and put into \nthe calendar today. Would the Senator be willing to check with the \nParliamentarian at his earliest opportunity?\n  On this amendment, the Senator is a cosponsor, I think I heard.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Senator Lott and I.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator be gracious enough to check with the \nParliamentarian? It seems to me before we get the body stirred up on \nthe issue of BRAC, we ought to determine the relevance on that \namendment with these unanimous consent requests. I say that by way of \ncourtesy.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, I appreciate the Senator's courtesy. Of course, I \nam familiar that last week, perhaps for the last time, the committee \nhas gotten unanimous consent requests for relevancy. I say ``for the \nlast time'' because I have discovered both last evening and this \nmorning that the amendment, as originally drafted, would be \nnonrelevant. Let me describe my surprise at that.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me finish the explanation and I will be happy to \nyield.\n  The Base Closure Commission was established in this bill by this \ncommittee some years ago. One would expect the ability to strike that \nrequirement would be in this bill. That is where it would be relevant, \nin this bill.\n  This bill itself contains provisions dealing with base closings \nbecause the bill contains some hundreds of millions of dollars in \nconformance with the requirements and the costs of previous Base \nClosure Commission actions.\n\n  I was told this morning the way our amendment is currently drafted is \nnonrelevant. I don't have the foggiest idea who could come up with that \nsort of judgment. I will not demean anyone who does, but to say there \nis no way on God's Earth that anybody can suggest that it is not \nrelevant in this legislation to deal with base closing because this is \nwhere base closing came about. This is where it originated.\n  If the idea of relevancy is to get unanimous consent to shut people \nout from being able to offer amendments such as this on this bill, it \nis the last time--I say this again--it is the last time any committee \nwill ever get a unanimous consent in this Senate as long as I am here \nduring this session of the Congress on relevancy. It is the last time \nit will happen.\n  I am certainly not upset at the Senator from Virginia, but I am upset \nwith this process because I will find a way to draft this so it is \nrelevant and we will have a vote on it.\n  Frankly, I am upset that we have a Byzantine process by which someone \nsays you cannot strike a provision that was put in the bill because it \nis not relevant. What on Earth are we thinking about?\n  I say to the Senator, your courtesy is understood. I was aware last \nevening and this morning that there was preparation to say to me, this \nis not relevant the way it is written. Then I will write it the way I \nhope someone around here can think clearly to say it is relevant. There \nis already a provision in this bill that deals with the Base Closure \nCommission; I can cite it.--There is no way my amendment can be \nnonrelevant.\n  I will work on that in the next couple of hours. I know the Senator \nfrom Virginia will want to oppose the amendment, as will the Senator \nfrom Michigan. I hope the Senator from Virginia will agree with me that \nhe will not want a process by which he brings a bill to the floor, as \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, and will want to prevent \nsomeone such as me who is not on the committee from offering an \namendment to strike a provision put in this bill some years ago.\n  I don't expect that the Senator from Virginia would want that to be \nhappening. I don't think you will want to prevent me from offering an \namendment that you think is relevant. I appreciate the comment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I suggest maybe a revision in your \ncommentary. It is not in this bill. You keep referring to ``it's in \nthis bill.''\n  Some years ago this bill, by the authorization committee, did contain \nit. I happen to have been a drafter of it. But it became law. So it is \nin law today. But there is no provision, to my understanding, in this \nbill that relates to the generic subject of the BRAC.\n  Mr. DORGAN. When I say ``this bill,'' I am referring generically to \nthe Defense Authorization bill that we do each year. This bill is where \nthe Senators who wanted to add the base-closing BRAC commission put it. \nIt is in this piece of legislation. Generically.\n  Now, this bill you wrote this year that comes to the floor does not \ncreate the BRAC because the BRAC now is in law. I am trying to strike \nit.\n\n  Let me say, however, that on page 349 of your bill:\n\n       For base closure and realignment activities as authorized \n     by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (Part \n     A of title XXIX of public law 101-510--\n\n  My point is, that portion of law is already referenced in your bill \nbecause you are proposing to spend $370 million in pursuit of certain \nrequirements there.\n  My point is, it is not as if base closing as a concept or as a \nsubject is not there. It is there.\n\n[[Page S6647]]\n\n  I assume that neither you nor the Senator from Michigan--perhaps I \nshould ask both of you. I assume that neither of you would anticipate \nwhen you propound a unanimous consent request on relevancy that you \nwould want to prevent someone from coming to the floor to offer an \namendment that is clearly relevant. I assume you would not want to try \nto prevent this kind of amendment.\n  I assume you want to prevent an element that deals with, say, CAFE \nstandards on automobiles, having nothing to do with defense or \nsomething dealing with health care that has nothing to do with defense. \nThat is what relevance, in my judgment, is about.\n  I ask the Senator from Virginia, if I may reserve my time and ask for \na response, or perhaps the Senator from Michigan, did you anticipate \nlast Thursday preventing amendments such as the amendment I was \nintending to offer with Senator Reid on concurrent receipt, which \nclearly deals with the military, or the amendment that I intend to \noffer on base closing, is that what you intended to prevent with the \nunanimous consent request?\n  I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the distinguished ranking member and \nmyself at the time, with the leadership, had no specific subject or \namendment in mind. We simply recognized the magnitude of this bill, \nsome $400 billion, covering many subjects; in years past we have been \non the floor, I can remember in my 25 years, 2 weeks at a time. Given \nthe urgency of this situation, the calendar before the Senate, we \nthought we could best serve the institution of the Senate by proposing \nthe Parliamentarian the decisionmaking with reference to relevancy. We \nhad nothing in mind, I assure the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me ask this, if I might ask the Senator from \nMichigan. I don't disagree with you at all. I understand you don't want \n100 extraneous amendments that have nothing to do with this, so you \nwant a relevancy test.\n\n  But as I understand, the provision in law that I reference in my \namendment is exactly the provision in law that is referenced on page \n349, lines 16 to 19. That will now be prevented, so I will have to \nrewrite this amendment. The Parliamentarian says he thinks it is not \nrelevant--their office thinks it is not relevant, ``after consultation \nwith both the majority and minority staff of the Armed Services \nCommittee.'' I might wonder what kind of consultation exists there. Can \neither of the Senators tell me?\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, I don't know what consultation \nexists between the Parliamentarian and the staffs of committees \nrelative----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Might I----\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I could just complete my statement?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, go ahead.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Relative to bills that come before them.\n  These are complex bills. I assume they consult all the time. I cannot \nimagine it is unusual for the Parliamentarian to talk to either Members \nof the Senate or to our staff.\n  By the way, this requirement of relevance is not unusual. I just ask \nthe Parliamentarian, is this an uncommon provision? It is not an \nuncommon provision. In fact, it seems to me, in a bill that recently \ncame before us it had a provision, although I cannot remember which one \nit was--but it is not an uncommon provision. It was not intended to \nprevent any particular amendment.\n  As the Senator from Virginia said, it was just simply intended to \ngive some kind of parameter to a very lengthy and complex bill. It was \nnot aimed at a BRAC amendment or aimed at any particular amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me ask the question further, if I might retain my \nright to the floor, if the Parliamentarian's office consulted with the \nSenator from Michigan, would the Senator from Michigan think an \namendment that would strike the Base Closure Commission is not relevant \nto the bill?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would ask the Parliamentarian for a definition of \n``relevance.'' I would follow his definition. If the Parliamentarian \nasked me whether or not that provision was germane to the bill under \nthe common germaneness definition, I would say, Boy, it sure sounds \ngermane to me. But the Parliamentarian would tell me, No, sorry, that's \nnot germane to the bill.\n  I don't know what the technical definition of ``relevance'' is. But \nit is technically defined like the word ``germane.'' It is not just a \ngeneral word which is taken from the dictionary. There is a \nparliamentary definition of the word ``relevant.'' That is the \ndefinition which is incorporated, I believe, in every single unanimous \nconsent request that there be a relevance standard.\n  Again, I repeat, and I think it is important we find this out, it is \nnot uncommon to have a relevance standard in a unanimous consent \nrequest to limit amendments to debate so we can keep within the \nparameters of the bill.\n  If I could add one other thing, to my friend from North Dakota. It \nseems to me what the Senator from North Dakota may be arguing at the \nmoment is that, in fact, his amendment is relevant, or that it could be \nmade relevant within the meaning of the word as defined by the \nParliamentarian. If so, it seems to me that takes care of the issue.\n  I know the Senator from North Dakota----\n  Mr. DORGAN. But, yes, the Senator is correct. I darn well expect to \nbe able to offer this amendment. If I have to reword it, I will reword \nit. But I was trying to ask the question, Is this what you expected to \ntry to prevent?\n  You say we were just trying to deal with something that was \n``relevant,'' and that is a standard that existed for a long period of \ntime. You know and I know that standard has changed over the last 20 \nyears.\n  I, frankly, am surprised this morning at this. I think a number of \nothers are as well because I don't think this is what I thought \nrelevancy was about.\n  My amendment is three lines long. It repeals the base-closing round. \nIf this is not what you intended to prevent, let me ask consent that \nyou would agree this be deemed as relevant.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I would not agree with that.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is aware, is he not, that on our side we have \nvery competent staff, Marty Paone, Lula Davis, who help us with \nparliamentary issues that come before this body; the Senator is aware \nof that, of course?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that we have been told by them that \nthe rulings that have been made on this bill have been a surprise to \neven them, in the many, many years they have served in the Senate? The \nnew--I am talking about new in the last few days--determination of what \nis relevant has surprised even our very competent floor staff. Is the \nSenator aware of that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that, generally speaking, relevance is \nnot germaneness? They are two totally different concepts; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I was surprised, flabbergasted, disappointed last night \nwhen the amendment that you and I and Senator McCain--I didn't mention \nhis name last night and I apologize for not doing that because I was so \ntaken aback by the ruling of the Chair--that our concurrent receipt \namendment was ruled nonrelevant. That is an amendment to allow the \nmilitary to receive their disability pay and their retirement pay.\n  I would have to think this huge bill we have here--there are copies \non the desk, here it is right here--in this huge bill here, I would \nhave to think there is something about pay for the military, about \nretirement pay, about disability. But the Chair ruled that was not the \ncase.\n  I accept the ruling of the Chair. I do not like it, but I certainly \nsupport the statement made by the Senator from Michigan last night. I \nthought that was a very fair statement. We have to go along with what \nthe Chair rules. There is no other alternative, but that does not take \naway that this has been a tremendous surprise, disappointment to me, \nand I would think to the Senator from North Dakota. Is that a fair \nstatement?\n  Here is a situation that has arisen that is totally against what we \nhave learned has been the rule of relevance. This is not some magical \nconcept that just came out of the sky, but in the\n\n[[Page S6648]]\n\nlast few hours there is a new determination of what relevance is. Is \nthis a fair statement, I say to the Senator from North Dakota?\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is my feeling. I hope the Senator from Virginia and \nthe Senator from Michigan were surprised as well.\n  If not, if their suggestion last Thursday of what relevance was, by \nunanimous consent, in effect, was to say: Oh, by the way, those of you \nwho want to come with a base-closing round, we are not willing to fight \nyou on that; You can't offer it; We will find a way to prevent you from \noffering it.\n  It is partly our fault. I had no idea that what you were doing last \nThursday with a relevancy request, by consent, would have prevented \nSenator Reid from offering the concurrent receipt issue. The fact is, \nwe were going to offer the concurrent receipt issue last week on the \ntax bill and decided not to do that, decided to offer it here because \nhere is where it ought to be offered.\n  When someone works 20 years in the military for this country and then \nretires and earns a retirement pay, if during that time they were \ndisabled, what our current law says, in most cases--not all, but in \nmost cases--is that you are not going to be able to collect your \ndisability and your retirement; concurrent receipt is prohibited.\n  That is wrong. We ought to change that. Most of us know we ought to \nchange that. The place to change that is on the Defense authorization \nbill. Of course it is the place to change it.\n  I am just as stunned that Senator Reid has been told it is not \nrelevant as I am about my amendment. I have spent more time this \nmorning trying to figure out how on Earth someone could determine that \nthis may not be relevant. I do not know what else that someone might \nwant to offer here that deals directly with a defense issue, deals \ndirectly with policy in defense, will now be ruled as nonrelevant. What \non Earth are we talking about here?\n  I hope the two of you, the chairman and the ranking member, will \nagree that at least those issues that appear well within the scope of \nwhat we have always thought to be relevant, and Senator Reid described \nit exactly, about which those in our caucus who are the experts--I am \nnot an expert on relevancy--are surprised, I hope those issues that you \nare preventing with a unanimous consent, at least by this latest rule, \nI hope we will be able to offer them.\n  I will try to offer to the Parliamentarian's office some version of \nthis amendment that will meet the relevancy test. I hope I can do that. \nIf I can't, I hope it is not your intent that relevancy should be \ndescribed in the way that prevents the offering of legislation that \nwould strike a provision that you put in the law in 1990 in this very \nDefense authorization bill. I hope that is not your intent.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have to say to my friend, I would not want him to leave \nthe floor under the illusion that if the amendment fails to meet the \nrequirements of the Parliamentarian, that my colleague, the \ndistinguished ranking member, and myself, would begin to sit as a \nsupreme court with regard to the Parliamentarian's decision and render \nexceptions. If we were to do that, the whole efficiency of this process \nwould soon disintegrate and put us in an impossible situation.\n  The institution of the Senate relies upon the fairness and \nobjectivity of the Parliamentarians. It is an institution since the \nbeginning of times here. We, as Members, should not be asked or put in \na position in which to overrule them, as you are fully aware.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Virginia has been here longer than I \nhave, but he understands when one comes to the floor to manage a bill \nwith the ranking member, that there will be dozens of opportunities for \nyou, in the next couple of days, to have unanimous consent agreements \nbetween the two of you. That is the way you manage a bill on the floor \nof the Senate. I am not suggesting some new approach. You will be \nrequired to ask unanimous consent for a number of things to happen on \nthe floor of the Senate. One of those will, I hope, be to say that you \nwant to allow to be considered on the floor of the Senate concurrent \nreceipt, for example. I think it would be a travesty if you leave the \nfloor, or I should say if we leave the floor--the Senate takes the \nfloor for final vote on a Defense authorization bill, having prevented \nthose retired soldiers who are disabled from having had a vote on this \nissue. What a travesty that is going to be.\n  I hope it will not be your intention to prevent that amendment from \nbeing offered. It is clearly right in the bull's-eye of this bill. \nClearly it is.\n  I guarantee you, to the extent I can guarantee you as a non-\nParliamentarian, that 3 years ago, 5 years ago, or 10 years ago, if \nthis were offered on this bill, it would be relevant. We all know that. \nThe only reason we are surprised this morning is because relevancy is \nchanging in a way that I hope surprises you because I don't expect that \nyou last Thursday would have wanted to prevent the concurrent receipts \nbeing debated and voted on. And I wouldn't expect that you want my \namendment to be voted on. As I said before, I have great respect for \nthe chairman and ranking members of this committee. I think they do \nwonderful work for this country. I have great admiration for them. I \nsupport much of what they have done. I will offer a couple of \namendments. One which I very much hope you will allow to be offered is \nthe one Senator Reid, myself, and Senator McCain want to offer on \nconcurrent receipts. And one that certainly should never be prevented \nfrom being offered is on the Base Closure Commission. I have already \nmade the comments about that amendment and why I think it is important \nand why I think it is timely to offer it today. I know that both \nSenators will object to that. But there is a very solid and strong \ngroup of Senators who feel the other way. I and Senator Lott intend to \noffer this amendment to the extent that we can find a way to offer it, \neither by rewording it or finding a way to allow us a consent to offer \nit. It would be a mistake not to do this before the bill leaves the \nfloor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I think this colloquy undoubtedly is \nbeing followed by a number of colleagues. I already now have petitions \nby several on my side of the aisle seeking to ask whether we can go \nahead and take this up even though the Parliamentarian has indicated to \nthose Senators in a formal and appropriate way that it is acting within \nthe description of their job function here to say the amendment fails \nthe test. Again, I do not intend to sit here in judgment and overrule \nthe Parliamentarian. But the Senator is perfectly willing under the \nrules of the Senate to seek to do that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. You do not have to overrule the Parliamentarian. If one \nwere to move to do that, that would be a different issue. But by \nconsent we can--and you know we will--do most anything on the floor of \nthe Senate. My point is not to ask you to overrule the Parliamentarian. \nMy point is to ask you whether you believe, whether the committee \nbelieves that it is somehow not relevant to this bill to be talking \nabout the Base Closure Commission that was created by the Defense \nauthorization bill in the Senate, or to be talking about concurrent \nreceipts which affect emolument and reimbursements for veterans and \nretired veterans. Clearly, the Senators from Virginia and Michigan \ncould not feel that is somehow outside the scope of this bill. If you \nbelieve it is in the scope of the bill, let us not be technical. Let us \nby consent allow amendments that are at the heart of this bill to be \noffered.\n  That is what I am asking. That is my point.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, if the Senator from North Dakota was \nasking me do I believe that a BRAC amendment is germane to this bill, \nnot relevant but germane to this bill--look up the word ``germane'' in \nthe dictionary--it sure sounds germane to me. But then I ask the \nParliamentarian if it is germane, and the Parliamentarian says, no, it \nis not germane to this bill, and if this were a postcloture situation, \nit would be allowed, the Senator could get up and ask, Does the Senator \nfrom Michigan really believe the BRAC amendment should not be allowed \non this bill because under the rules of the Senate it is apparently not \ngermane? The Parliamentarian has told us that.\n\n  What intrigues me is the relevance standard which the Senator from \nNorth Dakota has raised as to whether or not, in fact, there has been a \nchange. I use the words ``whether or not'' there has\n\n[[Page S6649]]\n\nbeen a change in the standard of relevancy. It seems to me that is an \nimportant issue for this body to review, as to whether there has been a \nchange in that definition. I haven't talked to the Parliamentarian \nabout it. I don't know. Does the Senator from North Dakota suggest that \nthere has been a change? Whether there is, has been, would be or not, \nwe should know as a body what the standard of relevance is and whether \nthere has been a change and, if so, how did it come about.\n  I hope the Parliamentarian, given this exchange, would advise the \nSenate as to the standard of relevance and as to whether or not there \nhas been a change in that standard. I am not suggesting, obviously, \nthat the Parliamentarian speak on the floor at this point. I am \nsuggesting the Parliamentarian advise the Senate in some written form \nrelative to the standard of relevancy because the Senator is raising an \nabsolutely essential issue. We use the word ``relevant'' here all the \ntime. If there is a change in the definition of that word, then it \nseems to me we ought to know about it and decide whether or not we are \ncomfortable with it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, let us place before the Chair a \nparliamentary inquiry as to whether or not there has been any change in \nthe definition of the word ``relevancy'' as used by the \nParliamentarian, say, in the last decade.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the Senator from Michigan made a \nsuggestion which is I think perhaps a better approach, to have the \nParliamentarian communicate with us about that subject. I don't know.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, will my friend yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I have the greatest affection for my friend from Virginia. \nIf there were ever a southern gentleman, he is it. But this question \nwill not do the trick. It is like asking Al Capone if he is a criminal. \nI am not saying that the Parliamentarian is a criminal, but you can't \nask him to defend himself. That is what this amounts to. That is what \nis happening, especially here in the Senate. This is not the way to do \nit. I say to those on that side of the aisle that I have the greatest \nconfidence in our floor staff, as they do theirs. They are not Johnny-\ncome-lately. They have been here a long time. They knew when this \nunanimous consent agreement was entered into what it was. They knew \nwhat the standard basic definition was. They are dumbfounded as to the \nrulings of the Chair. Marty Paone and Lula Davis--who I lived with on \nthis floor, and spend days and weeks and months of my life, I depend on \nfor advice and counsel every day, are dumbfounded.\n  I say to my friend from Virginia that to ask the Chair to determine a \nchange in the definition in the last 2 days is not the way to go.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me make the point that there has not been a ruling of \nthe Chair. The issue is what the Parliamentarian views to be relevant \nand not relevant at this point. There is an important distinction. But \nwe don't want to have a half hour of debate on this point.\n\n  The only reason I came to the floor to talk about this was because I \nwanted to talk about two amendments which I wanted to offer, \nrecognizing that one of them at this point has been described as not \nrelevant. I was stunned by that. I expect to be able to redraft it to \nmake it relevant. But I was especially interested in whether the \nmanagers of the bill, the chairman and ranking member, would want to \nprevent us from offering amendments that are so central to the Defense \nauthorization bill. If not now, where would I offer this amendment? I \nask the question: If not here, where would I offer it? Is there an \nalternative to offering this type of amendment somewhere else? Clearly \nthe answer is no. If there is a place, this is the time to offer this \namendment.\n  My hope is that working with the chairman and ranking member I will \nbe able to do that. Quite clearly, this amendment is central to the \nconsideration of this bill. It is right in the middle of the defense \nauthorization. I am not coming here with some amendment that is \nextraneous.\n  My colleague from Michigan used the world ``germane'' which \nintroduces a new subject. I thought he was going to debate that \nsubject. But then he used that to describe its relationship to \n``relevance.'' This will be lost on a lot of people in the country. But \nit would be lost on people as well if they understand what this bill \nis, and then look at the amendment that is proposed to be offered by \nthe Senator from Nevada and the amendment that I propose to offer and \nhear that those somehow are not relevant to the bill. They would ask, \nIs there some common sense missing here someplace?\n  Clearly, clearly----\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, if the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator from Virginia propounded a question to the \nChair. My distinguished colleague from Nevada suggested maybe we \nshouldn't follow that procedure.\n  I have now consulted with the Parliamentarian. They are prepared to \nanswer the question propounded by the Senator from Virginia with regard \nto this practice over the last several years. Whatever period of time \nis stipulated I think is not that important. So I once again propound \nto the Chair the question of whether or not the means by which the \nParliamentarian through the years has judged a question's relevancy--\nhas it changed, say, in the last 5 years?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am sorry?\n  Mr. WARNER. We can't hear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not.\n  Mr. WARNER. What did the Chair say?\n  Mr. REID. It has not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not changed in the past few years.\n  Mr. WARNER. Thank you.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, Madam President, that is patently absurd. The \nchairman asked--the first time he asked the question, he asked in the \nlast decade.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. I will repeat the question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. No, no, no. I am not asking him to repeat the question. I \nhave the floor.\n  He asked the last decade. Then he asked the last several years. Then \nhe asked the last 5 years. The fact is, people who watch this, going \nback through several Parliamentarians, are surprised this is not a \nrelevant amendment.\n  Relevancy is purely judgmental. If I were a Parliamentarian, a member \nof the Parliamentarian's Office, I would say nothing has changed in 200 \nyears. God bless us.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  I would like the Record to reflect, following the statement of the \nChair, a big smile and a laugh from the Senator from Nevada based on \nthat decision by the Chair.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, Madam President, it is hard to describe the smile \nthe Senator from Nevada blesses us with, but if he wishes the Record to \ninclude that, we will do that.\n  Look, we have gone on long enough. My interest is in substance, not \nprocedure. I understand the Senate operates based on procedures and \nprecedent, but I am not very happy today because the fact is, people \nwhose judgment I rely on are very surprised by this. I just don't have \nthe foggiest idea--not the foggiest idea--how my ability to strike a \nprovision that was put in this bill 2 years ago is thwarted because it \nis not relevant to this bill. I don't have any idea.\n  I would ask the question, if I can't do it now, then when can I do \nit? If I can't do it in this bill, then where can I do it? I don't have \nany understanding of that. Sometimes logic gets turned on its head. \nThat is clearly the case here.\n  Now, to the Parliamentarian's Office, I say I am sorry we have this \ndisagreement. But the fact is that what I heard this morning, both with \nrespect to retired veterans who are prohibited from getting their \ndisability payments--you know something, they have been shunted around \nthis Chamber now for years--for years--and the fact is a whole lot of \nthem deserve more than they have gotten from this Congress. These are \npeople who served this country, earned a retirement, and then were \ndisabled while serving their country and can't collect full disability \npayments. And every time we try to solve\n\n[[Page S6650]]\n\nthat, there is one reason or another it can't be done.\n\n  It is just one amendment Senator Reid and I and Senator McCain want \nto offer. But it just does not make sense to me to be in this position. \nI hope my two colleagues, Senator Warner and Senator Levin, would not \nintend for these amendments to be nonrelevant. They have some notion of \nwhat is relevant, what is nonrelevant in terms of what they wanted to \nprevent, and I assume they didn't want to prevent these types of \namendments from being offered.\n  So I will be working with them and seeing if we can find a way \nthrough this. I will work with the Parliamentarian's Office. But I must \ntell you, this is the first time--I have been in this Senate for a long \ntime. I have never come to the floor ever, not one instance I think you \nwill find where I have come to the floor and been upset with the \nParliamentarian's Office or others. I am not a complainer. But I tell \nyou what, this defies common sense. And I think, frankly, in a quiet \nmoment, off the floor, the chairman and ranking member would tell me \nthey didn't intend to preclude these two amendments. And if that is the \ncase--and I think that is the case--then they ought not be precluded, \nand we need to find a way to allow them to be offered.\n  So I will come back. I intended to come and speak to the substance \nand raise the question, and then try to solve it. I am sorry we got \ninto a longer discussion than that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I have a statement I would like to make on \nthe bill. It is my understanding we are in order to move forward with \nthe debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering the \nNational Defense Authorization Act of fiscal year 2004. While there \nwill be much debate on a few of the provisions in this bill, there is \none thing we can all agree on--the defense of this Nation is our No. 1 \npriority.\n  The bill before us is a reflection of that priority. With the passage \nof this bill, we are saying this body is determined to ensure our Armed \nForces have the resources, tools, and equipment they need to \neffectively combat those who threaten the United States, its interests \noverseas, and its friends and allies. With the passage of this bill we \nare saying our military personnel are the best in the world and should \nbe paid and equipped as such. Modern equipment and sophisticated \ntechnology were certainly critical factors in recent operations. \nHowever, it was the extensive training, superb leadership, and valiant \nservice of thousands of soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and \ncoastguardsmen which has been the deciding factor time and time again.\n  With the passage of this bill, we are also admitting that threats to \nour way of life persist in many parts of the world. The global reach of \nterrorist networks is extensive, as demonstrated by the recent bombings \nin Saudi Arabia. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is \ngrowing. There are reports, for example, that North Korea may try to \nsell a nuclear weapon. These threats and others require us to remain \nvigilant. Our military must be prepared and ready to respond in a \nmoment's notice.\n  I would like to take a few moments to draw the attention of the body \nto some of the more important provisions in this legislation.\n  Section 534 of the bill, which I sponsored, lays out several actions \nthe Secretary of Defense and the Secretaries of each military \ndepartment must take to address sexual misconduct at service academies. \nThese include promulgating policies on sexual misconduct, conducting \nannual cadet surveys, and submitting a report to Congress on the board \nof visitors of each academy. The recent sexual assault scandal at the \nUnited States Air Force Academy highlighted the importance of being \nproactive and taking appropriate action at the first sign of trouble. \nThis provision will be helpful in discovering sexual misconduct \nproblems at the academies. This provision will also help academy \nleaders develop new tools for addressing sexual misconduct and give \nCongress and the board of visitors insight into the size and scope of \nthe problem.\n\n  Another provision which I sponsored focuses on improving the Defense \nDepartment's management of travel credit cards. This provision builds \non the purchase card legislation of Senators Grassley and Byrd which \nwas approved by this body last year in the Defense appropriations bill. \nFederal agencies are required by law to use purchase cards for certain \ntransactions and travel cards for official trips. While utilization of \nthese cards has yielded considerable savings for the American taxpayer, \nabuse has continued.\n  Recent GAO audits have reported these cards have been used at \nbrothels, adult clubs, sporting events, and even Internet pornographic \nWeb sites. Section 1013 will help address this deficiency. It requires \nthe Secretary of Defense to prescribe guidelines and procedures \nregarding disciplinary action against personnel guilty of improper, \nfraudulent, or abusive use of Defense travel cards. The provision \nrecommends to the Secretary that he consider enforcing various \npenalties allowed in law, including assessing a fine three times the \nsize of the abuse, requiring the guilty party to pay court and \nadministrative costs, and firing or court-martialing Department of \nDefense personnel.\n  Lastly, the provision requires the Secretary to report to Congress on \nthese guidelines and provide legislative proposals should legislative \naction become necessary.\n  The bill before us also includes two provisions I sponsored regarding \nmilitary voters. With the current deployments resulting from the war on \nterrorism, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and numerous other military \nactions, we must do all we can to ensure these military men and women \nare given every available opportunity to exercise their right to vote. \nI believe it is our duty to remove as many barriers as possible for \nmilitary voters to be heard.\n  One provision included by the Armed Services Committee addresses \nthose voters who fall through the cracks when they leave the military \nand move before an election but after the residency deadline. The other \nprovision addresses problems with overseas military absentee ballots. \nAfter the 2000 election there were numerous reports of ballots mailed \nwithout the benefit of postmarking facilities. Sometimes mail is \nbundled from deployed ships or other distant postings and the whole \ngroup gets one postmark which would invalidate them under current law. \nThe provision adopted will change the law so our military personnel \nwould be ensured their votes count.\n  I am encouraged by the $40 million added to the President's request \nfor formerly-used defense sites, better known as FUDS. As noted in the \ncommittee report, there are over 9,000 FUDS in the program which \nhistorically have been underfunded. The longer these sites wait to be \nremediated, the more expensive they become. That is why I am pleased to \nsee the extra funds and encourage the Army to address these problems in \nan expeditious and thorough manner.\n  Turning to the provisions that originated from the Strategic Forces \nSubcommittee, which I chair, these provisions reflect a net increase of \n$85 million in procurement, a net increase of $202 million in research \nand development. They also reflect the requested level of funding for \nthe Department of Energy programs and activities. The total net \nincrease was $287 million.\n  These provisions fully fund the President's $9.1 billion request for \nmissile defense. I was pleased that my ranking member, Senator Bill \nNelson, and I were able to work together effectively on these issues. I \nam hopeful any missile defense amendments considered as part of this \ndebate will be noncontroversial.\n  Significant funding actions in the committee's bill for missile \ndefense include an increase of $100 million for the\n\n[[Page S6651]]\n\nground-based missile defense system for additional testing and hardware \nimprovements to reduce risk and enhance operational effectiveness, and \na $70 million decrease for the ballistic missile defense system \nintercept project.\n  The bill before us also includes a number of space-related provisions \nthat originated from my subcommittee. One would help to more fully \ndevelop an effective cadre of space professionals. Another would \nestablish assured access to space for national security payloads as \nnational policy.\n  Significant funding actions for space include the following: An $80 \nmillion increase for the GPS III, which is an advanced navigation \nsatellite; a $60 million increase for the Advanced EHF Satellite \ncommunication system; a $60 million increase for assured access to \nspace; and a $50 million decrease for the Advanced Wideband system, \nwhich will put this program on a sounder schedule.\n  There are two significant legislative provisions regarding the \nintelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, referred to as ISR. The \nfirst would require establishment of a Department of Defense ISR \nIntegration Council, and formulation of a 15-year ISR roadmap to ensure \nthe development of an efficient, interoperable, complementary ISR \narchitecture for the Department.\n  The second reemphasizes the committee's support for the acquisition \nand use of commercial imagery to meet Department of Defense and \nIntelligence Community needs. The bill also adds funds to a number of \nhigh-priority ISR programs.\n  Another set of provisions originated from my subcommittee focuses on \nDepartment of Energy programs. These provisions authorize the weapons \nactivities within the National Nuclear Security Administration at the \nbudget request level of $6.4 million; the Naval Reactors program at \n$788 million; and the Defense Environmental Management program at $7.7 \nbillion.\n  Another DOE provision would authorize $21 million for the National \nNuclear Security Administration to begin research on advanced concepts, \nand $15 million of that research money will be used to continue the \nfeasibility study on the robust nuclear earth penetrator. A repeal of \nthe ban on low-yield nuclear weapons research and development was also \nincluded--emphasizing just the repeal, and this involved the research \nand development.\n  Mr. President, our Armed Forces are highly capable, superbly led, and \ndevoted to the protection of the American people. During Operation \nEnduring Freedom, the Taliban unwittingly discovered our military has \nthe capability to deploy and supply thousands of soldiers in the most \nremote of regions of the world. And during Operation Iraqi Freedom, \nSaddam Hussein experienced firsthand the devastating precision \nfirepower our forces can unleash from a multitude of platforms.\n  Yet despite these capabilities, we cannot stand still because, most \nassuredly, our enemies will not. We must be determined, committed, and \nfocused on the task before us. It is our duty.\n  The Armed Services Committee, under the outstanding leadership of \nChairman Warner, has spent many hours developing, analyzing, and \nreviewing the provisions in this bill. I also want to thank the ranking \nmember of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, Senator Bill Nelson, and \nhis staff for their cooperation and leadership during our hearings and \ncommittee markup. While we may not all agree on the merits of some of \nthe provisions, we can all agree the overall bill will go a long way \ntoward meeting the growing needs of our men and women in uniform.\n  The American people depend on us, just as we depend on our Armed \nForces. Let us do our duty and quickly approve this bill.\n  I yield the floor. Seeing no other member seeking recognition, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, there is a very simple, but important, premise \nunderlying this amendment. I believe Congress should know the \ncapabilities of any missile defense system that is deployed, and that \nthese capabilities should be subject to rigorous testing. I understand \nthis information may very well be classified, and we would receive it \non a classified basis, but it is essential for us, as we make decisions \nabout a huge program, not only in terms of dollars, but in terms of \nconsequences to our security, that we know how capable this program is.\n  My amendment would request and require the Department of Defense \ndevelop measurable performance criteria for missile defense systems and \nan operational test plan for those systems, and an estimate of when \noperational testing would be done to verify the performance criteria \nare met. The performance criteria would include the characteristics of \nthe threat missiles that each missile defense system is being designed \nto counter.\n  The amendment would require the Secretary of Defense to submit the \nperformance criteria and operational test plan to the Congress each \nyear.\n  The amendment would also require the Director of Operational Test and \nEvaluation to provide an annual assessment of the progress being made \nto verify, through operational testing, whether the systems are meeting \ntheir established performance criteria.\n  Both the performance criteria and test plans could be revised as \nnecessary by the Department of Defense, but I do believe we need to \nhave an idea at least of the capabilities of these systems and also, \nagain, these capabilities must be established by operational testing.\n  The Patriot PAC-3 system, the only currently deployed ballistic \nmissile defense system, conducted operational testing to prove it met \nestablished performance criteria prior to being deployed. This is the \nright way to develop a missile defense system; indeed, all defense \nprograms. This amendment would model other missile defense programs on \nthe very successful PAC-3 program in terms of performance criteria, \noperational testing, and then deployment.\n  There are a number of important things this amendment will not do. \nThis amendment does not reduce funding for any missile defense system.\n  It would not prevent the administration from fielding missile defense \nby 2004, although, hopefully, we will have an idea of exactly what they \nfield in 2004, and, frankly, I do not think this Congress has such an \nidea at this moment.\n  It would not dictate what performance any missile defense system \nshould have, nor does it establish any dates for when certain \nperformance must be attained.\n  It would, however, enable Congress to understand what missile defense \ncapabilities are being bought for the $9.1 billion provided in the \ndefense bill for missile defense. I think that is a threshold issue our \nconstituents expect us to know. If we are investing $9.1 billion, we \nhave to know, and the American people should feel confident we know, \nwhat are we buying, how much will it protect us against what type of \nthreat.\n  I believe also it would improve the chances of developing effective \nmissile defenses by establishing clear standards of performance.\n  Currently, none of the missile defense programs under development, \nunder the Missile Defense Agency, have established performance \ncriteria, meaning essentially there are no standards for when a system \nreaches any particular milestone or has completed its development. \nThese standards did exist under the Clinton administration but were \nremoved by the current administration.\n\n  The administration claims it cannot develop performance criteria for \nmissile defense because the systems are too complex and difficult, and \nno one can predict how they will perform.\n  However, despite this seeming quandary about not knowing what will \nhappen, the administration plans to field both ground- and sea-based \nmissile defenses in 2004 and possibly an airborne missile defense by \n2005. Frankly, a system that is ready to be fielded is presumably far \nenough along to be able to tell its performance, or one can only assume \na system is being fielded without any knowledge of how it actually will \nwork. That to me would not be a very prudent or a very wise deployment.\n  Other defense programs are also complex and difficult, yet they have \nmeasurable performance criteria against which they are tested. The F/A-\n22 aircraft program is a very complex and difficult system, as is the \nV-22 Osprey program. Yet both of these programs have well-established \nperformance criteria.\n  In fact, all major military programs, except missile defense, have \nperformance criteria or requirements which were approved relatively \nearly in a system's development and revised as necessary as the program \nmatures. I do not think it is incompatible to have a flexible system \nthat can be adapted, yet still have performance criteria, but it seems \nin our discussion of missile defense these two notions are completely \nseparated: Flexibility, innovation, seizing technological \nbreakthroughs, and simple performance criteria. They should be part and \nparcel of any program we undertake.\n  For example, all unmanned aerial vehicle programs, such as the \nPredator, have requirements stating how long they need to stay aloft, \nhow high they should fly, and how well their sensors can see. Yet this \nhas not interfered with their innovation, their development, and their \ndeployment.\n  The administration has claimed because it has adopted the new spiral \ndevelopment, capabilities-based acquisition approach, that establishing \nactual performance criteria and operational test plans is not \nappropriate because we just do not know for sure what missile defense \ncapabilities will ultimately emerge. But there are a number of other \nspiral development programs in the Department of Defense, and all of \nthem, except missile defense, have performance criteria and operational \ntest plans.\n  For example, the Global Hawk Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, which saw \nservice in Afghanistan and Iraq, is a spiral development program. Yet \nit has well-established performance requirements and a documented \noperational test plan.\n  There is absolutely no reason that missile defense should not have \nthe same sort of yardsticks for measuring progress.\n  Ballistic missile programs used to have performance criteria, such as \nhow many incoming missiles they should be able to engage, and how much \narea a system should defend. This enabled Congress to understand the \ncharacteristics of missile defense programs that were being funded and \nwhy they were necessary. Such criteria have been removed, and Congress \ndoes not know, for example, how many incoming missiles each missile \ndefense system is being designed to defend against or how much area the \nsystem is being designed to defend.\n  Without such information, Congress is essentially writing an $8 \nbillion to $9 billion blank check each year to the administration for \nmissile defense.\n  Over the previous 2 years, Congress has tried and tried again to get \nthe administration to provide the most basic information on its missile \ndefense programs. Time and again, the administration has refused to \nprovide it.\n  In fiscal year 2002, Congress directed the Department of Defense to \nprovide its most basic cost, schedule and performance goals for missile \ndefense.\n  We also asked the General Accounting Office to assess the progress \nbeing made towards achieving these goals.\n\n[[Page S6653]]\n\n  As late as the end of fiscal year 2002, when the first GAO assessment \nwas due, the Department had still not established a single meaningful \ngoal for its missile defense programs. GAO was forced to write to \nCongress saying that it could not complete its assess because there \nwere no goals to measure missile defense programs.\n  Lately, in response to continued Congressional pressure, the \nadministration has begun to establish a few very broad, very near-term \ngoals. But even these goals are misleading.\n  Secretary Aldridge, the Pentagon's acquisition chief, recently \ntestified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that he thought \nthe administration's 2004 missile defense would have a 90 percent \nchance of hitting an incoming warhead from North Korea.\n  Whether this is a firmly established goal or simply the individual \nopinion of a very sophisticated observer but nevertheless an individual \nopinion, it is hard to tell. Indeed, one can raise many questions about \nwhether this 90-percent figure as a goal is being achieved and can be \nachieved by 2004. Secretary Rumsfeld has said in public that the 2004 \nsystem is rudimentary. Does that mean a 90-percent goal will be \nachieved or does it mean something less?\n  Indeed, if we look at the system closely, there are many issues that \nemerge which would suggest that this is such a situation in which there \nare no goals. For example, the booster for the system that is designed \nto be deployed in 2004 has yet to be flown in an actual intercept. So \nthere is the question of making it work with the actual kill vehicle in \nan operationally feasible mode. That is a pretty significant issue when \nit comes to whether this system will have a certain degree of \nreliability.\n  The radar for the system was never designed for missile defense and \ncan never be actually tested in an actual intercept attempt. The \nPentagon's chief tester has told the Senate Armed Services Committee \nthat the 2004 missile defense, in his words, has not yet demonstrated \noperational capability. Yet it seems clear that, regardless, there is \nan intention to field this system in 2004.\n  All of these issues raise real questions as to the capability of this \nsystem. If we accept, in fact, that it might be 90 percent, is it 90 \npercent of hitting a missile with defense decoys or 90 percent of \nhitting a missile without a decoy? These are important points that I \nthink can be answered and should be answered by the Department of \nDefense as we go forward to invest something on the order of $9 billion \na year in missile defense.\n  The administration also claims that the missile defense system it \nplans to field in 2004 will protect all 50 States, but if we look at \nthe details such a defense is only possible if we have Navy ships \nconstantly patrolling the waters of North Korea using their radars to \npick up any ICBM launches headed towards Hawaii.\n  Initially, in the Clinton proposal there was a plan to build a very \nlarge radar designed particularly for ballistic missile defense that \nwas intended to and had established criteria that would include \nprotecting and covering all 50 States.\n  This new approach may in fact be effective, but, once again, we are \nnot sure--the Congress is not officially on record in either an \nunclassified or a classified sense--of what is the standard. Is it all \n50 States? Is it 50 States assuming that the Navy will have ships \nconstantly patrolling the waters off North Korea? Indeed, it is not \nquite sure whether those ships can constantly be patrolling the waters \noff of North Korea given the numerous missions in the war on terror, \ngiven the numerous military operations. That, too, has to be looked at \nand examined based upon some clear criteria.\n  Another point is that the radar on these ships is being adapted, but \nit was not originally designed to identify and track ICBM-type targets. \nThere is a question of whether the radar would be accurate enough to \nperform this mission.\n  If the Navy ships are not there, if the radar truly does not work as \nthey hope it works or it is not modified quickly enough, there is a \nreal question about the coverage of the system.\n  All of these points are being made to say in order to assess what we \nare buying, it helps to have these performance goals, to have them \nclearly delineated, to have the assumption laid out, and to have all of \nthis operationally tested, so when we deploy a system we can say with \ngreat confidence to the American people that it will provide this level \nof protection. I do not think we can say that at this point.\n  This amendment in no way inhibits the administration from fielding a \nsystem, any type of system, in 2004, but what it will give us is an \nopportunity to measure that system. How effective is that system? What \nthreats will this system engage? That type of knowledge is very \nimportant for us as we make our decisions. It is also incumbent upon \nthe administration to provide such knowledge. Again, I emphasize it can \nbe done either on a classified or unclassified basis because I \nunderstand there is a utility sometimes to have a system which our \nadversaries might assume is 100-percent effective. But at least the \nCongress must know this information.\n  The other fact of this lack of clarity and goals is it inhibits \noperational testing. Administrative witnesses have testified as to the \nneed for operational testing. We have passed laws establishing \noperational testing. This is the traditional routine way in which we \nverify whether a system works and also, as we improve the system, how \neffective the modifications and improvements are.\n  Every major defense program I can think of, except missile defense, \nhas established plans for operational testing. Without these criteria \nfor performance and operational testing, I do not know if we can, in \nfact, create and deploy a system of which we can be confident.\n  As we reestablish these performance criteria for missile defense \nprograms and require a plan for operational testing, Congress will \nregain an important tool to understand how well our missile defense \nprogram is succeeding, how our money is being spent--not our money, \nfrankly, but the American people's money. Without such criteria and \noperational testing, none of that clarity will be available to us.\n  I think something else will be very important. It will require the \nDepartment of Defense to face squarely these tough issues: What type of \nthreats can we defeat? How wide is the coverage of our system? What \nadditional resources must we bring to bear to make it effective? Is \nthis investment cost effective and cost efficient in terms of \nprotecting the American people?\n  Right now all of that is very amorphous, very nebulous because there \nis no standard to measure it, even a general standard, these general \ngoals I talked about. I hope this amendment could be accepted because \nit builds on provisions in the law that were adopted by the committee.\n  I commend Senator Allen for his efforts to include more cost data, \nmore lifetime cycles of the cost, what it will cost to field this \nsystem. This is an attempt to build on that foundation. I hope my \ncolleagues will see it as such, agree to this amendment, and provide \nthe kind of goals, operational testing and clarity that are needed so \nwe can assure the American public that when we deploy a missile defense \nsystem, it will live up at least to the standards that are disclosed to \nthe U.S. Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Reed \namendment. First, there have been a number of issues that Senator Reed \nand myself have worked together on, and I think quite effectively. It \nis with considerable regret that I stand today and oppose his \namendment.\n  It is an amendment that would add a number of reporting requirements \nfor the Missile Defense Agency and the Office of Test and Evaluation. I \ncannot buy into the argument that a few good, well-thought-out \nregulations does the job; that if we just put in more regulations it is \neven better. There is a good balance we need to sustain. We have found \nthat balance. This is an issue that in previous years has been hotly \ndebated within the Armed Services Committee and within my subcommittee \nin which this issue comes out.\n\n  This year we did not have any amendment--we had some debate but no \namendment in the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, which I chair; we \ndid not have any amendments in the full\n\n[[Page S6654]]\n\ncommittee. Now we are dealing with this issue in the Senate.\n  The Missile Defense Agency is attempting to develop an effective \nmissile defense system as rapidly as possible. They are structuring the \nprogram to meet the threats we currently face, while recognizing that \nthe missile threats will unpredictably evolve in the future. That is \none of the problems I have with the Reed amendment, its \nunpredictability. To do so, the Missile Defense Agency has taken a \ncapabilities-based approach that focused on developing a number of \nsystems.\n  The Reed amendment attempts to relate ballistic missile defense \nelement performance criteria to specific threats that these elements \nare designed to defeat. If it takes effect, the amendment would push \nthe Missile Defense Agency back toward threat specific development and \nacquisition, away from capabilities-based development and acquisition.\n  Why is that a problem? We do not always understand the threat facing \nthe United States. I can take us back to a couple of current situations \nwhere we did not understand what was happening with potential \nadversaries. In 1991, for example, in the Persian Gulf conflict, we got \ninto Iraq. Only then did we begin to recognize how far along the \nnuclear development program was in Iraq. That was 1991. The people in \nthe Defense Department, our experts, were surprised. People in defense \nintelligence were surprised. We looked back to the North Korea \nsituation. For some time we suspected there was, perhaps, nuclear \ndevelopment going on but we were not able to get that confirmed until \njust recently where North Korea finally admitted they were developing \nnuclear weapons.\n  My point is, when we have the development of a weapons program based \non what you think the threats are, it may not truly reflect what is \nhappening. The best thing we can do is decide, for example, on missile \ndefense, it is a capability that we need to have and we base it on the \ncapability of being able to develop that technology so we have the best \ntechnology. That is where we get the best deterrence in a program such \nas the ballistic missile system.\n  The systems or capabilities will be upgraded on a 2-year spiral, or \nblocks, as the technology matures. The Missile Defense Agency is \nseeking to develop a single integrated missile defense system \nconsisting of a seamless web of sensors and shooters tied together by \ncommand and control, battle management and communication systems. Each \nsystem element, such as THAAD or PAC-3 or the sea-based aegis systems, \ncan support the other, and it makes the other more effective.\n  Congress has already approved a number of Missile Defense Agency \nreporting and process requirements in the fiscal year 2002-2003 \nNational Defense Authorization Acts. Yet the Reed amendment requires \nanother layer of reporting requirements.\n  In response to the previous 2 years of legislation, the Missile \nDefense Agency provided a 300-plus-page system capability specification \nthat describes block 2004 system specifications and metrics in painful \ndetail, including battle manager, sensor, weapons by each element such \nas THAAD, PAC-3, and ABL and ground-based, midcourse, among others.\n\n  ABL also provided over 1,000 pages of a 2-volume adversary \ncapabilities document which describes all the performance \ncharacteristics that might be embodied in foreign threat missiles that \nU.S. missile defense systems might have to defeat. The budget \njustification document provides a funding breakdown by element and \nblock--a detailed set of goals for 2004 and more general goals for \nblock 2006 and beyond.\n  The amendment in question appears to require much that is already \nprovided by the Missile Defense Agency as well as reporting that is \nalready required by law. The Director of the Missile Defense Agency \nalready provides performance criteria. The Director of OTNE already \nestablished and provides operational test plans for missile defense \nsystems and also provides an annual assessment of the Missile Defense \nAgency test plan.\n  Here we are, saying a few well-thought-out regulations are good, they \nare fine, and we are making the assumption if a few are good, more \nregulations ought to be better. I don't agree with that. That takes \naway from and delays a program that needs to be moving forward in an \nexpeditious and thoughtful way. What we have in the present system \nprovides the accountability we need as lawmakers.\n  The other point is, when you tailor your development of your \ntechnology to the threats or perceived threats from your enemy, you \nwill be left in the dust. We do not always know what our enemies or \npotential enemies are doing. We have a capability to defend this \ncountry. If we want a strong defense system, we need to move ahead with \nthat defense system. It does have a deterrent effect.\n  It should be noted that the Missile Defense Agency already provides \nmore reporting than any other program in the Department of Defense. \nThere is no reason for Congress to require duplicative reporting on top \nof what is already authored or required. We cannot and should not be in \nthe business of micromanaging missile defense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I listened to Chairman Allard and I commend him for his \nleadership on the committee's subcommittee. The committee addressed a \nseries of issues and in this legislation they have made progress on \ntrying to do something we are all committed to do.\n  I point out in terms of reporting requirements, the legislation \nitself includes additional reporting requirements. For each ballistic \nmissile defense element, the production rate capabilities, the \npotential data availability, the expected cost, et cetera, the notion \nof having more reporting requirements has already found its way into \nthe legislation.\n  My point is that we are not, as yet, asking effectively--we have \nasked before but ineffectively--for some simple language about what are \nthe goals, and also how are we going to validate these goals through \noperational testing.\n  I do know the value of a capabilities approach but you have to ask a \nmore detailed question: The capability to defeat what? The Missile \nDefense Agency can answer what they know they are not going to defeat. \nThey have absolutely no plans at this point to be able to engage a \nsophisticated MIRVed weapon with multiple decoys. They tell you that \nflat, that is not 2004. What they will not tell us is what they prepare \nto engage, what they can engage.\n  I think, if they clearly understand they are not attempting a \ncapability to defeat one or multiple missiles launched from a \nsignificant power, such as Russia or China, they can tell us what \nprecisely they are engaged in trying to defeat.\n  So the notion about capabilities cannot be divorced from threats. \nThat is not possible in any type of military concept. The notion they \nhave to have a capabilities base does not excuse them from that because \nthey defined already their capability. It is a limited capability.\n  So I guess I would ask the question: What are the limits to that \ncapability?\n  What I am proposing is not inconsistent with the notion of \ncapabilities in an evolving system. This amendment clearly lets them \nrevise these criteria daily, if they like. But at least it insists that \nthere be some criteria, some goals.\n  The reluctance to provide us this information has, perhaps, many \nreasons. One possibility is they don't know. But if they don't know \nthis, that is even more shocking. We are spending $9 billion a year and \nthey don't know, in the Missile Defense Agency, what type of threat \nthey are trying to defeat with this deployment in 2004? The alternative \nis they know but they will not tell us, and that is equally disturbing.\n  Frankly, I think this amendment makes sense. It does not restrict \ndeployment. It does not restrict funding. Every major weapons \ndevelopment system has goals, has operational testing plans, except for \nthe Missile Defense Program.\n  I, again, urge my colleagues to accept or adopt or support this \namendment because it answers a very fundamental question, a question I \nthink every Member of this body and every American wants answered: What \nare we buying for $9 billion each year? How will it protect us? From \nwhat will it protect us?\n  I think the people of my State--capability--threats--they want to \nknow\n\n[[Page S6655]]\n\nwhat this system will be valuable to do.\n  I am happy to yield to the chairman.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to ask the following \nquestion: We have a process in our committee that is not unlike what \nother committees do. We have our subcommittee structure where these \nissues are brought up and worked through the subcommittee. Then they \nare fully worked in the full committee in a series of two markups.\n  I say to my distinguished colleague from Rhode Island, one for whom I \nhave tremendous admiration, you have been a watchdog on this subject \nfor some period of time. I have listened carefully to the debate today.\n  Where I am perplexed is that in our bill, on pages 26 and 27--you \nneed not go to that; I will just read it to you--``Oversight and \nprocurement of ballistic missile defense,'' we enumerate a series of \nmatters that we have in the nature of reports. This was carefully \nworked out by the staff of the majority and staff of the minority. Your \nconcerns were not raised, as I understand it, at the subcommittee \nlevel. They were not raised at the full markup level. Here we are now \nconfronting the entire Senate with the issue of whether we should go \ninto more reporting requirements, above and beyond what is in the bill.\n  I say to my distinguished colleague, if you go back--for instance, \nlast year you had similarly at the last minute, the last amendment on \nthe bill, a series of further reporting requirements. We ended up \nworking that out, accepting parts of it, and went ahead with the bill. \nBut according to my calculation, the Armed Services Committee receives \nmore than 2,000 pages of reporting each year now from the Missile \nDefense Agency. I repeat, 2,000 pages. We are putting more and more \nrequirements on this Agency, requiring more and more staff on subjects \nwhich, for reasons perhaps you will give now, you did not raise in the \nsubcommittee and you didn't raise in the full committee.\n\n  The purpose of our staffs is to try to work out and reconcile, in the \ncourse of the preparation of the bill before it is finally marked up \nand brought to the Senate, such matters as this. After all, reporting \nrequirements are fairly arcane and as a general rule we try to accede \nto the requests of Members who feel strongly about it. Unfortunately, \nthey pile up and become quite onerous, but nevertheless, the practice \nof the Senate is to accord courtesy to fellow Members.\n  But now we are up to 2,000 pages from one agency of the Department of \nDefense. To the best of my knowledge, I don't know how many people on \nthe committee, members and staff, go through all these 2,000 pages at \nthe moment.\n  Could the Senator, then, advise me as to the procedure in the \nsubcommittee, procedure in the full committee, and why the staff didn't \nhave these matters under their cognizance at the time they were trying \nto reconcile the differences and prepare the bill language on reporting \nrequirements?\n  Mr. REED. I will be happy to respond to the chairman.\n  First, this is an issue I think is not only important but at a level \nwhere it is not just a detail of reporting. I think it goes to the \nheart of the accountability, not just for our committee but for the \nwhole Senate.\n  Frankly, all of our colleagues have to be able to answer the question \nto their constituents: How much protection are we getting for these \nresources?\n  I understand the Missile Defense Agency, as so many Department of \nDefense organizations, is required to submit reports. But they \ncertainly have the resources to do these reports.\n  What I find striking--again, it is a reflection, too, of the previous \nyears--we have in the past tried to get this information. We required \ngoal setting and a GAO assessment. I was, frankly, amazed--and this \namazement came about in the preparation, not only for the committee \nmarkup but also coming to the floor--that the GAO simply sort of threw \nup its hands because the Missile Defense Agency says we really don't \nhave any goals; we can't tell you; they are too imprecise.\n  So I think this is an issue that should be engaged by the entire \nSenate. There was no intention on my part to undermine the procedures \non the committee, the Armed Services Committee or the subcommittee. I \nwas not aware in order to bring a matter to the floor one had to offer \nit first in subcommittee or full committee.\n  I think this is an issue that is of a magnitude and of a degree of \nclarity that Members of the entire Senate can make a judgment and \nshould make a judgment. That is my response.\n  Mr. WARNER. I take it from your reply that one Senator thinks it is a \nmatter of enormous importance. Was there a reason it wasn't brought up \nin the subcommittee of jurisdiction? We have the distinguished chairman \nhere. So those members who, on our committee, have the first--should we \nsay the first response? I like that phrase, first response--to look at \nmatters of this nature, if it is that important why wasn't it brought \nup then? Then we had the subsequent markup session. If it was that \nimportant, why wasn't it brought up then?\n\n  It seems to me that the way the members of the committee can best \nserve the Senate is to take those entrusted with specific subjects, put \ntheir minds on it, put it in the bill. If you had endeavored to put it \nin, it was rejected at subcommittee, rejected at full committee, then \ncome on out on the floor and roll it out with all the guns and say: \nLook, colleagues, the committee didn't do its work.\n  Mr. REED. If I may reclaim my time, first, I do not assume--just on a \nprocedural basis--that is a requirement. I think by law every Member of \nthe Senate can offer amendments on any bill when it comes to the floor, \nwhether you are on the committee or not. Being on the committee does \nnot prevent you from offering an amendment if you did not offer it \nbefore.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am not contesting that. You recognize that. I am just \npointing out, in 25 years, how the committee has to do its work.\n  Mr. REED. If there are procedural oppositions to the bill, that is \none thing. But I think the substance is compelling enough to respond, \nand I think everyone here is capable to respond in substance. Either \nyou are going to let the system continue to operate, which I think \neither because of--whatever number of reasons, it has not clearly \nidentified goals and objectives, has not conducted robust testing that \nI think we all believe should be concomitant with the defense program. \nI am trying to remedy those issues. I think this is a perfectly \nappropriate place to introduce such an amendment, to have the committee \nengaged. All our colleagues are here. The staff is here. The arguments \ncan be made here, and I hope they will be. I think it is an important \nissue. I am prepared to submit it to a vote. That is my understanding \nof the procedure.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I do not in any way contest the Senator's \nassertion that this is an important subject. I simply ask, can't we as \na committee better serve our colleagues if we make an assessment first \nat the subcommittee, where the members are fully conversant with all \nthese issues, and then at the full committee where, again, members are \nconversant, rather than to spring it out on the floor?\n  If I may say to my good friend, it is almost as if the chairman of \nthe subcommittee didn't do his work and the ranking member didn't do \nhis work and the members of the committee didn't do their work because \nthis matter is of such great importance because it goes to the very \nheart of the Missile Defense Program.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, if I might make a comment or two?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Our committee has worked and put in hours of effort and \ntestimony on this issue of spiral development, or whether we have an \ninflexible program, which I think the Reed amendment leads us, to where \nyou have specific timelines for specific parts of the system. What \nhappens if you run into a problem in one particular part of the system? \nIt delays the whole development.\n  With the spiral concept, it gives the developers of the system, the \nMissile Defense Agency, the opportunity to move forward in other \naspects of development. It is a multifaceted system. It has to do with \ncommunications for a number of different systems and parts.\n  In my view, one of the problems we have had in the past, with cost \noverruns and whatnot, is where you have had inflexibility in the system \nand you\n\n[[Page S6656]]\n\nfind one real problem area and then all of a sudden it ties up moving \nforward.\n  That is the whole concept between spiral development. We have had \nhours upon hours of this concept of spiral development. We have General \nKadish and many of the individuals who are ``in the know'' testify \nabout how important it is that we take this new approach so we can move \nforward with some of the more difficult and more technologically \nadvanced programs, such as missile defense.\n  Again, the assumption is that we have some regulations which I think \nare reasonable which we put in bills in years past, and we put some \nmore in this year's bill. The assumption has been made that if we have \nfewer regulations, it is better. That is not an assumption we should \nmake. I think there is a proper balance. I think the committee has \nworked and studied that issue.\n  That we didn't have any amendments in the Strategic Subcommittee, as \nwell as the Armed Services Committee, indicates that members of those \ncommittees having heard testimony for hours upon hours are comfortable \nwhere we are right now.\n  I hope we oppose the Reed amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I pose a question to my colleague? I \nsee that Senator Bill Nelson of Florida is the ranking member on this \nsubcommittee, together with Senator Byrd, Senator Reed, Senator Nelson \nof Nebraska, and Senator Dayton.\n  The Senator has looked at this very carefully. Is there a means by \nwhich to work this out in some way--as to portions of it which you \nbelieve we will not go back over, and the issue of why it wasn't raised \nbut now that it is raised--is there a means by which we can do it \nrather than taking up further time in the Senate on reporting \nrequirements?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I think maybe we can sit down and have some further \ndiscussion. All of a sudden, this gets brought up on the floor of the \nSenate and we need some time to maybe talk with the parties.\n  As the Senator mentioned in his comments, we felt as if we pretty \nwell worked this out in committee. The various members on my \nsubcommittee who are knowledgeable on the subject, the Senator from \nVirginia and myself have worked out what we thought was a reasonable \nlevel of rules and regulations. Now we have an amendment that is \ncalling for more rules and regulations. We might be able to work it \nout. I think we need some time. I hope this could be set aside at least \nfor the time being to give us an opportunity to kind of work this issue \na little bit more on the floor of the Senate and then perhaps come back \nto it at a later time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Is that an acceptable offer?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I have no opposition to taking some time \nprior to coming forward to see if we can reach an agreement, if we \ncan't ask for a vote. I have absolutely no opposition to setting aside \nand working it to try to come up with something with which we feel \ncomfortable.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe laid aside with due diligence and good faith to see what might be \nadded. I will come back to the 2,000 pages.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will withhold that for a moment, I would \nlike to add one quick comment on this amendment as to what the stakes \nare.\n  First, I want to commend Senator Reed for bringing this amendment to \nthe attention of the Senate. This is not, in all fairness, simply a \nreporting amendment. This is not just more reports. This tells the \nMissile Defense Office to adopt performance criteria which are \nmeasurable, adopt an operational test plan for your systems, adopt a \ntimetable, all of which can be changed any time they want to. I don't \nthink it is fair to characterize this as some inflexible thing which is \nlaid upon the Ballistic Missile Defense Office. It is highly flexible. \nIt just tells the Ballistic Missile Defense Office to do whatever other \nprogram managers do, of every major weapons system--adopt a measurable \nperformance criteria and adopt an operational test plan, including some \nkind of timetable. It is neither inflexible, nor is it unusual.\n  I don't know of any other major weapons system that does not have \nthese kind of criteria. I just didn't agree with that characterization \nof it. Where I do agree totally with our chairman is that if there is a \nway to work this matter out, it should be worked out. This is an \nimportant system. The issue is no longer whether a ballistic missile \ndefense is going to be fielded. That is not the issue anymore. The \nquestion now is whether it will have any kind of performance criteria \nby which it can be judged. That is the issue.\n  It seems to me we ought to be grateful as a body to the Senator from \nRhode Island for bringing to our attention the fact that these \nimportant measurements are absent. But in fairness, I think it is not \nsimply more reports to the Congress. It is saying to the Ballistic \nMissile Defense Office: We want you to adopt performance criteria that \nare measurable. It is not a matter of reporting to us. It is a matter \nof doing it for yourself and for the American people. That is what the \nissue is here. Send us a copy, by the way, will you?\n  Mr. WARNER. I simply say to my colleague that if there was a serious \nissue in the function of the Missile Defense Agency, in your judgment--\nand you attach enormous importance to this--why did we not consider it \nin the course of the subcommittee hearing?\n  Mr. LEVIN. There are all kinds of amendments that have not been \nconsidered. Senator Reed is one human being who has taken upon himself \na huge amount of material to digest and present to the committee. He \ndid a magnificent job. I think my good friend from Virginia would agree \nwith that. There are other things which, as a matter of time, one is \nnot able to put together and present to the committee at that moment \nbut which are important to present to the entire Senate. I don't think \nwe can fault Senator Reed in that regard. That is purely a matter, it \nseems to me, of what human limitations might be in terms of what one \nhuman being can do. But he surely did more than his share in terms of \nthe work that was presented to the committee.\n  Mr. WARNER. It simply says: Agency, if it is that important in your \njudgment in reporting, it goes to the very heart of the oversight \nprocess. We should have raised it in subcommittee, adopted an amendment \nof this type, and worked it out.\n\n  I was told the staff worked very closely with one another on the \nprovisions we did put in the bill as to reporting on missile defense \nwhich we believed was a closed-out item.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is always ideal to try to bring matters before the \ncommittee. The chairman knows I agree with him on that. Sometimes it is \nnot possible just it terms of the workload to do that. I don't think we \ncan fault any member of the committee if and when that load is such \nthat they have to present it to the floor because they were not able to \nget together in place all the material at the time of the committee \nhearings. The Senator from Rhode Island would be involved in the debate \non many nuclear weapons systems even though those matters in some cases \nwere brought to the attention of the committee.\n  There are new formulations just because new thinking has been brought \nto bear since our committee hearings and markup on those subjects.\n  But, in any event, I fully concur with the Senator from Virginia. If \nwe can possibly work this out to fill in an omission in what the \nBallistic Missile Defense Office should be doing, which is to develop \nthese performance criteria which are measurable for this major system \nto have an operational test plan for this major weapons system, it \nseems to me if that can be worked out either over lunch or during the \nafternoon, I fully concur with the chairman that we ought to do that.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank both of my colleagues. We have had a good \ncolloquy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I want to clarify. We are putting this aside \nfor a period of time to work on this. But if we can't reach--and I hope \nwe can--an understanding, we will have a vote, I presume, early in the \nevening.\n  I think that is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Those are matters we delegate to the leadership, the \nmajority leader, and the Democratic leader.\n\n[[Page S6657]]\n\nThere is no way we will deny you a vote, if we fail to work it out.\n  Mr. REED. I will endeavor to reach an understanding, and hopefully we \ncan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Is the Reed \namendment now laid aside? Has that action been taken?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So that we now at this point have three amendments which \nare laid aside, and there is no amendment which is pending before the \nSenate, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I believe there are two first degrees and a \nsecond-degree amendment laid aside.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Did the Chair say two first-degree amendments and one \nsecond degree?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Republican manager of the bill ready to move forward \non any unanimous consent requests?\n  Mr. WARNER. We are about to work out a timing for the vote on the \nDaschle-Graham or Graham-Daschle amendment. I simply ask that the 5 \nminutes equally divided be expanded to 10 minutes, so I think we are \nprepared to go ahead and set that, if that is the desire of the leader.\n  Mr. REID. That would be certainly fine.\n  Mr. WARNER. I believe we will propound that UC in a moment. In the \nmeantime I will attend to some other housekeeping matters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/20/senate-section/article/S6657-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, these resolutions concern pro se civil \nactions commenced in the United States District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of California by the same plaintiff. The first resolution \nconcerns a suit that the plaintiff has brought against seventy-seven \nMembers of the Senate claiming that their votes approving the joint \nresolution authorizing the use of military force against Iraq violated \nthe law. Included among the 77 defendants plaintiff has sued are the \nnew Members who were not even in the Senate at the time of the vote on \nthe resolution authorizing the use of force.\n  This suit is without merit as the court has no jurisdiction over the \nmatter and the Speech or Debate Clause bars suits against legislators \nfor the performance of their legislative duties under the Constitution. \nThere is simply no legal basis for suing Senators for their role in \nauthorizing the use of military force against Iraq. While a Senator's \nvote on whether to authorize the use of military force by the President \nis an appropriate subject for political debate, it cannot be the basis \nfor filing a lawsuit against the Senator in court.\n  The second resolution concerns a lawsuit filed by the same plaintiff \nagainst Senator Frist for allegedly failing to schedule for \nconsideration by the Senate the repeal of provisions enacted as part of \nthe Homeland Security Act of 2002. This suit is also without any merit \nas the court has no jurisdiction over the matter and the suit is barred \nby the Speech or Debate Clause. Senator Frist's decisions on the agenda \nand schedule for the legislative business of this body do not present a \njusticiable issue for the courts.\n  These resolutions authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent the \nSenate defendants in these two actions.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, over the past year and a half I have spoken \non many occasions of including women in the reconstruction of \nAfghanistan. Since then we have seen the inclusion of two women cabinet \nmembers give hope to the women of Afghanistan. We have also learned the \ninclusion of only two women is certainly not enough. Greater \nrepresentation of women is necessary in Afghanistan. Likewise, Iraqi \nwomen should play some part, and I believe an important one, in the \nrebuilding of their country. Iraqi\n\n[[Page S6658]]\n\nwomen should be an effective force for peace, for democracy, and for \nhuman rights. Women must be included, and not just symbolically but \nsubstantively, in the charting of the future of these two nations. So \ntoday I urge the Bush administration to, No. 1, ensure women are \nincluded as full participants in the new government of Iraq and, No. 2, \nthat there be an improvement and expansion of our security mission in \nAfghanistan so that women are free to fully participate all over that \ncountry.\n  The first U.S.-sponsored planning meetings for Iraq give me concern. \nIn a meeting of Iraqi expatriates in London, 3 out of 65 participants \nwere women. Women at this meeting urged greater representation in \nsubsequent meetings, but at the next meeting in Iraq in April there \nwere still only 4 women out of 80 participants. In fact, women were \nlosing, not gaining, representation in Iraq. Women must be included in \nleadership roles in the planning of the new interim government as well \nas in cabinet positions in the interim government itself.\n  In spite of Saddam Hussein's impression, women in Iraq have a proud \nhistory and involvement in the workforce in public service. We can't \nlet this history be lost.\n  In recent history women have held 20 percent of Iraq's parliamentary \nseats which is significantly more than the 3.5 percent average among \nArab states. Let me repeat that: In the Iraq parliament, 20 percent of \nthe seats were held by women and in the rest of the Middle East Arab \nstates 3.5 percent women are in the parliamentary seats. Even though \nmany of these parliaments--in fact, I think I could say all of them, \nare really not without a lot of power--I am sorry, they are without a \nlot of power--it still says a great deal as to the makeup of these \nparliamentary bodies--3.5 percent as the average among Arab states.\n  We need to do better in Iraq. We need to do better in Afghanistan. \nIraqi women prior to the war held professional jobs. They were well \nrepresented in medicine, engineering, academia, and in civil service. \nIn 2002, 38 percent of Iraqi doctors were women.\n  Women in Iraq are well educated. Last year, almost 35 percent of \nuniversity and polytechnic students in Iraq were women.\n  We also cannot allow a lack of security to destroy women's rights in \nIraq as they have done and continue to do in Afghanistan. Frightened by \nthe chaos and lawlessness on the streets of Baghdad, many Iraqi women \nare prisoners in their own homes. Few, if any, women are seen in \npublic. The markets and the gas stations are occupied almost entirely \nby men. This is a grim picture for a country whose women have enjoyed a \nlevel of independence that is unusual in most Arab countries.\n  Security problems are eroding the hope of many Afghan women, as well, \nand it is a concern. In light of this situation, I was pleased to see \nthat Germany's Chancellor, who is the head of the International \nSecurity Assistance Force (ISAF), has called for an expansion of this \ninternational peace-keeping mission in Afghanistan. This request is \nsupported by UN officials, Afghan women leaders, humanitarian \norganizations and women's rights groups and even by Congress.\n  Last year, we passed the Afghan Freedom Support Act, a bi-partisan \ninitiative--which called for expansion of peace-keeping forces. The \nPresident signed this legislation into law, but still, we have no \nexpansion of ISAF, International Security Assistance Force, in \nAfghanistan.\n  Afghanistan cannot wait much longer for improvements in security. In \nsome areas, warlords are imposing Taliban-like restrictions on women \nand girls. Girls schools have been bombed. Humanitarian aid workers \nhave been killed. Security in the southern part of the country is so \nbad that UN workers now have to be accompanied by armed guards.\n  This fall, Afghans will assemble to adopt a Constitution. One year \nfrom now, elections will be held--we hope. Only if security is \ndramatically improved throughout the country will it be possible for \npeople who advocate women's rights and human rights to participate in \ndeliberations about their constitution. Fair and democratic voter \nregistration and elections will not happen without improvements in the \nsecurity situation. Without proper security, without the full inclusion \nof women in the constitution, and without the ability for women to \nparticipate in elections as voters and candidates, women's rights will \nhave no chance in Afghanistan.\n  We have won the war in both Iraq and Afghanistan--the military has \ncertainly triumphed--but we are in jeopardy of losing the peace. Women \nin Afghanistan and Iraq--indeed the citizens of these nations, and the \nworld community will not be able to sustain this loss.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will speak for a moment on an unrelated \nmatter. I know we are working on a schedule to accommodate a vote on \nthe amendment that was offered last night by Senator Graham of South \nCarolina, myself, and others.\n  Last week, I spoke about the burden of the high cost of health care \non families in South Dakota and across the country.\n  I spoke of citizens who were forced to pay health care premiums as \nhigh as $10,000 per year but received only the sparest benefits in \nreturn.\n  I spoke of citizens with serious health problems who were not able to \nacquire coverage because insurers decided it wasn't profitable for \nthem.\n  I spoke of the millions of Americans living in fear because they were \njust one layoff, one bad crop, or one illness away from losing their \nhealth insurance and being driven into poverty and poor health.\n  But the high costs of health insurance are a burden not only to \nindividuals, they are also a huge burden to small business. In the past \nyear alone, health care premiums for businesses have risen more than 13 \npercent. If this keeps up, the cost of health care for businesses will \ndouble every 7 years--six times faster than their revenues.\n  Small businesses, which employ 50 percent of the workers in this \ncountry, face the greatest pressure of all. Because they are not big \nenough to bargain with insurers for better rates, small businesses too \noften are forced to pay for the nationwide increase in health care \ncosts.\n  In the past year, in the midst of the toughest business environment \nin a generation, the total cost for insuring employees of small \nbusinesses rose 18 percent. Seventy percent of small businesses that do \nnot cover their workers say that high costs are the No. 1 obstacle.\n  Many businesses are forced to shift costs to their workers in the \nform of higher copayments and fewer benefits. Many others cut benefits \naltogether. Those who want to keep their commitment to their employees \npay a penalty for having less capital to grow their business and create \nmore jobs.\n  Entrepreneurs with good ideas and solid business plans are scared off \nbecause health premiums are making the cost of starting and growing a \nbusiness higher and higher. Skyrocketing health costs could pose the \nsingle greatest obstacle to entrepreneurship and growth in our economy \ntoday.\n  I recently heard from the Jensen family. Daren and Paula Jensen live \nwith their three boys in Langford, a small town of about 300 in the \nnortheast corner of South Dakota.\n  Daren and Paula own a body shop, Jensen's Auto, which Daren runs. The \nJensens have one employee, but because the cost of insurance is so \nhigh, they cannot afford to pay for the insurance to provide health \nbenefits.\n  Daren used to receive coverage through his wife who worked at the \nlocal bank, but when she quit her job to take care of their children, \nthe family was covered through COBRA, the law that provides temporary \naccess to a former employer's insurance.\n  Their COBRA monthly premium was $525, but to keep that same coverage \nafter COBRA expired would cost them more than twice that. The Jensens \ncould not afford to spend $14,000 a year\n\n[[Page S6659]]\n\non health coverage. So they had to find another health plan.\n  They researched every possible plan and could not find an affordable \none to cover the whole family. In the end, it made more sense to seek \ninsurance separately. Daren enrolled in a plan that cost $250 a month \nand has a $500 deductible. Since Daren is a diabetic and spends $150 \nper month on medication, his coverage was the most important. The rest \nof the family--Paula and the three boys--enrolled in a plan with a \n$3,000 annual premium and a $1,000 deductible.\n  After a year, the premiums went up to almost $5,000. They could no \nlonger afford coverage so Paula dropped hers, and her children have \nfound coverage through South Dakota's Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, CHIP.\n  Too many small business owners face exactly that challenge, but we \ncan do something to help them and support the efforts of entrepreneurs \nwho drive our economy. A recent study shows that nearly 9 out of 10 \nsmall businesses favor a tax credit that would help employers buy \nhealth insurance for their employees.\n  In January, a number of us introduced a small business tax credit \nprovision in S. 10, the Health Care Coverage Expansion and Quality \nImprovement Act of 2003. This 50-percent tax credit will help small \nbusinesses with less than 50 employees obtain affordable health \ncoverage.\n  The small business tax credit will help small business owners, such \nas the Jensens, spark more investment and growth by small business and \nmove us closer to health care for every American.\n  This problem will not solve itself. Unless we act, health care \npremiums will continue to rise, driving more people on to the rolls of \nthe uninsured and keeping more businesses from growing and creating \njobs.\n  We can do better. It is a national problem, and it demands national \nleadership to fix it. Small businesses can, once again, be the engine \nfor growth in our economy, but we need to provide them with the \nopportunities to remove the obstacles to that growth.\n  This is a critical moment in our Nation's history. We have an \nobligation to focus on the troubles of our economy and the Americans \nwho are struggling to work and raise families.\n  We intend to do all we can to keep the Senate's attention focused on \nthe crisis in health care. Our citizens are asking for this kind of \nleadership, and we have an obligation to answer their call.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for \nyielding. I have been working with Senators on both sides of the aisle \nto approve a compensation package for guardsmen and reservists. We have \na modification to Senator Daschle's amendment. I second-degreed his \namendment last night. We have reached a compromise where we merged the \nbest of the two packages. Basically, what we are trying to do is make \nsure that Guard and Reserve members, if they choose to, can become \nmembers of TRICARE, the military health care network for military \nmembers and their families, by paying a premium. It would be what a \nretiree pays plus $100 for an enlisted Guard or Reserve member, $150 \nfor an officer. So it is a very good deal for the Reserve and Guard \nfamilies. They pay into the system if they choose to be a member of \nTRICARE. That way when they are called to active duty they do not leave \none health care plan for another. They will have continuity of health \ncare. They do not get bounced around between systems. It would really \nhelp with recruitment and retention. It has been a bipartisan effort \nlike none I have ever experienced.\n  I want to add cosponsors, and then I will yield for Senator DeWine, \nwho has been a tremendous leader on this issue. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the following Senators be added as cosponsors to this compromise \nproduct: Senators Clinton, DeWine, Kennedy, Miller, Allen, Leahy, \nStabenow, Mikulski, Landrieu, Chambliss, Campbell, Collins, and Dorgan.\n  I compliment Senator Daschle for his fine efforts in making this \npossible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the entire military coalition for all their hard \nwork and support for this effort. I thank all of my colleagues. I also \nthank General Smith of the Ohio National Guard for all they have done \nto keep this initiative moving forward.\n  As my colleagues are well aware, our amendment would offer a \ncomprehensive approach to health coverage for members of our military \nreserve component. Put simply, it would provide a critical health care \nsafety net for service members and their families by offering \nuninterrupted, affordable health insurance.\n  I can't emphasize enough how important this is both as a readiness \nand as a retention issue.\n  We know how important it is that we fund our military hardware and \nbase installations. But, at the same time, we can't ignore our military \npersonnel. We can't ignore the very men and women who voluntarily lay \ntheir lives on the line to protect our national security. It's the very \nleast we can do, particularly as we continue to rely more and more on \nour Reserve and National Guard.\n  Our amendment is an important sign of support for those called to \nserve, as well as their families. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment is intended to close an \nunfortunate and unacceptable gap in health insurance coverage for \nfamilies of Reserve and Guard members who are called up for active duty \nin the Armed Forces. The amendment is a needed step forward in taking \ncare of our troops and their families, and it includes most of the \nprovisions of S. 647 that I introduced earlier this year to close the \ngap.\n  Today's military relies more heavily than ever on the Reserve and \nGuard.\n\n[[Page S6661]]\n\nOver 215,000 Guard and Reserve soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen \nhave been mobilized in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation \nEnduring Freedom, and Operation Noble Eagle. One challenge they should \nnot have to face is maintaining their health insurance coverage. The \nproblem is that few employers are willing to continue health insurance \ncoverage for Guard and Reserve employees and family members when they \nare activated.\n  According to the General Accounting Office, nearly 80 percent of \nreservists have health care coverage when they are working in the \nprivate sector. Almost all of them would like to maintain that coverage \nwhen they are activated, in order to provide continued health benefits \nfor their family members. The military's TRICARE coverage works well \nfor the reservists when they are activated, but it is not a realistic \nalternative for family members since more TRICARE providers are located \nclose to military bases that are often far from the homes where the \nfamily members of the reservists continue to live.\n  In fact, 95 percent of active-duty military families live near bases \nand health care facilities, so TRICARE is readily available to them. \nBut only 25 percent of Guard and Reserve families live near bases, so \nTRICARE is inaccessible for them. Nevertheless, the other reservists \nfeel they have no alternative, since their private insurance has \nlapsed. So they change to TRICARE while they are activated, and then \nchange back to their former plan when the activation ends.\n  This amendment will enable them to enroll their family members in \nTRICARE, too. It is the right thing to do but it solves only part of \nthe problem.\n  When TRICARE is not a realistic alternative for family members, they \nhave the option to maintain their private health insurance plan during \nthe activation. The frequency and length of activations for Guard and \nReserves are disruptive and stressful enough. We should do everything \nwe can to enable families to maintain their coverage and avoid \nunnecessary upheaval.\n  We had hoped to achieve that goal in this amendment as well, but the \nconsent agreement means we cannot include it. So I urge the Senate to \nadopt the pending amendment to make TRICARE available to Reserve and \nGuard personnel and families and let us work together to deal with this \nother aspect of the problem, too.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nGraham-Daschle amendment to the fiscal year 2004 Defense authorization \nbill. This amendment will take a much needed step to improve the \nreadiness and strength of the National Guard and Reserve by ensuring \nthat more of our citizen-soldiers have adequate health insurance.\n  Almost 220,000 members of the Guard and Reserve answered the call to \nduty for the war in Iraq. These volunteer soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nand marines have responded with professionalism, skill, and honor. In \nmy own State, hundreds of members of the Green Mountain Boys from the \nVermont National Guard were deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan and \nthroughout the United States to answer the call to service. Our \nNation's military would not be as large or as strong without these \ndedicated--and often-used--soldiers. Time and time again, the Total \nForce concept that we in Congress developed and promoted has given our \nmilitary unparalled strength and unity.\n  The increased callups of the Reserves since September 11 has raised \nsome problems that threaten the long-term readiness of this critical \nforce and--in turn--of our entire military structure. A recent GAO \nstudy underscored that more than 20 percent of those reservists ready \nto deploy at a moment's notice do not have health insurance. At least \n500 of the 4,000 members of the Vermont National Guard currently do not \nhave coverage. These shortfalls mean that there are reservists who are \nreporting for duty who have not had routine access to doctors, to \ntreatment, or medicine they might need, or to hospitals. These \nsoldiers--ready to make the ultimate sacrifice at any moment--may not \nbe in the best physical shape because our Government is not protecting \nits investment.\n  At the same time, many families in Vermont and in other States have \ntold me about substantial turbulence from the callups. Even beyond the \nunderstandable worry of watching a loved one head off for battle and \ndealing with loss of income from the temporary departure from a \ncivilian job, families have had to experience the frustration and \nconfusion created by switching health insurance plans. This disruption \nhas resonated from the home front to the frontlines, becoming a factor \nin reservists' willingness to stay in service. These patriots make \nselfless decisions to sacrifice time with their families. Some \nsacrifice their own lives in the line of duty to their country. When we \nask a reservist or a guardsman to answer the call, it is our duty to \nhelp them take proper care of their families and to make the transition \nto active duty as easy as possible.\n\n  This amendment is a version of S. 852, the National Guard and Reserve \nComprehensive Health Benefits Act of 2003. I worked closely with \nSenators Graham, Daschle, DeWine, Clinton, and Smith in crafting this \nlegislation to deal with medical readiness problems for our National \nGuard in two main ways. First, the legislation makes members of the \nGuard and Reserve eligible to enroll in TRICARE on a cost-share basis. \nSecond, it allows families to apply to the Defense Department to \nreceive reimbursement for keeping their current health plans during a \ndeployment. The reimbursement is capped to ensure that the costs are no \ngreater than putting the family on TRICARE.\n  This legislation is cost-effective, solving the problem with the \nminimum necessary expenditures. The Congressional Budget Office has \ninformally scored the entire bill at $4 billion over 5 years, going \nfrom about $350 million in the first year and leveling out at about \n$1.1 billion per year in the fifth year. Figures from the GAO report \nconfirm these cost estimates.\n  This Reserve health care amendment will cost far less than increasing \nactive-duty end-strength or than having to substantially increase \nrecruiting and retention programs--steps which will be necessary if \nadequate support is not provided to our Reserves.\n  Let me make sure everyone is clear about what this vote means. A vote \nin support of the amendment is a vote to ensure a vibrant future for \nthe Guard and Reserve. It is a vote that recognizes, as have all of the \nmajor military associations, that we cannot continue to have a Total \nForce if the benefit structure for the Reserves is not improved. A vote \nagainst the Daschle amendment means treating the Guard and Reserve as \nlow-paid contractors to the militry--the temporary hires who can do the \njob but who cost less because they do not have the proper salaries, \nbenefits, and protections as their full-time counterparts.\n  At a time when the Nation has never relied more heavily on the \nNational Guard and Reserve, I urge all Senators to vote in support of \nthe Graham-Daschle amendment, which will ensure a healthy, effective \nmilitary into the foreseeable future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several endorsement letters from various \nmilitary Reserve associations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        National Guard Association\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 10, 2003.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy. On behalf of the men and women of the \n     National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS), I \n     thank you for the stalwart support you have given the \n     National Guard over the years. The NGAUS is pleased to offer \n     its support for your legislation entitled the National Guard \n     and Reserve Comprehensive Health Benefits Act of 2003. This \n     important legislation would offer members of the selected \n     reserve and their families, the opportunity to participate in \n     the Tricare on a cost-share basis; provide a partial subsidy \n     of private health insurance premiums for family members of \n     Guardsmen who wish to retain their private health insurance; \n     and improve transition coverage upon deactivation.\n       The National Guard and Reserve contributions to the ongoing \n     operations in Iraq, fighting the global war on terrorism, \n     protecting the homeland, and supporting contingency \n     operations around the world are a key indicator of the \n     importance of maintaining a high level of readiness. The \n     General Accounting Office recently found more than twenty-one \n     percent of National Guard and Reserve members do not have \n     health coverage. Forty percent of those individuals\n\n[[Page S6662]]\n\n     without insurance are in the junior enlisted ranks.\n       Units with nearly twenty-one percent of its member unable \n     to deploy due to medical reasons has a major impact on the \n     ability of that unit to complete its mission. Providing \n     Tricare during all phases of service can decrease an already \n     lengthy mobilization process by ensuring medical readiness is \n     routinely sustained. Medical readiness is an important factor \n     in unit readiness.\n       Recent National Guard mobilizations have demonstrated how \n     quickly the guard can be ready to fulfill their federal \n     mission. Some of these notifications for mobilization have \n     given Guardsmen hours and days, as opposed to the days and \n     weeks normally required. This reduced ramp also requires \n     members of the Guard to maintain their family readiness plans \n     in order to lessen the complications and distractions during \n     deployments. Providing continuity of health coverage for \n     family members will ensure those who support our service \n     members and make it possible for them to serve, are provided \n     for while their loved ones are away.\n       As always, the NGAUS stands ready to assist you and looks \n     forward to our continued relationship ensuring a strong and \n     viable National Guard.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         Richard C. Alexander,\n\n                                         Major General (RET), AUS,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       The Military Coalition,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, April 15, 2003.\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: The Military Coalition (TMC), a \n     consortium of nationally prominent uniformed services and \n     veterans organizations representing more than 5.5 million \n     current and former members of the seven uniformed services, \n     plus their families and survivors, would like to thank you \n     for introducing S. 852, the National Guard and Reserve \n     Comprehensive Health Benefits Act of 2003. This important \n     legislation would offer members of the Selected Reserve and \n     their families the opportunity to participate in the Tricare \n     program on a cost-share basis; provide a partial subsidy of \n     private health insurance premiums for family members of \n     Guardsmen and Reservists who wish to retain their private \n     health insurance; and improve transition coverage upon \n     demobilization. This initiative to improve healthcare \n     readiness for members of the National Guard and Reserve \n     components and their families is at the forefront of TMC's \n     priorities for that community.\n       The National Guard and Reserve components' contributions to \n     the ongoing operations in Iraq, fighting the global war on \n     terrorism, protecting the homeland, and supporting \n     contingency operations around the world are key indicators of \n     the importance of maintaining a high level of readiness. The \n     General Accounting Office recently found more than 21 percent \n     of National Guard and Reserve members do not have health \n     coverage. Forty percent of those individuals without \n     insurance are in the junior enlisted ranks.\n       Providing Tricare during all phases of service can decrease \n     an already lengthy mobilization process by ensuring medical \n     readiness is routinely sustained. Medical readiness is a \n     critical factor in mission readiness.\n       Recent National Guard and Reserve mobilizations have \n     demonstrated how quickly these forces can be ready to fulfill \n     their war-fighting mission. Some notifications for \n     mobilization have given Guardsmen and Reservists hours and \n     days, rather than weeks and months once required. This \n     reduced alert ramp also requires members of the Guard and \n     Reserve to maintain their family readiness plans in order to \n     lessen the complications and distractions during deployments. \n     Providing continuity of health coverage for family members \n     will ensure those who support our service members and make it \n     possible for them to serve, are provided for while their \n     loved ones are away.\n       The Military Coalition supports S. 852 and applauds your \n     efforts to ensure a strong and viable National Guard and \n     Reserve as an integral component of our nation's total force.\n           Sincerely,\n     The Military Coalition.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     Adjutants General Association\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC,\n     Senator Mike DeWine,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Senator Tom Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Senator Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators DeWine, Daschle, Leahy and Smith: On behalf \n     of the Adjutants General of the 54 states and territories I \n     want to thank you for your introduction and support of S. \n     852, National Guard and Reserve Comprehensive Health Benefits \n     Act of 2003. The introduction of S. 852 brings the Adjutants \n     General Association of the United States another step closer \n     to its goal of providing optional, contributory TRICARE \n     coverage to members of the Guard and Reserve and their \n     families.\n       The provision of health care to Guard and Reserve members \n     has been a priority of our Association since our Strategic \n     Planning Committee introduced the issue to the Adjutants \n     General in August 2000. Your legislation encompasses all of \n     the essential elements that our Association has sought since \n     that time.\n       All of my fellow Adjutants General have indicated their \n     support of your initiative. We pledge our support in securing \n     passage of S. 852 and we will continue to request additional \n     co-sponsorship of the bill by the senators from our \n     respective states. Please share this letter of support with \n     your Senate colleagues as you consider further action.\n       Once again, we thank you for your outstanding effort on \n     behalf of the Guard and Reserve.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John F. Kane,\n                                         Major General, President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time? The time of the sponsors has \nexpired.\n  Who yields time in opposition? The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Two and a half minutes per side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two and a half minutes in opposition.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I served as a reservist for over 10 \nyears. Some of my best friends are reservists. My Army Reserve partner \nis now my chief of staff. I have a lot of good friends in the Army \nReserve and National Guard. They have a lot of needs. There is much we \ncan do for them. I have not specifically been hearing in my State this \ninsurance question, although I can list half a dozen other items \nreservists have told me that are important to them. I do not think we \nhave had the kind of serious study about what should be our priority in \nhelping reservists be more willing to serve. They are doing a \ntremendous job at this point in time. We have had 400 special forces \nNational Guardsmen from my State in Iraq and Afghanistan; several have \nbeen wounded. They are critical to our Nation.\n\n  But we have not thought this through. We do not have the $2 billion \nto $3 billion to spend on this program at this time. I do not believe \nthe conferees can take that much out of existing active-duty accounts \nto pay for this. At this point, it is unwise. What we need to do is \ncontinue to study this matter. I chair that subcommittee, and we can \ntalk about it and come back with priorities that benefit all reservists \nin a fair and equitable way and fund those expenditures.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will use my leader time, but I thank the Senator from \nAlabama for his kindness.\n  Let me thank and congratulate all Members who have had so much to do \nwith offering this amendment--Senator Graham of South Carolina, Senator \nDeWine, Senator Leahy, and so many others who have made this effort \nover the course of the last several months.\n  The distinguished Senator from Alabama said we need to think this \nthrough. This has been the subject of a great deal of study. The GAO \nhas studied it; various economic analyses have been done on it.\n  There are three numbers I call to my colleagues' attention. The first \nis 700. There has been a 700 percent increase in the utilization of \nGuard and Reserve in active-duty and law enforcement roles since \nSeptember 11--700 percent. The dislocation caused by that new role has \nbeen remarkable in all of our States. We are asking them to be law \nenforcement officers. We are asking them to be soldiers. We are asking \nthem to fight in wars. We are asking them to play a role they did not \nplay before.\n  The second number I ask my colleagues to remember is one-tenth of 1 \npercent. That is what the cost of this amendment would be, one-tenth of \n1 percent of the Defense Department budget. We can afford one-tenth of \n1 percent to say to all of those Guard and Reserve personnel: You are \nplaying a role; you have never played a role before by seven times.\n  Now we are going to give them the chance just to purchase health \ninsurance. That is all they are going to do, purchase TRICARE \ninsurance. We are not going to give it to them, but we will let them \npurchase it.\n  The final number is this: 30; there is a 30 percent uninsured roster \nright now among the National Guardsmen who are under 30. Thirty is an \nimportant threshold. We have a vast number of people we have called \nupon to serve\n\n[[Page S6663]]\n\ntheir country in war and in peace, in roles involving National Guard, \nas well as in the military. All we are saying through this amendment \nis: You have a chance to buy health insurance, so you can do it better. \nAnd when you do it, you are going to be healthy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Ensign) \nand the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Voinovich) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the \nSenator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), and the Senator from Massachusetts \n(Mr. Kerry) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``aye''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the underlying amendment, \nas amended, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 689), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we accept the expression of the will of \nthe Senate on this matter. I had the difficult position to oppose it, \nwhich I did.\n  As we look toward the benefits for the Guard and Reserve, they are \ndeserved, richly, in most instances, but there is a balance that is \nsomewhere not clearly definable between what we do for the regulars and \nwhat we do for the Guard and Reserve. If it gets out of balance, we \ncould precipitate a bit of civil strife between these two magnificent \ncategories of men and women who proudly serve in the uniform for our \ncountry and carry out their duties side by side on the battlefield and \nhere at home. We will move on.\n  It is my intention to carefully consider this amendment, which was \nstrongly adopted by the Senate, in the context of the overall bill and \nsuch other amendments in the House and the Senate as may contribute to \nthe benefit of the men and women of the Armed Forces.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 715\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Kennedy and myself, and we are joined by Senators \nFeingold, Dayton, and Stabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself, \n     Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Dayton, and Ms. Stabenow, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 715:\n\n   (Purpose: To strike the repeal of the prohibition on research and \n               development of low-yield nuclear weapons)\n\n       Strike section 3131.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I think the Senator probably knows \nthis would strike the Spratt-Furse language.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we understood a number of Senators were \ngoing to introduce it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I was 12 years old when the Enola Gay went out of the \nPacific. I remember that big mushroom cloud on the San Francisco \nChronicle and then, for months afterward, I remember the pictures that \ncame back from Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It may well be that we are too \nfar removed from that day to really understand the repercussions of \nwhat this bill is going to begin to allow to happen in the United \nStates. What is going to be allowed to happen is a reopening of the \ndoor to nuclear development which has been closed for decades.\n  This amendment would strike section 3131, and that is the repeal of \nthe Spratt-Furse language which prohibits the development of so-called \nlow-yield nuclear weapons. This prohibition of nuclear development was \nadopted in the 1994 Defense authorization bill. It has been the law of \nthe land for the last decade.\n  The language of Spratt-Furse--I would like to read it--says that with \nrespect to U.S. policy, ``it shall be the policy of the United States \nnot to conduct research and development which could lead to the \nproduction by the United States of a new low-yield nuclear weapon, \nincluding a precision low-yield warhead. The Secretary of Energy may \nnot conduct or provide for the conduct of research and development \nwhich could lead to the production by the United States of a low-yield \nnuclear weapon which, as of the date of the enactment of this act, has \nnot entered production.''\n  And then it has a section on the effect on other research and \ndevelopment, and it says that nothing in this section shall prohibit \nthe Secretary of Energy from conducting or providing for the conduct of \nresearch and development necessary to design a testing device that has \na yield of less than 5 kilotons; secondly, to modify an existing weapon \nfor the purpose of addressing safety and reliability concerns, or, \nthree, to address proliferation concerns.\n  President Bush is right when he says the greatest threat facing the \nUnited States lies in the global proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction and terrorist access to these weapons. But by adopting a \nnew approach to national security in the wake of 9/11 that stresses \nunilateralism and preemption and increases U.S. reliance on nuclear \nweapons, I am deeply concerned that this administration may actually be \nencouraging the very proliferation we seek to prevent.\n  This bill, left intact, clearly opens the door to the development of \nnew nuclear weapons and will, if left as is, begin a new era of nuclear \nproliferation, as sure as I am standing here.\n  A couple of weeks ago, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright \ntalked with the Democratic Senate Caucus and she said something \ninteresting. She said, in all of American history, there never has been \na greater change in foreign policy and national security than between \nthis administration and the last one.\n  Indeed, I deeply believe this bill places America at a crossroad in \nthe conduct of foreign policy, and how we determine nuclear weapons \npolicy will go a long way to determining whether we control nuclear \nproliferation or expand it. This bill will expand it. Let there be no \ndoubt.\n  To my mind, even considering the use of these weapons threatens to \nundermine our efforts to stop proliferation. In fact, it actually \nencourages other nations to pursue nuclear weapons by emphasizing their \nimportance.\n  For decades the United States relied on its nuclear arsenal for \ndeterrence\n\n[[Page S6664]]\n\nonly. In the symmetric world of the Cold War, we faced the Soviet Union \nwith nuclear weapons and a conventional military that was stronger than \nours. Nuclear weapons were used to deter not only a nuclear attack on \nour homeland but also a conventional attack against our allies in \nwestern Europe and Asia.\n  Today the Soviet Union is gone, but the world is not a safer place. \nRather, we have seen new nuclear states emerge--India, Pakistan, and \nlately North Korea. As we continue to prosecute the war on terror, it \nshould be a central tenet of U.S. policy to do everything at our \ndisposal to make nuclear weapons less desirable, less available, and \nless likely to be used.\n  This bill will do exactly the opposite. Instead of ratcheting back \nour reliance on nuclear weapons, this administration is looking for new \nways to use nuclear weapons and to make them more usable. Does anyone \nin this Chamber doubt that others will follow? I do not. The \nadministration's Nuclear Posture Review, released in January of 2002, \ndid not focus solely on the role of nuclear weapons for deterrence. It \nstressed the importance of being prepared to use nuclear weapons in the \nfuture. In fact, the review noted that we must now plan to possibly use \nthem against a wider range of countries.\n  The Nuclear Posture Review said that we need to develop new types of \nnuclear weapons so we can use them in a wider variety of circumstances \nand against a wider range of targets such as hard and deeply buried \ntargets or to defeat chemical or biological agents. And indeed, a few \nmonths after issuing the Nuclear Posture Review, President Bush signed \nNational Security Presidential Directive 17, saying the United States \nmight use nuclear weapons to respond to a chemical or biological \nattack.\n\n  In the past, U.S. officials have only hinted at that possibility. But \nthis administration has made it formal policy. In doing so, it has \ntelegraphed the importance of nuclear weapons and the administration's \napparent willingness to use them.\n  In the legislation before us today, there is language requested by \nthe administration asking Congress to repeal the Spratt-Furse \nprovision--a decade old law that bans research on weapons with yields \nof 5 kilotons. Now, that is a third the size of the bomb used at \nHiroshima.\n  I believe Spratt-Furse is an important prohibition with positive \nsecurity equities for the United States. Since it has been in effect, \nno nation has developed lower yield nuclear weapons.\n  This administration wants to repeal Spratt-Furse for one reason, and \none reason only: to build new nuclear weapons, particularly for \nmissions against the hardened bunkers that rogue states may be using to \nstore chemical and biological weapons.\n  By seeking to build nuclear weapons that produce smaller explosions \nand develop weapons which dig deeper, the administration is suggesting \nwe can make nuclear weapons less deadly. It is suggesting we can make \nthem more acceptable to use. But there is no such thing as a clean \nnuclear weapon that minimizes collateral damage.\n  Consider the following facts: According to a Stanford physicist, \nSidney Drell, destroying a target buried 1,000 feet into rock would \nrequire a nuclear weapon with the yield of 100 kilotons. That is 10 \ntimes the size of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.\n  According to Dr. Drell, even the effects of a small bomb would be \ndramatic. A 1-kiloton nuclear weapon detonated 20 to 50 feet \nunderground would dig a crater the size of Ground Zero in New York and \neject 1 million cubic feet of radioactive debris into the air.\n  According to models done by the Natural Resources Defense Council, \ndetonating a similar weapon on the surface of a city would kill a \nquarter of a million people and injure hundreds of thousands more.\n  So there really is no such thing as a ``usable nuclear weapon.''\n  Moreover, nuclear weapons cannot be engineered to penetrate deeply \nenough to prevent fallout. Based on technical analysis at the Nevada \nTest Site, a weapon with a 10-kiloton yield must be buried deeper than \n850 feet to prevent spewing of radioactive debris. Yet a weapon dropped \nfrom a plane at 40,000 feet will penetrate less than 100 feet of loose \ndirt and less than 30 feet of rock.\n  Ultimately, the depth of penetration is limited by the strength of \nthe missile casing. The deepest our current earth penetrators can \nburrow is 20 feet of dry earth. Casing made of even the strongest \nmaterial cannot withstand the physical forces of burrowing through 100 \nfeet of granite, much less 850 feet.\n  In addition, the United States already has a usable nuclear bunker \nbuster, the B61-11, which has a ``dial-a-yield'' feature, allowing its \nyield to range from less than a kiloton to several hundred kilotons. \nWhen configured to have a 10-kiloton yield and detonated 4 feet \nunderground, the B61-11 can produce a shock wave sufficient to crush a \nbunker buried beneath 350 feet of layered rock. We have the weapons to \ndo the job. We don't need another.\n\n  But the U.S. military, the strongest and most capable military force \nthe world has ever seen, bar none, has plenty of effective conventional \noptions at hand designed to penetrate deeply into the earth and destroy \nunderground bunkers and storage facilities.\n  Those conventional bunker busters range in size from 500 to 5,000 \npounds, and most are equipped with either a laser or GPS guidance \nsystem. A 5,000-pound bunker buster like the Guided Bomb Unit 28/B is \ncapable of penetrating up to 20 feet of reinforced concrete or 100 feet \nof earth. It was used with much success in Operation Enduring Freedom \nin Afghanistan.\n  Other conventional bunker busters were used to take out Saddam \nHussein's underground lairs in Operation Iraqi Freedom. In fact, the \nU.S. military possesses a conventional bunker buster, the GBU-37, which \nis thought to be capable of taking out a silo-based ICBM. With this \nconventional arsenal at our disposal, there is little military utility \nthat a low-yield nuclear weapon provides to the U.S. military.\n  While I agree that nuclear weapons may have some military utility in \ncertain circumstances, the benefit of the development of new mini-nukes \nappears to me to be far outweighed by the costs. But with the sought-\nfor repeal of Spratt-Furse, the administration seems to be moving \ntoward a military posture in which nuclear weapons are considered just \nlike other weapons--in which their purpose is not simply to serve as a \ndeterrent but as a usable instrument of military power, like a tank, a \nfighter aircraft, or a cruise missile.\n  But there are several things wrong with that logic. Nuclear weapons \nare different.\n  First, using them--even small ones--would cross a line that has been \nin place for 60 years. If the Spratt-Furse prohibition is repealed, the \ndevelopment of new nuclear weapons could lead to the resumption of \nunderground nuclear testing in order to test the new weapons. This \nwould overturn the 10-year moratorium on nuclear testing and could lead \nother nuclear powers, and nuclear aspirants, to resume or start \ntesting, actions that would fundamentally alter future nonproliferation \nand counterproliferation efforts.\n  I understand Secretary of State Powell has written a letter \nsupporting this, and I must express my profound disappointment. I must \nrestate something he said last year on ``The NewsHour With Jim \nLehrer.'' I quote Secretary Powell:\n\n       I mean, the thought of nuclear conflict in 2002, with what \n     that would mean with respect to loss of life, what that would \n     mean to the condemnation--the worldwide condemnation--that \n     would come down on whatever nation chose to take that course \n     of action, would be such that I can see very little military, \n     political, or other kind of justification for the use of \n     nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons in this day and age may \n     serve some deterrent effect, and so be it; but to think of \n     using them as just another weapon in what might start out as \n     a conventional conflict in this day and age seems to me \n     something that no side should be contemplating.\n  This was 1 year ago. What has changed, Mr. President? Why would we \nopen the door to nuclear development at the very time we are trying to \nsay to North Korea this is unacceptable, at the very time we are \nworried as to whether Pakistan can securitize its nuclear weapons, and \nwhether there may be a nuclear holocaust between Pakistan and India?\n  I have never been more concerned about where this Nation is going \nthan I am today. Let me give another example. China has a no-first-use \nnuclear policy. Their warheads have been stable at between 18 and 24 \nICBMs. Yet we\n\n[[Page S6665]]\n\nhave a policy document, the Nuclear Posture Review, that says we would \ncountenance a first use of nuclear weapons against China if they were \nto use military action against Taiwan, and we said the same thing about \nNorth Korea going into South Korea. This is in writing.\n  Does no one think anybody reads these things? Does no one believe \nthat we do not set the tenor of the world with respect to weapons? We \nare the largest weapons seller on Earth, and I do not want to see us \ndevelop more nuclear weapons, nor do I believe the American people want \nto see it either. This bill allows that to happen.\n  I do not believe this side of the aisle can sit by and let it happen \nto our children and our grandchildren. Tactical nuclear weapons in the \nmost sophisticated military in the world should play no part.\n  I cannot think of a single issue that should more define the \npolitical agenda today than whether the United States should go back \ninto the nuclear business again, and repeal of Spratt-Furse is the \nfirst step in that direction.\n  In the Energy Committee, I suspected this was coming, and I asked \nSecretary Abraham: Are there any plans? He said no. Last Wednesday, in \nDefense Appropriations, I asked Secretary Rumsfeld what is going on. He \nsaid: Oh, it is just a study. Just a study, baloney. Does anyone really \nbelieve that?\n  The repeal of Spratt-Furse opens the door for America to begin to \ndevelop nuclear weapons again, and I for one do not believe we should \nsit by and see that happen.\n  We are telling others not to develop nuclear weapons. We are telling \nothers not to sell fissile materials. We are concerned when North Korea \nhas plutonium and uranium and Iran begins to start up refining uranium. \nYet it is all right for us to go out and begin to develop weapons that \nare one-third the size of the weapon that hit Hiroshima and killed \ninstantly 175,000 people? I do not think so. And I do not believe that \nis what the American people stand for either.\n  This is a big vote. This is a vote that opens the door. How we can \nrepeal language that says to all the world the United States is not in \nthe nuclear development business, I do not know, but I find it \nabsolutely chilling and even diabolical, particularly when we preach to \nother nations.\n  At a time when we brand as evil certain countries based in part on \ntheir pursuit of nuclear arms and weapons of mass destruction, we must \nbe careful how we consider our own options and our own contingencies \nregarding nuclear weapons. So I urge my colleagues to think very \ncarefully about the implications this defense bill is going to carry \nthroughout the world.\n  The 10-year old prohibition on study, on testing, and on developing \nnuclear weapons is going to be thrown out the window, and it is a major \nsignal that the United States is going to get back into the nuclear \narms business.\n  I urge this Senate to join Senator Kennedy and I in support of this \namendment. I yield time to Senator Kennedy, as much time as he \nrequires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, over the past years, we have had the opportunity to \nconsider the Defense authorization bill, and a number of extremely \nimportant weapons systems have been debated on the floor of the Senate. \nBy and large, over that period, we have seen the results in our \nmilitary.\n  All of us recognize the extraordinary performance of our military in \nthese past weeks where they performed with, first, extraordinary \ncourage; second, with extraordinary leadership; and third, with the \nlatest and the best of technology. I think all of us want to make sure \nthose are the items which are going to be there for the security of our \nmilitary. They are going to be the best trained, best led, and best \nequipped with the latest technology.\n  We ought to consider the various proposals that are before us and ask \nwhat is the military significance of any of the matters we are asked to \nconsider on the Defense authorization bill. It is against the \nbackground that the Senator from California has pointed out that we \nought to examine what is the possible need for this kind of a weapons \nsystem and another opening of the debate on the testing of nuclear \nweapons.\n  Make no mistake about it, we may hear that all we are interested in \nis the design of the nuclear weapon, but we will come back to that \nbecause it is the clear intention of the administration to move ahead \nwith not only the design but also the testing of nuclear weaponry.\n  We have to ask: How does that affect our national security? How does \nthat affect our national defense? First of all, we ought to be asking \nourselves, given the fact that our Armed Forces were in battle over the \npast weeks, resulting in an enormous success: What came out of that \nconflict that would make us take this step of lifting the ban on any \nkind of nuclear test? What happened in Iraq? What was the objective? \nWhat was the military objective in Iraq that would make us say what we \nwant to do on the Defense authorization bill is move us back from the \nsuccessful negotiations over the last 50 years of Republican and \nDemocratic Presidents in moving us away from nuclear proliferation and \nmoving us away from the possibility of nuclear confrontation? That is \nwhat the record has been over the last 50 years under Republican and \nDemocratic Presidents alike.\n  The Senator from California has reviewed that. We remember times when \nwe came dangerously close--I certainly do--in the Cuban missile crisis \nto the real possibilities of nuclear conflict and nuclear exchange \nwhich effectively would have annihilated the United States and the \nSoviet Union as we knew it. It came dangerously close, and since that \ntime Republican and Democrat leaders have said, OK, we do not want to \nsee an escalation of the nuclear arms race. We have seen step after \nstep to contain it. One of the most important ways of containing it is \nto have a moratorium on testing and also to have a battle against the \nproliferation of weapons.\n  What we have with this administration is basically an effort to lift \nwhat they call the Spratt amendment, which is a prohibition for \nresearch and development into the nuclear weapons. One can call them \nmini nukes. One can call them small nukes. Basically, I call them low-\ndeath weapons because that is what they are. We are talking about the \nkilling of thousands of individuals with these weapons systems, and the \nadministration is attempting to open this whole process again.\n  Over the period of the last 5 years we have not had any testing of \nnuclear weapons by India or by Pakistan, two nuclear powers. We have \nnot seen any testing either by the United States, Russia, or China \nprobably for the last 15 years. Progress was being made. We have seen \nfive countries that have basically gone nonnuke, basically renounced \ntheir nuclear weapons in the world. We have been making real progress.\n  What do we hear from the other side? We are living in a dangerous \nworld. Well, I hope on the other side they are going to be able to tell \nus how nuclear weapons are going to solve the problem of dealing with \nal-Qaida, how nuclear weapons would have solved our problem in dealing \nwith the threats in Morocco this week or Saudi Arabia, for example, the \nlast week.\n  What do they intend to do with these nuclear weapons? Well, we hear \nmaybe they can be used in our new, dangerous world to deal with the \nproblems of biological and chemical weapons.\n  Have my colleagues read the reports on what would happen if we have \nnuclear weapons incinerating large storage spaces of gas or chemical \nweapons, and if those were to fractionate into the air in terms of \ncritical masses, the amount of devastation and death that would mean to \nthousands or tens of thousands of troops if they were near or hundreds \nof thousands of civilians who were near?\n  What is the singular purpose? What is the military necessity? What do \nthe Joint Chiefs want to do with this weapons system?\n  We will hear the other side say, let's not get all worked up about \nthis because all we are trying to do is some research on this issue.\n  Listen to what some of the principal spokespeople for the \nadministration say about that. In February, the Pentagon's Deputy \nAssistant Secretary for Nuclear Affairs, Fred Celec, was asked: What \nwould happen if a nuclear bomb could be developed that would crash\n\n[[Page S6666]]\n\nthrough rock and concrete and still explode?\n  He said: It will ultimately get fielded.\n  And you are talking about all we are trying to do is a little \nresearch in this area? Come back to us later on; we will come back and \ntalk to you if we are really going to get into testing of nuclear \nweapons.\n\n  This is what the head of the nuclear affairs weapons system at the \nPentagon said: It will ultimately get fielded.\n  Then we go to Linton Brooks, who is the administration's nuclear \nweapons chief at the Department of Energy, who said the same thing to \nthe Armed Services Committee in April: I have a bias in favor of the \nlowest usable yield because I have a bias in favor of something that is \nthe minimum destruction. I have a bias in favor of things that might be \nusable.\n  There he is, Linton Brooks, the administration's nuclear weapons \nchief at the Department of Energy. Come on, now. You are talking about \nwe are just going to do a little research and then we will come back \nand talk to you? Do you think our friends and adversaries around the \nworld are going to believe that is what is going to happen in the \nUnited States? They will read those statements and they will start \ntheir programs of testing. That is what we are risking.\n  For what? We still have not heard from the military as to what it is \nour conventional bombs cannot do. What is it that our conventional \nartillery cannot achieve and accomplish? Where were their failings? \nWhere is the potential target out there somewhere in the world? It was \nnever told to us in the Armed Services Committee. It was never revealed \nto us in the Armed Services Committee.\n  Nonetheless, we want to find out if we want to go ahead--with all of \nthe potential dangers that we know in terms of the dangers of \nproliferation of weaponry and the dangers from testing.\n  We have the administration's own Nuclear Posture Review in January of \nlast year outlining the plans for developing new nuclear weapons, \nincluding improved weapons and warheads that reduce collateral damage. \nDo you know what that means in layman's language, reduced collateral \ndamage? That means these smaller nuclear weapons. That is what it \nmeans.\n  Now, let us look at what these low-death weapons--I call them low-\ndeath weapons--could do. We have seen the administration talk about not \nexploding them even in their testimony before the Armed Services \nCommittee. They refused to rule out the use of any nuclear weapons in \nthe battle with Iraq; although Tony Blair did, our Secretary would not.\n  Well, now we have the 5-kiloton, earth-penetrating nuclear explosion. \nThis chart depicts the average wind patterns for a winter day in the \nMiddle East. It depicts a hypothetical attack outside of Damascus, \nSyria, using the nuclear weapon with a yield of 5 kilotons. The \nthreshold of this ban exploded at a depth of 30 feet. This is the \nlevel, approximately 50 feet. This is at 30 feet.\n  This blast would cause 230,000 fatalities and another 280,000 \ncasualties from radiation exposure within 2 years of the blast.\n  This is a plume pattern developed by the Defense Threat Reduction \nAgency computer model. We are talking about tens of thousands--hundreds \nof thousands--of casualties. That is what we are talking about with \nthis weapon system.\n  What is the challenge? Are we finding that the Russians are building \nup to develop this kind of capability? No, we have not heard that. Have \nwe heard the Chinese are now trying to build up their capability \nsomehow to be a threat to us? No, we have not heard that. Have we heard \nthe Pakistanis are going to do it? No. The Indians are going to do it? \nNo, we have not heard they are going to do it. They have actually \ncomplied with the test ban treaties by not having any explosions, and \nthey have been working with us in terms of the reduction. Certainly the \nRussians have in terms of reducing the total number of nuclear weapons.\n  We stood on the floor and passed an agreement with Russia not many \nweeks ago. So what is out there? What is out there that is going to put \nus on the track toward the reassumption of nuclear testing? What is the \nthreat to us today?\n  It seems to me we do live in a dangerous world, with what is called \nal-Qaida. Everyone in the United States understands it, if they read \nthe newspapers in the last few days and they see what has happened in \nthe Middle East and what has happened in Morocco. We have to ask \nourselves: How in the world will this particular weapon system help us \ndeal with that particular threat? That reason has not been made.\n\n  The reason for this weapon system other than, well, let's take a \nchance, we can move ahead, it will be nice to add this to our \nstockpile, add one more weapon system, seems to be the argument. We \nhave the possibility of going ahead; why not go ahead and do it.\n  I don't hear the other questions being raised about the range of \nactivities that are going to take place in countries around the world. \nMake no mistake, this will release a chain of reactions across this \nworld in nuclear testing. On the one hand, the United States says, \nlook, we are trying to negotiate with the North Koreans in order to \nreduce the possibilities of nuclear exchange and miscalculation on the \nKorean peninsula. But do not pay attention to what we do. We are going \nover here to develop some new nuclear weapons. How does that work? What \nkind of message does that send in this world today? Who will buy that? \nMaybe those who support it are going to say how that kind of activity \nhas worked in the recent past, how that kind of threat has resulted in \nother countries being cowed and intimidated into laying off on that. It \nwill be the contrary.\n  Now, should these systems ever need to be developed, other colleagues \nwant to speak about what the dangers would be, as to the possibilities \nof terrorists being able to purloin, steal, a small weapon system and \nbeing able to use that more effectively. We all know it is enormously \ncomplicated and difficult for them to do it today--not an \nimpossibility--and we are realistic in terms of trying to do more to \nmake sure that is done, but there is a whole range of additional \nthreats by smaller systems that can cause devastation to hundreds of \nthousands of people.\n  Finally, we see what this administration will do; they will deploy \nthe dangerous nuclear weapons. They could be developed to penetrate, \naccording to their Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear \nAffairs. Linton Brooks: ``I have a bias in things that might be \nusable.''\n  And there is the administration's nuclear policy review that \nindicates deployed warheads reduce collateral damage. That is what we \nare talking about. This is a matter of enormous risk.\n  If this risk were balanced by the danger, sign me up. But that case \nhas not been made. This would be a remarkable step backward from the \nfirewall established going back to GEN Eisenhowser, all the way \nthrough, a firewall between conventional and nuclear.\n  This administration, this policy, will break that down. It is wrong. \nIt is not in our national security interests. That ought to be the \ntest. This fails to meet that test.\n  I hope our amendment is acceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Reed from Rhode \nIsland be added as a cosponsor, Senator Durbin of Illinois, I believe \nSenator Dayton already is, and Senator Bingaman, as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this is an issue we have considered in \nthe Armed Services Committee, of which I am a member. I note it passed \non a vote of 15 to 10 with bipartisan support.\n  I hear the opponents to this amendment using words such as ``these \nmatters should not even been contemplated.'' ``We should not even think \nabout a new type of nuclear weapon that may be less dangerous, have \nless collateral damage than the ones we already have. That is not where \nthe United States should be.''\n  I note for my colleagues, the cold war approach to life has changed. \nWe are in a new world environment. We need to be thoughtful about how \nwe go forward. We should not shut off any study, any evaluation, of \nnuclear weapons in what we might need in the future, what\n\n[[Page S6667]]\n\nwould be better, what could create peace in a more effective way than \nthe current armament system we have.\n  They say if we do anything, if we study, if we go out and do any \nresearch, if we even think about what other nations might be doing, we \ncan no longer encourage countries not to proliferate their weapons. I \ndon't think so.\n  What is happening now? They say Pakistan, they talk about India, \nKorea, Iran, and other countries that are, in fact, working on nuclear \nweapons. They are doing that now, are they not? Aren't they doing that \nright now, this very minute? The fact we have not done any research or \ndevelopment or built any weapons in over a decade, I suppose, how has \nthat had any impact on what they decide to do? These countries make \ndecisions on what they think might be in their best interest. We have \nto work with them and encourage them not to do certain things.\n\n  If a lot of countries around this world--a lot of them are our Allies \nlike Japan--if they felt we did not have an adequate military \ncapability or option or weapon system that would allow us to \neffectively defend their interests, they may decide they have to have \nnuclear weapons, too. The United States has a peacekeeping role in the \nworld. It is a high calling. It requires us to be very thoughtful. We \ncannot exercise blind fear about the world we are in and the technology \nthat is out there and what is going to happen.\n  A lot of people may not know, of all the nuclear powers in the world, \nthis country is the only one incapable at this moment of building a new \nweapon. We do not have the capability at this point to build new \nweapons. Despite that, the President has called for a reduction in our \nnuclear stockpile by one half or more. We are in an unprecedented \nreduction in the nuclear capability of this country, removing thousands \nof weapons from our inventories. However, we do not need to stick our \nhead in the sand. We do not need to assume other countries are not out \nthere studying nuclear weapons and will study nuclear weapons whether \nwe study nuclear weapons. That is silly. That has no logical basis.\n  Think about it. Whether we have a laboratory somewhere that is \nstudying nuclear weapons, this is going to determine whether Kim Jong \nIl decides to build new weapons? Whether Iran or China decides to build \nmore weapons? No sir, not at all. That makes no sense whatever.\n  We have had smaller weapons in the past. They have been removed from \nstockpiles. I don't think that destabilized the world during that \nperiod.\n  They say, well, even though we are reducing our stocks by half, even \nthough we have no weapons program, even though we are not doing nuclear \ntesting, it is our fault. We are somehow destabilizing the world. We \nare causing Kim Jong Il to create weapons. I don't think it is our \nfault. I am not part of the ``blame America first'' crowd. Anyone wants \nto go to the DMZ up there and look into that depraved country of North \nKorea, stand in that wonderful, free, progressive country of South \nKorea, and see what he has done to the people of North Korea and has no \nmoral rejection of him and his would-be empire, his regime, and has no \nsense of compassion for the people he oppresses, and now we are going \nto blame ourselves for his misbehavior? And we are sending him food to \nfeed his own people because he cannot raise the food to do so? I don't \nthink so.\n  I believe this country has a moral responsibility to lead in this \nworld and we will not be an effective leader if we don't maintain \nleadership in all forms of weaponry--yes, including nuclear weaponry. \nIt is just that simple.\n  I hope we do not have to develop any new systems, but I don't see \nanything wrong with doing some research. We might learn what others are \ndoing out there, too, and that might be important to our national \ndefense.\n  We are the premier nuclear power in the world--premier power in \ngeneral and the premier nuclear power in the world. If we ever got to \nthe point where we had some smaller weapons, why would that make the \nworld more dangerous than the big ones we have, let me ask you? I think \nthat is not where we need to be heading. We need to be rational about \nwhere we are. Nuclear power remains a part of our arsenal. A growing \nnumber of nations around the world, as they have been from time to time \nsince nuclear power became available, are studying ways to develop \ntheir own nuclear power.\n  They say we can't use it against al-Qaida. Maybe we can, maybe we \ncan't. Probably we would not use a nuclear weapon against a group like \nal-Qaida. But who would have thought we would have been at this level \nof conflict in Afghanistan or Kosovo or Bosnia 15 years ago? Who knows \nwhat the future may bring? A great nation, a great Congress, who has a \nresponsibility to protect and defend this Constitution and this Nation, \nshould be thinking ahead to make sure we have the capability, as time \ngoes by, to deal with any threat that faces us. To do otherwise would \nbe irresponsible.\n  Let's be clear about this. This amendment we passed 15 to 10 in \ncommittee does not authorize building small weapons. It does not \nauthorize testing weapons. It talks about study and research. If any \nstep further than that has to be taken, this Congress would explicitly \nhave to approve it. Then we can hear these debates about whether or not \nwe want to go forward, depending on what the state of the world is at \nthat time.\n  I used to be a Federal prosecutor. As I understand the law, it would \nbe a crime to utilize the language in this bill to build one of these \nweapons or to test one of these weapons because it would not be \nauthorized in law. You cannot use money appropriated by Congress for \nthings not authorized. This language does not authorize testing. It \ndoes not authorize building of a nuclear weapon.\n  We have also to be concerned in this age of increasing knowledge \nabout nuclear power, with the increasing ability through technology and \nother capabilities to transmit that knowledge around the world. We \nought to be aware that others could step forward and make breakthroughs \nin nuclear power that could in many ways undermine the leadership we \nhave in the world today. We do not need to have other nations studying \nnuclear power, nuclear weaponry, and us not.\n  Think about this. We have cut our power down substantially. We are \ncutting down the number of our weapons very substantially--half or more \nthan half. We absolutely cannot make a commitment that we will never do \nanything else in the future. That would simply set out a marker that \nwould be the goal any nation could seek to attain and then they would \nbe on equal power with the United States of America militarily, in \nterms of nuclear weapons. We should not do that.\n  We need to make it clear to the entire world we care about peace, we \ncare about world harmony, but we will not allow our Nation to be \nvulnerable to attack because our Nation--I can say it with confidence--\nour Nation stands for peace, prosperity, trade, and freedom in this \nworld. That is what we stand for. A lot of nations don't. If somebody \nin this body is not capable of making that value judgment, then I think \nthey need to go back and study their history a little bit. So we can \nstand for right in this dangerous world; we simply have to be \nmilitarily strong.\n\n  Americans expect us to be thinking about it and going forward. \nPresident Bush supports this amendment that passed with bipartisan \nsupport in the committee. Secretary of State Powell supports this \namendment, as do Admiral Ellis and General Jumper, two of our key \nmilitary people who deal with these issues.\n  I simply think it would be irrational to prohibit research that could \ninform future decisions as to whether such weapons would enhance the \nnational security of our country. It would not prejudice our Congress \nto decide these questions in the future. Let us not fear greater \nknowledge that would inform our future decisions. Let's make sure this \nNation does not have its head in the sand. Let's make sure our Nation \nis alert to what our capabilities are, what our enemies' capabilities \nare, and to the need for change if that need arises. I think that is \nthe right approach. I think that is why the Armed Services Committee \nsent this amendment to the floor as part of this bill.\n  I thank Senator Warner for his leadership. He has led us in this way, \nin a careful way. There is nothing extreme about this amendment. It is \nthe right step at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n[[Page S6668]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senate considers a myriad of topics. \nEvery week those who follow our debates will hear us discuss far-\nreaching topics from the farm bill to a transportation bill to a tax \nbill, how to move the economy, how to deal with health care and \neducation. All of those are critically important issues. But I cannot \nbelieve I have witnessed in my time on Capitol Hill a more historic \ndebate than what we are undertaking at this moment.\n  We are literally talking about whether the United States will \ninitiate a nuclear arms race again. Nothing I can think of meets this, \nin terms of gravity and its impact on the future of the world.\n  If I might, I would like to ask the ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee, my colleague from the State of Michigan, if he \nwould be kind enough, before I say a few words here, since he was in on \nthe committee debate on this bill and understands what is included in \nit, if he would answer a couple of questions relative to this issue of \nnuclear weapons so we can put this debate in context.\n  Is it a fact, I ask the Senator from Michigan, without yielding the \nfloor--is it a fact we are embarking on at least two dramatic changes \nin the policy of the United States of America toward research and \nbuilding of nuclear weapons in this legislation?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct. There are at least two provisions \nhere.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator be kind enough to tell me, when we use \nthe term low-yield nuclear weapons, is it not true these are weapons \nwhich have about one-third of the killing power of the nuclear weapon \nused, the atomic bomb used in Hiroshima which killed, in a matter of \nseconds, 140,000 people? Is that true?\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct. The so-called low-yield weapons \nindeed are about one-third the power of the weapon that was used at \nHiroshima.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Could the Senator from Michigan tell us how we are \nchanging our policy in relation to the building or research on these \ntypes of low-yield nuclear weapons?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Under the law that exists today, the so-called Spratt-\nFurse language which exists in law today, there is a prohibition on \nresearch and development which could lead to the production of a so-\ncalled low-yield weapon. Under the bill, that language would be \nstricken from the law and there would be no such prohibition.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Could the Senator also tell me in relation to even more \npowerful nuclear weapons, the so-called bunker busters--which name, I \nthink, does not do justice to the gravity of the weapon, the severity \nof the weapon we are considering--I am told by some these weapons have \ndetonation power up to 70 times the power of the bomb we dropped on \nHiroshima. Could the Senator from Michigan tell me, in terms of \ndeveloping and building these new doomsday weapons, 70 times more \npowerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, what does this bill do?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The so-called bunker busters, which is a total misnomer in \nmy book because these are city busters--they may indeed be nation \nbusters or world busters, but nevertheless the so-called bunker busters \nare two weapons. There is a so-called B-61 weapon, which is about the \npower of 28 Hiroshimas, and the other one is the B-83, which is up to \n71 Hiroshima weapons, in terms of power.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I could put that in context, if the bomb in Hiroshima \nkilled 140,000 people instantly, can the Senator even calculate how \nmany people may be casualties from the largest nuclear weapon which is \nenvisioned by this new piece of legislation?\n  My calculations are that up to 9 or 10 million people could be killed \nwith that type bomb.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I don't have a calculator. Whatever 140 times 70 would \namount to would be that number, assuming the same approximate density \nin Hiroshima.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Michigan for his diligent work \non this committee.\n  Consider the gravity of this debate. Consider for a moment what we \nare embarking on if we accept President Bush's vision and the \nadministration's vision of the future of America and the world. We have \njust come off a war in Iraq--a war which once again proved decisively \nthe strength of the American military. We have a military operation \nwithout peer in the world, the very best in skill when it comes to men \nand women in uniform, and the best technology on Earth. We spend \nupwards of $400 billion a year and more to develop this weaponry and \nthis national defense. When called upon as in Iraq, as in the Persian \nGulf, and so many other times, they have shown they are decisive in \ntheir goals. Frankly, there is nothing on Earth to match it. I don't \nthink there was a moment in the invasion of Iraq when people said, If \nwe just had another weapon, perhaps this would go more smoothly. Within \n3 weeks, we conquered that nation. We brought to bear a dictator and \nhis army. No one ever questioned that we have the most powerful \nmilitary in the world prepared to do that.\n  What the Bush administration tells us is it is not enough. Whatever \nconventional weaponry we own, it is not enough when we consider the \nfuture of the world; and we, as the United States, need to move \nforward, as the Senator from Michigan has told us, to develop so-called \n``low-yield nuclear weapons''--these compact nuclear weapons and these \nbunker buster nuclear weapons some 70 times the power of what was \ndetonated in Hiroshima. I think this is a dramatic departure in \nAmerican foreign policy.\n  I agree with the Senator from California and thank her for her \nleadership in offering this amendment, which I cosponsored with the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  I hope my colleagues, despite their warm and strong feelings for the \nPresident and his administration, will pause for a moment and think \nabout what we are doing today and the road and the course we are about \nto follow.\n  This bill is a declaration that the United States is prepared to \nlaunch a nuclear arms race in the world again--a nuclear arms race \nwhich is no longer the province of a handful of nations.\n  There was a time when ownership of a nuclear weapon reflected a \nprosperous country with great military capability. Look at North Korea \ntoday, as poor as they come, suffering from famine. This country is in \nthe process of developing a new nuclear weapon every single month. To \nthink that the United States could initiate a new nuclear arms race \nwith our research and development and not see this replicated around \nthe world in other countries is naive and wrong and dangerous. That is \nwhat is wrong with this proposal of the Bush administration.\n  I also ask my colleagues to put in context the Bush administration's \noverall view of foreign policy, which is a departure from 200 years of \nthinking in America. President Bush came to this office and said we \nwill no longer wait for nations that are an imminent threat to the \nUnited States. Since 9/11, we need to change the strategy, and change \nthe rules. We will now be engaged in preemption. That is, we will \nattack those countries which we think could be a threat to the United \nStates. That is dramatic change. With that dramatic change, coupled \nwith this change in policy, think about what we are saying to the rest \nof the world. Whether you are a threat to the United States, if we \nperceive you to be a threat to the United States, we can attack you. \nWhether you are a threat to the United States, if we perceive you to be \na threat, we can use nuclear weapons in attacking you. And we are about \nto develop several new generations of nuclear weapons to do it.\n\n  Step back for a second, as any rational person would do, and ask, \nWhat does some other country in the world do in response to that? I \nknow I am about to be attacked. Whether I threaten the United States, I \nhave to be on guard. If I know they will use nuclear weapons, even if I \ndon't, then what are you going to do? You are going to arm yourself to \nthe teeth, as the North Koreans have done. Develop as many weapons as \nquickly as you can to let the United States know that if they use \npreemptive foreign policy and nuclear weapons in that preemption, there \nwill be an answer coming back from that country. That is a recipe for a \nglobal arms race. There is no end in sight, if we allow that to occur. \nIt is exactly what is being suggested by this policy.\n  The Senator from Alabama came to the floor and said we should be \nthinking ahead. That is why he supports this. I would say to the \nSenator I agree with him completely. We should be thinking ahead, and \nthat is why we\n\n[[Page S6669]]\n\nshould oppose this. The United States ought to make it clear we are not \ngoing to initiate any nuclear testing to develop new weapons, that we \nare not looking for a new generation of nuclear weapons, and that we, \nfrankly, don't believe it makes for a stable and a peaceful world for \nother countries to develop these nuclear weapons either.\n  If we set an example with this new generation of nuclear weapons \ncalled for by this bill, how do we then turn to the rest of the world, \nand say, Stand in place, don't change, let the United States develop \nnew nuclear, but you don't do the same? That isn't going to work. It is \nnot rational. It doesn't show the kind of direct thinking I think we \nshould ask from this administration and every other administration.\n  I support the amendment offered by my colleagues to strike the \nsection of the bill that repeals the prohibition on R of low-yield \nnuclear weapons. This is calling for a study for the development of \nnuclear weapons.\n  Sadly, we know the spokesmen for the administration have made it \nclear that after one study they will be developed, in no uncertain \nterms. That, of course, is an invitation for a global arms race.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter of May \n19 of this year from several prominent scientists across the United \nStates in support of this amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                     May 19, 2003.\n       Dear Senator, As scientists and engineers with long \n     experience on nuclear weapons and defense issues, we are \n     writing to urge you to retain the Spratt-Furse law banning \n     development leading to the production of nuclear weapons with \n     yields of less than five kilotons.\n       There is no need for the United States to develop new low-\n     yield nuclear weapons beyond those it has already developed \n     and tested. Opponents of the law argue that the ban impedes \n     exploration of nuclear weapons concepts for attacking deep \n     underground targets and destroying chemical and biological \n     agents. However, technical analysis shows that low-yield \n     weapons would not be effective for these tasks. Low-yield \n     earth penetrating weapons cannot burrow deep enough and do \n     not have a large enough yield to destroy deep underground \n     targets; moreover, the explosion would not be contained for \n     even low-yield earth-penetrating weapons, and would \n     necessarily result in large amounts of radioactive fallout. \n     If a nuclear weapon was used to attack chemical or biological \n     agents, it is far more likely that this would result in the \n     dissemination of these agents rather than their destruction.\n       Moreover, the law does not restrict research and early \n     development of low-yield weapons, and places no restriction \n     at all on work on higher yield weapons. The law only \n     prohibits later stages of development and engineering that \n     are geared toward production of a low-yield weapon.\n       Some opponents of the law argue that maintaining expertise \n     at the U.S. weapons labs requires weapons scientists to \n     explore and develop new weapons concepts, and that \n     ambiguities in Spratt-Furse law have had a ``chilling \n     effect'' on such efforts. However, last week the House Armed \n     Services Committee adopted an amendment that clarifies the \n     wording of the law. We urge you and your colleagues to \n     support such a clarification in the Senate to make clear that \n     the ban permits research and early stages of development, \n     while prohibiting the engineering and development of new low-\n     yield nuclear weapons for deployment.\n       Arguments that low-yield weapons serve U.S. interests \n     because they produce less collateral damage and are therefore \n     more usable than high-yield weapons are shortsighted. Any use \n     of nuclear weapons would demolish a firebrake that has held \n     for nearly 60 years and would be a disaster for the world. \n     The United States should be seeking to increase the barriers \n     to using nuclear weapons, not decreasing them.\n       Moreover, it is counter to U.S. interests for the United \n     States to pursue new nuclear weapons at a time when the \n     highest U.S. priority is preventing other countries or groups \n     from obtaining them. The perception that the United States is \n     pursuing these weapons and considering their use would give \n     legitimacy to the development of similar weapons by other \n     countries, and would be an incentive to countries that are \n     concerned they may be a target of such weapons to develop \n     their own nuclear weapons as a deterrent.\n       The act of repealing this 10-year-old law would send a \n     strong, negative message to the rest of the world about U.S. \n     intentions with respect to maintaining the existing \n     international moratorium on nuclear testing. If the pursuit \n     of new low-yield weapons leads to the resumption of U.S. \n     nuclear testing, this would inevitably lead to testing by \n     other countries--thereby reducing U.S. security and \n     undermining U.S. efforts to stop the spread of nuclear \n     weapons.\n       Given the technical realities and limitations of low-yield \n     nuclear weapons, as well as the likely security costs of \n     developing new low-yield nuclear weapons, we urge you to \n     retain the Spratt-Furse law.\n           Sincerely,\n     Hans Bethe,\n                           Professor Emeritus, Cornell University.\n     Sidney D. Drell,\n          Professor Emeritus, Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, \n                                              Stanford University.\n     Richard L. Garwin,\n           Philip D. Reed Senior Fellow and Director, Science and \n         Technology Studies Program, Council on Foreign Relations.\n     Marvin Goldberger,\n           President Emeritus, California Institute of Technology.\n     John P. Holdren,\n      Professor and Director, Program on Science, Technology, and \n             Public Policy, Kennedy School of Government, Harvard \n                                                       University.\n     Albert Narath,\n         Former Laboratory Director, Sandia National Laboratories.\n     Wolfgang K.H. Panofsky,\n        Professor Emeritus and Director Emeritus, Stanford Linear \n                          Accelerator Center, Stanford University.\n     Bob Peurifoy,\n              Former Vice-President, Sandia National Laboratories.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me also say the policy implications of \ncrossing the line toward the use of nuclear weapons and actually making \nthem useful weapons argues most forcefully against developing such \nweapons.\n  I am particularly concerned that this administration's policy of \npreemption, combined with the policy of first use of nuclear weapons, \nis an incentive to proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \nespecially nuclear weapons.\n  Let me go back to the point made by the Senator from Massachusetts. \nThe threat we face today is not a threat of nuclear power against the \nUnited States. It is a threat of terrorism. No one has rationally \nsuggested that the development of these nuclear weapons can be used as \na deterrent against al-Qaida and terrorism. How could our possession of \neven a low-yield nuclear weapon have stopped September 11? It could not \nhave. We are dealing with asymmetrical power, to use a cliche which you \nfind on Capitol Hill in most committee hearings involving the military. \nIt just says you don't have to match the United States strength. You \ncan find a vulnerability where you have the strength to inflict \ncasualties and damage. That is what happened on September 11.\n  Otto Bismarck once said, ``Preventive war is like committing suicide \nout of fear of death.'' I believe we should remember those words of \nwisdom.\n  Let me elaborate on a few points.\n  The September 17, 2002 National Security Strategy of the United \nStates stated as a matter of self-defense that America will act against \nsuch emerging threats before they are fully formed to forestall or \nprevent such hostile acts by our adversaries. The United States will, \nif necessary, act preemptively.\n  When you put together a policy of preemption, a policy of first use \nof nuclear weapons, and a new generation of nuclear weapons, which this \nbill calls for, it does not make for a safer world. It is an invitation \nfor a world of uncertainty and a world of danger we will be leaving our \nchildren.\n  I have watched this administration come forward with many proposals I \ndisagree with. I cannot think of any proposal they have suggested which \nis more dangerous than what we are considering today.\n  For those who are following this debate, this is not another routine \nbill. This bill is about to discard 50 years of American foreign policy \nand 50 years of American nuclear policy. It is going into uncharted \nterritory with a new approach which invites danger, retaliation, and \nproliferation. It will, in my mind, increase the likelihood of nuclear \nconfrontation in the future.\n  I hope on a bipartisan basis the Senate will adopt the amendment \noffered by the Senators from California and Massachusetts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I wanted to say to the distinguished \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, who suggested earlier that we \nalternate back and forth, even though there is no agreement, I would be \nmore than happy to defer to someone on his side.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our colleague. I am perfectly \ncontented and listening carefully to the debate. At the appropriate \ntime I will make my remarks and then move to table. I\n\n[[Page S6670]]\n\nwant to in no way inhibit the debate on this important subject. I feel \nvery strongly a contrary form of view, as do a majority of the \ncolleagues I know. We certainly witnessed in the Armed Services \nCommittee a strong vote in favor of going ahead with this provision in \nour bill. I am respectful of the views of others, but I am mindful of \nwhat we did on the Committee on Armed Services in our vote on this \nissue.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, if the chairman wants to wait, I will look \nforward to hearing his remarks. I have the greatest respect for him, \nand also many of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle who \nwill offer their comments at a later time.\n  At the request of Senator Feinstein, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Jeffords be added as an original cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I am proud to rise with my very distinguished colleagues \nwho have introduced this measure, Senator Feinstein and Senator \nKennedy; they who have eloquently stated, along with the Senator from \nIllinois, the reasons why this drastic change in American policy is so \nill-advised--to resume the testing, development, and deployment of \nnuclear bombs. That would put the United States back into the front of \nthe world pack of nations now proceeding with nuclear weapons \ndevelopment. We should be leading the world in the opposite direction, \nto stop the future proliferation of nuclear bombs. We can't do both.\n  We can't tell other nations around the world not to build even a \nsingle nuclear weapon and then do it ourselves. We already have \nthousands of nuclear bombs. Yet we are going to tell other governments: \nYou can't have even one.\n  We should be negotiating those agreements. We should prevent other \nnations that do not presently have nuclear weapons from developing \nthem. We should negotiate agreements with North Korea, Iran, whereby \nthey would stop and dismantle their nuclear weapons production in \nreturn for economic assistance, food, technological development, \nwhatever it is we can do to improve their peaceful standard of living \nand help bring them back into the civilized world.\n  We should proceed to carry out the agreement which President Bush and \nPresident Putin reached over a year ago to consolidate and reduce the \nnuclear weapons which our two countries have. We should discuss with \nthe new Chinese leadership their doing the same. We should redouble our \nefforts to track down and purchase and to lock up the nuclear weapons \nand materials that are loose from the old Soviet Union or from any \nother source, before they fall into the very dangerous hands of \nterrorist organizations which, if they get nuclear weapons, will use \nthem against us. How can we do all that if we ourselves are developing \nour own next generation of nuclear bombs? It is crazy. It is crazy to \ndo it. And it is crazy to think that the rest of the world would stand \nidly by while we proceed to do so.\n\n  Why do we need to do this? We have the most overwhelming military \nforce in the world, as we just demonstrated in Iraq. We have the \ngreatest, most overwhelming military dominance of any nation in the \nhistory of the world over every other nation. We must maintain that \noverwhelming military superiority, and we will. President Bush has \nproposed increasing our military spending every year that he has been \nin office, and this Congress has provided him with every dollar he \nrequested. I voted for every one of them myself.\n  We are now spending this year more money on our military strength \nthan the next nine nations of the world combined. I agree with my \ncolleague from Alabama who is properly vigilant about what other \nnations are doing. We do need to look ahead and make sure that we \nmaintain the kind of superiority and dominance which we can then use to \nprevent nuclear wars or any kind of wars around the world. But we don't \nneed those devices today, and we don't see anybody else in the world \ndeveloping them. So we should be trying to stop it, not move it \nforward.\n  We don't need the so-called low-yield nuclear devices to win a war, \nnot any war anywhere in the world and not for any time in the \nforeseeable future. Parenthetically, there is no such thing as a low-\nyield nuclear device. It is an oxymoron, low-yield nuclear device. \nThere is only one description of these devices: They are nuclear bombs. \nThey are nuclear bombs more powerful than the ones used in Hiroshima \nand Nagasaki 58 years ago. My understanding is that in terms of yield, \nin terms of radioactive fallout they may be more constrained, but in \nterms of the explosive power of these advanced weapons, they go beyond \nanything that was used in World War II, which is, as we recall, the \nonly time in the history of the planet that nuclear bombs have ever \nbeen unleashed by one nation against another.\n  It is our responsibility as the leader of the world to assure that \nthey are never used again. Nothing is more dangerous to our national \nsecurity than the continued development and production and ultimately \nproliferation of more nuclear weapons anywhere in the world. The \nreality is we can't prevent their use once they are produced. We can \ntry, and we have. And we will continue to do so. With treaties, through \nnegotiation, we can build a national missile defense system as the \nPresident has proposed, as Congress has appropriated initial funding. \nBut even if it could be made to work perfectly, a terrorist group could \nput a nuclear weapon in a briefcase or in a car's glove compartment and \nannihilate New York City or San Francisco or Mobile, AL, or \nMinneapolis, MN.\n  We can't prevent the use of one of these nuclear weapons once it has \nbeen produced, which is why we can and must stop their production \nbefore. We still have a chance to do that. We still have that \nopportunity, and that is what this administration's priority should be, \nto put an end to the nuclear arms race and those who want to enter it \nand to negotiate these agreements. But to do that, we have to set the \nexample. We have to lead the world in the direction we want it to go.\n  We can't say, we are the exception; everybody else follow this set of \nrules, but we are different. We know that our intentions are honorable. \nWe know that we would not use them inappropriately. But we are not \nviewed that way by anyone else, as we would not view anyone else that \nway. We have to lead by our actions as well as by our words.\n  As others have pointed out, if we were to do this now as we try to \nput the lid on other nations' development of their nuclear industry \nweapons industry, it would be catastrophic. In the eyes of the world we \nwould look as though we don't really understand how we are viewed by \nthem.\n  This is an historic opportunity. It is so critical that this \nadministration, which has proven that it knows how to win wars with \nmilitary might--that we have established--which they inherited from \nPresident Clinton's administration, shows that we know how to win the \npeace.\n  We know how to win the peace in Afghanistan, where our efforts to \nrebuild the country have been minimal, tragically, in the last year and \na half compared to the scope of the need and the opportunity to \nshowcase the American economic social system, our way of life, so that \nthe people of that country can benefit, and people especially in the \nArab nations can see the benefits and advantages of our system. We need \nto do the same in Iraq--seize control and security there and bring in \nthe U.N. and other nations in efforts to bring that country over to a \ndemocracy and a stable government, encourage and assist their economic \nrecovery, and negotiate with others.\n  That is the direction in which we need to go, but it is not the \ndirection this administration is going, or cares to go, or knows how to \ngo. It is the wrong signal to send to the rest of the world that we \nintend to proceed further down the path of our domination militarily \nand our use of weapons of any level of destruction in order to achieve \nfuture goals; and if we proceed in that direction, we must expect that \nthe rest of the world will follow. That would be more dangerously \ndestabilizing to this Nation and to the planet than anything I can \nimagine.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from South Carolina \nis recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have a number of speakers who wish to \nspeak on this legislation. I wonder if it would\n\n[[Page S6671]]\n\nbe more orderly if we tried to arrange the time so that people----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognized the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I am glad to yield to the Senator for a \nmoment.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry, I didn't know. We might be better off--we have \na number of Senators waiting, so that there will be some order--I \nwonder how long the Senator from South Carolina is going to speak \napproximately.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. About 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I am wondering if it would be appropriate, I say to my \nfriend from Michigan, if we had one on our side, Senator Bingaman, for \n20 minutes, and Senator Feingold wishes 20 minutes, and Senator Dorgan \nwants 5 minutes. I am wondering--if there is someone from the \nRepublican side who wishes to speak interspersed with ours, they would \nbe allowed to speak.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the statement of the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, Senator Bingaman be recognized for 20 minutes, and \nfollowing him, the Senator from Wisconsin for 5 minutes, and then the \nSenator from North Dakota for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I just \nsuggest two things: One, the interspersed order include Republican \nspeakers, should they desire----\n  Mr. REID. That was part of the request.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Secondly, there will be additional speakers beyond that. I \nwould not want to suggest that the debate would end then because we \nhave additional speakers.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Feinstein is here. She wishes to speak for a \nconsiderable period of time. We need to confer with the Senator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Prior to that, Senator Byrd wanted to speak. I wanted to \nspeak for 10 minutes, and Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Senator \nAkaka want to speak as well.\n  Mr. REID. Why don't we lock these in?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I wish the opportunity to speak at the end for 1 \nhour.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, a number of other people wish to speak.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. At the end. If it is a unanimous consent agreement, I \ndon't want to be cut off.\n  Mr. REID. You will not be cut off. This is just to line speakers up \nfor an hour or so. There is plenty of time for debate after that.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Reserving the right to object, what was \nthe last thing the Senator said?\n  Mr. REID. Senator Feinstein wanted to be protected for future time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to \nthe amendment. As quickly as I can--a lot of people want to speak--I \nwill frame the debate for those who are listening.\n  The Armed Services Committee was asked by the Pentagon to give some \nrelief on a 10-year prohibition on research and development of low-\nyield nuclear weapons for a specific military purpose. The Pentagon and \nothers tell us that the warfare of the future is going to have a \ncomponent to it about which we need to be thinking.\n  As we have seen in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other places, the enemies \nof tomorrow and today have gone underground in a deep fashion--\nunderground not only to hide their forces, but to hide weaponry and to \npotentially build chemical or biological weapons facilities, \nunderground to develop hydrogen nuclear weapons, underground to protect \ntheir troops from the awesome power that we have today.\n  The committee, after listening to the Pentagon's request, in the bill \nwe have before us, lifted the ban on research and development to allow \nthe Pentagon to do research and development in this area as they could \non any other weapons system.\n  The question becomes for the Senate, after having received input from \nour Department of Defense and those experts who are paid to follow such \nmatters, whether saying no to their request to do research and \ndevelopment only is a wise decision.\n  My colleague who previously spoke mentioned the word ``crazy.'' I \nthink it would be incumbent upon us to listen, as the committee has \ndone. And the committee, in a bipartisan fashion, after listening, \nvoted to lift the ban on research and development, to go forward and \nlook at the ability to combat the threats of the future by having a \nlow-yield nuclear weapon that could go to the underground chemical or \nbiological weapons factory that may exist in the future--to go to the \nunderground nuclear weapons facility that may exist in the future.\n\n  As we have seen from Afghanistan and Iraq, the enemy has dug deep \ninto the earth. From the last gulf war to Operation Iraqi Freedom, we \nhave seen how the military has modernized and transformed itself. In \nthe first gulf war--Desert Shield and Desert Storm--only about 10 \npercent of the weapons used were precision-guided munitions. That \nchanged to the point where 90 percent of the weapons used in Operation \nIraqi Freedom were precision guided. I argue that that modernization \neffort, keeping that technological edge, saved a lot of American and \nIraqi lives.\n  I suggest to my colleagues that this is a dramatic moment in our \nNation's history. We have just upgraded the threat level to orange. We \nhave seen last week what is going on in the world--al-Qaida is still \nalive. They are on the run, but they have the ability to hurt people. \nThey desire nuclear weapons. There are a lot of rogue states that are \ngoing to try to pursue a nuclear weapon, or fissile materials, and they \nwill most likely be successful. People are going to enhance their \nbiological and nuclear weapons ability.\n  I argue that to stop research and development on a potential weapon \nthat could destroy a terrorist group or prevent a rogue nation from \ncreating a chemical or biological capacity that is deep underground is \nillogical--just to take it off the table in a blind fashion, trying to \nsay we are doing something that is going to spread nuclear weapons. I \ndon't believe we are.\n  Secretary Powell has written a letter on this matter, on May 5, in \nwhich he says:\n\n       I do not believe that repealing the ban on low-yield \n     nuclear weapons research will complicate our ongoing efforts \n     with North Korea.\n\n  It is a reality that the enemies of today and tomorrow will go \nunderground. They will go deep into the earth, and they will have \nlaboratories and research facilities available to them to develop \nweapons of mass destruction. I hope the Senate will listen to the \nPentagon and develop a weapon that counteracts that threat. Whether or \nnot we deploy that weapon we will decide later. But to take the \nresearch component off the table and not even plan for that possibility \nis very irresponsible. We will take up as a body whether or not to \nauthorize this development, as we should.\n\n  I implore my colleagues, please do not ignore the threats that exist \ntoday, an enemy going deep into the Earth where conventional weapons \nmay not be able to destroy that chemical or biological factory or that \nnuclear weapons program. Let's at least look at the possibility of \nhaving a weapons mix in the future that protects us from the evil that \nexists today.\n  I think what the committee has done is very responsible. I \ncongratulate the chairman and all those involved in lifting this ban at \nthe Pentagon's request. History will judge us poorly--who knows what is \ngoing to happen down the road--if we as a political body do not listen \nto what I believe to be a real threat and try to at least talk about \nand develop a counteraction to that threat for the future. That is what \nthis debate is about.\n  If this amendment is adopted, it would tie the hands of the American \nmilitary in looking at weapons systems to combat a real threat at a \ntime when the threats we face are growing, not lessening. I think that \nwould be a very bad move on the Senate's part. It would tie the hands \nof the Department of Defense unnecessarily.\n  We are not talking about deploying a weapon. We are talking about \nresearching and developing a weapon that may save lives in the future, \nand I hope the Senate as a whole will follow the lead of the committee \nand vote this amendment down. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nMexico is recognized.\n\n[[Page S6672]]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I start by saying I have always been a strong \nsupporter of maintaining our nuclear arsenal. I do believe that nuclear \nweapons have a significant role in our defense strategy, but their use \nfor us in that defense strategy is to deter others from using nuclear \nweapons. That has been the essential role they played.\n  It has been a very important role. It was an important role in \nwinning the cold war, and it remains an important role for our \nmilitary. But the amendment that has been put forward by Senator \nFeinstein and Senator Kennedy is not dealing with nuclear weapons as a \ndeterrent. What it is trying to get at is the change in philosophy that \nseems to have taken place among some in the administration that nuclear \nweapons are not just to be used as a deterrent; they are also to be \nused as a weapon. They are to be used in warfighting. They are to be \nused to counter preemptive threats that may present themselves to us, \nand that is a substantial change from what we have done with nuclear \nweapons in the past. I strongly believe it is important to maintain in \nlaw the ban that was put in law sometime ago.\n  This Spratt language, named for Congressman Spratt, whom we all know \nand respect, was developed in 1994, and it was developed as a follow-on \nto an action by George H. W. Bush, Sr., our current President's father, \nwhen he was in the White House. He made the decision on September 27, \n1991, to take out of our inventory nuclear artillery shells, tactical \nbombs, landmines--the various tactical low-yield nuclear weapons we had \nfielded at that time, primarily in Europe.\n  That decision was made as a follow-on to the end of the cold war. It \nwas a decision which was intended to reduce the risk of some kind of \nnuclear misstep by a field commander or by accident. It was a step \nintended to reduce the risk of a nuclear weapon being detonated when, \nin fact, it was not desired.\n  There is a lot of history behind this issue. Some might think, if \nthey just tune in and watch this debate, this is a new idea this \nadministration has come up with: Let's develop new low-yield nuclear \nweapons; let's do the research and gear up for development.\n  The truth is, we have had many so-called low-yield nuclear weapons in \nour stockpile in the past. Let me review a little bit of that history.\n  This first paragraph I have reproduced for folks to look at is the \nDavy Crockett MK-54 warhead which was a nuclear warhead that was \ncapable of producing the same damage as up to 1,000 tons of TNT. When \nthey talk about low-yield nuclear weapons, they are talking about up to \n5,000 tons of TNT. So this is substantially less powerful than that. \nThis was developed back in the fifties. It is technology about which \neveryone knows. It was launched from a recoilless rifle. This was a \nweapon capable of being launched that way. One could send it off \nanywhere. The range was 1.2 to 2.5 miles. As I say, it had a yield of \nup to 1,000 tons of TNT. This, to me, is an example of some of the \nhistory we know about on low-yield nuclear weapons.\n  Let me also point to a second example. This is the so-called MADM, \nthe Medium Atomic Demolition Munition. Looking at the photograph, you \nmight say I am talking about the one in the center. I am not. I am \ntalking about the much smaller warhead that is over on the left in this \nphotograph. This could go up to as high as 15,000 tons of TNT. It was \nin our arsenal until 1986. It was intended for use in destroying dams \nor bridges, and it was entirely portable. As one can see from the size \nof this warhead, this would be easily carried by a single person.\n  The third example, and the last example I want to show, is this W-79. \nThis is one of the weapons that was in our arsenal and was taken out of \nour arsenal. This is the so-called neutron bomb. We have heard of the \nneutron bomb. There was a lot of discussion about the neutron bomb a \ncouple decades ago. It had what was then designated a C-plus safety \nrating because they determined after a while that they could detonate \none of these if there was a stray bullet that hit the high explosive \nand, therefore, one of the reasons it was taken out of the field as an \nartillery shell was because of the safety problem involved.\n  To give an idea of the detonation of this neutron bomb, it is \npictured in this photograph. One can see that the amount of \nradioactivity, the amount of damage, the collateral damage from it was \nvery substantial.\n  Let me go to the last of these charts just to make another point.\n  My colleague from South Carolina was saying what we need is a nuclear \nweapon; we need to see about developing a nuclear weapon that can be \nused to go deep underground and, thereby, get at chemical weapons \nfabrication activities or perhaps biological weapons fabrication \nactivities.\n  The truth is, if you put one of these weapons on a rocket and send it \noff, you cannot get it very deep into the ground. If it is a 12-foot \nlong weapon, the maximum it can go is 48 feet into the ground. If it is \n100-ton TNT equivalent, the experts tell us you have to bury that at \nleast 140 feet under the ground or else you are going to have \nradioactive fallout. If you have a 1,000-ton weapon, you have to bury \nit at least 450 feet when it is exploded to contain the fallout. The \ntruth is, we cannot put this on a rocket and get it down 450 feet. It \nis just not practical.\n  The points I am making are these are not sophisticated weapons. This \nis not a new technology all of a sudden which someone decided to \ndevelop.\n  This is technology that was in our arsenal. We are now seeing this \nadministration say, OK, let's come back and once again begin to look at \nthis as a viable part of our warfighting capability. I do not see the \njustification for it; I do not think it makes sense; and it poses \nenormous additional risks for us in terms of proliferation potential.\n  One of the other comments the Senator from Alabama made a few minutes \nago was: We already have a great many nuclear weapons. What can be so \nwrong about developing some that are small?\n  One thing that could be wrong is that the risk of proliferation of \nmuch smaller, more portable weapons, is substantially greater. The \nsmaller the weapon, the easier it is to move. These weapons are not \nsophisticated. These are not like the very large, high-yield weapons \nthat are difficult to reproduce. There are many countries in this world \nthat have the capability to produce low-yield nuclear weapons, and many \nof them, I am sure, will get more interested as time goes on if they \nsee this is the direction in which we are moving.\n  I think Senator Kennedy made reference to the speech Mr. Putin gave \nlast Friday. The article in the New York Times on Saturday summed it up \nwell when speaking of President Putin. He appeared to be responding to \nthe Bush administration's new nuclear strategy announced last year when \nhe said Russia, too, was considering developing new variants of nuclear \nweapons.\n  This was his statement to the Russian Duma. He said: I can inform you \nthat at present the work to create new types of Russian weapons, \nweapons of the new generation, including those regarded by specialists \nas strategic weapons, is in the practical implementation stage.\n  He did not elaborate, nor did his advisers, though some analysts said \nhe appeared to be referring to Russia's efforts to modernize its \nnuclear arsenal and to develop low-yield nuclear devices. That remark \nwas greeted with applause.\n  This is a dangerous road we start down if we decide to rely more on \ntactical nuclear weapons and once again commence the development of \ntactical nuclear weapons. I think it is an unwise course. My own view \nof our overall defense strategy is that we have always thought it \nserved our interests to emphasize those areas in which we have a \ncomparative advantage.\n  We know today, more than perhaps ever in our history, that we have an \nenormous comparative advantage over any potential adversary in the \nworld in the area of conventional weaponry. We have precision-guided \nweapons. We have smart weapons. We have demonstrated their use \nextremely effectively in the recent conflict in Iraq. Our comparative \nadvantage does not lie in developing small, easily transportable \nnuclear weapons. Many other countries have the capability to do that, \nand not only countries but perhaps groups as well.\n  Once development of those weapons is pursued by us, the likelihood of \nproliferation increases and the likelihood of similar activities by \nother countries\n\n[[Page S6673]]\n\nincreases. Those types of weapons can be easily fabricated. They can be \neasily transported. They can be easily concealed. It is certainly not \nin our interest.\n  I know several of my colleagues have said all this provision is, that \neveryone is getting upset about, is a provision to repeal the ban on \nresearch and development, so what could be so wrong with repealing the \nban on research and development?\n\n  I do think that the reason many of us are concerned is we believe \nvery much that if one of these weapons--if a new type or a new suite of \nthese weapons is developed, it will ultimately be fielded. We believe \nthat is the wrong way to go to maintain our security and to maintain \nthe security of the world in general.\n  Fred Celec, who is the Deputy Assistant to the Secretary of Defense \nfor Nuclear Matters, recently said that the administration wants the \nweapon; that is, the robust nuclear earth penetrator--and that is a \nseparate amendment. Senator Dorgan from North Dakota is going to be \noffering an amendment relating to the robust nuclear earth penetrator \nsometime later this afternoon. But Mr. Celec said the administration \nwants the weapon and will move forward with its development and \nproduction. If a hydrogen bomb can be successfully designed to survive \na crash through hard rock or concrete and still explode, it will \nultimately be fielded. That is a news article from the San Jose \nMercury.\n  So there is reason to be concerned with this provision. Congressman \nSpratt, I believe, showed good judgment when he proposed this provision \nin 1994. The Congress showed good judgment when it adopted this \nprovision as a follow-on to the decision by former President Bush to \ntake these kinds of weapons out of our arsenal. I believe we would do \nwell to keep this ban on research and development in place. I hope my \ncolleagues will agree and support the amendment by the Senator from \nCalifornia and the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. In terms of alternating now, I think we should have the \nSenator from New Mexico address the Senate on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from New Mexico will yield for an \ninquiry.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am pleased to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Can the Senator give an approximation of how long he will \nspeak?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be very brief. An hour and a half.\n  Mr. LEVIN. An hour and a half?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No, sir. About 15 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator can take such time as he feels \nnecessary.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand.\n  Mr. WARNER. Because he brings to this debate a very important aspect \nof many years in the Senate dealing with this subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I acknowledge upfront the very astute \nand academically sound argument of my colleague from New Mexico, Mr. \nBingaman. While I have been working in this field for the last 25 to 26 \nyears in particular, and the last 10 with more emphasis, this has \noccurred in the last period of time. My work has come as the United \nStates has prepared its great nuclear weapons laboratories to use new \nkinds of science to determine the viability and credibility of the \nexisting warheads without underground testing.\n  As everyone recalls, this body passed an amendment, rather \noverwhelmingly, saying we should not use underground testing for our \nweapons. I have learned since then how little we knew about that \nproposition when we cast that vote. Nonetheless, it is the law of the \nland. It has cost the American taxpayer, in my way of looking at it, \nbillions of dollars.\n  Frankly, as I look at the risk in the world, I do not think it has \nsaved the world from nuclear weapons as people had thought. Already \nwith that ban, there are new countries with new nuclear weapons, and \nthey did not need underground testing. At least they did not need it as \nwe had assumed they would need it when we stopped ourselves from doing \nit. Yet we have the greatest scientific community of men and women in \nthe world, believe it or not, accumulated in three laboratories, and \nabout 85 percent of their work goes to that one item.\n  How can we make sure that the weapons we have are valid without \ntesting, all of which was done in the hope that nobody else would get \nbombs, get any nuclear weapons, because an underground test would \nproliferate the desire, if nothing else, for more nuclear weapons?\n  I was not on the Senate floor for the entire argument when that \namendment of nonnuclear testing occurred. My great friend Mark Hatfield \nwas a proponent. But I do know the argument was of the type that if we \ndid not do that, we would be inviting other countries to do what is \nnecessary to develop nuclear weapons. If we did not do it, we could \ndampen that.\n  Now, I do not suggest the arguments are analogous.\n  It is interesting that this enormous debate is taking place regarding \nan amendment that says nothing in the repeal of the previous amendment \nregarding low-yield weapons. ``Nothing in the repeal made by subsection \n(a) shall be construed as authorizing the testing, acquisition, or \ndeployment of low-yield nuclear weapons.''\n  We could say we do not believe what we are saying, that it is not \ntrue, if America wants to direct its scientists--the same scientists I \njust spoke of, incidentally--it will be the same laboratories. They \nwill not invent some new ones. In addition to everything you are doing, \nyou will be given permission to think about, to hypothesize, to ponder, \nto make pictures of, draw diagrams of low-yield bombs and what they are \nall about.\n  Does it make sense, in the kind of world we live, to say to the \ngreatest scientists in the world--we are spending about $6 billion a \nyear for them to make sure the current nuclear weapons are OK, safe, \nand will deliver, if called upon, without underground testing, but to \nsay to that same group, you cannot spend any time--you cannot have a \ndepartment, you cannot have a division, you cannot have your smartest \npeople or even any people in those institutions thinking about low-\nlevel nuclear bombs--not making them, not preparing to deploy them, for \nthis statute forbids it.\n  Our laboratories are filled with dedicated Americans. They want to do \ntheir jobs. They want to do no more or no less than they are \nauthorized. They do not want to be called upon by a congressional \ncommittee to respond to doing more than they had authority to do; and \nclearly they never want to be accused of having done less than they \nwere supposed to.\n  On the other hand, does it seem possible we should be saying to these \nmost brilliant of scientists, here on the wall is a statute and \nregardless of what comes to your great minds about low-level nuclear \nbombs, stop thinking about it. It is against the law. We do not want \nyou thinking about it.\n  Maybe that is a little farfetched. But it is not farfetched to say \nthinking about it and writing something down about it is against the \nlaw, at least if what my colleague from New Mexico says on the floor \nprevails.\n  Those scientists know so much more than us about the world and the \nchanges occurring, and we are wondering about what Russia is going to \nbe doing. There is apt to be 3 or 4 nuclear powers in the next 10 years \nand there is nothing in the world we can do about it. We can sit on the \nfloor and talk about low yield; maybe that is what they are after. \nThere will be nuclear devices that can be delivered long distances \ncausing huge amounts of damage. They are going to happen. The people \nworking on those are not going to spend one iota of concern on whether \nwe have this provision in our law.\n  Some of our scientists might just come up with a great idea about a \nlow-level bomb that could be great for America considering what they \nsee going on in the world, converse to what the argument has been. The \nargument has been, we will teach the world to do what we are doing. I \nam suggesting our scientists will say to us, we are learning from the \nworld what we might want to do in order to keep the peace longer and \nbetter and be able to tell our adversaries what you are thinking of \ndoing.\n\n[[Page S6674]]\n\n  I thought that was what we were all about. I thought that is what Los \nAlamos scientists are all about. I thought they were part of this great \ndeterrent. I still believe they are. I believe to permit them to work \nin this area is part of the deterrent. It does not commit the country \nto build new kinds of weapons. It does not permit us to produce or test \nnew weapons. It does not suggest we should deploy new weapons. It \nallows our scientists to study and perform research and development \noptions that policymakers in the administration and even in the \nCongress may want to know more about.\n\n  I know this for sure when I say ``may want to know more about it.'' I \nsay that because these smart people might come to us and tell us, \nbelieve it or not, something we do not know. Would that be preposterous \nto some of us sitting in the Senate? Would it be preposterous that \nafter this prohibition is lifted in 5 years they could come to us and \nsay, We have been studying and here is what we have found. It is \nsomething you never had in mind, we never had in mind. But think about \nit. All of that seems to me to come on the good side.\n  On the negative side, I cannot see where researching, thinking about, \nintellectualizing about low-level waste, is adding to the proliferation \nof nuclear weapons problem in the world. Remember, even if someone in \nthe administration wanted the new weapons, they could not proceed to \nfull-scale development, the production and deployment, unless Congress \nauthorizes and appropriates funds required to do so. This has not been \ndone. It should not be done without more information or debate, and it \nwill not be done.\n  Finally, there are very important intelligence, nonproliferation \nreasons why our scientists should be able to develop their thinking in \nthese important areas of research. If anyone in this world is thinking \nabout low-level weapons, we must know as much as we can about them. I \njust said that in a different way a moment ago.\n  NNSA, the new semiautonomous agency that controls our weapons \ndevelopment, should challenge their scientists and engineers to think, \nto explore, to discover, to innovate. By removing the prohibition on \nresearch and development on low-level yield weapons, our experts will \nexpand their own understanding and capabilities without artificial \nrestrictions.\n  I repeat, if anything comes out of this that is surprising, it will \nbe what we will be able to do to prevent proliferation from happening \nsomehow, somewhere in the world. In fact, I think that is more apt to \nhappen as a result of the thinking and the development that occurs here \nby our scientists than the reverse. We have no idea what these great \nminds can be thinking, but the great minds of the other scientists in \nthe world are thinking about them also.\n  As a matter of fact, we heard some statements about Russia thinking \nabout them as if we ought to be afraid of that, because if we do not do \nit, they will not do it. If anyone believes that, they probably would \nbelieve almost anything. They are busy looking at whatever kind of new \nnuclear weapons that do not break any of the agreements with us. We \nwill soon be greatly reducing our arsenals of heavy weapons, and at the \nsame time other countries and their scientists will develop nuclear \nweapons. They will be developing low yield ones, too. They will be \ndeveloping low yield ones with very different ways of using them than \nwe ever thought. We ought to have the very best looking at how that \nmight happen, if it might happen.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Wisconsin yield just \nfor a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after Senator \nFeingold, Senator Inhofe be recognized and then Senator Byrd be \nrecognized after that Senator, and then Senator Talent be recognized \nafter Senator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection? Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from California and the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I am pleased to have cosponsored it. I commend the \nSenators for offering this important amendment, and I am extremely \npleased to be one of a large group of Senators who have come to the \nfloor to express their concern about this policy and to support this \namendment.\n  I share their concern, as I know that many of our colleagues do, \nabout the provision in the underlying bill that would repeal the 10-\nyear ban on research and development of low-yield nuclear weapons. \nLifting this ban could be the first step in the resumption of nuclear \ntesting and the creation of new classes of nuclear weapons which I \noppose.\n  Our men and women in uniform are facing new threats, but our defense \nprocurement policy remains planted firmly in the cold war by calling \nfor more nuclear weapons. We should not endorse a policy that could \nstart or spark another nuclear arms race.\n  I am deeply concerned that the administration's Nuclear Posture \nReview represents a departure from this country's longstanding nuclear \nweapons policy. Lifting the ban on low-yield nuclear weapons and \nfunding a feasibility study on the so-called robust earth penetrator \nand directing the Secretary of Energy to accelerate the readiness \nposture for the Nevada Test Site from 24 to 36 months to 18 months all \npoint toward a disturbing destination--the resumption of an active \nnuclear weapons program, including underground testing by the United \nStates.\n  These decisions send dangerous signals to our allies and adversaries \nalike. The United States has urged nonnuclear states and rogue \noperators not to pursue nuclear programs. But if we, as a nuclear power \nwith enough of these weapons to destroy the world many times over, \nbegin developing mini-nukes or other new forms of these dangerous \nweapons, I think we run the risk of inviting other countries and other \norganizations to do so as well.\n  I supported the Moscow Treaty earlier this year because, while it is \nnot perfect, it does move us closer to the goal of reducing the \nstrategic nuclear arsenals of the United States and Russia. I don't \nthink we should undermine this worthy goal by now starting down the \npath toward smaller, more easily transported nuclear weapons that could \nfall into the wrong hands.\n  I recognize that the underlying bill would lift the ban on research \nand development of low-yield nuclear weapons without authorizing that \nsuch weapons be tested, acquired, or deployed by the United States. But \nI still think this is a perilous first step toward a new class of \nnuclear weapons. It is one we should not take. I, therefore, urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment offered by the Senators from \nMassachusetts and California.\n  I yield the remainder of my time and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, let me make real clear things that \nsomehow get lost in the discussion. I have heard it said by the last \nfour or five speakers that doing this is moving forward with the \ndevelopment and production of low-yield nuclear weapons. Nothing could \nbe further from the truth.\n  By repealing the ban on low-yield nuclear weapons research, our \nnuclear weapons experts will be able to explore weapons concepts that \ncould help us to respond to new threats. We ought to treat research and \ndevelopment of low-yield nuclear weapons like research and development \nof any weapon. For any weapon that we have had, any weapon, \nconventional or otherwise, we have had to go through this period of \ntime. That doesn't mean we are going to make one. It means we are going \nto be prepared if need be.\n  By repealing the ban as we did in the Senate bill, the administration \nis still required to specifically request funding at each phase of the \nresearch and development as required by the National Advanced \nAuthorization Act of Fiscal Year 2003. The Congress has the prerogative \nwhether to authorize and appropriate for such activities. With the many \nnew and emerging threats in the world, we cannot afford to be \nunprepared.\n  I was listening to the Senator from Wisconsin talk about how, \nsomehow, this starts some kind of a nuclear race.\n\n[[Page S6675]]\n\nReally that is just not true. People argue that research on nuclear \nweapons would encourage nuclear proliferation. Since 1993, when the ban \nwent into effect, the ban we are seeking to repeal right now, several \nnations have sought and in some cases achieved nuclear capabilities--in \nother words, countries such as India and Pakistan and North Korea. \nThere is no correlation between U.S. weapons research and \nproliferation. More significant is the U.S. track record of nuclear \nreductions.\n  Our top military people and diplomatic leaders support repeal of this \nprohibition: ADM James Ellis, GEN John Jumper, Secretary of State Colin \nPowell.\n  In 1994, Congress prohibited any research and development which could \nlead to the production of a low-yield nuclear weapon. That is less than \n5 kilotons. This is an arbitrary restriction and it impedes the ability \nof scientists and engineers who support our national defense to explore \na full range of scientific and technical concepts for the nuclear \nweapons stockpile.\n  It has a chilling effect on creative thinking when scientists have to \nconsult a lawyer before exploring concepts involving nuclear weapons. \nIt restricts the ability of this or any administration to explore \noptions to modify our nuclear weapons capability to prepare for \nchanging defense needs in the 21st century.\n  These needs are changing. I remember 8 years ago, sitting in the \nSenate Armed Services Committee hearings, when there was a proposal \nthat said we would no longer need ground troops in the next 10 years. \nIt was about 10 years ago. Yet here we come up with the problems that \nwe had in Afghanistan. We had the great battles there, ground troop \nbattles. We went into Iraq. That was on the ground; it wasn't in the \nair. Now we are looking at other options and possible risks and we \ndon't know what they are going to be.\n  The point is, we have to be ready for whatever does come. It is \nprudent national security policy to allow the administration to \nconsider weapons concepts that would hold at risk deeply buried and \nhardened targets to defeat chemical and biological agents and reduce \ncollateral damage.\n  Reducing collateral damage--if we were to be able to do this research \nand ultimately it became necessary to have this, we would be able to \npenetrate deeply into the ground to knock out chemical threats, to \nknock out biological threats, maybe even nuclear threats, and not cause \nany collateral damage. In the absence of that, you would have to use \nsomething else, a MOAB, for example, that would clear an area of maybe \n5 or 10 square miles, killing everything within that range. So it would \nbe an effort to reduce collateral damage.\n  Repealing this prohibition would not authorize the administration to \nbuild any nuclear weapon. I think it is very important people \nunderstand that.\n  What happens if all of a sudden there is a changing threat out there \nand we discover we need to be able to develop a low-yield nuclear \nweapon, if every Senator in here, every Democrat and every Republican, \nagreed that we had to have this? If we don't do research and \ndevelopment now, it could be years before we would be able to have it. \nIf we go ahead, then we would be able to have it in a very short period \nof time.\n  I chaired the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness for \nquite a number of years. I see my colleague from Hawaii over there, who \nis my ranking member. Of course he chaired it also. We know that the \nthreats change all the time. The whole idea of readiness is to be ready \nfor anything that should come up. Unfortunately, we cannot predict what \nthe future holds.\n  We predicted it wrong 10 years ago. We predicted it wrong 5 years \nago. We could predict it wrong this time. Just by doing research and \ndevelopment, we are not coming out with any kind of production on any \nkind of low-yield nuclear weapon. It is just a matter of being prepared \nin the event that everyone should decide that we have to have this \ncapability.\n  I hope we vote down this effort to stop our ability to be able to do \nresearch and development in this area. Again, on every weapons system \nwe have, we have had to go through an extensive and long period of time \non research and development. It doesn't cost us any more to be ready in \nthe event that capability should be required.\n  I thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to modify the \nprevious agreement: That I be recognized next and the next Senator to \nbe recognized following the movement back and forth on our side would \nbe Senator Akaka.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I am listening to this debate, and I \nguess I just do not understand. We are hearing that it is important for \nour country to begin studying or developing, researching a new class of \nnuclear weapons, a new design of nuclear weapons, low yield--which is \nan oxymoron--low-yield nuclear weapons, bunker buster nuclear weapons.\n  I was thinking of something Martin Luther King said, which was: ``The \nmeans by which we live have outdistanced the ends for which we live. We \nhave learned the secret of the atom but forgotten the sermon on the \nMount.''\n  I don't understand what we are thinking about here. At a moment in \nhistory when we need to be the world leader in stopping the spread of \nnuclear weapons and reducing the threat of nuclear weapons, we are \ndebating whether we ought to begin producing more nuclear weapons. Is \nthere someone here who can't sleep because we don't have enough nuclear \nweapons? There is roughly 30,000 nuclear weapons on this Earth.\n  About 2 years ago, or 1\\1/2\\ years ago, our intelligence community \nthought one was missing. They thought that one from the Russian \nstockpile had been stolen. At least there was the rumor. They had an \nepileptic seizure about one nuclear weapon missing. Would it be \ndetonated in an American city? They were concerned about one nuclear \nweapon.\n\n  There are 30,000, roughly, nuclear weapons, and we have people here \nworried about not having enough of the right kind. I just do not \nunderstand.\n  We just heard there is a change in threat. There may be a change in \nthreat. Everybody knows the threat isn't being addressed in this bill. \nThere is $9 billion in this bill to build a big, old antiballistic \nmissile system; a national missile defense system. Take a look at the \nthreat meter and find out what the least likely threat against this \ncountry is. It isn't that a terrorist or terrorist group will have \naccess to an ICBM with a nuclear tip on it and fire it against the \nUnited States. A nuclear weapon, if sent here by a terrorist, isn't \ncoming in here at 14,000 miles per hour on an intercontinental \nballistic missile. It will be pulled up at 2 miles an hour at a dock at \nan American city in a container loaded by terrorists. Yet we are going \nto spend $9 billion on national missile defense.\n  I understand we have been doing that for the last several years. It \ndoesn't make any sense to me. We are unprepared in other areas. At a \ntime when we ought to be leading, to say to the rest of the world, \ndon't build more nuclear weapons, don't use nuclear weapons, this \ncountry is sending a signal to the rest of the world in dozens of ways \nsaying, you know, we will not renounce first use. We believe in the \nopportunity for preemptive attack, if we are challenged; we ought to \nstudy new nuclear weapons, a bunker buster design of nuclear weapons.\n  Again, this issue of low yield is nuts. I don't want to hear people \ntalk about low yield. The people who talk about low-yield nuclear \nweapons are the same people who talk about the ability to use nuclear \nweapons. If anybody here thinks there is an ability in this world to \nuse nuclear weapons in a war, then I don't know what planet you are \nliving on. Once the movement of nuclear weapons goes back and forth \nbetween adversaries, I am sorry, your children will have no future. If \n30,000 isn't enough, I am just wondering what hours of the night you \nare awake worried about your lack of protection.\n  I do not understand this at all. If ever this world needed this \ncountry in all of its majesty and in all of its wonders of leadership \ncapability, if ever this world needed this country, it is now.\n  My colleagues are no doubt tired of this. I will point out again what \nI have\n\n[[Page S6676]]\n\nin this desk. I have some pieces of metal that were given to me that \ncame from an ICBM. This came from an ICBM which used to have a warhead \non it aimed at the United States. It could have destroyed an American \ncity. We didn't shoot it down. It was never launched. That is how I \nhave this.\n  We, with Nunn-Lugar funds, destroyed this missile in its silo. Where \nthis missile used to exist, there is now planted sunflowers. Yes. This \nmissile is gone. We sawed wings off bombers. We have destroyed \nsubmarines, and we paid for it. We didn't shoot them down. We paid for \ntheir destruction under arms control agreements and arms reduction \nagreements.\n  Our job at the moment is to continue the Nunn-Lugar program and \ncontinue these efforts to say to other countries that all of us must \nback away from this madness.\n  This is not modernization; it is madness. How many more nuclear \nweapons do we want? What kind of an additional signal do we want to \ngive to countries around the world that it is OK to build nuclear \nweapons and it is OK to be doing research on classes of new nuclear \nweapons?\n\n  I say to those of you and to the administration that I guess they are \ngetting the message. We hear it from Russia. They got the message. We \nare going to do some research on these so-called low-yield nuclear \nweapons. They can do some research on low-yield nuclear weapons. I \nguess they are getting the message. I suppose the Chinese got the \nmessage. All of them will get the message. Then our children will have \na much less bright future because we will have not seized the \nopportunity and the responsibility as the world's leading power, \neconomic and military, to steer us in a direction away from nuclear \nconfrontation, away from building more nuclear weapons, and away from \nfirst use. We will not have done that. We will have instead flexed our \nmuscles and said that we have unlimited money. Let us just go ahead and \nspend billions here and billions there.\n  I found it interesting. Last week I couldn't get one-fourth of $1 \nbillion through this Senate that had been approved previously to try to \nfeed hungry kids in Africa who are on the abyss of starvation. Forty-\nthousand people a day die because they do not have enough to eat, \nmostly kids. That is the equivalent of one Hiroshima bomb every 3 days.\n  We have plenty of money for all the things we are talking about \ntoday. We didn't have enough money to deal with the issue of hunger and \nfamine in Africa a couple of days ago. But aside from the issue of \npriorities, which, in my judgment, is a twisted set of priorities, \nlosing the opportunity and failing to seize the moment in which \nAmerican leadership is demanding to move this world away from a belief \nthat we need more nuclear weapons and that it is OK for countries to \npotentially use nuclear weapons is a miserable failure on the part of a \ncountry and a legacy, in my judgment, in a very negative way.\n  My hope is that before we go too far we will have the votes on this \namendment and subsequent amendments. I intend to offer another \namendment in a group of four. I hope we will have the votes to begin to \nturn this country in a constructive direction in this debate on the \nauthorization bill.\n  This is about judgment. There is an unending appetite in this Chamber \nright now to do all of these things. But, in my opinion, this is about \nusing good judgment as a nation to assume our responsibility in the \nworld.\n  I regret very much that if the work of the committee prevails on the \nfloor of the Senate today, then we will this evening find a world that \nis much less secure than it was before this committee began its work.\n  We have the capability to do awfully good things. But it requires our \nleadership. It requires our character and our judgment to decide there \nis a right direction and a wrong direction. The wrong direction, in my \njudgment, is for our country to say to the rest of the world, let us \nall build some more nuclear weapons. Let us worry about some threat or \nsome rogue nation digging tunnels so deeply we can't catch them or \nexplode them. So let us deal with new nuclear weapons.\n  I can't think of a more destructive course or a more destructive set \nof policies than those coming to us in this bill dealing with these \nissues. Some say it is irrelevant; it doesn't matter; this is only \nresearch. Are you kidding? That is what the other countries will say as \nwell as they begin to ramp up their programs. It is only ``research'' \non their next group of designer nuclear weapons. It is only research. \nBut we will have taken the cork out of the bottle, and it won't be \neasily put back in.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the amendment. This is a very \nimportant vote, perhaps one of the most important votes on the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. It is my understanding that the debate has been going back \nand forth. Senator Allard was in the queue but has graciously allowed \nme to get in front of him. What I would like to do is propound a very \nlimited request. I ask unanimous consent that after I speak, Senator \nAkaka be recognized to speak, and after he has completed, Senator \nAllard be recognized to speak.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I am in agreement with that. I want to \nconsult my distinguished ranking member. The Senator from Michigan and \nI had worked out a schedule.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from Arizona would modify the \nrequest to add Senator Reed immediately after Senator Allard on his \nside.\n  Mr. KYL. Senator Akaka would be after me, and then Senator Allard, \nthen Senator Reed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Senator Reed of Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WARNER. In that order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I appreciate the cooperation of my \ncolleagues. This is a very serious debate. We need to be careful of the \nlanguage we use and the arguments we make. I would like to respond to a \ncouple arguments just made. I think we can clearly be sending some very \nbad signals to some very bad countries of the world in the Senate. When \na Member of the Senate speaks about low-yield nuclear weapons as \n``nuts,'' we make a grave mistake.\n  The majority of the Armed Services Committee of the Senate, the \nSecretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the \nSecretary of Energy--these are very serious people who have a very \nserious reason for asking that this language be retained in the bill.\n  The reason low-yield weapons research is being sought is because the \nworld has changed since the time we developed these huge megaton \nnuclear weapons that can kill millions in just a few seconds. Instead \nof wanting to use those kinds of weapons, the United States would \nprefer, if it had to, to use a much smaller weapon, a low-yield weapon.\n  There are several potential uses for this kind of weapon. To digress \nfor a moment, we used to have a lot of these. They are called tactical \nnuclear weapons. Russia still does. The United States got rid of ours. \nRussia says it is going to be getting rid of its tactical nuclear \nweapons as well. Tactical nuclear weapons are not new. Low-yield \nnuclear weapons are not new. But the United States, in order to have a \ncredible deterrent against a strategic nuclear attack, developed these \nvery robust weapons that can take out cities, that can take out huge \nmilitary targets with one weapon. One of the reasons was because we \nwere not very accurate 20 years ago when the weapons were designed. We \ncould get pretty close but nothing like the precision with which our \nweapons can be targeted today.\n  In the most recent conflict in Iraq, we literally saw missiles flying \nthrough windows of buildings in downtown Baghdad. The kind of precision \nwe have today enables us to use much smaller yield weapons to achieve \nthe same results that large conventional weapons are being used for \ntoday. But they can do so much more effectively. For example, we know \nthat some so-called conventional bunker busters were used in an attempt \nto decapitate the Iraqi leadership in the early stages of the war. We \nwere impressed with the fact that these missiles could actually go \nthrough a hole in the floor board by one missile and then three or four \nmore in the same hole and destroy a lot below. But it did not do the \njob. As good as they were, apparently the leadership of the Iraqi \nregime lived on. So\n\n[[Page S6677]]\n\nwe cannot say we have the capability, even in dealing with that regime, \nto destroy those kinds of targets.\n  What we know from intelligence is that there are a lot of other \nnations in the world that know one thing: If you get deep enough \nunderground with enough concrete and steel above your head, they can't \nget you. That is exactly the kind of facility being built by our \npotential enemies today. There is only one way to get those, and that \nis through a precise low-yield nuclear weapon. The design of those \nweapons is certainly in the mind of our scientists. And if they are \nallowed to think about this, to do some research on it, we think at \nleast we would be prepared, should the Pentagon decide that it wants to \nask the Congress for the authority to go forward with the program, to \nbe able to do so.\n  The point has been made adequately, this does not authorize anything. \nThis merely removes a self-imposed prohibition on the United States. No \nother country in the world is suffering under this same prohibition. We \nlegislated this restriction on ourselves. Russia does not have it. \nChina does not have it. Great Britain does not have it. France does not \nhave it, nor do the countries of the world that are proliferating or \nbuilding weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons in \nviolation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\n  There may be a reason for us to need these kinds of weapons in the \nfuture. It has also been noted that they could be very useful in the \ndestruction of chemical and biological agents or weapons which are not \neasily destroyed by conventional weaponry and in any event where the \nfallout can be more dangerous than the weapon just sitting there on the \nground. If you put a large conventional explosion on top of chemical or \nbiological agents, you could end up dispersing those agents in a very \ndangerous way over a far greater area than if the enemy actually tried \nto use the weapon. But with a precise low-yield nuclear weapon, you \nmight well be able to destroy that biological or chemical agent or \nweapon. In this new world there may well be reasons to have these \nweapons. For somebody to suggest it is nuts is simply an uneducated \napproach to this very serious issue.\n  I made the point that this is not an authorization. All we are doing \nis removing a self-imposed restriction on thinking about this, on doing \nresearch. If the researchers conclude it could be done and the Pentagon \ndecided it should be done, Congress would still have to authorize such \na program and fund it through appropriations. So I don't think we \nshould be against thinking in the Senate, against researching something \nthat we may well wish we had down the road.\n  This could save lives. Think about the application of such a weapon \nas we have today on one of these targets. We would risk killing \nmillions, and there is no point in doing that. It would be immoral to \ndo that.\n  A second point made earlier was to demonstrate the ICBMs that have \nbeen destroyed and to suggest that if we now move forward with \nrebuilding some nuclear weapons, we would be signalling to other \nnations that it is OK to build these nuclear weapons. Let's parse that \na little more carefully.\n  The reason we are destroying nuclear weapons is because we want to \nget rid of some of these very large nuclear weapons that we don't think \nwe need anymore because circumstances have changed. Frankly, I don't \nthink it is a very credible deterrent for us to say--I will say this \nregarding Iraq because that is over and so I think one can safely talk \nabout the situation there. I don't want to talk about potential future \nsituations--to Saddam Hussein, if you use chemical weapons against our \ntroops, since we have foresworn chemical weapons and we have foresworn \nthe use of biological weapons--we don't even have them; our only big \nticket type here is a nuclear weapon--we won't take any option off the \ntable. We just might use a nuclear weapon if you use biological or \nchemical weapons against us.\n  We threatened that once before, and some say it worked to deter his \nuse of those chemical weapons. Would it work today? Does anybody really \nbelieve the United States would kill maybe 3 or 4 or 5 million innocent \nIraqi citizens by bombing Baghdad with one of our big nuclear weapons \ntoday? Those are the kinds of weapons we have. They kill lots of people \nreal fast. As a deterrent when the cold war was going on, we wanted to \nlet the Soviet Union know that they better not launch against us \nbecause they would suffer just as much destruction as we would and, \ntherefore, we could deter their actions.\n  Would it really deter a Saddam Hussein from using biological or \nchemical weapons against us? Would he really think we would use one of \nour great big nuclear weapons? I don't think so. So, ironically, these \ngreat big weapons are too big to use.\n  The deterrent may not be credible. As a result, it makes sense for us \nto destroy a large number of those weapons, to take them out of our \ninventory and keep only enough that we think would really be necessary \nin the event we needed to deter a nuclear-armed country, such as Russia \nor China today. The other legal nuclear countries, of course, are \nFrance and Britain. In addition, we have India and Pakistan, which are \nnot part of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n  So we say we can deter an action by a Saddam Hussein with a far \nsmaller, less destructive kind of weapon. If he knows that we have a \nlow-yield nuclear weapon that can bust his bunker and all of the other \nleadership, maybe he will think twice before he orders the use of \nchemical or biological weapons.\n  Today, the experience in Iraq shows that we could not get the \nleadership of Iraq. So what does this teach other potential enemies? If \nyou burrow deep enough underground and put enough steel and concrete \nover your head, like Saddam Hussein apparently did, you are not going \nto be able to get him, or get us, and therefore we have nothing to \nfear. That is another reason we need these weapons. We are willing to \nget rid of our great big weapons; that is the signal we are sending. We \nalso will continue to have a credible deterrent with much smaller kinds \nof weapons.\n  I mentioned the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. I will make this \npoint. The nuclear countries of the world that signed the NPT agreed we \nwould be the nuclear powers; but in exchange for other countries that \nsigned up, including countries such as Iran, we said we would provide \nthem with information and assistance regarding atomic energy--the \npeaceful uses of nuclear energy. We have done that.\n  When countries have come to us and asked, we have provided that \nassistance because that is what the NPT calls for. We have abided by \nit; they have not. What makes anyone think that a self-imposed \ncongressional limitation on the United States has deterred countries \nsuch as North Korea and Iran--or India and Pakistan for that matter--\nfrom developing weapons in contravention of the NPT?\n  Obviously, our action hasn't prevented them from developing these \nweapons. So what kind of an argument is it that this law on the books \nhas been effective at stopping other countries? It didn't stop Saddam \nHussein, Iran, or North Korea; and other countries are also trying to \nwork on a nuclear capability.\n  So let's not kid ourselves. This isn't stopping proliferation. What \nwill stop it is a strong signal from the U.S. that it will not be \ncountenanced, because if you have signed the NPT, like Iran, you don't \nhave any right; you signed that right away for something we gave you. \nWe are going to have a credible deterrent to your use of such a weapon.\n  Finally, I am astonished at the argument that was made earlier that \nwe should be ``setting our priorities straight,'' we should be willing \nto spend money on hunger in Africa rather than defending the United \nStates of America. That was the argument made on this Senate floor. I \nam concerned that we are sending the wrong signals to the world--\nespecially our potential adversaries--if that kind of a statement is \nleft unresponded to.\n  The U.S. Government has an obligation above all others, and that is \nto protect and defend the people of the United States of America. That \nis our primary obligation as Members of this body. If it is necessary \nnot to spend one nickel but simply remove a provision of the law that \nprevents our scientists from even thinking about this problem, and if \nwe are saying that has a lower priority than spending money on hunger \nin Africa, then something is gravely wrong.\n\n[[Page S6678]]\n\n  Fortunately, we are not going to do this. The Armed Services \nCommittee understood the need to remove the restriction on thinking. \nThe Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and \nSecretary of Energy have said to remove that restriction so our people \ncan think about this problem. I think that is the priority here. That \nis why we should support the action of the Armed Services Committee. It \nshould not be illegal to think of ways of defending America.\n  I will conclude with this statement. Everybody would like to see a \nday when there are no nuclear weapons. But we cannot disinvent the \nnuclear weapon. Either we have confidence in the United States of \nAmerica as a power that can help do something to stop the wrong people \nfrom acquiring these weapons and using them, or we do not. If we have \nso little confidence in America that we don't trust ourselves with \nthese weapons to be used as a way of stopping the likes of Saddam \nHussein, then we have lost our way indeed.\n  Americans must have the confidence that we will do the right thing as \na government. Members of the U.S. Congress make this kind of policy. Do \nwe have so little confidence in ourselves that we are not willing to \nlet our scientists think about this problem?\n  We hold the decision in our hands to authorize a program, to \nappropriate the money for a program. So it is not as if we are giving \nanything up by allowing our scientists to think about this.\n  Yet that is what the opponents of the committee bill would have us \ndo. I find it incredible that we would, like the Luddites of old, say \nwe don't want to know any more about this because nuclear weapons are \nreally icky things. Well, they are not nice, but somebody needs to have \nthe ability to deter others from gaining their capability or, God \nforbid, invoking the use of these weapons.\n  Only a country that is willing to think about what kinds of \ndeterrents may be required in the future is going to be able to provide \nthat degree of stability in the world. That burden rests upon the \nUnited States of America. I gladly accept it as a representative of the \nGovernment that I think we can trust.\n  That is what it boils down to today. Do we trust the President, the \nSecretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a \nmajority of the Committee on Armed Services or don't we? I think we can \nput our trust in them. I do, and I urge my colleagues to support the \ncommittee action and defeat the amendment against the committee action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I rise today to support the amendment \noffered by Senators Feinstein and Kennedy to the fiscal year 2004 \nDefense authorization bill to strike section 3131 and to keep the \nprohibition on the research and development of low-yield nuclear \nweapons.\n  Let me explain to you and my colleagues why I am supporting this \namendment. In 1993, Congress placed a prohibition on research and \ndevelopment that could lead to the production of new low-yield nuclear \nweapons that would have an explosive yield of less than 5 kilotons. I \nam informed that this administration has sought to eliminate this \nprohibition.\n  The administration's Nuclear Posture Review calls for exploring new \nnuclear weapons ``concepts'' to be able to attack hard and buried \ntargets in so-called rogue nations with reduced collateral damage.\n  According to the administration, the restriction on research on low-\nyield nuclear weapons impedes this effort. But the existing law gives \nnuclear weapons laboratories sufficient room to explore new nuclear \nweapons concepts. Adequate research is permitted but not production.\n  However, the fiscal year 2004 authorization bill follows the \nadministration's request and repeals the 1993 prohibition. Yet the \ndevelopment and production of low-yield nuclear weapons would create \nmany problems. As I noted in my statement to the Senate on April 11, \n2003, although the administration is looking to reduce collateral \ndamage from a nuclear explosion, low-yield weapons could still cause \nwidespread devastation if used, threatening civilian populations and \nU.S. forces.\n  We already have several conventional weapons that can be used to \ndestroy or incapacitate buried bunkers. Rather than pursuing new \nnuclear weapons, we could devote additional resources to improving the \nability of our conventional forces to render deeply buried targets \ninoperable.\n  Developing the new low-yield nuclear weapons could also encourage a \nnew arms race in tactical nuclear weapons and setback U.S. \nnonproliferation efforts. There is already some evidence of a new \naction-reaction arms race cycle starting.\n  Just last Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin told the Russian \nDuma in his annual address that Russia is working on a new generation \nof nuclear weapons. Russian military experts were quoted as saying that \nPresident Putin was probably referring to new low-yield nuclear weapons \nlike those proposed by the administration.\n  Last month, Secretary of State Colin Powell sent a message to the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Preparatory Committee conference in \nGeneva in which he said the United States ``remains firmly committed to \nits obligations under the NPT.'' Assistant Secretary of State John Wolf \noutlines the steps the United States had taken to fulfill its article \nVI obligations to the conference. But he expressed very strong worries \nthat the NPT regime was being weakened by nonnuclear countries covertly \npursuing nuclear weapons programs.\n  The majority of the signatories to the NPT treaty agreed to its \nindefinite extension in 1995 on the assumption the nuclear weapons \npowers would continue to reduce their nuclear arsenals and ratify a \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The administration's pursuit of new \nnuclear weapons makes it harder to convince the world to crack down on \npossible NPT violators.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. We should act to \nstop the further proliferation of nuclear weapons and prevent the start \nof a new mini-nuke arms race.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, we have had excellent cooperation on \nboth sides of the aisle in this very important debate. I would like to \npropound a unanimous consent request on which my distinguished \ncolleague from Michigan, the leader, Senator Reid, and I have worked. \nThis is on the pending Feinstein-Kennedy amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that prior to a vote in relation to the \npending Feinstein-Kennedy amendment No. 715, the following Members be \nrecognized to address the Senate: Senator Reed, 20 minutes; Senator \nBiden, 20 minutes; Senator Kennedy, 5 minutes; Senator Feinstein, 15 \nminutes; Senator Levin, 25 minutes; and under the control of the \nSenator from Virginia will be 60 minutes, which I will allocate.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if I can ask the Senator to accept this \nmodification, that the order of the speakers on our side be Senator \nReed of Rhode Island, Senator Biden, Senator Boxer, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Feinstein, and Senator Levin.\n  Mr. WARNER. With that addition, I say to my colleague, we would add \nmore time for Senator Boxer?\n  Mr. REID. Senator Boxer is scheduled for 5 minutes. Senator Levin \ndoes not want to be the final speaker, so we will have him go before \nSenator Feinstein. That is a total of 90 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is acceptable.\n  Let me finish the request. I ask unanimous consent that following the \nuse or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation \nto the amendment, with no amendment in order to the language proposed \nto be stricken prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I say to colleagues on my side of the aisle, I hope they will \napproach me as soon as possible to indicate such time\n\n[[Page S6679]]\n\nas they might wish to take of the hour under the control of the Senator \nfrom Virginia. The Senator from Colorado wishes to address the Senate. \nI yield the floor for that purpose.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I wish to make a few comments in regard to the Kennedy-\nFeinstein amendment currently before us.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I say to the Senator, since we discussed \nwhat he intends to do, I yield to him such time as he may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I think it behooves all of us to take \nthe time and review where we are in this debate.\n  The current law prohibits research and development of low-yield \nnuclear weapons. It prevents scientists from even thinking about low-\nyield nuclear weapons. There is a provision in the bill before us that \nsays we will be able to think about low-yield nuclear weapons, but it \nspecifically prevents testing, acquisition, or deployment of low-yield \nnuclear weapons unless you come to the Congress and ask permission to \nmove forward with that type of effort.\n  The Kennedy-Feinstein amendment we are currently considering takes it \nback to the current prohibition of even thinking about what it is we \nneed to do about low-yield nuclear weapons.\n  During the Easter break, which was a 2-week break, I spent the first \nweek on townhall meetings in Colorado. The second week I spent visiting \nour National Laboratories.\n  Our National Laboratories are pretty much known for their \nresponsibility of managing the nuclear stockpile to make sure that it \nis safe and reliable. As I visited these laboratories, I found out they \ndo much more than that. They give a lot of thought to what type of \ndeterrence should we have as far as being a superpower. They do a lot \nof thinking about our vulnerabilities. They think about our potential \nthreats and what might be the proper response to those threats.\n  So the nuclear laboratory scientists tell me that they wish at least \nthey could study the low-nuclear weapon alternative. I agree. I think \nat least we ought to look at the pros and cons. We ought to try to \ngather the scientific data and understand which situations may be \nneeded. Maybe we do not need low-yield nuclear weapons, but they at \nleast need to think about it and they need to have a study.\n  Ambassador Linton Brooks testified before the Armed Services \nCommittee, and he was the acting administrator of the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration. He also testified before the Strategic Forces \nSubcommittee on April 8, 2003. This is what he said: Repeal of the low-\nyield restriction simply removes the chilling effect on scientific \ninquiry that could hamper our ability to maintain and exercise our \nintellectual capabilities and to respond to the needs that one day \nmight be articulated by the President.\n  He also noted that such warhead concepts could not proceed to full-\nscale development, much less production and deployment, unless Congress \nauthorizes and appropriates the funds required to do this.\n  As a point of reference in the ban on research and development of \nlow-yield nuclear weapons--low yield is defined as below 5 kilotons as \na comparison. So in nuclear technology, we are talking about a \nrelatively small type of warhead.\n  I respect the view of the scientists I visited at our various \nlaboratories. One thing I came away thinking is they are dedicated \nAmericans. They are dedicated scientists. They have a lot of ingenuity, \nand they are supported by a tremendous workforce that is dedicated to \nmaking sure we have a safer world and that we can actually preserve \nfreedom. They are concerned that we remain a world leader. My view is \nwe are a world leader, but we are a world leader in reducing nuclear \nweapons.\n  Earlier the Senator from North Dakota commented about the fact that \nwhere he had silos for missiles with nuclear warheads, he now has \nsunflowers growing in the field. Well, right now, under the \nPresidential directive of President Bush, we are removing peacekeepers \nfrom the ground. We are taking out a sizable proportion of some of the \ncold war relics that are supposed to act as deterrents as far as a \nnuclear war is concerned.\n  While these sunflowers are growing and the President is removing more \nof our nuclear warheads, what is the rest of the world doing? What I \nhave observed is that there are countries such as Iran and Iraq--no \nlonger Iraq but at one point in time at least--Afghanistan, Pakistan, \nand North Korea are building more nuclear weapons. They are trying to \ndevelop that technology.\n  We have been a leader. The problem is nobody is following. I think \nthese countries are more concerned not so much about what the United \nStates is doing but about what their neighbors are doing, what it is \nthat they are going to have to require to defend their borders. So this \nis beyond what we do in this country.\n  Even though this country remains committed and has shown leadership \nin reducing our nuclear weapons, we have to remember that other \ncountries are moving ahead, regardless of what we are doing. We need to \ngive some thought to that. We need to study that issue.\n  I am looking at some figures on nuclear testing which we postponed on \nSeptember 23, 1992. That was the last date of underground nuclear tests \nby the United States. Since that date, we have had a number of nuclear \ntests by China, France, India, and Pakistan.

I do not see that other countries are responding to our \nefforts. So I think we need to think about our own vulnerabilities and \nour own potential threats. That is what we are trying to do in the \narmed services bill. We are trying to at least give our scientists an \nopportunity to study our nuclear weapon vulnerabilities.\n  Earlier on in the debate, some comment was made--I think we had a \ndialogue between a couple of Members who were supporting the Kennedy-\nFeinstein amendment. The point was made during that dialogue that this \nprovision we have in the bill would lead to the building of new \nweapons. That is not true. We have a specific provision in the bill \nthat says nothing in the provision shall be construed as authorizing \nthe testing, acquisition, or deployment of low-yield nuclear weapons.\n  What it does provide for is study and thinking about our \nvulnerabilities, our deterrence efforts, and our potential threats.\n  I mentioned that Ambassador Linton Brooks testified in front of our \nsubcommittee. I have a letter from General Jumper explaining how \nimportant it is that we at least study the low-yield nuclear weapons. I \nhave a letter from Admiral Ellis talking about that need. We also have \na letter from Secretary of State Colin Powell talking about the need of \nhaving low-yield nuclear weapons. I ask unanimous consent these three \nletters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                      Department of the Air Force,\n\n\n                                 Office of the Chief of Staff,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 8, 2003.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I seek your support for repealing \n     Section 3136 of the Fiscal Year 1994 National Defense \n     Authorization Act (42 USC Sec. 2121). This section of the \n     law, commonly referred to as the Precision Low-Yield Weapon \n     Development (PLYWD) limitation, prohibits the Department of \n     Energy and by extension the Air Force from conducting any \n     research and development on a new nuclear weapon design with \n     a yield of five kilotons or less.\n       Research and development of new low-yield weapon concepts \n     is required in order to evaluate all potential options to \n     meet current and emerging combatant commanders'\n\n[[Page S6680]]\n\n     requirements. Low-yield nuclear weapons currently in the \n     stockpile simply are not suited to satisfy all these \n     requirements.\n       We are pursuing full rescission of this section of the law \n     instead of just an amendment. A partial repeal that only \n     permits basic research and development with no prospect for \n     production would effectively have the same impact as the \n     current law.\n       A similar letter has been sent to the Ranking Minority \n     Member of your Committee and to the Chairman and Ranking \n     Minority Member of the House Armed Services Committee.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               John P. Jumper,\n\n                                                    General, USAF,\n     Chief of Staff.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Department of Defense,\n\n                                  United States Strategic Command,\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Nuclear Posture Review put in motion \n     a major change in the role of our nuclear forces. As we \n     continue to strategize the most effective methods of \n     addressing new and emerging threats to our National Security, \n     it is an inherent responsibility of the Department of Defense \n     to not only reevaluate the capabilities of our nuclear \n     arsenal, but to thoroughly analyze the potential of advanced \n     concepts that could enhance our overall deterrent posture.\n       US Strategic Command is interested in conducting rigorous \n     studies of all new technologies, and examining the merits of \n     precision, increased penetration, and reduced yields for our \n     nuclear weapons. The nation needs to understand the technical \n     capabilities of threats under development by potential \n     adversaries and to thoroughly explore the range of options \n     available to the United States to deter or defeat them. Once \n     we complete the precise engineering analyses necessary to \n     validate facts related to nascent advanced concepts, the \n     results of the research will enable dispassionate, fact-based \n     discussions on very important defense and policy issues.\n       The findings of the Nuclear Posture Review were strongly \n     endorsed by the Service Chiefs. Repealing Section 3136 of \n     Fiscal Year 1994 NDAA (42 USC, 2121) will allow US Strategic \n     Command the ability to evaluate the full range of advanced \n     concepts through research and development activities.\n       Your support in repealing the prohibition on low-yield \n     research and development for nuclear weapons is greatly \n     appreciated. A similar letter has been sent to the Ranking \n     Member of your committee.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   J.O. Ellis,\n\n                                               Admiral, U.S. Navy,\n     Commander.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       The Secretary of State,\n\n                                          Washington, May 5, 2003.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express support for the \n     President's FY2004 budget request to fund the feasibility and \n     cost study for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP), \n     and to repeal the FY1994 legislation that prohibits the \n     United States from conducting research and development on low \n     yield nuclear weapons. I do not believe that these \n     legislative steps will complicate our ongoing efforts with \n     North Korea. Inasmuch as work on the RNEP was authorized and \n     funded in last year's National Defense Authorization Act, I \n     believe that North Korea already has factored the RNEP into \n     its calculations and will not vary those calculations \n     depending on how Congress acts on this element of the FY2004 \n     budget request.\n       Thank you for your important work on these issues and \n     please do not hesitate to ask if I can be of further \n     assistance in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Colin L. Powell.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Many rogue nations have built and are continuing to build \nhard and deeply buried facilities to protect their most valuable assets \nsuch as their leadership, communications equipment, and facilities for \nthe manufacture of weapons of mass destruction. We know that \nconventional weapons cannot hold all of these targets at risk. A recent \nreport by the Congressional Research Service cited a DIA estimate of \nsome 1,400 known or suspected strategic underground facilities world \nwide. It further states that the only way to destroy them is with a \nstrong shock wave that travels through the ground.\n  The question that the Congress and the administration must now \ngrapple with is how to ensure the continued credibility of the Nation's \nnuclear deterrent into the 21st century. We must recognize that today's \nstockpile was designed and manufactured to deter the threat by the \nformer Soviet Union. As we all know, that threat no longer exists. \nToday, we are faced with a multi-dimensional challenge that requires a \ndifferent set of tools.\n  By repealing the ban on research and development of low-yield nuclear \nweapons, this does not mean the United States is about to resume \nnuclear weapons production. In fact, the United States has not \nmanufactured a new nuclear weapon for more than a decade. The advanced \nconcepts initiative merely allows the labs to explore the technical \nboundaries of providing solutions to new and emerging national security \nchallenges. Advanced concepts work will allow the labs to train the \nnext generation of scientists and engineers that the Nation will need \nto ensure a safe, secure and reliable nuclear deterrent.\n  The fear of the erosion of the firewall between the use of nuclear \nand conventional weapons use is another unfounded issue. During the \n1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, when U.S. tactical nuclear weapons were \ndeployed throughout the world and warfighting plans were in place, no \nU.S. nuclear weapons were ever used. We still maintain the policy that \nonly the President can authorize the use of nuclear weapons and there \nare no plans to change that very important policy, nor is there any \ndesire on the part of the Department of Defense to develop battlefield \nnuclear weapons to accomplish what our conventional weapons can already \ndo.\n  Now I will review the bill that is before us.\n  It states specifically in the legislation that nothing in the repeal \nmade by section A shall be construed as authorizing the testing, \nacquisition, or deployment of a low-yield nuclear weapon.\n  We are just talking about studying, thinking about low-yield nuclear \nweapons.\n  The key is if the U.S. President is faced with a situation so grave \nthat the use of nuclear weapons is considered, we must have a full \nsweep of options. Options in our current stockpile are very limited and \nwould result in a significant level of collateral damage if the nuclear \nweapon is required to resolve a crisis in terms of the best interests \nof the United States.\n  These are challenging times, but they are crucial times, important \ntimes, and it is important we make the right decision because the world \nis changing. We need to know that. We need to know what the parameters \nare as we move forward in determining what is best to protect America. \nTo have a provision in law that says you cannot study or think about \nall the options when you are looking at your vulnerabilities and where \nyou need to go to protect America is foolhardy.\n  I hope the Senate today will defeat the Kennedy-Feinstein amendment \nand at least allow for study and our scientists to think about various \nalternatives, including a low-yield nuclear weapon. I am here to ask my \ncolleagues in the Senate to join me in voting no on the Kennedy-\nFeinstein amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nRhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise in support of the Kennedy-Feinstein \namendment. First, we should explain the terminology better because \nthere is a suggestion implicit in many of the comments today that a \nlow-yield nuclear device is something akin to a big conventional \nweapon.\n  Nuclear weapons are sui generis, the most horrific weapon that man \nhas ever developed. Under this bill we remove a ban on the research and \ndevelopment, and therefore testing and deployment of so-called low-\nyield weapons, 5 kilotons or less.\n  Let me put that in perspective. The weapon dropped on Hiroshima was \n14 kilotons. The weapon dropped on Nagasaki was 21 kilotons. A 5-\nkiloton weapon, a 1-kiloton weapon, is a significant weapon causing \nsignificant damage.\n  When we talk about low-yield nuclear weapons, it is almost like \ntalking about a small apocalypse because nuclear weapons have \napocalyptic qualities in their destruction and in their fear.\n  As a result, for more than 50 years we have attempted to put them \nbeyond use. This language in this bill lowers that threshold \ndramatically. It says we will begin after a 10-year prohibition not \njust research, but this bill takes away the prohibition on developing, \nengineering, testing, and deploying weapons. Low-yield weapons. But \nagain, those low-yield weapons have fantastic power.\n  I heard some of my colleagues talk about the fact if we had such \nweapons\n\n[[Page S6681]]\n\nlike this we surely would have gotten Saddam Hussein. Dropping a \nweapon, even a ``low-yield nuclear weapon,'' in an urban area will \ncreate incredible collateral damage. Not as much, of course, as a 400-\nkiloton weapon but the damage is huge. In fact, Sidney Drell, a \nphysicist and arms control advocate, calculated that a 1-kiloton weapon \npenetrating at 40 feet, a penetrating type weapon, would create a \ncrater larger than the impact area at the World Trade Center and put \nabout 1 million cubic feet of radioactive material in the air. If we \nhad dropped such a weapon on Baghdad, we would not be in Baghdad today. \nOur troops would be ringing the city waiting for the radiation to clear \nand trying to minister to the civilians.\n\n  The notion we need these weapons for military purposes is \nunsubstantiated. There is no military requirement for a so-called low-\nyield nuclear weapon.\n  In testimony before the Armed Services Committee on April 8, 2003, \nAmbassador Brooks, the head of NNSA, testified after a question from \nBill Nelson:\n\n       Well, is there a requirement in your opinion for a new low \n     yield?\n       Ambassador Brooks: No.\n       Senator Bill Nelson. Is there a requirement for such a \n     weapon under consideration or being developed?\n       Ambassador Brooks: There is no requirement being developed. \n     To the best of my knowledge there is no requirement under \n     consideration. There is no military need for this weapon.\n\n  That is the testimony of the administration.\n  I am sure there are many people who would say yes, it is nice to \nstudy. There are lots of things that are nice to study. But without a \nmilitary requirement for such a weapon, why are we abandoning a \nsignificant prohibition that has aided, I believe, our efforts in \ntrying to tame or at least contain the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons?\n  It seems to me counterintuitive that one could argue, as I think some \nof my colleagues do, the way to stop the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons is to build more nuclear weapons. I don't think that makes \nsense.\n  There is a suggestion also throughout the discussion this afternoon \nthat this is just about research, nothing else. I was intrigued by this \nnotion and I asked Ambassador Brooks about it at a hearing. His initial \njustification for the language requested by the administration was it \nwould, in his words, ``remove the chilling effect on scientific inquiry \nthat could hamper our ability to maintain and exercise our intellectual \ncapabilities to respond to needs that one day might be articulated by \nthe President.''\n  I asked a very obvious question. Why didn't the administration simply \nsend up a modification to section 3136, the ban, simply to carve out \nlanguage that will allow research but still would maintain the \nprohibition against engineering, development, testing, and deployment? \nI said:\n\n       For example, the language could simply say: It shall be the \n     policy of the United States not to produce a low-yield \n     nuclear weapon, including precision low-yield nuclear weapon.\n\n  Ambassador Brooks replied to my query:\n\n       It is accurate that that would eliminate one of the \n     concerns I have with the language, though the language now \n     does have, we fear, a potentially chilling effect on R and, \n     as you described a possible modification, it might not. So \n     speaking narrowly from the prospect of trying to get a robust \n     advanced concept program working, language like that might be \n     entirely suitable.\n\n  But that is not what this legislation includes. Not a limited \nexception to research, but a categorical elimination of the ban on \nresearch, engineering, development, testing, deployment of so-called \nlow-yield nuclear weapons.\n  It is pretty clear here we are really not talking about just \nresearch. In fact, I hope this amendment of Senator Kennedy and Senator \nFeinstein passes. I support it. If it fails, I am prepared to offer \nlanguage that will, in fact, limit it just to research.\n  Now, we also heard before the committee that one of the reasons we \nneed this research project is so scientists can continue to work on it, \nmaintain their skills. It turns out if that is the case, there are \nplenty of opportunities with existing weapons in the inventory to go \nahead and hone those skills.\n  Even if such opportunities were not readily available, to give up a \nsignificant and recognized prohibition on at least one class of nuclear \nweapons simply to satisfy technical training would at least suggest to \nme that other ways should be found to train our scientists, and other \nways, I think, could be found to train the scientists.\n  There is also a perception, I think inherent in the discussions \nhere--and I have alluded to it in my initial comments--that the effect \nof one of these so-called low-yield weapons is that it will produce \nless collateral damage. That is true, but less than what? Less than the \nbomb at Hiroshima which, to my recollection, took over 100,000 lives. \nAre we willing to engage or use or tactically employ weapons that only \ntake, in one fell swoop, 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 lives and claim they \nare low yield and therefore innocuous? There is nothing innocuous about \nthe weapons we are talking about.\n  I believe very strongly that it is incumbent upon this Senate to \nmaintain the ban. I think it is wise policy. I think it is a policy \nthat has given us advantages as we have urged other nations to refrain \nfrom the development of nuclear weapons.\n  There are some discussions about whether arms control has succeeded \nor failed. I think many times we point to those cases in which \ncountries acquire nuclear weapons, but we fail to recognize the many \ninstances where countries have given up their nuclear weapons--such as \nseveral countries in the former Soviet Union like the Ukraine, Belarus \nand Kazakstan. Because of the spirit of the nonproliferation treaty and \nbecause of the efforts of the United States and other countries urging \nthat they become compliant with the nonproliferation treaty, these \ncountries voluntarily gave up nuclear weapons. I do not know that \ntoday, if they were watching what we are doing here, they would be so \neager to give up their nuclear weapons.\n  So we lose a great deal more than simply this language in the bill. I \nthink we lose a diplomatic advantage, in terms of the goal which I hope \nwe are still pursuing, which is the elimination, I hope, or certainly \nthe containment, of nuclear weapons.\n  I urge all my colleagues to think very clearly and to recall several, \nfor me, salient points. These are weapons of horrendous effect. Don't \nthink low-yield, think small apocalypse. These are weapons that have no \nmilitary requirement today.\n  What we do here will be emulated by other countries. That is the \nnature of world leadership. We have a chance to preserve at least this \naspect of arms control, which will give us the opportunity, I hope, to \nargue for even more, and more effective means of nonproliferation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Feinstein-Kennedy amendment.\n  I yield my time to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are now operating under a time \nagreement. We will have our distinguished colleague from Nevada here \nmomentarily. For the moment, let's put in a quorum call and this side \nwill bear the time on the quorum call because I see my two colleagues \nare engaged in a colloquy. So I observe the absence of a quorum and ask \nthat it be charged to this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield to the Senator from Nevada such time as he may \nrequire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the 1994 National Defense Authorization \nAct stipulated that:\n\n       It shall be the policy of the United States not to conduct \n     research and development which could lead to the production \n     by the United States of a new low-yield nuclear weapon, \n     including a precision low-yield warhead. The Secretary of \n     Energy may not conduct, or provide for the conduct of, \n     research and development which could lead to the production \n     by the United States of a low-yield nuclear weapon.\n\n  This legislation has been effective in preventing our nuclear weapon \nscientists from conducting any research into these low-yield nuclear \nweapons.\n\n[[Page S6682]]\n\n  I believe that repeal of the low-yield research and development \nprohibition is in the national interest. The National Security Strategy \noutlined in the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review included the long-term goal \nto maintain a strong nuclear deterrent with a smaller nuclear arsenal \nby utilizing missile defense and conventional strike capabilities. To \naccomplish this without putting U.S. safety or security at risk \nrequires that the Department of Defense and the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration be allowed to adapt and/or rebuild the existing \nnuclear stockpile to meet current and emerging threats.\n  The United States has deployed low-yield nuclear weapons throughout \nthe history of the stockpile and has them today. These weapons have \nenhanced nuclear deterrence by providing the President with credible \noptions for attacking targets of national importance. The existence of \nlow-yield weapons over the last 50 years has not blurred the nuclear \nthreshold and it is unlikely that future conceptual studies will \neither. Maintaining a strong research and development capability will, \nmore likely, assure our allies and dissuade and deter our adversaries.\n  The Department of Defense has important and emerging missions that \nlow-yield weapons can uniquely address. For example, low-yield weapons \nhave the potential to significantly reduce collateral effects and yet \nstill provide the high temperatures needed to destroy chemical and \nbiological agents stored in bunkers. The 1994 legislation has been a \nsignificant barrier to the advanced development program needed to study \nthis capability and other innovative technologies.\n  Maintaining a viable nuclear weapons enterprise is vital to both the \nNational Nuclear Security Administration and the Department of Defense. \nThe low-yield research and development prohibition has had a chilling \neffect on the ability of National Nuclear Security Administration \nscientists to respond to Department of Defense requirements and in \nfulfilling the goal of developing the responsive infrastructure needed \nto respond decisively to changes in the international security \nenvironment or to stockpile surprises.\n  The low-yield research and development prohibition has been called \n``a pillar of arms control'' by its supporters and its repeal a \npossible cause of increased global nuclear proliferation. However, \nnuclear proliferation occurred steadily throughout the 1990s. India, \nPakistan, North Korea and others have pursued active nuclear weapon \ndevelopment programs despite the United States self-imposed refrain \nfrom low-yield studies.\n  Repeal will not commit the United States to producing new or modified \nwarheads. Congressional approval is required prior to any full-scale \ndevelopment.\n  The Feinstein-Kennedy amendment would strike the repeal of the \nprohibition on research and development of low-yield nuclear weapons in \nthe defense authorization bill.\n  It should not be illegal to think of, or research, ways to defend \nAmerica. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Feinstein-Kennedy \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, how much time do I have available under the \nunanimous consent agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  Before I begin speaking in support of the Kennedy amendment, I would \nlike to make just one generic point. I find it fascinating that the \nUnited States of America, of all countries in the world, feels the need \nto increase its nuclear arsenal at this moment--low-yield, high-yield, \nno-yield, any yield.\n  It is fascinating that, at this moment in the world's history, in our \nrelative strength and power, we are the ones who think we need another \nnuclear weapon in our arsenal. But that is just, as a friend of mine \nnamed Arlen Mekler used to say, a random thought.\n  Let me get to the heart of this. I obviously support the Feinstein-\nKennedy amendment which would keep the 1993 Spratt-Furse amendment in \nplace. That amendment, as we all know, bans all work on low-yield \nnuclear weapons, those with a yield below 5 kilotons. We had a lot of \nreasons to do that. It is sometimes useful to remember why we did these \nthings in the first place. I might add we enacted that amendment at a \ntime when the Russians had a whole heck of a lot more weapons than \nexist now; at a time when things were actually a little more dangerous, \nwhen our vulnerability to nuclear attack was greater than it is today.\n  But the question now is, Why should we oppose the repeal of that ban? \nAfter all, section 3131 states:\n\n       Nothing in the repeal . . . shall be construed as \n     authorizing, testing, acquisition, or development of a low-\n     yield nuclear weapon.\n\n  So why stop our nuclear weapons labs from just thinking about these \nlow-yield weapons?\n  One answer is that the current law doesn't restrict research and \nearly development on these low-yield weapons. It only prohibits later \nstages of development and engineering that are geared toward the \nproduction of low-yield nuclear weapons.\n  Obviously, what we would do by lifting this ban is to be in the \nposition of being able to move toward production of those weapons, a \nnotion that will not be lost on the rest of the world.\n  The other answer is that low-yield nuclear weapons are not like \nregular ones. Regular nuclear weapons are designed to deter \nadversaries. The massive destruction and civilian casualties that they \ncan cause make nuclear weapons unlike even other weapons of mass \ndestruction. Low-yield nuclear weapons are different. They bridge the \ngap between conventional weapons and the city-busting weapons of the \ncold war, and they offer the lure of a better way to destroy point \ntargets. Supporters of low-yield weapons argue they could deter an \nadversary, and that is true. All nuclear weapons have a deterrent \nfunction. But the deterrent benefits that low-yield weapons provide are \nfar outweighed by both the risk that they will actually be used and the \ndangerous signal they send to other countries, whether intentional or \nnot, that we intend to fight a nuclear war.\n  Low-yield weapons also blur the distinction between nuclear and \nconventional war, and they begin to make nuclear war more \n``thinkable,'' as Herman Kahn might have said. Herman Kahn's book was \ntitled ``Thinking About the Unthinkable.'' He understood that nuclear \nwar was unthinkable, even as he demanded that we think about how to \nfight one, if we had to.\n  Looking at the foreign defense policies of the current \nadministration, I fear they fail to understand that very vital point. \nThey want to make nuclear war ``thinkable.'' Section 3131 of this bill \ncould make it ``thinkable'' that we could use these low-yield weapons--\nas if we needed to have these low-yield nuclear weapons, despite the \noverwhelming conventional deterrent we have. Had we had them, I wonder \nif anyone might have suggested that we use these low-yield nuclear \nweapons that we may produce against any of the bunkers Saddam Hussein \nwas in. I am sure we could hear a voice today that if we had a low-\nyield nuclear weapon, we could have used it that first night and \nguaranteed he was gone. The fact that we would have been the only \ncountry for the second time in world history to use a nuclear weapon, \nin this case unlike the first, without any real need, would have been \nlost on some people. But, I wonder what that message that would have \nsent to India and Pakistan, which are cheek to jowl with nuclear \ncapability.\n  The administration's failure, in my view, to understand that nuclear \nis still ``unthinkable'' is, I think, the most fatal flaw in this \napproach. That failure to understand could lead to bigger failures--a \nfailure to understand how to keep other countries from developing \nnuclear weapons, a failure to view nonproliferation as a vital and a \nworkable policy objective, and perhaps even a failure to avoid nuclear \nwar which would do horrible damage to any country involved, including \nourselves.\n\n  Consider what the administration has said regarding nuclear weapons. \nWe parse out what the administration says a piece at a time. I don't \nthink we understand that the rest of the world, friend and foe alike, \ntakes it in its total context. Let us look at the whole range of what \nthey have said so far about nuclear weapons.\n  The Nuclear Posture Review of December 2001 spoke of reducing U.S. \nreliance on nuclear weapons. But it also\n\n[[Page S6683]]\n\nreportedly listed not only Russia and China but also North Korea, Iraq, \nIran, Syria, and Libya as potential enemies in a nuclear war with the \nuse of nuclear weapons. I emphasize ``reportedly listed''--I have not \nlooked at the classified document. I am referring to what has been \nprinted on the Web and what has been in the press. The Nuclear Posture \nReview spoke of possibly needing to develop and test new types of \nnuclear weapons, and gave that as a reason for increasing our nuclear \ntest readiness, and further said nuclear weapons might be used to \nneutralize chemical and biological agents.\n  More recently, civilian Pentagon leaders ordered a task force to \nconsider possible requirements for new low-yield nuclear weapons, even \nwhile assuring the Senate that no formal requirement has yet been \nestablished.\n  A Presidential strategy document reportedly stated the United States \nmight use nuclear weapons against a country with chemical or biological \nweapons. Then, in a runup to the war in Iraq, the administration \nproclaimed (but never explained) a new doctrine of preemption against \nany potential foe that acquired weapons of mass destruction.\n  All that taken individually is understandable. Taken collectively, it \ncould give someone a very foreboding picture. And do those statements \nincrease our leverage over potential foes, and with a world community \nat large, or do they only give the rogue states the argument that they \nreally are threatened and, therefore, really need nuclear weapons? Do \nour statements enable the rest of the world to ``blame the victim,'' as \nthe neo-conservatives would say--and I would agree with them on the \noutrageousness of that--instead of blaming those responsible for \nsetting disorder in motion?\n  If you are North Korea, or Iran, or Libya, or Syria, which part of \nthe reports I just referenced are you likely to rely on to make your \nspecious case to the rest of the world?\n  We have seen the willingness of the rest of the world to engage in \nthe suspension of disbelief. As a friend of mine said, never \nunderestimate the ability of the human mind to rationalize. We have \nseen our friends, from the French on, rationalize why we shouldn't do \nwhat needs to be done.\n  Which part of the administration's strategy statements, which I \nbriefly outlined, do you think the bad guys--North Korea, Iran, Libya, \nand Syria--are likely to rely on? The part where we say we reduce our \nreliance on nuclear bombs, or the part that names those countries as a \npossible target for nuclear preemption?\n  As long as you are already listed on the possible target list, what \nare you going to say, and what are you going to do? Obviously, they are \ngoing to say, ``We have to do this because of what the United States is \ndoing.''\n\n  There is no one in the world who doubts our capacity to annihilate, \nby conventional weapons alone, any other country in the world. There is \nno doubt in anyone's mind. And now we are saying that for our defense, \nwe need another nuclear weapon. How do you think the world will \ninterpret that? Some will say it doesn't matter what the rest of the \nworld thinks. But it surely matters, in 1,000 different ways, whether \nit is a matter of deciding you will not let us sell chickens in your \ncountry or deciding whether you will allow businessmen to operate in \nyour country or deciding whether you will cooperate in any other 500 \nways we need cooperation on.\n  What do our statements say, if you are North Korea or Libya or \nanywhere else? Do you say the United States is getting a low-yield \nnuclear weapon, so it is time we gave up our efforts to get nuclear \nweapons? Or if you think we are getting a low-yield nuclear weapon, \nmight you decide it is time to accelerate your efforts?\n  So far we have one clear answer, from North Korea. It is not the one \nwe wanted. Iran appears to be accelerating its nuclear weapons program \nas well. I am not suggesting they would not be doing that if we weren't \nenunciating the policies of this administration. I suspect they would \nanyway.\n  The whole question here is, How do we keep dangerous weapons, \nparticularly nuclear weapons, out of the hands of the most dangerous \npeople in the world, be they terrorists or those who would support \nthem? That is our policy; that is the President's policy; and I agree \nwith it. But obviously, we haven't quite gotten it right. So far, I \ndon't think the administration has the answer to the question of how to \nachieve our objectives.\n  For a while, it seemed as though the administration's answer was to \ndeclare war on every adversary that dared to go nuclear. But do we \nreally intend to go to war with North Korea, if the price is the \nslaughter of hundreds of thousands of South Korean civilians? Do we \nintend to go to war with Iran, when we cannot guarantee security in \nIraq?\n  The list of countries that we accuse of having weapons of mass \ndestruction is long; will we take them all on? And what do we do when \nIndian officials cite our Iraq war arguments as justification for a \npossible Indian attack on Pakistan that could risk a nuclear war? Is \nthis the world we want?\n  The Administration has refused to negotiate directly with North \nKorea, so we have yet to really test North Korea's claim that it would \nbe prepared to meet all our security concerns in return for truly \nnormal relations with us. Instead, we have demanded that North Korea \nfirst renounce its nuclear programs and take tangible steps to \ndismantle them.\n  I sympathize with the concern not to be bullied or blackmailed. \nNobody likes to be seen as backing down. I even sympathize with the \nPresident's intense dislike of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. There \nis much to dislike in the man, and even more to dislike in his regime.\n  But what have we achieved through this policy? So far, we have gotten \nthe end of the 1994 Agreed Framework--which had kept North Korea from \nreprocessing more of its spent nuclear fuel to get plutonium for \nnuclear weapons. We have seen international inspectors kicked out of \nNorth Korea. And now North Korea may be reprocessing its spent nuclear \nfuel, which could give it enough material for a half dozen more nuclear \nweapons.\n  We may be making some progress, with China engaging North Korea. If \nwe are lucky, North Korea's posturing will lead China and Russia to \nfinally support us and bring some pressure on North Korea. But we don't \nknow whether they can really influence a North Korea that sees itself \nalready in the American crosshairs as part of the ``axis of evil.''\n  The administration talks of stopping North Korea from exporting its \nnuclear weapons. That worries me a little bit because it implies we \nhave already given up on stopping them from producing them.\n  And North Korea could just export plutonium with which to make \nnuclear weapons; they will be able to become the plutonium factory of \nthe world if they keep on the road they are on now. How are we going to \nstop that? The plutonium needed for a nuclear weapon can fit in a \nbriefcase. It does not even need much shielding because it is not very \nradioactive. The whole shipment might be bigger than a bread box, as \nSteve Allen used to say, but it wouldn't be much bigger. It certainly \nwouldn't be bigger than a trash can. Can we really stop and search \nevery trash can leaving North Korea? What will we do if a year from now \nNorth Korea claims to have provided weapons plutonium to groups in \nother countries that will destroy major cities unless we do what \nit wants?\n\n  What are we going to do about Iran, which has North Korean medium-\nrange missiles and is moving toward the ability to enrich its own \nuranium?\n  Nobody ever said that nonproliferation was easy. I don't have a \nsilver bullet, and I don't expect the President to have one either. But \ndon't we have to keep our eye on the ball? When conservatives opposed \nthe Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, they said countries would \nbuild nuclear weapons for their own strategic reasons. That's right. It \nmeans if we want to prevent proliferation, or roll it back, we have to \naffect those strategic calculations.\n  Nonproliferation policy gives us a framework for those efforts. The \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty gives us international support and may \naffect the calculations of countries whose neighbors sign and obey the \ntreaty. The Nuclear Suppliers Group buys us more time by restricting \nexports of nuclear and dual-use materials and equipment. But in the \nend, it still comes\n\n[[Page S6684]]\n\ndown to influencing a country's strategic calculations.\n  How can we influence those countries? Deterrence is one big way to \ninfluence them. Any country that builds nuclear weapons knows if they \nuse them on us, they will very quickly cease to exist. But deterrence \nis still a mind game. It didn't help when the administration belittled \ndeterrence in order to press its case for missile defense. And \ndeterrence may not work if we say: By the way, we may still target you, \neven if you don't build nuclear weapons.\n  For countries that are not our enemies, security assurances are a big \nway to influence them. The U.S. nuclear umbrella offers a country a lot \nof security at a low cost; but that umbrella may not look so good if \nthe United States is threatening nuclear war against a large number of \ncountries. At that point, our friends may question whether we will \nreally be able to protect them, when we are taking on all those other \ncountries. That is the question you hear people asking in Japan.\n  To achieve lasting nonproliferation, we must treat the regional \nquarrels that drive countries to seek nuclear weapons. We did that with \nArgentina and Brazil. As South Africa moved away from apartheid, we \nwere able to do that there as well. We are making a real effort to help \nIndia and Pakistan step back from the brink and have to continue that \neffort. But we also have to address security concerns in east Asia, \nincluding North Korea's concerns, if we are to keep that whole region \nfrom developing nuclear weapons, weaponizing the peninsula, and Japan \nbecoming a nuclear power. We have to pursue peace in the Middle East, \nif we are truly going to take advantage of our military victory in \nIraq.\n  Nor is there really any alternative to working with the international \ncommunity. We don't have the ability to inspect sites in Iran; the \nAtomic Energy Agency does have that ability. Our forces in Iraq don't \nhave a great record in their hunt for weapons of mass destruction; the \nIAEA and the U.N. could help in that hunt, both by providing detailed \ninformation from past inspections and by helping to monitor sites they \nhave visited in the past.\n\n  We cannot close down proliferation traffic by ourselves. The \ncooperation of other countries, especially Russia and China, is \nessential.\n  These are the paths to nonproliferation. They are long and difficult. \nWe don't know whether they will succeed, but we can see where we want \nto go, and we can see how working these issues will help us get there.\n  But building low-yield nuclear weapons is not a path to \nnonproliferation; neither is a program to do R on such weapons, while \nDefense Department officials tell people to come up with reasons to \nbuild them; neither is a program to test these weapons, which would \nsurely be necessary to develop a new low-yield weapon, and which would \njust as surely be the death knell not only of the Comprehensive Nuclear \nTest-Ban Treaty--which I think is the objective of some--but of the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the NPT.\n  Frankly, neither is nonproliferation served by the administration's \nplan to field a nearly worthless missile defense system in Alaska next \nyear, just so the President can say he did it. The push to deploy that \nsystem has been at the expense of making an effective defense. The \ndefense will lack the radar it needs for several years, and the space-\nbased infrared collection it needs for even more years. And the funds \nand equipment to deploy it are coming out of the funds and equipment \nneeded to test it, to improve it, and to make sure it works. You have \nto wonder what the administration's priorities are.\n  The path of deterrence, security assurance, nonproliferation, \ndiplomacy, and sensible weapons development is difficult, but at least \nit is headed in the right direction.\n  The path of hasty deployment of a missile defense that cannot be \nuseful for years to come is simply foolish. The path of new nuclear \nweapons, new nuclear testing, and looking at nuclear weapons as \nsomething ``normal'' may be a highway paved with good intentions, but \nas the nuns used to make me write on the board after school when I \nmisbehaved: The road to Hell is paved with good intentions.\n  This is a road to disaster. We should know better than to go down it.\n  The Feinstein-Kennedy amendment, in my view, will keep us off that \ndangerous highway. It deserves our support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Feinstein, Senator Kennedy and others on low-yield \nnuclear weapons.\n  The Defense Authorization bill would repeal the ban on research and \ndevelopment of low-yield nuclear weapons, sometimes called ``mini-\nnukes.''\n  The ban, known as the Spratt-Furse Amendment, was enacted in 1993. \nThat law prohibits ``research and development which could lead to the \nproduction by the United States of a low-yield nuclear weapon.'' It \neven has specific exemptions, including allowing research on existing \nweapons and research to address proliferation concerns.\n  To state it plainly, this is not about basic research or defensive \nresearch. This is about research and development to produce new nuclear \nweapons. And since these weapons would have yields of less than 5 \nkilotons of TNT, these are not strategic weapons.\n  That means that if we pass this bill without adopting the Feinstein \namendment, we are heading down the path of developing new, low-yield, \ntactical nuclear weapons. And you can bet that if we develop these \nweapons on the drawing board, we will see a demand to build and test \nthese weapons to be sure that they would work. Why would we build these \nmini-nukes if we don't intend to use them?\n  We don't need to go down that path. America has the strongest \nmilitary in the world. We also have a huge arsenal of strategic nuclear \nweapons, which can strike anywhere in the world, for deterrence. We \ndon't need tactical nuclear weapons, not even to strike buried targets \nlike bunkers. We have conventional weapons to do that. Our scientists \nare developing better weapons all the time. I am so proud of the \nbrilliant people at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Indian Head, \nMaryland, who developed and produced the ``bunker-buster'' thermobaric \nbombs used against caves in Afghanistan. But the bottom line is that \nAmerica doesn't need new nuclear weapons.\n  I don't want to go down that path because it is destabilizing and \ndangerous to America's national security.\n  Why is it so dangerous?\n  It would signal that the U.S. would no longer use nuclear weapons \nonly for deterrence. That would legitimize nuclear weapons and increase \nthe risk that they'll be used against us or our allies. If we move to \ntesting of nuclear weapons, other nations would almost surely follow \nour lead.\n  Increasing the range and number of weapons in our nuclear arsenal \nwould fundamentally undermine our nuclear nonproliferation efforts, \nincluding the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, NPT. That would mean \nmore countries developing and deploying nuclear weapons.\n  The production of small nuclear weapons, some of which could even be \nportable or easily transported in a truck, poses a particular danger. \nEven if the U.S. would effectively safeguard such weapons, other \ncountries might develop similar weapons. The presence of a large but \nunknown number of tactical nuclear weapons in Russia poses one of the \ngreatest dangers to our national security. If we are concerned about \nterrorists getting nuclear bombs, the last thing we should do is \ndevelop more small, easily-transported weapons.\n  America's national security will best be served if we keep in place \nthe existing ban on research and development leading to production of \nlow-yield nuclear weapons. I urge my colleagues to join me in support \nof this amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, for more than half a century, our world has \nlived under the specter of a nuclear Armageddon. The end of the cold \nwar has reduced this threat, but both the United States and Russia \ncontinue to be armed to the teeth, each side possessing many thousands \nof nuclear weapons, any one of which could devastate an innocent city.\n  During the cold war, both Democratic and Republican Presidents held \nout the chance that an end to the nuclear arms race could lead to the \nrenunciation of nuclear weapons. I point\n\n[[Page S6685]]\n\nto article VI of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, signed by \nPresident Nixon in 1968, and ratified by the Senate in 1969: ``Each of \nthe Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good \nfaith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms \nrace at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a Treaty on \ngeneral and complete disarmament under strict and effective \ninternational control.''\n  But the United States is no longer striving for a world free of \nnuclear weapons. The administration now seeks to develop a new \ngeneration of nuclear weapons, from bunker-busting hydrogen bombs that \ncould wipe out a buried cache of arms, and a whole city with it, to \nlow-yield mini-nukes, which could even take the form of the suitcase \nnuclear weapons that are the worst case scenario for our homeland \nsecurity planners.\n  The alarm at the development of these new weapons is underscored by \nthe Nuclear Posture Review, released in January 2002, and the National \nSecurity Strategy, released in September 2002. Taken together, these \ndocuments envisage a United States that could strike anywhere on the \nglobe with overwhelming force. The Nuclear Posture Review, in \nparticular, moves breathlessly from discussions of conventional weapons \nto strategizing on the use of nuclear weapons.\n  The unavoidable conclusion is that the administration seeks to \nreduce, and perhaps eliminate, the difference between conventional and \nnuclear weapons.\n  A new reliance on nuclear weapons for our national security can only \nlead us to greater dangers. CIA Director George Tenet warned the Armed \nServices Committee on February 12, 2003, that the ``domino theory of \nthe 21st century may well be nuclear.'' We must heed this warning.\n  One powerless country after another may seek to develop the most \nextreme weapon of mass destruction in order to assure its security, \nfearing an imminent, preemptive attack from the world's only \nsuperpower, which views itself as being unconstrained by international \nlaw, the U.N. Security Council, or the court of world opinion.\n  Rather than attempt to head off this destabilizing trend, this \nadministration has recast its preemptive war as a liberation of the \noppressed, threatened to find ways to punish allies who opposed our \nbelligerency, and proposed the development of new nuclear weapons.\n  If we do not wish to be in a state of perpetual war, the United \nStates must recapture its standing as a peacemaker. Let us step back \nfrom the brink of a nuclear arms race. Moving forward with new bunker-\nbusting and low-yield nuclear weapons can only send us in the wrong \ndirection. I urge my colleagues to reject the moves by this \nadministration to initiate new nuclear arms programs.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that under the \nagreement we are now working, the time for Senator Boxer be given to \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy. So instead of 5 minutes, \nhe has 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing the vote this evening on the Feinstein-Kennedy amendment, \nSenator Reed be recognized in order to offer an amendment on the \nsubject of low-level nuclear weapons; provided further that immediately \nfollowing the reporting of that amendment, Senator Warner be recognized \nto offer a second-degree amendment; provided further that following any \ndebate with respect to the amendments this evening, the amendments be \ntemporarily set aside, and when the Senate resumes consideration of the \nbill tomorrow morning, there will be 20 minutes equally divided for \ndebate between Senator Warner and Senator Reed. Finally, I ask that \nfollowing the use of that time, the Senate proceed to a vote in \nrelation to the Warner second-degree amendment, and that if the \namendment is agreed to, then the underlying amendment be agreed to, as \namended.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to proceed on this side for \nabout 5 or 6 minutes and then we will rotate. I must say, I express my \npleasure at the cooperation we are receiving on both sides of the \naisle, particularly from our Members with regard to amendments. I might \nsay there is a colleague on that side of the aisle who has a very \nmeritorious commitment to be at a certain place at 7:45, and it is a \nfamily matter. We are going to try to yield back time on our side to \naccommodate the colleague on the other side. I am not announcing the \ntime exactly, but I hope it can come about at about 7:42 or 7:43, \nenabling him to meet a very serious matter relating to his children. We \nare going to make that work; is that correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are going to do our best. While the Senator is \nspeaking, I will talk to Senator Kennedy and Senator Feinstein.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think I will only need 3 \\1/2\\ or 4 minutes, if we are \ntrying to accommodate somebody.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am willing to cut my time down as well. I haven't talked \nto Senator Feinstein, who has already cut her time down.\n  Mr. WARNER. We are providing flexibility to my colleague from \nMichigan to try to make it work.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important that in the Record of this \ndebate there at least be one statement, if I may say, on behalf of the \nSenator from Virginia which enables the reader of the Record to \ndetermine with ease exactly what the debate is about. For that purpose, \nI will make a broad unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following material be \nprinted in the Record: First, the existing law passed in 1994, which is \nthe subject of the debate we are now having. That is to be followed by \nthe submission of the Department of Defense as to the rationale for \nremoving this particular law. That is to be followed by the manner in \nwhich we did it in the Armed Services Committee--it is a copy of the \nbill section. That is to be followed by correspondence received by the \nSenator from Virginia, first from the Secretary of State in which he \nexpresses his opinion in regard to the amendment; and then the \nstatement by Admiral Ellis, Commander of the Strategic Command, stating \nhis support for the work done by the committee. That is to be followed \nby a letter from General Jumper, expressing his support for the work \ndone by the committee. Then I have listed as a matter of convenience \nfor my colleagues the seven steps that are taken, traditionally, with \nrespect to nuclear weapons.\n  That is the information relevant to this debate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Existing Law Passed in 1994\n\n     SEC. 3136. PROHIBITION ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF LOW-\n                   YIELD NUCLEAR WEAPONS.\n\n       (a) United States Policy.--It shall be the policy of the \n     United States not to conduct research and development which \n     could lead to the production by the United States of a new \n     low-yield nuclear weapon, including a precision low-yield \n     warhead.\n       (b) Limitation.--The Secretary of Energy may not conduct, \n     or provide for the conduct of, research and development which \n     could lead to the production by the United States of a low-\n     yield nuclear weapon which, as of the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, has not entered production.\n       (c) Effect on Other Research and Development.--Nothing in \n     this section shall prohibit the Secretary of Energy from \n     conducting, or providing for the conduct of, research and \n     development necessary--\n       (1) to design a testing device that has a yield of less \n     than five kilotons;\n       (2) to modify an existing weapon for the purpose of \n     addressing safety and reliability concerns; or\n       (3) to address proliferation concerns.\n       (d) Definition.--In this section, the term ``low-yield \n     nuclear weapon'' means a nuclear weapon that has a yield of \n     less than five kilotons.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       Subtitle C--Other Matters\n\n       Section 221. Section 3136, the so-called PLYWD legislation, \n     prohibits the Secretary of Energy from conducting any \n     research and development which could potentially lead to the \n     production by the United States of a new low-yield nuclear \n     weapon, including a precision low-yield warhead.\n       This legislation has negatively affected U.S. Government \n     efforts to support the national strategy to counter WMD and \n     undercuts efforts that could strengthen our ability to deter, \n     or respond to, new or emerging threats.\n       A revitalized nuclear weapons advanced concepts effort is \n     essential to: (1) train the\n\n[[Page S6686]]\n\n     next generation of nuclear weapons scientists and engineers; \n     and (2) restore a nuclear weapons enterprise able to respond \n     rapidly and decisively to changes in the international \n     security environment or unforeseen technical problems in the \n     stockpile. PLYWD has had a ``chilling effect'' on this effort \n     by impeding the ability of our scientists and engineers to \n     explore the full range of technical options. It does not \n     simply prohibit research on new, low-yield warheads, but \n     prohibits any activities ``which could potentially lead to \n     production by the United States'' of such a warhead.\n       It is prudent national security policy not to foreclose \n     exploration of technical options that could strengthen our \n     ability to deter, or respond to, new or emerging threats. In \n     this regard, the Congressionally-mandated Nuclear Posture \n     Review urged exploration of weapons concepts that could offer \n     greater capabilities for precision, earth penetration (to \n     hold at risk deeply buried and hardened bunkers), defeat of \n     chemical and biological agents, and reduced collateral \n     damage. The PLYWD legislation impedes this effort.\n       Repeal of PLYWD, however, falls far short of committing the \n     United States to developing, producing, and deploying new, \n     low-yield warheads. Such warhead concepts could not proceed \n     to full-scale development, much less production and \n     deployment, unless Congress authorizes and appropriates the \n     substantial funds required to do this.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Subtitle B--Program Authorizations, Restrictions, and Limitations\n\n     SEC. 3131.

John Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express support for the \n     President's FY2004 budget request to fund the feasibility and \n     cost study for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP), \n     and to repeal the FY1994 legislation that prohibits the \n     United States from conducting research and development on low \n     yield nuclear weapons. I do not believe that these \n     legislative steps will complicate our ongoing efforts with \n     North Korea. Inasmuch as work on the RNEP was authorized and \n     funded in last year's National Defense Authorization Act, I \n     believe that North Korea already has factored the RNEP into \n     its calculations and will not vary those calculations \n     depending on how Congress acts on this element of the FY2004 \n     budget request.\n       Thank you for your important work on these issues and \n     please do not hesitate to ask if I can be of further \n     assistance in the future.\n            Sincerely,\n     Colin L.

John W. Warner,\n     Chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee, Russell Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman, The Nuclear Posture Review put in motion \n     a major change in the role of our nuclear forces. As we \n     continue to strategize the most effective methods of \n     addressing new and emerging threats to our National Security, \n     it is an inherent responsibility of the Department of Defense \n     to not only reevaluate the capabilities of our nuclear \n     arsenal, but to thoroughly analyze the potential of advanced \n     concepts that could enhance our overall deterrent posture.\n       U.S. Strategic Command is interested in conducting rigorous \n     studies of all new technologies, and examining the merits of \n     precision, increased penetration, and reduced yields for our \n     nuclear weapons. The nation needs to understand the technical \n     capabilities of threats under development by potential \n     adversaries and to thoroughly explore the range of options \n     available to the United States to deter or defeat them. Once \n     we complete the precise engineering analyses necessary to \n     validate facts related to nascent advanced concepts, the \n     results of the research will enable dispassionate, fact-based \n     discussions on very important defense and policy issues.\n       The findings of the Nuclear Posture Review were strongly \n     endorsed by the Service Chiefs. Repealing Section 3136 of \n     Fiscal Year 1994 NDAA (42 U.S.C. 2121) will allow U.S. \n     Strategic Command the ability to evaluate the full range of \n     advanced concepts through research and development \n     activities.\n       Your support in repealing the prohibition on low-yield \n     research and development for nuclear weapons is greatly \n     appreciated. A similar letter has been sent to the Ranking \n     Member of your committee.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   J.O. Ellis,\n\n                                               Admiral, U.S. Navy,\n     Commander.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Department of the Air Force,\n\n\n                                 Office of the Chief of Staff,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 8, 2003.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman, I seek your support for repealing \n     Section 3136 of the Fiscal Year 1994 National Defense \n     Authorization Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 2121). This section of the \n     law, commonly referred to as the Precision Low-Yield Weapon \n     Development (PLYWD) limitation, prohibits the Department of \n     Energy and by extension the Air Force from conducting any \n     research and development on a new nuclear weapon design with \n     a yield of five kilotons or less.\n       Research and development of new low-yield weapon concepts \n     is required in order to evaluate all potential options to \n     meet current and emerging combatant commanders' requirements. \n     Low-yield nuclear weapons currently in the stockpile simply \n     are not suited to satisfy all these requirements.\n       We are pursuing full rescission of this section of the law \n     instead of just an amendment. A partial repeal that only \n     permits basic research and development with no prospect for \n     production would effectively have the same impact as the \n     current law.\n       A similar letter has been sent to the Ranking Minority \n     Member of your Committee and to the Chairman and Ranking \n     Minority Member of the House Armed Services Committee.\n           Sincerely\n\n                                               John P. Jumper,\n\n                                                    General, USAF,\n     Chief of Staff.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             Nuclear Weapons Life Cycle Management Process\n\n       Phase 1--Concept Study.\n       Phase 2--Feasibility Study.\n       Phase 2A--Design Definition & Cost Study.\n       Phase 3--Full Scale Engineering Development.\n       Phase 4--Production Engineering.\n       Phase 5--First Production.\n       Phase 6--Quantity Production & Stockpile Maintenance \n     Evaluation.\n       Phase 7--Retirement & Dismantlement.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment.\n  Research on precision low-yield nuclear weapon design is prudent in \ntoday's national security environment. Why would we want to prevent any \ntype of research on weapons that might contribute to improving our \nnational security? Authorizing the research does not authorize the \nproduction, testing, or deployment of a low-yield nuclear weapon. \nCongress reserves the right to decide that as a separate matter, should \nsuch a step be requested by this or any future Administration.\n  I have received three letters on this matter: two from top military \nleaders, Admiral James Ellis, Commander of U.S. Strategic Command and \nGeneral John Jumper, Chief of Staff to the U.S. Air Force, and one from \nSecretary of State Colin Powell. All three of these distinguished \nleaders urged support for repealing the ban on low-yield nuclear \nweapons research.\n  In the current international environment, with many new unexpected \nthreats, it is prudent to allow research on low-yield nuclear weapons \nto learn whether such weapons could add to the deterrent value of our \nnuclear force. A repeal of the ban on low-yield nuclear weapons \nresearch and development would permit the scientists and engineers at \nour national laboratories to consider whether these types of weapons \nare feasible and for what purpose. For instance, could such a weapon \ndestroy a laboratory with biological and chemical agents without \ndisbursing them as a conventional weapon would do? What would be the \ncollateral effect?\n  I do not agree with those who assert that even allowing this research \nto go forward would undermine our nuclear non-proliferation efforts. \nThe United States is steadfast in its determination to prevent nuclear \nproliferation through many means including diplomacy, multilateral \nregimes to control the export of sensitive technologies, and \ninterdiction of illegal exports. The U.S. also has a proven record of \nnuclear reductions.\n  Secretary Colin Powell confirmed this view in his letter sent to me \non May 5th, 2003. In that letter, Secretary Powell stated: ``I do not \nbelieve [repealing the ban on low-yield nuclear weapons research and \ndevelopment] will complicate our ongoing efforts with North Korea.''\n  Over the past decade--while the current prohibition on this type of \nresearch has been in place--the United States has taken thousands of \nnuclear weapons out of the active stockpile, abided by a moratorium on \nunderground nuclear tests, designed no new nuclear weapons, and \nrefrained from research on low-yield nuclear weapons.\n  Some might argue that these activities served the purpose of \nencouraging\n\n[[Page S6687]]\n\nother countries not to develop or proliferate nuclear weapons. But \nlet's examine the record.\n  Over the past decade, India and Pakistan tested nuclear weapons for \nthe first time. Other nations have continued to seek nuclear weapons \ncapabilities, including Iraq, Iran and North Korea. And many nation are \npursing chemical and biological weapons capabilities. I believe this \nshows that other nations make decisions about whether or not to acquire \nnuclear and other WMD capabilities based on their assessment of their \nown national security need--not based on U.S. action in this area. The \nargument that some make that if U.S. refrains from certain types of \nactivities, others will follow, just does not stand the test of time.\n  Some would also argue the authorizing of this research would lower \nthe nuclear threshold. I disagree. As Ambassador Linton Brooks, \nAdministrator of the Nuclear Security Administration, testified before \nthe Strategic Forces Subcommittee, on April 8, 2003, the ``[n]uclear \nthreshold is awesomely high.'' If wars of the future are about winning \nhearts and minds, about liberating rather than conquering, then the \nthreshold for using nuclear weapons remains very high indeed. But as \nlong as we maintain a nuclear deterrence force, we would be remiss if \nwe did not keep it safe, secure and reliable, and if we did not \nmaintain our research capabilities both for ourselves and to understand \nwhat other countries might be exploring.\n  It is worth noting that the United States had a large number of low-\nyield nuclear weapons in our inventory during the '50s, '60s, and '70s \nwhich have now been removed from the inventory. During each of these \ndecades there were significant national security challenges to the \nUnited States. None of those challenges came close to reaching the \nnuclear threshold, notwithstanding the availability of low-yield \nnuclear weapons.\n  We have a responsibility to ensure the safety and security of all \nAmericans. We should not place artificial limits on the intellectual \nwork of our gifted scientists to explore new technologies, to \nunderstand what is possible as well as what potential adversaries could \nbe exploring. Should threats emerge which cannot be deterred or \ndestroyed with conventional weapons, our President must have other \noptions available to protect the citizens of the United States, our \ninterests and our allies. This has been the policy of the United States \nfor almost sixty years.\n  The provision in the Senate bill merely permits the research that \nwill inform future decisions as to whether such weapons would enhance \nthe national security of our country overall. It does not prejudice how \nCongress would decide that question in the future. Let us not fear \ngreater knowledge to inform our future decisions.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this issue is as clear as any issue ever \ngets. You are either for nuclear war or you are not. Either you want to \nmake it easier to start using nuclear weapons or you don't.\n  Our conventional weapons already have vast power and accuracy. We can \nmake them even more powerful. No one at the Pentagon and no one in the \nadministration has given us any examples--none at all--of cases where a \nsmaller nuclear weapon is needed to do what a conventional weapon \ncannot do.\n  For half a century, our policy has been to do everything we possibly \ncan to prevent nuclear war, and so far we have succeeded. The \nhardliners say things are different today: A nuclear war won't be so \nbad if we just make the nukes a little smaller. We will call them mini-\nnukes. They are not real nukes. A little nuclear war is OK.\n  That is nonsense. Nuclear war is nuclear war is nuclear war. We don't \nwant it anywhere, anytime, anyplace. Make no mistake, a mini-nuke is \nstill a nuke. Is half of Hiroshima OK? Is a quarter of Hiroshima OK? Is \na little mushroom cloud OK? That is absurd.\n\n  The issue is too important. If we build it, we will use it. No \nCongress should be the Congress that says let's start down this street \nwhen it is a one-way street that can lead only to nuclear war.\n  Some may say that smaller weapons are less dangerous than the larger \nweapons already in our arsenal. But these nuclear weapons are actually \nmore dangerous, because they are smaller, therefore easier to steal and \nsmuggle. The Administration's goal is to make them more usable by \nlowering the thresholds for the first use of nuclear weapons.\n  Some may say we can't build new weapons, and haven't built them in \nyears. To that I ask why do we need to build new weapons when we have \nover six thousand warheads in our inventory? It's enough to destroy the \nworld at least ten times over, and leave the world in nuclear winter. \nIt would take only ten nuclear weapons to paralyze the United States.\n  Some believe our non-proliferation efforts do not stop North Korea or \nIran from developing nuclear weapons of their own. No one argues that \nthese weapons have the capability to stop North Korea. But why not \ntarget them now with our existing nuclear weapons. This is not an \nargument for new nuclear weapons.\n  Some argue that current law ties the hands of the Pentagon. But there \nis no military requirement for these weapons, just hypothetical \nsituations proposed by the other side. No one can point to an actual \nsituation where we would use these weapons.\n  Some may argue that we need to do this research to go after Al Qaida \nand other asymmetric threats. How can we consider using thee weapons \nwhen we don't know where our adversaries are? Al Qaida is active in \nIndonesia, Saudi Arabia, Canada, and Germany. Would we use these low-\nyield weapons against these countries?\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle believe that we \nhave reduced our weapons while other countries have begun nuclear \nweapons programs. They say no one is following our lead and that since \n1992, we have stopped testing while China, France, India, and Pakistan \nhave continued to test. On the contrary, there have been no tests in \nthe past five years. Four states who were nuclear states have come \nunder the non-proliferation treaty as non-nuclear states: South Africa, \nBelarus, Kazakhstan, and the Ukraine.\n  They think we need to have our smartest people thinking about low-\nyield nuclear weapons. Lifting the ban would give them their freedom to \nindulge in intellectual curiosity, and it is more likely to yield a way \nto stop proliferation. However the research banned by this amendment is \nan offensive, not defensive capability. This is research leading to the \ndevelopment and the production of weapons, not pure intellectual \nexploration of advanced concepts. The Spratt amendment prohibits the \nconstruction of prototypes.\n  Some will argue that we cannot be confident that our weapons will \nwork, without the development of these new weapons. According to the \nNational Academy of Sciences (July 2002), ``The United States has the \ntechnical capabilities to maintain confidence in the safety and \nreliability of its existing nuclear weapons stockpile under the CTBT, \nprovided that adequate resources are made available to the Department \nof Energy's nuclear weapons complex and are properly focused on this \ntask.''\n  My colleagues believe that we still retain the right to authorize and \nappropriate funds for nuclear weapons systems. We should be allowed to \nthink about these weapons to prevent others from developing this \ncapability. But no one else is developing these weapons; if we start, \nothers may follow. We may be igniting a new nuclear arms race. Nothing \nin law prohibits our scientists from doing research on our adversaries' \ncapabilities.\n  Finally, some say we should develop these weapons because we cannot \nuse the existing weapons, because they are too large. They say killing \nmillions of Iraqis is too many. If we use a lower-yield weapon, we can \ndeter Saddam Hussein. But this is just arguing for hundreds of \nthousands dead, rather than millions. If we really want a surgical \nstrike capability, then we should develop a conventional alternative.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my remaining time to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n[[Page S6688]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the provisions in this bill relating to the \ndevelopment of new nuclear weapons mark a major and a very dangerous \nshift in American policy. Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nis the greatest threat we face. Uncorking the nuclear bottle to develop \nnew and modified nuclear weapons goes in the opposite direction of the \ncommitment we made when we signed the nonproliferation treaty. We are a \nparty to that treaty.\n  It has been said on this floor that North Korea is a party to the \nnonproliferation treaty, and they have to live up to it. They got \nsomething in return for their signature. They did, indeed. They got our \nsignature, and our signature committed us to end the nuclear arms race.\n  Uncorking the nuclear bottle, which these provisions do, makes a \nmockery of our argument to other countries around the world that they \nshould not go nuclear.\n  Just think about some of the headlines in the last few months about \nNorth Korea: ``U.S. Assails Move by North Koreans to Reject Treaty.'' \nThat is the nonproliferation treaty to which we are a signatory, too, \nthat commits us to end the nuclear arms race, not to start a new \nchapter in the nuclear arms race. So we assail their move.\n  Another headline: ``Military Action Possible, U.S. Warns North \nKorea.'' We take their move toward nuclear weapons so seriously that we \nhave actually suggested we may initiate military action to stop them \nfrom moving in a nuclear direction. Yet we, if these provisions stay, \nare moving in that same direction. We have told Iran the same thing. We \nhave urged Russia: Do not help Iran go nuclear. Do not supply them with \nany materials which they might use to go nuclear.\n\n  Yet in these provisions in this bill, we would, if they stay in the \nbill, lift a prohibition that exists in current law in the United \nStates which prohibits the research and development on nuclear weapons \nthat could lead to the production of new nuclear weapons. That is what \nthe so-called Spratt-Furse language does. It prohibits research and \ndevelopment on nuclear weapons which could lead to their production. \nThat is the language which was stricken by a 15-to-10 vote in the Armed \nServices Committee, and that is the language which the amendment \noffered by the Senators from California and Massachusetts would restore \nto the law.\n  We have a special responsibility for a lot of reasons. No. 1, we are \nthe leader. We have to live up to what we say we want others to do. But \nwe are also the only country that has actually used nuclear weapons. We \nsay we are determined to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. Are we \nserious about that? If we have a prohibition in our law which says we \nwill not do research and development on nuclear weapons which could \nlead to their production, are people around the world going to take us \nseriously that, in fact, we want to stop other countries from going \nnuclear, gaining nuclear weapons, that our major fear is the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons if we take the position that an \nexisting prohibition in law on research and development that could lead \nto production of those weapons is going to be lifted by us?\n  We have a special responsibility. This is a security issue for us. \nAre we really more secure in the world where that nuclear bottle is \nuncorked and uncorked by us, by lifting an existing ban in our law?\n  Nuclear weapons cannot be seen as just another option for warfare. \nThey cannot be seen as usable as warfighting weapons. Yet the \nadministration is moving to change the historic position of one U.S. \nadministration after another by looking to make nuclear weapons more \nusable, not just as another capability but usable in warfighting, and \nthat is the language which has been quoted on this floor.\n  The language of the head of the nuclear weapons program talks about \nthe desirability of designing weapons which are usable. That is his \nword, ``usable.'' One administration after another has gone in the \nother direction.\n  The specific weapons that are covered by the ban are so-called low-\nyield nuclear weapons. What a misnomer that is for reasons so many of \nus have given on the floor this afternoon. Five kilotons, which is the \ndefinition of a low-yield weapon, is roughly one-third the size of the \nnuclear bomb that was used on Hiroshima which immediately killed \n140,000 people, left hundreds of thousands radiated and injured in \nother ways. And by the way, 140,000 people was almost half the \npopulation of Hiroshima.\n  Nuclear weapons are weapons of mass destruction, whether they are a \nthird the size of the bomb that was used at Hiroshima or 20 times the \nsize or 40 times the size. They are weapons of mass destruction.\n  The administration seeks to repeal a ban on research and development \nwhich could lead to the production of a weapon of mass destruction. \nThat is the bottom line, and the statement by the Administrator of the \nNational Nuclear Security Administration, Mr. Linton Brooks, makes it \nvery clear that there is an intent here to develop weapons which are \n``usable.'' That is not my word. That is not the word of the supporters \nof the amendment, the Senator from California and the Senator from \nMassachusetts. That is the testimony of the Administrator of the \nNational Nuclear Security Administration who said that he has a bias in \nfavor of things--referring to weapons--that might be usable, referring \nto the so-called low-yield nuclear weapons.\n\n  It is more than research. In this law which exists, unless we repeal \nit, are prohibitions on research and development. The Deputy Assistant \nSecretary of Defense in charge of these programs, Mr. Celec, who has \nalso been quoted today, specifically said the following. Fred Celec, \nDeputy Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Nuclear Matters, made \nclear that:\n\n       The administration wants the weapon and it is moving \n     forward.\n\n  He is talking about a weapon that could be a deep penetrator. It \ncould be a so-called bunker buster, but also it could be a low-yield \nweapon. He is not specific. If a hydrogen bomb can be successfully \ndesigned to survive a crash through hard rock and still explode, it \nwill ultimately get fielded, Celec said in an interview with the \nMercury News. The San Jose Mercury News in 2003 ran that story, and we \nhave confirmed that, in fact, that is what he said. He was not \nmisquoted. So we have the Deputy Assistant to the Secretary of Defense \nfor Nuclear Matters saying that if a hydrogen bomb can be designed to \npenetrate hard rock and still explode, ``it will ultimately get \nfielded.''\n  That is the path the language in the bill repealing the so-called \nSpratt amendment would take us down.\n  All of this is being done in the context of what is called the \nNuclear Posture Review which was completed by the administration in \nDecember of 2001. This was the first step in an effort to develop new \nusable nuclear weapons. The Nuclear Posture Review is the basis for a \nnew strategic policy that is described in a March 23, 2002, Washington \nPost article:\n\n       Would give U.S. Presidents the option of conducting a \n     preemptive strike with precision-guided conventional bombs or \n     nuclear weapons.\n\n  That is the policy shift which occurred back then. That is the \nenvironment in which we are determining whether or not to lift a \nprohibition on research and development of new nuclear weapons.\n  That Nuclear Posture Review walks away from a longstanding policy \nthat the United States will not be the first to use nuclear weapons \nagainst a nonnuclear state. That Nuclear Posture Review, again \naccording to the Washington Post article, specifically identifies \ncountries that could be targets, including North Korea, Iran, Syria, \nand Libya.\n  The legislative proposal that accompanied the administration's \nrequest to repeal the Spratt-Furse prohibition on low-yield nuclear \nweapons says the following--that is the proposal that accompanied the \nrequest that the committee voted to approve by a 15-to-10 vote. This is \nwhat the administration's language says:\n\n       In this regard, the . . . Nuclear Posture Review urged \n     exploration of weapons concepts that could offer greater \n     capabilities for precision, earth penetration--\n\n  And other things.\n  The justification concluded that the Spratt-Furse law impedes this \neffort.\n  It does indeed.\n\n[[Page S6689]]\n\n  Without the Spratt-Furse law, there is no legal impediment to the \ndevelopment, testing, production, or deployment of new, usable nuclear \nweapons.\n  Will that impediment be removed? That is the issue we are going to \ndecide tonight. At a time when we are trying to dissuade other \ncountries from going forward with nuclear weapons development, when we \nstrongly oppose North Korea's pulling out of the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, when we are spending over a billion dollars to \nprevent the spread of nuclear weapons material and technology, it seems \nto me that lifting this prohibition on the research and development of \nnuclear weapons which could lead to their production sends a terrible \nmessage. We are telling others not to go down the road to nuclear \nweapons, but instead of being a leader in the effort to prevent the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons, we would be recklessly driving down \nthat same road.\n  In short, the United States should not follow a policy that we do not \ntolerate in others. We live in a dangerous world where proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction is the greatest threat we face. The answer \nis not to make the world more dangerous by our own actions.\n  If Senator Allard wishes to alternate, there would then be someone to \nspeak from his side. If not, I know Senator Feinstein is next in line.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank all of those who have come to \nthe floor to speak. I think this is a very important debate because I \nthink we are at a crossroad.\n  Clearly, this Defense authorization bill, when coupled with the \nrepeal of the Spratt-Furse amendment, opens the door to new nuclear \ndevelopment. In my tenure in the Senate, in either a classified or \nunclassified session, I have never had any information provided that \nthis is necessary or that there is a military requirement to do so.\n  One of the reasons this should not be repealed is, when it is \ncombined with other provisions in the Defense authorization bill, one \ncan really see where this is going. For example, this bill authorizes \n$15 million for the study of the robust nuclear earth penetrator. It \nauthorizes $6 million for advanced nuclear weapons concepts. Then if we \nlook at page 448 of the report, we see that the committee recommends a \nprovision that would require the Secretary of Energy to achieve and \nthereafter maintain a readiness posture of 18 months for resumption by \nthe United States of underground nuclear tests. This moves up a 3-year \nperiod to 18 months.\n  So if we combine all of these, it is very clear to me that where this \ncountry is going is toward the resumption of nuclear development.\n  I wish to rebut a couple of arguments. It was said that we need \ncapabilities for any possible contingency, and I could not agree more. \nBut if we read Spratt-Furse, it allows research but it disallows \ndevelopment and production. In other words, it allows research on \nexisting systems; it does not allow research on new systems. \nConsequently, if Spratt-Furse is repealed, what automatically is being \nsaid is that we begin study, research, and testing on new systems. If \nresearch is promising and there is a military need, the administration \ncan come back and ask for specific authorization. As I said, there is \nno specific military requirement for these weapons that we know about.\n  It has also been said today that developing low-yield weapons is \nimportant to preserve U.S. credibility in determining threats. In fact, \nwe already have over 6,000 nuclear weapons in our stockpile, and we \nalready have a warhead that can be dialed down to 1 kiloton or less. So \nwhat is the need to go to 5 kilotons of new development? We do not know \nbecause it has never been presented to us.\n  We also have an overwhelming conventional military advantage over any \nother country. We have conventional bombs that range in size from 500 \nto 5,000 pounds. A 5,000-pound bunker buster, like the guided bomb unit \n28B, is capable of penetrating up to 20 feet of reinforced concrete or \n100 feet of earth. This was used with success in Operation Enduring \nFreedom in Afghanistan.\n  To my knowledge, we have never been told that this is inadequate or \nthat there is no other way, other than a nuclear way, to get at a deep \nbunker; we have never been told that our intelligence does not work or \nyou cannot plug an air hole or you cannot use a number of conventional \nbunker busters to achieve a similar result.\n  We have been told that repealing Spratt-Furse will not affect \nproliferation because others will seek nuclear weapons anyway. Well, \nour standing in the world, I have thought, really rests on our moral \ncase, our sense of justice, our sense of equity, our freedom. In fact, \nsince 1992, the United States has not developed new weapons and others \nhave followed suit. Russia has not tested since then and has not \ndeveloped new weapons. China stopped testing. India and Pakistan have \nnot tested for 5 years and are not currently developing new weapons. \nBut we can be sure, when it is learned that the United States is going \nto go ahead with new studies, new feasibility tests on up to 5-kiloton \nnew nuclear warheads, that others will follow suit.\n  I believe U.S. restraint is, in fact, an important element of our \nnonproliferation effort.\n  This is a very big vote that is before us right now because the only \nreason to repeal Spratt-Furse is to signal that we are, in fact, going \nto develop a new generation of nuclear weapons. This is a horrible \nmistake. I think it is a mistake morally. I think it is a mistake \nmilitarily. I do not know a commander who would want to send his troops \nonto a battlefield where a 5-kiloton nuclear weapons device had been \nutilized. So why are we doing this? It makes no sense to me. I hope \nthis body would vote against it.\n\n  I leave with one point. A 1-kiloton weapon detonated at a depth of 20 \nto 50 feet would inject more than 1 million cubic feet of radioactive \ndebris and form a crater about the size of ground zero in New York. If \nwe fail to repeal the repeal, we will allow research to go ahead to \ndevelop up to five times that when we have conventional weapons that \ncan do the job as well. I have very strong feelings on this subject.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy, Senator Levin, and all Members who have come \nto the floor to speak in support of our amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I think we are getting to the point where we are ready to \nwrap up debate. I will make a few comments and we will move to table \nand have a vote in a relatively short period of time. I am warning \neveryone we are getting close to a vote.\n  I thought I would take a few moments to review some of the comments \nmade by individuals in the administration about the need to allow for \nresearch, at least, and study as far as the low-yield nuclear weapons \nwere concerned.\n  I rise in opposition to the Kennedy-Feinstein amendment. Let me read \nfrom a letter from Secretary of State Powell, dated May 5, 2003.\n\n       I am writing to express support for the President's FY2004 \n     budget request to fund the feasibility and cost study for the \n     Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP), and to repeal the \n     FY1994 legislation that prohibits the United States from \n     conducting research and development on low yield nuclear \n     weapons. I do not believe that these legislative steps will \n     complicate our ongoing efforts with North Korea.\n\n  This is a statement from our Secretary of State.\n  ADM Ellis, U.S. Navy, had this to say in a letter to the chairman:\n\n       The nation needs to understand the technical capabilities \n     of threats under development by potential adversaries and to \n     thoroughly explore the range of options available to the \n     United States to deter or defeat them. Once we complete the \n     precise engineering analyses necessary to validate facts \n     related to nascent advanced concepts, the results of the \n     research will enable dispassionate, fact-based decisions on \n     very important defense and policy issues.\n\n  If you repeal the law on low-yield nuclear weapons, you end up \nproducing nuclear weapons which will cause less collateral damage if \nused and, therefore, the United States is more likely to use that. That \nis the assertion.\n  First, in response to that, NNSA cannot produce or deploy a new \nnuclear weapon without an authorization and appropriation from \nCongress. Second, there have been thousands of deployed\n\n[[Page S6690]]\n\nlow-yield nuclear weapons during the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and \ntoday, and that has not lowered the nuclear weapon threshold. Nuclear \nweapons are still a very high threshold that only the President can \ninitiate.\n  On April 8, 2003, Admiral James Ellis said:\n\n       . . . it's not clear to me there is a direct linkage \n     between the size of the weapons and the awesome \n     responsibilities embodied in that decision.\n\n  Ambassador Linton Brooks quoted, as then acting director of NNSA, in \nan April 8, 2003 hearing:\n\n       Is there a logic to saying that we have older low-yield \n     weapons, but that we now know we are not going to ever want \n     to produce new low-yield weapons. Now to some extent I admit \n     we are talking about--since I'm not going to develop or \n     produce anything without the permission of the Congress and \n     if the Congress decided to give me permission, it could \n     modify the ban . . .\n\n  Now, we are looking at both administrations that have basically taken \nthe position that we need to have a nuclear response to either chemical \nor biological weapons or weapons of mass destruction.\n  On December 7, 1997, President Clinton issued some guidelines which \nwould permit nuclear strikes after enemy attacks involving chemical or \nbiological weapons, which was reported widely at that time.\n  Finally, I point out some language and remind my colleagues we have \nspecific language in the bill, and I will again repeat that language:\n\n       Nothing in the repeal made by subsection (a) shall be \n     construed as authorizing testing, acquisition, or deployment \n     of a low-yield nuclear weapon.\n\n  The issue is clear. I am now willing to move forward with the vote.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Biden as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. For Members' information, we are going to proceed to a \nvote. I want Members to understand we are going to hold this vote open \nan extra length of time to accommodate those who are expecting the vote \nto occur at 7:45. This will allow Members who are anxious to get home \nearly tonight to leave early, and then we will keep the vote going \nlater on.\n  Having made that announcement, I will move to table.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator withhold for just a moment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I understand we have some time to be yielded back on both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Members all over town have been expecting \nthis vote to occur at 7:45, so I hope the leader will allow us to have \nthe vote drag on for a little while to make sure our people get back.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I have contacted the leader on the Republican side. He is \nexpecting us to leave this open to somewhere around 8:10.\n  Now we both have time to yield back.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield the remainder of the time on the Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Now I move to table the Kennedy-Feinstein amendment. I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, for over 50 years, the United States has \nbeen in the vanguard in both urging and acting to delegitimize the use \nof nuclear weapons. Today, the Bush administration is implementing a \ndeparture from this bipartisan policy of arms control by adopting \nmeasures that will lower the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons.\n  Dissatisfaction with America's nuclear policy by conservatives was \nevident even before George W. Bush became President. One of the more \ndramatic examples of this was the rejection of the Comprehensive \nNuclear Test-Ban Treaty by the Senate in 1999. A particularly revealing \naspect of that vote was the opposition to a proposal to put the treaty \naside rather than to formally defeat it. Deferral would have given a \nfuture President the ability to renegotiate aspects of the treaty, such \nas verification, that were specifically criticized. A combination of \nideological and political motivations forced a vote that further \nweakened efforts at arms control. Indeed, today the defeat of the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty still lingers as something that I \nthink is a serious erosion of arms control throughout the world and our \nability to influence other nations to refrain from testing and \ndeveloping.\n  In a similar vein, Republicans in Congress enacted legislation that \nfixed the minimal number of launch vehicles and warheads in order to \nprevent the Clinton administration from initiating reductions through \nnegotiations with the Russians. This legislation was quietly repealed \nwhen President George W. Bush announced his intention to conclude the \nMoscow treaty. The Moscow treaty seems to be the type of arms control \ntreaty that conservatives can be comfortable with since it does not \nactually require the elimination or destruction of nuclear weapons by \neither side. I have heard today repeatedly discussions of how we are \ndestroying nuclear weapons. In fact, under the Moscow treaty, we are \nsimply redesignating nuclear weapons. We are calling them operational \nand nonoperational. We are not destroying nuclear weapons.\n  The Bush administration not only accepted these precedents, but \nrapidly and deliberately built upon them. The President quickly \nannounced the withdrawal of the United States from the ABM Treaty. Here \nagain, there was scant attention paid to the possibility of negotiating \nchanges with the Russians in order to pursue the development of an \nantimissile system without jettisoning the ABM Treaty. The ABM Treaty \nhas been a long-time target of the right wing. President Bush's \ndecision was as much about appeasing a powerful component of his \npolitical base as it was a reflection of strategic thinking.\n  The President has made it clear that he will not pursue further \nnegotiations under the START process with the Russians. He is content \nto let the Moscow treaty stand as the beginning and the end of his arms \ncontrol initiatives.\n  The most effective nonproliferation program, the Cooperative Threat \nReduction Program, was greeted initially by the Bush administration \nwith skepticism. The program was placed on hold for the first year of \nthe administration while the program was under review. The program was \ndelayed an additional year when the administration could not make the \ncertifications necessary for the program to proceed. The program \nsurvived the review and the certification delay but 2 years was spent \non justifying the program rather than aggressively eliminating weapons \nand weapons material.\n\n  All of this was prelude to the publication of the Nuclear Posture \nReview in December of 2001. The review is classified and the \nadministration provided only a cursory nonclassified briefing. Public \ncomments by the administration suggest the major shifts in policy \nincluded in the review.\n  For the first time, the Nuclear Policy Review indicates that the \nUnited States is prepared to use nuclear weapons against nonnuclear \nnations that are not aligned with a nuclear power. Previously, the \nfocus of our policy was to respond to the nuclear potential of other \nnuclear powers and their allies as a means of deterring the use of \nnuclear weapons. Today, the United States is contemplating the use of \nnuclear weapons against nations that do not possess nuclear weapons. In \nso doing, the NPR, the Nuclear Posture Review, blurs distinctions \nbetween conventional and nuclear weapons.\n  Instead of trying to place nuclear weapons beyond use or at least \nseverely restricting their use to the deterrence of an attack by a \nnuclear power, the NPR makes them just one more tool in our tool kit. \nIn so doing, it mischaracterizes the horrific effects of nuclear \nweapons; trying to suggest that they are a little bit more than a \nconventional weapon, when they are of a dimension and scale that is \nbeyond the contemplation of anyone who has used conventional weapons.\n  The NPR maintains the current size of the stockpile of nuclear \nweapons. Despite the end of the cold war, the dissolution of the Soviet \nUnion and the emergence of a democratically elected government in \nRussia, the administration continues to maintain thousands of warheads \nin the stockpile.\n  The NPR holds out the possibility of the resumption of nuclear \ntesting, either to maintain the current stockpile or to develop new \ntypes of nuclear weapons. Budget requests to fund the production of \nhundreds of new plutonium pits per year, a necessary component of a \nnuclear weapon, are included in this budget.\n  Requests to undertake the designs of new weapons if needed and to \nshorten the time necessary to initiate and conduct a nuclear test are \nincluded in the budget proposals, and all of them strongly suggest that \ntesting could go well beyond the need to maintain the existing \nstockpile.\n  Coupled with the rejection of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban \nTreaty, the NPR sent a disturbing signal that we would once again \nundertake a testing program. Such a program may very well be imitated \nby other nations, either through perceived need or as a means to \nmaintain their prestige in the nuclear club. In any case, this, too, \nwould further weaken the restraints against the use of nuclear weapons.\n  In the context of these dramatic changes in policy, rejection of the \ncomprehensive test ban treaty and a new nuclear policy review that \nblurs the distinction between conventional and nuclear weapons, the \nadministration proposed last year to begin the design of a robust \nnuclear earth penetrator to use against hard and deeply buried targets. \nThis weapons would modify an existing nuclear device. In essence, the \nkinetic package already in the stockpile would come out of inventory \nand the key work would involve the design of a casing that could \npenetrate the proper depth for the weapon.\n  The first point to be made is that the existing weapons being \nconsidered are quite large, on the order of several hundred kilotons to \nover 1 megaton. For a frame of reference, the weapons dropped on \nHiroshima and Nagasaki were in the range of 14 to 21 kilotons. Thus, \nthe smaller of these bunker busters is roughly 25 times the size of the \nbombs dropped on Japan. These weapons will bust more than a bunker. The \narea of destruction will encompass an area the size of a city. They are \nreally city breakers, not bunker busters.\n  A further point is the fact that conventional munitions have \nsubstantially increased their precision. We have seen that in Iraq \nrapidly and effectively. Although they have not achieved the ability of \nflying through an open door and taking the elevator down to the bunker \ncommand center, increased precision means enhanced ability to target \nand destroy entrances and the communication network of a command center \nor other sensitive target.\n  We have much better capacity today with conventional weapons, and \nmany would argue these conventional weapons could effectively deal with \nmany, if not all, of these potential targets.\n\n[[Page S6692]]\n\n  Finally, the recent fighting in Iraq presented our forces with just \nthe type of targets that the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator is \nenvisioned to engage; deeply buried command centers and possible \nstorage areas for weapons of mass destruction. From preliminary reports \nand from casual observations, it does not appear in any way that our \nmilitary efforts were inhibited by the lack of a robust nuclear earth \npenetrator.\n  Last year Senate Democrats were able to delay spending money on a \nrobust nuclear earth penetrator by requiring a report identifying the \ntypes of targets this weapon is designed to hold at risk and the \nemployment policy for the robust nuclear earth penetrator. The \nclassified report has been submitted and the administration is forging \nahead.\n  Equally unsettling as the robust nuclear earth penetrator is the \nproposal by the administration to repeal the 1993 statutory ban on the \nresearch, development, testing, and production of low-yield nuclear \nweapons. Current law prohibits work on weapons with yields equal to or \nless than 5 kilotons. In attempting to justify this proposal, \nAmbassador Linton Brooks, Acting Director of the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration, NNSA, stated before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, that ``we are seeking to free ourselves from intellectual \nprohibitions against exploring a full range of technical options.''\n  Importantly, he did not justify this proposed work as a current \nmilitary requirement. At present, there is no military requirement for \na low-yield nuclear weapon. As I said before, really, low-yield nuclear \nweapon is a misnomer. These are still horrendous, horrific weapons. \nThey might better be referred to as small apocalypses, not low-yield \nweapons.\n\n  More illustrative of the motivation behind the efforts is a \nsubsequent statement of Ambassador Brooks at the hearing. The \nAmbassador declared:\n\n       I have a bias in favor of the lowest usable yield because I \n     have the bias in favor of something that is the minimum \n     destruction . . . I have a bias in favor of things that might \n     be usable.\n\n  Let me commend the Ambassador for his candor and his responsiveness \nto the question because I think he has laid it out very accurately and \nvery precisely and very well. No longer are we being motivated by a \nsincere and intense and consistent desire to try to avoid the use of \nnuclear weapons. We are trying to design weapons and produce weapons \nthat we fully anticipate can be used. That is an extraordinary sea \nchange in our policy. And it is a sea change that I think will \nreverberate around the world to our disadvantage, not to our security.\n  At the heart of the debate over these so-called low-yield nuclear \nweapons lies the observation, if not the fact, that the ability to \nlimit collateral damage makes a weapon more likely to be used. The \nadvent of precision-guided munitions makes attacks on urban areas more \nacceptable to leaders. Would we have dropped a dumb bomb on Saddam \nHussein's suspected hideouts in the crowded neighborhoods of Baghdad? \nIt would have been a much tougher call.\n  In a similar fashion, as suggested by Ambassador Brooks' comments, \ndeveloping low-yield nuclear weapons, small apocalyptic weapons, tilts \nthe scales for use, not for restraint. That is a balance I think will \nagain jeopardize our situation, not enhance it.\n  Proponents of this new policy with its bias in favor of things that \nare usable, in the Ambassador's terms, attempt to justify their \nposition on several grounds. They argue arms control and \nnonproliferation have failed. We heard the arguments on the floor of \nthe Senate all day long. They cite a litany of states that acquired \nnuclear weapons since the adoption of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty in 1968: India, Israel, Pakistan, South Africa, and apparently \nNorth Korea. But this litany must be placed in context. Forty years ago \nwhen the original nuclear powers--the United States, the Soviet Union, \nBritain, France, and China--had a monopoly on nuclear weapons, it was \nroutinely assumed that proliferation would be rapid and irreversible. \nPresident Kennedy predicted in the early 1960s that an additional 25 \ncountries might develop nuclear weapons within 10 years. This dire \nprediction did not come true because of efforts at arms control \nexemplified by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n  Recently, this point was reiterated by Deputy Secretary of State \nRichard Armitage who stated: Instead of the 25 or so countries that \nPresident Kennedy once predicted, only a handful of nations possess \nnuclear weapons. Of course, we suspect many more countries have \nchemical or biological weapons, but still short of the scores that have \nbeen predicted in the past.\n  We have reached this state of affairs in no small part through the \nconcerted efforts of many nations, agreements such as the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty and Chemical Weapons Convention, organizations \nsuch as the IAEA and nuclear supply groups--these constitute a global \nsecurity architecture that have served us satisfactorily and kept us \nsafe.\n  Moreover, of the five states that have acquired nuclear weapons since \n1968, three--Israel, India, and Pakistan--never signed on to the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. In retrospect, many look back and \nwish we could have urged them, convinced them, persuaded them, to sign \non because it would have made their ascendency to the nuclear ranks \nthat much more difficult.\n  South Africa gave up its nuclear weapons and joined the regime as a \nnonpossessor. That leaves the very special case of North Korea which \njoined the NPT in 1985 and has been caught on at least two occasions \nviolating this obligation before its recent announced repudiation of \nthe treaty.\n  Critics of the nonproliferation regime frequently fail to acknowledge \nthat Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, and Taiwan ceased their suspected \nnuclear program in part because of the international law norm \nrepresented by the nonproliferation treaty.\n  Similarly, with the demise of the Soviet Union, the newly independent \nstates of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine found themselves in \npossession of nuclear weapons. All of them voluntarily relinquished \ntheir weapons in favor of joining the NPT. Their decision, at the \nurging of the United States and others, reaffirmed the norms of \nnonproliferation. Indeed, as recently as May, 2000, the United States \nreaffirmed this norm by joining the four other original nuclear powers \nin declaring their commitment to the ``unequivocal undertaking'' to \neliminate nuclear arsenals.\n  That affirmation is in stark contrast to the legislation before us \nthat seeks to expand and enhance our nuclear arsenal. Today, \nnonproliferation is being advocated by the United States as ``do what I \nsay,'' not ``do what I do.'' Unfortunately, the United States is more \noften imitated than obeyed.\n  Last Saturday, Vladimir Putin's annual address was reported in the \nAmerican media. According to one report:\n\n       [Putin] appeared to be responding to the Bush \n     administration's new nuclear strategy, announced last year, \n     when he said that Russia, too, was considering developing new \n     variants of nuclear weapons.\n\n  President Putin declared, in his words:\n\n       I can inform you that at present the work to create new \n     types of Russian weapons, weapons of the new generation, \n     including those regarded by specialists as strategic weapons, \n     is in the stage of practical implementation.\n\n  As the newspaper report further indicated:\n\n       [A]nalysts said he [Putin] appeared to be referring to \n     Russia's efforts to modernize its nuclear arsenal and to \n     develop low yield nuclear weapons.\n\n  At this point in the speech, the press reported that the ``remark was \ngreeted by applause.''\n  I don't know how comfortable we all feel with the Russian Duma \napplauding the statement that Russia is considering modernizing their \nnuclear forces, potentially developing low-yield nuclear weapons. \nIndeed, it seems terribly ironic to me that as we urge support and help \nfor the Russians to destroy their nuclear arsenal, they are \nsimultaneously taking the path we are in trying to create and build a \nnew, more modern arsenal.\n  Acknowledging the important role of the nonproliferation treaty, as I \nhave over many decades, should not be equated with assuming the arms \ncontrol regime is without shortcomings. A structure that was designed \nprimarily to moderate the superpower confrontation between the United \nStates and the\n\n[[Page S6693]]\n\nSoviet Union cannot be expected to adapt to the new threats and new \ntechnologies of the post-cold-war world without conscious and committed \nefforts led by the United States to deal with these new circumstances. \nThus, it is incumbent on ourselves, the United States, not simply to \nwalk away from this regime of arms control but to adapt it to the new \ncontingencies, the new threats, the new environment of this new \nstrategic world.\n  The consequences of the detonation of a weapon of mass destruction \nare so devastating that reliance on military means alone to deter or \npreempt such an event is shortsighted. Abandoning serious efforts at \narms control will weaken, not strengthen, our efforts to protect the \nNation. We must engage, again, I believe, in a concerted effort to \nstrengthen these norms of nonproliferation, of nonuse--not weaken them, \nas this legislation suggests.\n  A second argument used by proponents of these policies is that it is \njust about research; no one would ever deploy these weapons. These \nadvocates have not been paying attention to the Bush administration. \nThese are the words of Fred Celec, Deputy Assistant to the Secretary of \nDefense for Nuclear Matters, in an interview with the San Jose Mercury \nNews, talking in the context of the development of a ``hydrogen bomb \nthat can be successfully designed to survive a crash through the hard \nrock or concrete and still explode,'' which is an earth penetrator. Mr. \nCelec concludes, in his words, if we can do it, ``it will ultimately \nget fielded.'\n\n  So this is not about hypothetical research; it is not about a big \nscience project, or training scientists. In the view of a very \ninfluential member of the Department of Defense, it is about getting \nweapons we can put in the field. I can't think of any weapon that we \nwould field, that we would place in the hands of American military \npersonnel, that we wouldn't test first. So we are also talking about \ntesting.\n  These are grave--not just possibilities, but if you listen to the \nspokesman of the administration, these are right over the horizon. I \nthink it is very disturbing. That is why I think we have to act here to \nexercise our judgment and our responsibility to ensure that our policy \nis consistent with the best interests of this country. I hope, through \nconsideration of this amendment, we will do that.\n  A third point that seems implicit in many of the arguments that are \nmade on behalf of these weapons is the notion that nuclear weapons can \nbe designed so their use is, if not relatively benign, then at least \ntolerable.\n  As previously discussed, the proposed modification of existing \nweapons to create a robust nuclear earth penetrator is anything but \nbenign or tolerable. It will pack an explosive punch at least 25 times \nthat of Nagasaki or Hiroshima, and even if technology and the Congress \nallows for a smaller yield robust nuclear earth penetrator, its use \nwill be devastating.\n  Sidney Drell, a noted physicist and arms control advocate, pointed \nout that even a 1-kiloton weapon, penetrating to 40 feet, would create \na crater larger than the impact area at the World Trade Center and put \nabout 1 million cubic feet of radioactive material in the air. Such \nradioactivity could last for many years and would likely be spread over \na fairly large area by the prevailing winds. That is not a small, \ndiscrete weapon that plows into the ground with a little puff of smoke \nemanating. That is a devastating weapon.\n  A fourth rationale raised by proponents is that permission to develop \nlow-yield nuclear weapons is necessary to train the next generation of \nnuclear scientists. This argument ignores the existence of thousands of \nnuclear weapons that are available for training purposes. The ban on \nlow-yield nuclear weapons applies only to the fabrication of new \nweapons, not the dismantling and study of existing ones. Moreover, the \nidea that decades of arms control efforts would be cast aside simply to \nprovide a training exercise should cause a more exhaustive search for \nother training opportunities rather than the creation of a new class of \nnuclear weapons. Or, at a minimum, it should prompt a careful exemption \nfrom the ban for the purpose of research, and not the wholesale repeal \nof the ban that is included in this legislation before us.\n  A fifth rationale advanced by supporters is the possible use of a \nlow-yield nuclear device to attack a facility that contains biological \nor chemical agents. The theory is that the radiation can destroy the \nbiological or chemical agents in addition to destroying the facility. \nBut this rationale begs two questions. What will destroy the radiation \nemitted by the nuclear blast and why are precision-guided missiles not \nas suitable a response? Once again, this is the very specialized threat \nthat may be dealt with by other means and is an attempt to deal with \nthe possibility of chemical and biological exposure through the release \nof a definite radiological exposure. It is not a compelling reason to \nabandon the ban on low-yield nuclear weapons.\n  A final justification for the development of low-yield nuclear \nweapons is that it will act as a deterrent. Proponents argue that our \nexisting nuclear weapons are so large that we are self-deterred from \nusing them and our adversaries know this. But with new, low-yield \nweapons, our adversaries will have renewed concern that we will employ \nnuclear weapons.\n  Several points are in order. First, in the war on terror, our \nadversaries are unlikely to be deterred by any size nuclear weapon, due \nto their fanaticism and the practical problem of targeting them. In a \nconfrontation with rogue states, the targeting problem is easier, but \nthe use of nuclear weapons of any size presents difficult tactical \nproblems.\n  Our doctrine of air superiority, information dominance, precision \nweapons, and speed makes the use of nuclear weapons less attractive on \nmilitary grounds since we plan for and anticipate the rapid destruction \nof enemy forces and the swift seizure of key political objectives. The \nuse of nuclear weapons will likely slow us down and increase the cost, \nboth short run and long run, of our operations.\n  In Iraq, we were confronted by a rogue state. We heard before the \nhostilities of the existence of deep underground facilities. We were \ntold there were significant weapons of mass destruction throughout the \ncountry. Yet, I don't think any military commanders would have even \ncontemplated the use of low-yield nuclear weapons, or any type of \nnuclear weapon. For one reason, if we had, we would still be miles away \nfrom Baghdad, because we could not occupy a place that was radiating \nplutonium. We would have caused significant civilian casualties. We \nwould have caused a political firestorm that could never be contained \nin that part of the world and passed across the globe.\n\n  These are the practical considerations that deter us--not the fact \nthat we do not have a low-yield weapon.\n  In addition, the ``deterrent effect'' may have the opposite effect on \nthese rogue nations, as we think we are going to deter them.\n  Indeed, as Michael May, the former head of Lawrence Livermore \nNational Laboratory, suggested, the emphasis on tactical nuclear \nweapons ``increases the motivation of 'targeted states' to improve and \nextend their own nuclear force, or to get one if they don't have it.''\n  The behavior of North Korea and Iran, although clearly unjustified, \nmight be prompted by such considerations.\n  The amendment I offer today is designed to do what I heard \npractically all of my colleagues say was the intent of this proposal by \nthe administration--to allow scientists to do research but clearly to \nprevent the development, the testing, the fielding, and the use of \nnuclear weapons, particularly low-yield nuclear weapons.\n  The amendment I offer today would amend the current Spratt-Furse law \nso that research is allowed. Work beyond research would, however, \nremain prohibited.\n  Since 1953, the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense \nhave worked in a very formalized weapons development process. In the \nDOE nuclear weapons development process there are a series of numbered \nphases of development. They are pictured in this chart. The top chart \nrepresents the development of a new weapon. There are eight phases as \nindicated in the chart. The bottom array is the development of or \nmodification of an existing weapon such as the case would be with the \nrobust nuclear earth penetrator. It is coming out of the stockpile, but \nit is still subject to the same clearly defined phases that have been\n\n[[Page S6694]]\n\ndefined now for almost 50 years, concept assessment, feasibility, all \nthe way through retirement.\n  The amendment I offer today would prohibit ``development \nengineering,'' which is phase 3, or phase 6.3. Again, these are clearly \nidentified phases. There will be no confusion in the Department of \nEnergy or in the Department of Defense as to what is prohibited, what \nis allowed, and what is allowed as ``reasonable.'' That is what I have \nheard consistently my colleagues say, that the whole purpose of this \nproposal by the administration and the development phases are well \nunderstood. They have been in use for 50 years. The phases were \ndeveloped jointly by the Atomic Energy Commission, the predecessor to \nthe DOE, and the Department of Defense in a memorandum of understanding \nsigned in 1953.\n  Again, my amendment is very clear. It allows phase 1, phase 2, and \nphase 2-A activity for a new weapon. The red line comes at phase 3. It \nwould allow phase 6.1, 6.2, and 6.2-A. The red line phase comes at 6.3 \nfor the modification of existing weapons. Research is allowed, and \neverything else is prohibited.\n\n  The amendment is designed to allow what, as I said, the Bush \nadministration claims is a primary reason to seek the repeal of the \nSpratt-Furse law--the need to ``train the next generation of nuclear \nweapons scientists and engineers.''\n  I and many of my colleagues do not support providing an open-ended \nauthority to this or any other administration to develop, test, \nproduce, and deploy new nuclear weapons. Unless we adopt this amendment \nor some variance of the amendment, that is precisely what we will be \ngiving the administration.\n  The amendment would address the primary concern of ADM Ellis, \nCommander of Strategic Command, the command responsible for nuclear \nweapons.\n  In a letter to the Armed Services Committee, ADM Ellis stated that \nthe ``U.S. Strategic Command is interested in conducting rigorous \nstudies of all new technologies and examining the merits of precision, \nincreased penetration, and reduced yield for our nuclear weapons.''\n  Nowhere is there a suggestion that he would like the permission to \ndevelop the test in the field of new weapons.\n  Again, if we are serious about arms control, and if we recognize the \nrequest for less stability in research, this amendment will be adopted. \nI hope it is. I would prefer, frankly, the restoration completely of \nthe Spratt-Furse amendment. But this will, I think, do what must be \ndone--prevent development, testing, and fielding of new nuclear weapons \nof the low-yield type.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senate has just voted to authorize the \nresearch of new nuclear weapons for the first time since 1993. We have \nremoved a prohibition on research which could lead to the production of \nnuclear weapons. This is a major shift, in my judgment, a terribly \nmistaken shift in policy because of the message it so clearly sends to \nthe world that we are now going to walk down the road we are telling \nthe rest of the world not to walk down.\n  The amendment which has been offered by Senator Reed, of which I am a \ncosponsor, starts from that point. However, as the Senator from Rhode \nIsland just described, it does not seek in any way to reverse what the \nSenate just did relative to the research that the opponents of the \nFeinstein-Kennedy amendment said was so important to protect. It \naccepts the decision of the Senate and the opponents of the Feinstein-\nKennedy amendment--the argument made that research should not be \nprohibited. Senator Reed's amendment does not prohibit research. \nRather, it says we should not allow the development of these new \nweapons and, of course, any subsequent testing or deployment of those \nweapons; that if we are going to let the world know we are not \ncommitted to the deployment and the development of new weapons, we have \nto send a clear signal to the world of some kind that even though \nresearch would be allowed, nonetheless we are not going to raise the \nprohibition or lift the prohibition on the development of new nuclear \nweapons.\n  I believe it was a mistake to repeal the Spratt-Furse language. I \nthink what we are doing is telling the North Koreas and the Irans of \nthe world that we are not going to tolerate your having nuclear \nweapons, but we are going to develop new nuclear weapons ourselves. It \nis a totally inconsistent position. It undermines our whole position \nand our standing in the world to argue that nations such as North Korea \nand Iran should not be allowed to have nuclear weapons.\n  It is mighty difficult to persuade even our Allies in the world that \nwe should take strong measures to stop North Korea from getting nuclear \nweapons, and we should take strong measures to stop Iran from getting \nnuclear weapons, including working with the Russians to try to stop \nIran from getting nuclear weapons, but, oh, by the way, we are going to \ndo research and development on new nuclear weapons.\n  As the Senator from Rhode Island and others have said, this isn't \njust a matter of research, because the Deputy Assistant Secretary of \nDefense for Nuclear Matters puts it this way: ``If a hydrogen bomb \ncould be successfully designed to survive a crash through hard rock and \nstill explode, it will ultimately get fielded''--I presume speaking for \nthe administration.\n  So nobody should be, in any way, fooled that what we are talking \nabout is just simply research. Unless we put a prohibition in to stop \nthe development of these weapons, what the world will believe--and I \nthink accurately--is that it is not just research, it is development. \nThen, in the words of Fred Celec, the Deputy Assistant Secretary on \nnuclear matters: It will get fielded.\n  Now, the opponents of the last amendment said: Well, that is not what \nwe are trying to do here. We are not trying to make any commitment to \nfielding a weapon or even developing a weapon. All we are talking about \nis research. And since the Spratt amendment prohibits research on \nweapons which could lead to their deployment and to their production, \nwe think the Spratt amendment simply goes too far and should be \nrepealed.\n  So what the Senator from Rhode Island does in his amendment is say: \nWell, then, for Heaven's sake, consistent with that--and to avoid \nsending a message which even the opponents of the Feinstein-Kennedy \namendment said they do not want to send--let us keep the prohibition on \nthe development of new nuclear weapons. That is all the amendment \noffered by Senator Reed does.\n  It seems to me it is the least we can do to avoid sending a signal \nfrom the U.S. Senate that this country is now going down a road that we \nare saying no country should go down, which is the road of new nuclear \nweapons.\n  The former Assistant Energy Secretary, Rose Gottemoeller, in March of \n2003 put it this way:\n\n       Other countries watch us like a hawk. They are very, very \n     attentive to what we do in the nuclear arena. This is going \n     to be considered another step in the tectonic shift.\n\n  She was referring to the repeal of the Spratt-Furse language.\n\n       I think people abroad will interpret this as part of a \n     really enthusiastic effort by the Bush administration to \n     renuclearize. And I think definitely there's going to be an \n     impetus to the development of nuclear weapons around the \n     world.\n\n  The greatest threat we face is the terrorist threat and the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We should do what we can \nto avoid sending a signal to the world that we are committed to the \ndevelopment of new nuclear weapons. The prohibition now has been lifted \non research and development of new nuclear weapons, which could lead to \ntheir production.\n  Unless we adopt the Reed amendment, it will appear to the world--\naccurately--that this Senate is committed to the development of new \nnuclear weapons. I hope we are not going to make that commitment. It \nwould be a terrible mistake for what it would unleash.\n  In order to avoid that commitment from being made, or from appearing \nto be made, to the rest of the world, we need the Reed language, which \nsays that we are going to keep the prohibition of Spratt-Furse from the \ndevelopment stage on.\n  The Senate has spoken relative to research. The words again of the \nopponents, who have said: My Heavens,\n\n[[Page S6695]]\n\nunder Spratt-Furse, you can't even do the research. Surely, we ought to \nallow scientists to think.\n  The Reed amendment is consistent with what the opponents of \nFeinstein-Kennedy said was their main reason for opposing the \nprohibition that exists in law. So I would hope that we could adopt the \nlanguage that is in Senator Reed's amendment, to indicate we, in fact, \nare not committed to the development of new nuclear weapons, and that \nwe would not march down a road when we tell other nations they must not \nmarch down that road.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have listened very carefully to the \narguments by my two distinguished colleagues, the Senator from Rhode \nIsland and the Senator from Michigan.\n  The Senate has acted on repealing a portion of the ban, and I think \nit is important that the Senate be consistent and that it should be a \ntotal repeal unless it could be construed as not being the intention of \nthe Congress to fully support the actions of the research in the first \ntwo steps.\n  My second-degree amendment would allow the entire repeal, as called \nfor in the bill, to take place. But very importantly, I then make it \neminently clear that not one step can go beyond the research phase \nunless--and I read section (c):\n\n       The Secretary of Energy may not commence the engineering \n     development phase, or any subsequent phase, of a low-yield \n     nuclear weapon unless specifically authorized by Congress.\n\n  Laws should be written that are clear, so they are understandable. \nThis second-degree amendment absolutely places in the mind of every \nreasonable person who reads it precisely what is the intent of the \nCongress. And that intent is that this is approved to go forward in the \nvote we have just taken. In the second degree amendment to the pending \namendment, it is clear that Congress is fully in charge, working with \nthe executive branch. The Congress, and only the Congress, can \nauthorize and appropriate the funds necessary to go one step beyond \nwhat the earlier amendment provided.\n  Very simple. I do not need to prolong this argument. The second \ndegree amendment is eminently clear.\n  Mr. REED. Will the chairman yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REED. I think I understand your second degree, but if I could, \njust for a moment--my amendment authorizes research activities in \nphases 1, 2, and 2-A, and 6.1, 6.2, and 6.2-A, and then prohibits the \nfollowing phases. Your amendment would authorize work in these phases.\n  I think the difference is that rather than a clear prohibition, which \nwould require someone coming back to the Congress and seeking to repeal \nthe prohibition, you would require them to come back and get an \nauthorization to proceed. I think that is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I do not want to get tangled up in the terminology, but \nthe bill, as passed out by the Armed Services Committee that is pending \nbefore us, repeals, in the entirety, the law that was passed in 1994.\n  Then you are coming along and saying: All right, I cede the ground \nthat was authorized by this bill that just passed, but I wish to \nreimpose the limitation on the subsequent steps to the research.\n  All I am saying is, let's be consistent. We have repealed. Leave it \nrepealed. But insert the Congress at precisely the point the Senator \nraises there and say: Not one step more until the authorization and \nappropriation takes place.\n  Mr. REED. Essentially, the functional difference between my amendment \nand your second degree is, at this point, under my amendment the \nadministration would have to come and lift the prohibition; under your \namendment, they would have to come and get an authorization. I think \nthat is the functional difference.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REED. Let me say, if I may, again, we are united in the notion of \nallowing the research in these first three phases. We choose a \ndifferent way to control government access in the succeeding phases. \nBut the effect, I hope, at the end of the deliberations is that the \ndevelopment, engineering, testing, and deployment of nuclear weapons of \nlow-yield will be subject to congressional authority.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think the advantages, if I may say with respect to my \ntwo highly esteemed colleagues, are that the second-degree amendment \ncan be understood by anyone who can interpret the English language.\n  When I look at your amendment--I have been over here working it and \nreworking it--it leaves a little bit of a challenge.\n  Mr. REED. If the chairman will yield, that is why I have this chart, \nwhich is quite obvious, and it absolutely could explain your amendment, \ntoo.\n  I will lend it to you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am just comparing the two amendments. It \nseems to me in terms of directives, the simplicity of the Reed \namendment has it all over the amendment of the Senator from Virginia. \nIt is shorter than the Senator's amendment, if I am reading this \namendment correctly. I want to make sure I have the right amendment \nbefore I make this statement. It looks like on page 2 at least there \nare 10 lines of type; is that correct? Am I looking at the correct \namendment?\n  Mr. REED. I believe you are.\n  Mr. LEVIN. On the first page.\n  Mr. REED. It reads ``03.857'' on the upper left hand.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Correct. It is at least as simple as the amendment of the \nSenator from Virginia, which I understand is really a substitute.\n  Mr. WARNER. My esteemed colleague is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. When the Senator says it reimposes the limitation on \ndevelopment, the Senator is correct. It does do that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Which amendment are you discussing? The Reed amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Reed amendment, according to my dear friend from \nVirginia, would reimpose the prohibition on development that was just \nrepealed in the bill's language and left in because of the defeat of \nthe Feinstein amendment. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. First, it has to be removed and nothing has been removed \nyet. The law of the land remains the same tonight as it has been since \n1994. We are endeavoring to see what should be done about it. The bill \nreported out by our committee on a fairly significant vote in favor of \nrepeal would have the effect of repealing it in its entirety.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. My amendment says, yes, carry forward with the intent of \nthe majority vote in the Senate Armed Services Committee but put in the \nsteps of Congress having to authorize and approve funds for each step \nsubsequent to research.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And the Senator's amendment is useful.\n  Mr. WARNER. Which Senator's?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Virginia, the Senator I am addressing.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wish we were arguing that case. Both of us were trial \nlawyers. If you had made that mistake on the floor of a trial \ncourtroom, I would have you nailed right now.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am glad we are not in a trial courtroom because you \nsurely don't have me nailed here.\n  Mr. WARNER. You are working your way around trying to figure out \nexactly what it is you and the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island \nwant to do.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is quite clear what the Senator from Rhode Island and I \nwant to do, which is maintain a prohibition on the development of new \nnuclear weapons. The difference is exactly what the Senator from Rhode \nIsland said, which is that his amendment, which I have cosponsored, \nmaintains a prohibition on development; whereas the amendment of the \nSenator from Virginia says the administration would have to come back \nfor reauthorization.\n  The Senator from Virginia's amendment is valuable. As a matter of \nfact, I offered the amendment the Senator from Virginia is offering \ntonight in committee. It was defeated by one vote.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. In the committee?\n  Mr. LEVIN. In our committee I offered the amendment saying, come back \nfor reauthorization because under the circumstances, having defeated \nwhat we just had previously defeated in committee, I thought that was \nthe best that could be achieved. And we could\n\n[[Page S6696]]\n\nnot achieve that because it was defeated by a 13-to-12 vote. I don't \ndoubt there is value to what the Senator from Virginia is doing.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I apologize. I did not intend to \nplagiarize your good work. Suffering from a middle-age crisis, I forgot \nthat you might have done that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am delighted that the Senator from Virginia has offered \nthis as a second-degree amendment. Believe me, if the amendment of the \nSenator from Rhode Island is defeated by the adoption of the amendment \nof the Senator from Virginia as a substitute, all of us would be very \nsupportive of the amendment of the Senator from Virginia. Let it be \nclear that while there is value in it, there is not as much value in it \nas the amendment of the Senator from Rhode Island. It is not as clear a \nstatement to the world that we are not committed to the development of \nnew nuclear weapons.\n  What the Reed amendment says is: Development of these new weapons is \nprohibited. That is a very clear statement. The clarity of that \nstatement is absolutely pure. It is a lot clearer in terms of assuring \nthe world that we are not committed to the development of new nuclear \nweapons than is a statement such as the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Virginia which is, if you want to develop, come back to us \nfor authorization.\n  I say that in all sincerity. I look the Senator from Virginia in the \neye and say: His amendment, in my book, has value but not nearly the \nvalue of the amendment of the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  I hope we will adopt the amendment of the Senator from Rhode Island \nand defeat the substitute offered by the Senator from Virginia. But \nshould the substitute prevail, I would in all good conscience vote for \nthe substitute amendment if, in fact, it is substituted for the \namendment of the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Nonetheless, there is a much stronger statement made of reassurance \nto the world, a statement to the North Koreas and the Irans of the \nworld, that we are not committed to developing new nuclear weapons, if \nwe say exactly that. That is what the amendment of the Senator from \nRhode Island says. We are not going to proceed with the development, \neven though we are going to allow research on these new nuclear \nweapons.\n  I hope, again, the substitute is not agreed to and that the amendment \nof the Senator from Rhode Island is agreed to.\n  Again, I commend the Senator from Virginia because I do think that \nthere is a contribution in his substitute amendment which is better \nthan just simply repealing the Spratt-Furse language.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for what I interpret \nas kind words. We remain to have a difference of opinion as to the \nadvisability of not repealing this current prohibition in its entirety.\n  I have no further comments with respect to the pending amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I believe on the amendment that I offered \nearlier today on missile defense, we have reached agreement. It might \nbe appropriate at this time to call up the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am perfectly willing. That is a very \ngood suggestion.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I will lay aside the pending amendment. We \nare trying to identify the numbers so we can call up the amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I offer my deepest gratitude and \nsincere congratulations to Charles Michael Durishin, Democratic staff \ndirector of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, on the occasion of \nhis retirement, last Friday. A good friend and a consummate \nprofessional, Mike has served in various capacities in Congress since \n1973, including most of the last 16 years with the House Veterans' \nAffairs Committee.\n  I met Mike in 1972 on the Senate campaign of Jim Abourezk. We were \nhired within days of each other by Pete Stavrianos, one of my close \nfriends and my longtime chief of staff. Mike and I quickly became \nfriends on the campaign and, after the election, came to Washington \ntogether to work on Senator Abourezk's staff. I so respected his work \nthat he was one of the first people I hired to join my own staff when I \nwas elected to the House of Representatives in 1978. Mike worked with \nme, covering veterans issues, until 1986. At that time, I was a member \nof the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, and Mike matriculated to the \ncommittee staff.\n\n[[Page S6698]]\n\nWhile I lost one of my great friends and best staffers, the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee gained a staff member with expert knowledge, \nexceptional political skill, and great character.\n  I have been so fortunate to continue to work with Mike on veterans \nissues even as I moved to the Senate. On the committee staff, Mike was \ninstrumental in securing passage of the Montgomery G.I. bill. Later, he \ncontinued his work to improve education benefits, expand veterans' \nemployment opportunities, and end homelessness among veterans while \nworking for one of my close friends in the House, Representative Lane \nEvans.\n  I am truly grateful to have been able to work with such a great \nfriend for so long. Mike's wonderful smile, his dry sense of humor, and \nhis amazing wealth of knowledge have meant so much to me over the \nyears. I have had the pleasure of working with his wife Joey as well, \nand I know she and their son, Michael, will be happy to have him around \nthe house a little more often during his retirement. While those of us \nwho know his work are not yet ready to see him go, I wish him the best \nin this next stage of his life.\n  The veterans of this Nation will greatly miss the day-to-day service \nof this advocate who has dedicated his career to ensuring that our \nNation meets its obligations to the men and women who serve it so \nbravely. I will miss greatly working beside my longtime friend. Mike, \nyour record of service will be long remembered and appreciated in the \nHalls of the Congress and beyond. Good luck with your well-earned \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/20/senate-section/article/S6698-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      GRANTING TAIWAN MEMBERSHIP TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, 3 years ago today, Chen Shui-bian was \ndemocratically elected President of the Republic of China on Taiwan. \nUnder President Chen's strong leadership, Taiwan has remained true to \nits democratic values and has continued to be a model for its neighbors \nin the region. But as the Taiwanese people prepare to celebrate the \nthird anniversary of their President's election, they also are \nstruggling to contain the recent outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory \nSyndrome, SARS, in their country. The WHO's refusal to grant membership \nor even observer status to Taiwan has hindered the Nation's ability to \nhalt the spread of SARS, and has placed the health of all 23 million \nTaiwanese in jeopardy. This crisis highlights Taiwan's urgent need to \nobtain observer status in the WHO.\n  I urge the WHO to give Taiwan access to all the resources it needs to \nfight SARS so that President Chen can be as successful in the coming \nyears as he has been during the last 3.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following op-ed on this topic by \nPresident Chen that appeared in the Washington Post on May 9 be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 9, 2003]\n\n                         Help Taiwan Fight SARS\n\n                          (By Chen Shui-bian)\n\n       The outbreak and spread of severe acute respiratory \n     syndrome, or SARS, has brought illness, death and economic \n     peril to Asia and the rest of the world. It has also drawn \n     attention to Taiwan's exclusion from the World Health \n     Organization. If there was ever a time for my country to be \n     allowed to join the WHO, it is now.\n       As Taiwan's democratically elected president, my first and \n     foremost obligation is to the people of Taiwan. When SARS \n     first appeared in Taiwan in March, our health system \n     responded quickly and effectively. As a result, Taiwan \n     initially achieved a record of zero mortality, zero community \n     transmission and zero transmission abroad of SARS. But \n     despite our efforts, another outbreak occurred in late April. \n     We have taken strict measures in response, and are working \n     day and night to contain the disease.\n       Throughout this health crisis, my government has acted in \n     the best interest of our people and of foreign nationals \n     living in and visiting Taiwan. At no time has my \n     administration suppressed information about the disease. Our \n     press has reported freely on SARS. More important, our \n     officials know that they are accountable to the people, both \n     morally and at the ballot box. Whatever problems arise for \n     Taiwan, we will solve them according to the highest standards \n     of medicine, government accountability and human compassion.\n       I also have an obligation to the world. Taiwan is a nation \n     of 23 million people and a major trading partner for many \n     countries. What happens in Taiwan affects many millions more \n     around the world. For that reason, Taiwan immediately offered \n     to work with the WHO in combating SARS. Unfortunately, we \n     were rebuffed. However, in response to the most recent rise \n     in the number of cases, and for the first time in decades, \n     two experts from the WHO arrived in Taiwan last week. I \n     welcome this assistance and have directed my government and \n     called on my people to cooperate fully with them.\n       The WHO's decision to send these experts to Taiwan has \n     great significance. It demonstrates that Taiwan is \n     indispensable to international public health. But it also \n     suggests that cooperation between the WHO and Taiwan should \n     not be left to ad hoc arrangements.\n       Despite my country's advanced health system, staffed by \n     doctors and nurses educated in highly respected institutions \n     at home and abroad, and despite a strong desire to \n     participate in the WHO, Taiwan is denied membership or even \n     observer status in the organization. As a consequence, our \n     epidemiologists are still unable to gain prompt access to \n     information, such as samples of the virus, that could help \n     our scientists learn about the disease and treat patients. \n     Nevertheless, we have tried to provide information to \n     international organizations to ensure that Taiwan can make \n     the maximum contribution to solving this health problem.\n       The effort to understand and control SARS continues. Viral \n     experts seek answers to important questions. Doctors and \n     health professionals on the front line of the battle against \n     SARS need as much information as possible to be able to deal \n     with the disease. Moreover, like the WHO, international \n     health officials need as much data as possible about SARS and \n     the way it behaves in different environments and among \n     different populations.\n       Taiwan, with a population larger than those of three-\n     quarters of the countries of the world, is a piece of a \n     global puzzle that experts need to understand to cope with \n     the virus. Taiwan has long wanted not only to benefit from \n     the WHO's expertise but also to share the responsibility that \n     all countries have to global public health. Many health care \n     professionals around the world have expressed their support \n     for Taiwan's admission to the WHO as an observer. We are \n     grateful.\n       We hope that at the WHO meeting on May 19, this important \n     organization will invite Taiwan to be an observer. Taiwan's \n     people should not be excluded from efforts to defeat SARS. \n     Nor should the rest of the world be denied the important \n     contribution Taiwan can and wants to make to global health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/20/senate-section/article/S6698-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING PRIVATE DANNY J. KEOGH\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on March, 17, 1953, Private Danny J. Keogh, \nan Irish citizen and a resident of the State of Nevada, gave his life \nfor America while fighting in the Korean War. Private Keogh's story is \na tale of exemplary courage. After living and working in Sparks, NV for \n4 years, Private Keogh was drafted to serve in the U.S. Army during one \nof our Nation's most difficult hours. Private Keogh served valiantly \nwith the 9th Infantry Regiment of the 2nd Infantry Division until he \nfell to enemy mortar fire on March 17 when his position on Hill 355 of \nLittle Gibralter came under attack from Chinese forces.\n  Today I rise to honor Private Keogh and to thank his family for the \nsacrifice that this brave young man made for our country. Private \nKeogh's family has long sought American citizenship for their fallen \nloved one, and I pledge my support for this cause. Those who are \nwilling to make such great sacrifices for our Nation and our liberties \nhave earned the title of United States citizen, and deserve a special \nplace in the hearts of all Americans.\n  Our duty to honor those who serve on the front lines of our battle \nagainst tyranny, terrorism and hatred has become especially poignant in \nthe wake of our recent war with Iraq. I am pleased that Congress \nincluded language in the Department of Justice Authorization bill last \nyear to allow fallen heroes to receive the honor of citizenship. \nEfforts like this, and a strong commitment on the part of educators \nlike Assemblyman Bernie Anderson, Private Keogh's cousin to teach the \nnext generation of Nevadans about the sacrifices made in defense of our \nfreedoms, are essential for keeping America and our democratic ideals \nstrong. I salute Private Keogh and his family and look forward to the \nday very soon when this American hero will finally become an American \ncitizen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/20/senate-section/article/S6698-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6698-S6699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the\n\n[[Page S6699]]\n\nLocal Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes law, sending signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Humboldt, \nNebraska. Brandon Teena, 21, was brutally raped, beaten, and killed by \ntwo ``friends.'' Teena, who had been living as a man, befriended John \nLotter and Tom Nissen when she moved to Humboldt. After a local \nnewspaper revealed Teena's true identity as anatomically female, Lotter \nand Nissen became enraged. On Christmas Day 1993, the pair beat and \nraped Teena.

Mr. President, all of us who knew him and admired him \nand worked with him were deeply saddened earlier this month by the \nsudden and untimely death of Mike Jendrzejczyk, and we extend our \ndeepest condolences to his wife Janet and their family during this \ndifficult time. Mike was one of a kind, and his ability and dedication, \nhis tireless energy, his wonderful personality, and his many \nachievements for human rights will always be remenbered.\n  I met Mike soon after he came to Washington more than a decade ago to \nwork on human rights issues in Asia for the Washington, D.C. office of \nHuman Rights Watch. Mike's work benefitted all of us who care about \npromoting respect for human rights. We quickly learned that his last \nName was easy to pronounce even if we could never spell it. During the \ndebates on most-favored nation trade status for China, he was a \nconstant adviser to Senators and staff alike on the human rights \naspects of the issue. He also helped draft legislation on a code of \nconduct for U.S. companies operating in China, and his proposals set \nthe standard for many human rights codes developed by those firms.\n  I last saw Mike earlier this year as he escorted Xu Wenli, one of the \nmany Chinese dissidents he assisted, on a round of visits to meet with \nmembers of Congress. He greeted me with his trademark good welcome and \nthe unforgettable spirit and drive he brought to all his work. He was \nloved by everyone and his death is a great loss for all of us, and for \nthe cause of human rights he served so brilliantly,\n  I ask unanimously consent that a series of articles on Mike be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 4, 2003]\n\n          Michael Jendrzejczyk, 53, Advocate for Asians, Dies\n\n                         (By Elizabeth Becker)\n\n       Michael Jendrzejczyk, a human rights expert whose advocacy \n     on behalf of victims in Asian nations made him an unlikely \n     power broker in Washington, died on Thursday. He was 53 and \n     lived in Tacoma Park, Md.\n       He died after collapsing during a walk near his office in \n     Washington, has wife, Janet, said.\n       During more than a dozen years at the Washington office of \n     Human Rights Watch, Mr. Jendrzejczyk (pronounced jen-DREE-\n     zick) established himself as the Capitol's leading expert on \n     Asian human rights, routinely testifying before Congress, \n     writing opinion articles for newspapers and promoting his \n     causes.\n       He made his name after the 1989 Chinese military action in \n     Tiananmen Square by encouraging the United States to demand \n     that the victims be protected or, at least, accounted for.\n       He later became prominent in Asian human rights issues like \n     the protection of refugees from North Korea, ending financial \n     assistance to the military government in Burma, connecting \n     human rights to free trade and defending the religious \n     freedom of Tibetans in China and Montagnards in Vietnam.\n       What set him apart from advocates was his mastery of \n     details of subject as well as his networks of contacts with \n     officials, academics and dissidents he helped protect.\n       The House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, \n     said it would be ``difficult to count'' the contributions Mr. \n     Jendrzejczyk made in his promotion of human rights.\n       ``We can point to famous dissidents who have been released \n     from prison because of Mike, but there are tens of thousands \n     of ordinary people, whose names we'll never know, whose lives \n     were improved by his work,'' she said.\n       Mr. Jendrzejczyk, who was born and reared in New Britain, \n     Conn., was a graduate of the University of Hartford. He \n     joined the Army reserve during the Vietnam War but was \n     discharged as a conscientious objector.\n       He taught at a preschool while protesting the Vietnam War \n     and working in the civil rights movement. He became a peace \n     advocate for the Fellowship of Reconciliation in Nyack, N.Y., \n     and for Amnesty International in New York and London.\n       In addition to his wife, he is survived by his sister, Lynn \n     Ashmore of Willimantic, Conn.\n       He joked about the difficulty of pronouncing his surname, \n     telling others not to waste their time learning to say it or \n     spell it, but just to call him Mike J. His easy manner was \n     partly responsible for his wide reach.\n       Establishing himself in the relatively new field of human \n     rights advocacy in Washington, Mr. Jendrzejczyk broke ground \n     as a lobbyist for a cause without any obvious base of \n     support. Susan Osnos, former associate director of Human \n     Rights Watch, said he used information to promote his ideas.\n       ``Over the years he evolved into someone who worked well in \n     Washington, creating two-way streets that are the bread and \n     butter of getting things done, especially when you are \n     advocating things that people aren't naturally interested \n     in,'' she said.\n       His constituents were the Asian dissidents who might have \n     remained faceless without Mr. Jendrzejczyk's interventions. \n     Tibetans, Burmese, Chinese, Indonesians and other dissidents \n     came to rely on him as their most reliable voice in \n     Washington. When the Chinese dissident Liu Qing was released \n     after 11 years in prison, Mr. Jendrzejczyk took him around \n     Washington to explain to policy makers the human consequences \n     of their votes. Today Mr. Liu works for the New York-based \n     Human Rights in China.\n       During the final years of the Clinton administration, Mr. \n     Jendrzejczyk took many dissidents to meet Harold Hongju Koh, \n     a Yale law professor who was then an assistant secretary of \n     state for human rights. Mr. Koh said while Mr. Jendrzejczyk \n     pressed for countless changes in foreign policy to reflect \n     human rights concerns he was never irritated by his demands.\n       ``You start out in a professional relationship with him and \n     end up considering him a dear friend,'' Mr. Koh said. ``He \n     was one of those happy warriors who never let you forget that \n     you are holding a job not for personal gain but for the \n     betterment of American policy.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 4, 2003]\n\n                            A Quiet Champion\n\n       In the culture of federal Washington, no doubt as in all \n     cultures, there is a class of people who accomplish much by \n     seeking little credit. These people bring information to \n     reporters, suggest legislative language to Senate staffers, \n     introduce experts from different fields to promote \n     collaborations. Some do this work for profit, others for \n     principle. One of the latter was Mike Jendrzejczyk, who died \n     unexpectedly Thursday at age 53. He was far more influential \n     than famous, and his death is a setback to the cause of \n     freedom in Asia.\n       For Mr. Jendrzejczyk was in that subset of Washington \n     achievers known as human rights advocates: Specifically, he \n     was the Washington director of the Asia division of the \n     nonprofit organization Human Rights Watch. He was not the \n     sort of human rights champion who sneaks into totalitarian \n     countries and emerges with damning videotape, nor did he \n     devote much time to rhetoric or arcane points of \n     international law and doctrine. Mr. Jendrzejczyk believed in \n     getting things done. His ambitions were lofty, but they never \n     stood in the way of accomplishment. He would rather see two \n     dissidents freed from Chinese prisons than one, but he would \n     take one over zero--and over the years, the number of \n     political prisoners who owed their liberty in large part to \n     his persistence grew to a formidable total. He would have \n     liked to have seen democracy in China and Burma and Vietnam \n     yesterday if not sooner, but he worked hard for intermediate \n     steps: a loosening of political control, an improvement of \n     conditions for workers, a visit by a United Nations human \n     rights commissioner.\n       Those who knew Mike were always amazed at his perpetual \n     cheerfulness even as he sought to bring attention to the \n     worst horrors of human cruelty, to the sufferings of North \n     Korean refugees and Burmese child laborers. He understood \n     that human rights would always compete with commerce and \n     security and other national interests in the formulation of \n     foreign policy; he just wanted the voices of the oppressed \n     not to be drowned out altogether. He was influential in part \n     because his passion never diminished his honesty; if you \n     asked for the best argument on the other side, he would \n     deliver it, probably more eloquently than its true champions \n     could. He influenced us, and will continue to do so.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Human Rights Watch Mourns Death of Asia Advocate Mike Jendrzejczyk\n\n       New York, May 2, 2003.--Human Rights Watch is deeply \n     saddened to announce the\n\n[[Page S6700]]\n\n     death of our beloved colleague Mike Jendrzejczyk. Mike was \n     the Washington Director for the Asia division. He died of \n     natural causes in Washington, D.C. on May 1. He was 53.\n       Mike has left a void that simply cannot be filled--not only \n     as a powerful advocate for human rights, but also as a \n     colleague and friend whose infectious energy, and passion for \n     social justice inspired us all.\n       In his 13 years with Human Rights Watch, Mike was the \n     leading advocate in the United States on human rights in \n     Asia. His depth and breadth of knowledge was astounding. He \n     was widely respected for his expertise on China, Japan's \n     emerging global role, the World Bank and human rights, trade \n     policy and worker rights, and US foreign policy in Asia. He \n     was particularly engaged in seeking accountability for the \n     1989 Chinese military crackdown in Tiananmen Square, getting \n     assistance to North Korean refugees, denying funding to \n     abusive security forces across Asia, including Burma and \n     Indonesia, and in defending religious freedom for minorities \n     from Tibetans in China to Montagnards in Vietnam. In the past \n     several years, Mike was also increasingly engaged in South \n     Asian affairs, from the humanitarian consequences of the war \n     in Afghanistan, to the human rights consequences of the \n     military coup in Pakistan and the rise of religious \n     intolerance in India.\n       Mike, who grew up in Connecticut, was the grandson of \n     Polish immigrants, and an avid Bruce Springsteen fan. With \n     his white short sleeve dress shirts, yellow ties, and \n     contagious laugh, he used far more than his fair share of \n     exclamation points!! Colleagues joked that if you could \n     harness Mike's energy, it would power a small city. There's \n     no one in D.C. who didn't know him, and no one in military \n     fatigues in Asia who didn't have reason to fear him. He was \n     late for every meeting, but only because he was saving the \n     world on the other line. No email went unanswered, no phone \n     call went unreturned, and no opportunity to make a difference \n     was ever passed up. He has changed and saved the lives of so \n     many.\n       For those who didn't know Mike, a comment from Human Rights \n     Watch's former Asia Director Sidney Jones sums up the \n     difference he made in so many people's lives:\n       ``Mike has become an institution in DC. I have people I \n     barely know who, once they know I'm from Human Rights Watch, \n     begin to tell me how Mike is a national treasure; how \n     effective he is, and how knowledgeable and well plugged-in. \n     NGO colleagues from India to Indonesia know that by going \n     through Mike, they can get access to more and higher-level \n     officials than they can by going through anyone else.\n       Mike's ability to trade information is by now legendary. If \n     he's gone into the stock market, he could have made a \n     killing. He gets a piece of human rights news or gossip, \n     floats it, and watches it circulate as everybody in a \n     position to check it chases it down, and then waits until \n     they call him back with the facts, grateful for the heads up \n     he's given them.''\n       Mike first became involved in the human rights movement as \n     a Vietnam war protester in the 1970s and an anti-nuclear \n     demonstrator in the 1980s. He began working at Amnesty \n     International USA in the mid-1980's, then went on to work on \n     the staff of the Amnesty International Secretariat in London \n     in 1988. In 1990, he became Washington Director for the Asia \n     division of Human Rights Watch. Once a pre-school teacher, he \n     continued to teach us all.\n       Though most of us are unable still to correctly spell his \n     last name, we simply could not have gotten through each day \n     without him. It is hard to imagine how we will.\n       Our sincerest condolences go to Mike's wife, Janet.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, Mike Jendrzejczyk was an unusually decent \nman whose commitment to human freedom left an indelible imprint on all \nof us who knew him, and laid the foundation for a legacy of lasting \nimportance to the cause of human rights in Asia and the world.\n  Everybody who works on Asia in Washington knew Mike, and many of us \ncame to rely on his singular knowledge of human rights conditions \nacross Asia, as well as his operational ability to get things done by \nastutely working with and through the myriad components of our \ngovernment. Time and again, I found Mike to be a unique authority on \nthe human rights agenda in Asia, and an extremely skilled advocate who \nwas able to cajole, charm, shame, and ultimately convince his listener \nthat a particular human rights initiative was not only a moral \nimperative, but would best serve the national interest. Mike's \npragmatism never detracted from his high principles; on the contrary, \nthe combination of pragmatism and principle was what led people in \nGovernment to reach out to Mike, time and again, for advice on how to \nadvance the human rights agenda, given his unique talent for producing \ndeliverables, in terms of policy and legislation, that advanced human \nfreedom.\n  Mike was a man of unimpeachable integrity. You could trust his word \nand his judgment, a particularly admirable quality in Washington. He \ncould speak to so many audiences so well: whether to Burmese \ndissidents, Tibetan exiles, Cambodian reformers, Chinese activists, \nRepublicans, or Democrats, Mike had a way of engaging his listener \nwithout abandoning his trademark straight talk about practical \nsolutions to the grave challenges that confront those who fight \noppression every day. Mike had a friendly way of co-opting many of his \nallies, making them want to pursue the goals he had laid out, with the \nmeans he had proposed, in order to earn his respect and, as \nimportantly, the respect associated with those causes that met with his \napproval.\n  Mike was in the process of helping my staff draft a bill related to \nhuman rights in Vietnam when we lost him. Just as he accomplished so \nmuch, Mike left behind so much more to do. I'd like to think Mike will \nremain a voice of conscience to each of us who had the privilege of \nworking with him, and who found his work inspiring. Perhaps each of us \nwill try a little harder to fill the space Mike left behind in his \nquest to advance the cause of basic human dignity, and hope.\n  There was no one like Mike. But if Mike's memory doesn't fade; if we \nstill rhetorically fumble his amazing last name in recollecting his \nfull life; if we each absorb a small bit of the energy that drove him; \nand if we are true to the principles he held so deeply, reminding us of \nour own obligation to uphold them as well, he will stay with us, and \nfreedom's light will shine a little more brightly for it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on May 1, 2003, the world lost one of those \nrare people who die long before their time but who touch the lives of \nmore people than most of us do in a lifetime far longer.\n  I did not know Mike Jendrzejczyk well, although I had met him. I did \nknow of his work, and my staff worked closely with him for over a \ndecade. Shortly after Mike's sudden death, the New York Times and the \nWashington Post printed obituaries which described at length Mike's \nextraordinary career. I will not repeat what was written there, other \nthan to say that they were remarkable for a person so young. They \nportrayed very movingly the extent and impact of Mike's work in the \nfield of human rights.\n  It was because of Mike Jendrzejczyk and his colleague Sidney Jones at \nHuman Rights Watch that I first became concerned about human rights \nviolations in East Timor and Indonesia. In 1991, it was Mike's \nencouragement and advice that enabled me to sponsor the amendment which \nprohibited Indonesian military officers from participating in the \nInternational Military Education and Training program, after they \nslaughtered an estimated 200 peaceful demonstrators in a cemetery in \nDili, East Timor. It was also Mike who helped me with a similar \namendment after the Indonesian military orchestrated the mayhem in East \nTimor following the independence referendum there in 1999. Those were \ndifficult issues, and the amendments were controversial. Without Mike's \nguidance, they would not have become law.\n  Today, as the Indonesian military launches a major attack against \nrebels in Aceh, the potential for widespread human rights violations is \nof great concern. Mike's absence will make it far harder for us to \nmonitor what is happening there, and people in Aceh and throughout Asia \nwill suffer because he is no longer here to stand up for them.\n  Mike was also a regular source of information and advice on Burma, \nCambodia, and China, and many of the initiatives we have undertaken in \nthose countries were a result of his input. I can remember an \nappearance of Mike's on ABC's Nightline when he spoke passionately \nabout human rights in China.\n  Mike was so effective because of his ability to balance his deeply \nheld beliefs about human rights with his understanding of the political \nrealities we deal with every day here. He was a close observer of \nevents in Southeast Asia. He saw opportunities for the U.S. Government \nto act to support the development of civil society and to protect human \nrights, the rule of law, and individuals who were persecuted for their \npolitical beliefs, and his recommendations to us of what action to take \nreflected his best judgment of what was possible.\n\n[[Page S6701]]\n\n  Anyone who knew Mike, as my staff did over the course of so many \nyears, saw that he was motivated out of a deep commitment to the rights \nand freedoms that the United States stands for. He believed, as I do, \nthat those rights and freedoms are universal, and that Asians, like \npeople in so many countries, yearn deeply for the right to express \nthemselves and to associate freely, without fear of persecution. \nThroughout his career, Mike was a source of hope and support to \nthousands of people who he never met.\n  His goal was for Asian people to have the chance to enjoy those same \nrights and freedoms, and for the United States to live up to its own \nideals, and he worked tirelessly to achieve those goals. They are goals \nI share, as do many others here. They are goals that I will continue to \nwork towards in Mike Jendrzejczyk's memory.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to remember and pay \ntribute to Mike Jendrzejczyk, a tireless and dedicated champion of \nhuman rights who passed away earlier this month. A gaping hole has been \nleft with his passing, but his life and commitment to fundamental \nvalues we all cherish will continue to inspire and motivate us all.\n  As the Washington director for the Asia Division of Human Rights \nWatch for 13 years, Mike became an institution in this city and a \nleader in his field. Few human rights issues in Asia escaped his \nattention and few of his colleagues could surpass his knowledge and \nlevel of expertise.\n  As Human Rights Watch noted, ``There's no one in D.C. who didn't know \nhim, and no one in military fatigues in Asia who didn't have a reason \nto fear him.''\n  From Burma and Indonesia, to Vietnam and North Korea, Mike spoke up \nfor those who could not speak for themselves. He shined a light on \nhuman rights abuses and made it his mission to see that justice was \ndone. Time and time again he called on the United States to live up to \nthe values that made this country great and be the leader for human \nrights that the world so desperately needed.\n  Recently, my office had worked with Mike on the need to bring safety \nand stability to the people of Afghanistan, particularly women and \ngirls. We have lost a partner in that endeavor, but we have not lost \nthe example he set, and I know his memory will push us to work even \nharder in the days and weeks ahead.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Janet and his colleagues \nand friends at Human Rights Watch. Mike Jendrzejczyk will be sorely \nmissed.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I honor the late Mike \nJendrzejczyk, the Washington director for the Asia division of Human \nRights Watch, and a voice I have trusted and valued for many years. \nMike was kind, smart, unquestionably committed, and amazingly \nenergetic. He kept so many of us in Congress informed, always combining \nsavvy and idealism in his updates and enthusiastic calls to action. He \nbrought extraordinary human rights leaders from Asia to the Hill, and \nby connecting us to these courageous people, he helped to round out our \nview of faraway places--showing us not just the ugly reality of abuse, \nbut also the promise and bravery of those who resist.\n  By introducing Washington to these heros, Mike turned resignation to \nresolve and did the crucial work of sustaining momentum for action and \nchange. He became a hero himself. Mike helped countless people overseas \nin profound ways, but he helped the Congress as well. Mike helped us to \nbelieve that it is possible to do the right thing. His death is a \nterrible loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/20/senate-section/article/S6701-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRADE FACILITATION AND SECURITY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Mr. Baucus, I \nask unanimous consent the following statement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Customs Revenue Functions and Homeland Security\n\n       Mr. President, On May 15, 2003, Treasury Secretary Snow \n     signed Treasury Department order No. 100-15, which delegates \n     authority related to certain revenue functions of the Bureau \n     of Customs and Border Protection from the Department of \n     Treasury to the Department of Homeland Security.\n       The Treasury order identifies a number of essentially \n     commercial Customs functions over which the Secretary of the \n     Treasury will continue to exercise sole authority to approve \n     regulations, including import quotas, classification and \n     valuation of imports under the U.S. Harmonized Tariff \n     Schedules, eligibility for trade preference programs, marking \n     and labeling regulations, and copyright and trademark \n     enforcement. Authority to approve other regulations will now \n     fall under the authority of the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security.\n       The Customs Bureau serves two vital functions. One function \n     is to protect our borders by making sure the goods that enter \n     our country and the vehicles that carry them do not present a \n     threat to the security of our nation. Customs also plays an \n     equally critical role in supporting our country's economic \n     security. By facilitating the movement of critical goods to \n     American industry and its customers at home and abroad, \n     Customs assures our continued economic growth and vitality. \n     We are pleased that the Administration has worked with us to \n     craft a division of responsibilities between Homeland \n     Security and Treasury that recognizes the importance of both \n     these functions.\n       The new Treasury order is intended to strike a balance \n     between trade facilitation and security, but there remain \n     concerns that the scope of authority remaining at Treasury \n     may be too narrow. Over time and with experience, we may \n     conclude that the balance requires further adjustment. The \n     Treasury order calls for a review in twelve months. Two \n     months prior to expiration, the Administration is required to \n     consult closely with Congress on the upcoming review, and \n     discuss where further adjustments to the division of \n     authorities are warranted.\n       We look forward to our continued work with the \n     Administration as the new division of authorities takes \n     effect. The Finance Committee remains committed to the goal \n     of assuring that Customs and our nation can advance the twin \n     goals of enhancing homeland security and promoting economic \n     growth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/20/senate-section/article/S6701-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6701-S6702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING MARINE MATTHEW R. SMITH\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with great sadness and \ntremendous gratitude to honor the life of a fellow Hoosier, soldier, \nfamily man and friend, Matthew R. Smith, who died serving our country \nin Kuwait on May 10, 2003.\n  As those who knew Matthew can attest, his strong commitment to his \nState and country was reflected in his successful and distinguished \ncareer. He was the younger of two children and attended Indiana \nUniversity. He stood about 5 feet 8 inches and weighed 140 pounds, but \nnever let his small stature keep him from big accomplishments.\n  In the Marine Reserve, Matthew served as a radio operator and was \ndeployed to Kuwait in February. He traveled all the way to Baghdad \nduring the war and had since been working on essential supply convoys. \nAs a reservist with the 4th Force Service support group based in Peru, \nMatthew met an untimely death while driving in a military convoy. Chief \nWarrant Officer Suzanne Handshoe, who was his commanding officer in a \ntraining trip last summer to the Mojave Desert, remembered Matthew as \nan overachiever saying that he was ``a small guy, but was an extremely \nhard-working, can-do Marine.'' The day his son passed away, his father, \nDavid Smith received the first letter from his son since his \ndeployment. In it, Matthew told his dad how proud he was to be overseas \nfighting for his country's freedom.\n  President Abraham Lincoln wrote in a letter to the mother of a fallen \nUnion soldier: ``I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the \nanguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of \nthe loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have \nlaid so costly a sacrifice upon the alter of freedom.'' These words \nring as true today as they did 140 years ago, as we mourn the loss of \nMatthew R.

SMITH\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with great sadness and \ntremendous gratitude to honor the life of a fellow Hoosier, soldier, \nfamily man and friend, Matthew R. Smith, who died serving our country \nin Kuwait on May 10, 2003.\n  As those who knew Matthew can attest, his strong commitment to his \nState and country was reflected in his successful and distinguished \ncareer. He was the younger of two children and attended Indiana \nUniversity. He stood about 5 feet 8 inches and weighed 140 pounds, but \nnever let his small stature keep him from big accomplishments.\n  In the Marine Reserve, Matthew served as a radio operator and was \ndeployed to Kuwait in February. He traveled all the way to Baghdad \nduring the war and had since been working on essential supply convoys. \nAs a reservist with the 4th Force Service support group based in Peru, \nMatthew met an untimely death while driving in a military convoy. Chief \nWarrant Officer Suzanne Handshoe, who was his commanding officer in a \ntraining trip last summer to the Mojave Desert, remembered Matthew as \nan overachiever saying that he was ``a small guy, but was an extremely \nhard-working, can-do Marine.'' The day his son passed away, his father, \nDavid Smith received the first letter from his son since his \ndeployment. In it, Matthew told his dad how proud he was to be overseas \nfighting for his country's freedom.\n  President Abraham Lincoln wrote in a letter to the mother of a fallen \nUnion soldier: ``I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the \nanguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of \nthe loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have \nlaid so costly a sacrifice upon the alter of freedom.'' These words \nring as true today as they did 140 years ago, as we mourn the loss of \nMatthew R. Smith and honor the sacrifice he made for America and for \nall humanity.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Matthew R. Smith in the \nofficial record of the Senate for his service to this country and for \nhis profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think \nabout this just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain \nthat comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that Matthew's family \ncan find comfort in the word of the prophet Isaiah who said, ``He will \nswallow up death in victory; and the lord God will wipe away tears from \nall faces.\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God \nbless the United States of America.\n\n[[Page S6702]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/20/senate-section/article/S6702-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            HEALTHY FORESTS\n\n  Mr. DOMENIC. Mr. President, an article from today's Los Angeles Times \ntitled ``Fire Threat is Red-Hot in Parched West,'' outlines the threat \nwildfire poses to millions of acres of dense forests. The \nadministration estimates that 190 million acres of forests are at risk \nfor wildfire this summer. That threat is particularly ominous in the \nWest, where years of drought have left our forests tinder dry. The Los \nAngeles Times notes that public opposition to forest thinning is waning \nbecause the public understands the relationship between dense forests \nand devastating fires. I applaud this public awareness and the growing \npublic support for President Bush's Healthy Forest Initiative.\n  I congratulate President Bush for his vision and leadership in \ncreating the Healthy Forest Initiative. His remarks today precisely \noutlined the crisis and proposed the right solution. Congress must act \nswiftly to rescue our national forests from years of neglect and \nmismanagement.\n  Next month, Senator Craig and I will introduce legislation that \nreflects the priorities of the Healthy Forest Initiative as well as the \npriorities of the bipartisan House forest management bill.\n  In the last decade, we have seen endemic litigation cause management \nparalysis in the Forest Service. This has cost us lives, communities \nand nearly 30 million acres of once beautiful forests--all lost \nneedlessly to fire. I share President Bush's commitment to return to \nwise and proactive managing our forests to protect our environment and \nour rural communities.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the article I referred to in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, May 20, 2003]\n\n                 Fire Threat Is Red-Hot in Parched West\n\n                            (By Tom Gorman)\n\n       Zion National Park, Utah.--Park ranger David Eaker walks \n     through a field thick with grass as tall as his waist and \n     deceptive in its greenery.\n       Don't think for a minute, he says, that the drought is over \n     and the risk of fire has decreased in the West.\n       Spring rains here and elsewhere have nourished fresh \n     growth, belying the continuing, deep effects of the drought. \n     For the last three years, Zion has been too dry even for \n     grass, and now long-dormant grass seeds have sprouted across \n     meadows and mesas.\n       ``But this will all be brown by late June or early July,'' \n     Eaker said, ``and when it dries out, it will be nothing but \n     fine fuel.''\n       If the grass ignites, whether from a tourist's cigarette in \n     Zion Canyon or by lightning strikes in the upper reaches of \n     the vermilion-streaked sandstone mountains, the brittle \n     ponderosa and pinyon pines and junipers will burst into \n     flames.\n       Last summer, fires burned 7.1 million acres and 815 homes \n     and other structures, mostly in the West. Zion escaped with \n     eight small fires, scorching only 18 acres.\n       With parched forests and weather conditions that are \n     expected to remain dry and hot, fire officials are braced for \n     another dangerous season of wildfires. Eaker's park is almost \n     dead center in the region where the drought will persist, \n     according to projections issued Thursday by the National \n     Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction \n     Center.\n       The forecast through August shows that the drought, which \n     began in 1999, may worsen from southern Idaho and \n     southwestern Wyoming southward to the Mexican border. Some of \n     the regions last summer experienced the driest months in \n     recorded history, with trees drier than kiln-dried lumber.\n       Ed O'Lenic, senior meteorologist at the Climate Prediction \n     Center, said heavier-than-normal rainfall is expected in late \n     July and August across southern Nevada, Arizona, southern \n     Utah, western Colorado and much of New Mexico. Still, he \n     said, there won't be enough rain to erase the ravages caused \n     by three years of sustained drought.\n       While the coastline areas from San Diego to Seattle are \n     drought-free, conditions change rapidly within miles and \n     remain bleak across entire states. In woodlands from the San \n     Bernardino Mountains to the high desert of Santa Fe, N.M., \n     hundreds of thousands of acres of ponderosa and pinyon pine--\n     the most prevalent trees of the arid West--are dead or dying, \n     weakened first by a lack of moisture and then by burrowing \n     insects.\n       ``Even if we get above-normal rainfall, we may still see \n     extreme fire behavior,'' said Tom Wordell, wildland fire \n     analyst for the U.S. Forest Service. Computer modeling, he \n     said, predicts that fire will spread at twice the normal rate \n     among the weakened trees.\n       A key to firefighting is anticipating where fires will \n     break out and placing personnel and equipment in the region \n     ahead of time, said Kim Christensen, who coordinates \n     firefighting logistics at the National Interagency Fire \n     Center in Boise, Idaho.\n       The fire center predicts wildfires by charting which \n     forests are the densest because they have burned the least in \n     recent years, analyzing the moisture content of the most \n     flammable trees and brush, and monitoring weather fronts that \n     may spawn lightning-laced thunderstorms.\n       A handful of firefighters can be assigned to areas of \n     advancing lightning storms and, in the most vulnerable areas, \n     hundreds of firefighters and air tankers, managed by a \n     military-like command structure, can be positioned for a \n     quick response. About 99 percent of fires are extinguished by \n     the first firefighters on the scene, officials said.\n       Last year at this time, when big fires already were burning \n     in New Mexico and Arizona, thousands of firefighters were \n     flown to a staging area in Albuquerque, cutting response time \n     by several days.\n       On July 31, the busiest day of last year's fire season, 31 \n     large blazes were burning across the nation, 148 new fires \n     erupted and fire bosses had to decide where to dispatch \n     28,000 wildland firefighters, 1,205 engines, 30 air tankers \n     and 188 helicopters.\n       Because this year's fire season has started more slowly, \n     air tankers have been sent only to Alaska and Minnesota, \n     where current weather conditions make them more susceptible \n     to wildfires.\n       In another effort to reduce fires, foresters throughout the \n     country, in line with the 2-year-old National Fire Plan, are \n     thinning woods. Most of last summer's worst fires gorged on \n     forests overgrown with small trees and brush because of a \n     decades-long national policy to extinguish fires as quickly \n     as possible. Had fires been allowed to burn in previous \n     years, experts concede, those forests would have provided \n     less fuel for subsequent fires.\n       Some environmental groups have filed lawsuits to block \n     forest thinning, and neighboring communities have complained \n     about the smoke of prescribed fires. But public opposition is \n     waning because ``there's a much broader awareness of the \n     relationship between overly dense forests and large, \n     difficult-to-control fires,'' said Tim Hartzell, who heads \n     the wildland fire coordination office for the National \n     Park Service.\n       ``Our approach is very surgical, targeting the highest-\n     priority areas, especially in terms of preventing a fire from \n     roaring into a town,'' he said.\n       Fire officials have identified about 190 million acres of \n     federal land, mostly in the West, that are considered at high \n     risk for catastrophic blazes this summer. Of that, 2.4 \n     million acres were thinned last year and an additional 1.4 \n     million acres have been thinned so far this year, said Corbin \n     Newman, who coordinates the National Fire Plan for the U.S. \n     Forest Service.\n       Crews thin specific areas in forests where the spread of \n     fire can best be slowed, he said, with greater attention to \n     areas near residential development or areas that are critical \n     for watershed and wildlife habitat.\n       Fiercely burning fires are only one outgrowth of the \n     drought. Farmers have less water for crops, and with hay and \n     alfalfa production retarded, cattlemen are supplementing feed \n     for their breeding stock with federal-surplus powdered milk. \n     Environmentalists from Northern California's Klamath Basin to \n     New Mexico's Rio Grande want water released from reservoirs \n     to sustain endangered fish, at the expense of farmers and \n     urban dwellers complaining of water restrictions.\n       In Colorado, a late-winter snowstorm has allowed Boulder to \n     lift water restrictions, but in nearby Aurora, which relies \n     on a different watershed, there is a continuing prohibition \n     against the planting of sod, restrictions on new developments \n     and limits to landscape watering.\n       ``We didn't get in the drought in a year and we won't get \n     out of it in a year,'' said Jack Byers, deputy state engineer \n     for the Colorado Division of Water Resources.\n       The Western Governors' Assn. pushed unsuccessfully last \n     year for Congress to assign a federal agency to oversee \n     drought planning and response. New legislation will be \n     reintroduced in coming weeks, said Nebraska Gov. Mike \n     Johanns.\n       ``Drought is every bit as significant a natural disaster as \n     a tornado, hurricane or flood,'' Johenns said. ``But federal \n     policy in this area has been very hit-and-miss. We need to \n     focus the best science available on predicting drought and in \n     planning strategies to respond to it.\n       Politics aside, park ranger Eaker is wrestling with \n     realities. Crews at Zion, in southwestern Utah, are thinning \n     trees near park employee residences, and firefighters remain \n     alert to thunderheads that may unleash lightning.\n       ``Last year at this time the flow of water through our fork \n     of the Virgin River was 5% of normal,'' he said.\n       ``It's now flowing at 40% normal, but soil moisture is \n     still low, and now we have more grass fuel than we've seen in \n     years. Our anxiety about fire is as high as ever.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/20/senate-section/article/S6702-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6702-S6705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REMEMBERING FORMER SENATOR RUSSELL LONG\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nthe greatest Senators to have ever served in this body, the late \nSenator Russell Long. Born in 1918, Russell Long came from a long line \nof Louisiana political elites. From the beginning of his career\n\n[[Page S6703]]\n\nas a public servant, Russell wanted to distinguish his career from that \nof his father and to make his own mark. No doubt, his distinguished \nleadership and passion for serving people allowed him to create a \nlegacy that will be remembered by the people of Louisiana and this \nNation for a long time to come. Although he is no longer with us, the \nlegacy of his work and the relationships he fostered will live on \nforever.\n  For 38 years, Russell Long engaged in the debate of this Chamber. \nWhile he was a loyal Democrat, Russell always believed in putting \nprinciple above politics. His long list of accomplishments is a \ntestament to that value. His Earned Income Tax Credit, EITC, has proven \ntime and time again to be one of the most effective methods for helping \nlow-income workers stay off of welfare. Every year, the EITC helps \nmillions of Americans raise themselves out of poverty. Similarly, his \nefforts to expand Social Security to include coverage for the disabled \nhave saved tens of millions of lives over the past 50 years. These are \nbut a few of the many ways that Russell used his vast knowledge of the \nTax Code and his position as Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee \nto champion the poor and downtrodden.\n  Russell Long will not only be remembered for his incredible \nintelligence, but also for his kind, jovial manner. Always ready with a \nquick story or a witty one-liner, Russell was well known for trying to \nease tensions during difficult debates. His calm presence was a \nunifying force that could negotiate both sides of an issue fairly and \nrespectfully. His frequent practice of wrapping his arm around a \ncolleague and pulling his colleague so close that he could whisper in \nhis ear, helped to keep his friends abundant and his enemies rare. \nEveryone liked and respected Russell; few public servants can claim \nsuch a distinction.\n  In my 23 years of public service, I cannot count how many times I \nhave looked to him as an example. Russell Long set a benchmark for \nservice to the people of our State--a benchmark we all still strive to \nmeet today. I challenge my colleagues to honor his memory and the \nspirit of bipartisanship his career embodied. What mattered to Russell \nwas that justice was served and the policies put forward by the U.S. \nSenate were both equitable and fair. Faced with a growing deficit and \nan ongoing war on terrorism, these principles are now more important \nthan ever.\n  I end my remarks with words from the eulogy delivered by my \npredecessor and Russell's colleague, former Senator J. Bennett \nJohnston, at Russell's funeral:\n\n       Eighty-four years ago, Russell Long entered this life as \n     Huey P. Long Junior. The legendary kingfish thought better of \n     it shortly after and renamed him Russell, and said, ``that \n     boy has to make a name for himself.'' And what a name he \n     made. He served 38 years in the U.S. Senate, 16 of those \n     years as the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, longer \n     continuous service in that position than anybody else in the \n     history of the U.S. Senate.\n       President-elect Jimmy Carter used to say that he was sent \n     to Washington to run the country and got there and found out \n     Russell Long was already running it. Jimmy Carter may have \n     been exaggerating, but he wasn't exaggerating by very much.\n       Russell Long understood that with the tax code we can make \n     water run up hill, and for those who are thirsty and in need \n     that was a great phenomenon for Russell Long to be able to \n     perform, and this State and this Nation for decidedly better \n     because of it.\n       His legislative victories are legend. If Russell didn't \n     invent bipartisanship he certainly perfected the art. All of \n     the presidents with whom he served had both respect and \n     affection, and occasionally consternation, with Russell.\n       He had a legendary relationship with LBJ. When LBJ had a \n     provision he wanted to pass in regards to agricultural aid to \n     India, Russell said I can't help you, I can't help you, I am \n     against it. Well, LBJ's top aide Bill Moyers called back in a \n     little while and said, ``Why don't you come by the White \n     House this evening, just a quiet dinner.'' And Russell said, \n     ``I'm glad to go by the White House, the president is my \n     friend, but I do not want to talk about agricultural aid to \n     India.'' And Bill said, ``Well, that's a deal.'' So they were \n     sitting in the family room after dinner, just the three of \n     them in their rocking chairs, and after a couple of hours \n     Russell got up to go home, and the president said, ``Now one \n     more thing,'' and Russell's eyes shot through him And LBJ \n     said to him, ``You know that fifth circuit judge from \n     Louisiana you recommended. We'll, we've got a candidate from \n     Texas who's pretty good, too.'' And nothing else was said. \n     You know Texas and Louisiana share the fifth circuit. Well \n     the next morning Russell told his staff, ``Call Bill Moyers, \n     tell him we have an understanding.''\n       Nixon called him the partisan of principle, and indeed he \n     was. But he had a few characteristics which I think are neat. \n     He had a fifth gear he could slip into legislatively. He knew \n     when to hold 'em, when to fold 'em, when to bring 'em up for \n     a vote, when the time was right, what arguments would appeal. \n     And it was an amazing thing to watch. One of his most \n     enduring characteristics was his sense of humor.\n       Russell was always popular with people but he never \n     hesitated to go along with something unpopular when it was a \n     matter of principle. He voted for the Panama Canal because it \n     was a matter of principle. Russell Long had a side that was \n     unknown to the public. Always he was up. He was the most fun \n     person to be with. Anywhere it was fun to be with Russell \n     Long. But he was also sweet and gentle. My 16 years serving \n     as Russell's colleague are among the most pleasant memories \n     of my life.\n       He's a legend. A friend. A statesman. He will always be \n     bright and shining within us.\n\n  Bennett's words about Russell are so true. Russell's abilities as a \nSenator are legendary. His passing is a tremendous loss, but his \nservice in the U.S. Senate was a great gift to this body, the State of \nLouisiana, and the entire country.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an excerpt from his \nofficial obituary and two articles on his life from the Baton Rouge \nAdvocate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Baton Rouge Advocate, May 13, 2003]\n\n                    Russell B. Long, Legacy to Power\n\n       Russell B. Long had twice as long on this Earth as his \n     father, who died at 42 by an assassin's hand. Huey P. Long \n     was one of the most controversial men in America, and there \n     were many who did not mourn his passing.\n       His oldest son will be buried today in Baton Rouge amid \n     real grief at his passing last week, an with great respect \n     for his accomplishments.\n       It was certainly not that Russell Long failed to be \n     involved in the great battles of his day. He was sent to the \n     U.S. Senate in 1948, succeeding John H. Overton, and served \n     until he retired and was replaced in the 1986 election by \n     John Breaux, who has held the seat since.\n       During his 38 years in the Senate, Long held leadership \n     positions and chaired the Finance Committee, and was \n     intimately involved in the most momentous issues facing the \n     nation. He served on equal terms with giants such as Lyndon \n     B. Johnson at the apex of the Senate's power in American \n     government.\n       But if Long moved all his life among the great, he \n     distinguished himself not by emulating his father's colorful \n     oratory but by mastering the governing process. There were \n     probably few more humble and self-effacing men in Washington \n     life, and he made lifelong friends of many of those with whom \n     he served.\n       Nevertheless, his legislative skills became legend. He had \n     a fund of Uncle Earl stories to fall back on, but as often as \n     not he was buying time, waiting for the right moment to \n     introduce a skillfully drawn amendment or to strike the deal \n     that would advance both a piece of legislation and \n     Louisiana's interests.\n       He could judge the opportune time to strike in the Senate, \n     but he also could be astutely tone-deaf. There is a famous \n     story about President Kennedy lobbying Long for a vote, and \n     Long pretending not to hear and continuing to bring up the \n     subject of Fort Polk. The president got the message: The \n     senator would help the president if the president would help \n     the senator protect the military installation in Long's home \n     state.\n       Long was powerful and used his position to bring jobs and \n     projects to Louisiana. No one more diligently protected the \n     oil industry, and shrugged off accusations that he was \n     protecting his own substantial oil an gas properties. If he \n     thought the depletion allowance was good for Louisiana, it \n     would remain in law--and it did, probably too long. But it \n     had a friend in the Senate, and that was Russell Long.\n       Long's aide and biographer, Bob Mann, titled his book \n     ``Legacy to Power.'' The power was manifest, but Long's role \n     as the legacy of his populist father often was questioned in \n     years when liberal Democrats saw Long as too prone to support \n     corporate interests.\n       It is true that he became more conservative over time. But \n     many of Long's greatest legislative accomplishments were not \n     for oil and gas, or other business interests. They were for \n     Social Security and Medicare, expanding the role of \n     government in protecting poor people and the elderly from \n     privation.\n       In retirement and not often in the news in his later years, \n     Long's own legacy might not be fully appreciated in the \n     humble homes that he worked to protect and make whole against \n     the vicissitudes of life.\n       He proved himself worthy of his father's best ideals.\n\n[[Page S6704]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n             [From the Baton Rouge Advocate, May 13, 2003]\n\n               Long Brought Wisdom, Joy to D.C. Politics\n\n                           (By Joan McKinney)\n\n       Russell Long is being buried today. He's been gone from the \n     U.S. Senate for 17 years. If you are young or new to \n     Louisiana--oh, how unlucky you are to have missed him.\n       In the three days since his death, there's been every \n     conceivable claim about Long's importance to the politics and \n     economic life of Louisiana, and the impact he had--and still \n     has--on everybody in the taxpaying workplace, from the \n     richest corporate officer to the poorest wage earner.\n       Believe the claims. They're true.\n       But what Long did to, and with, the federal tax code as \n     chairman of the Senate Finance Committee--as huge as that \n     work was--that alone would not account for the way we \n     remember him. We remember him in Washington with alternating \n     awe and amusement. Respect and laughter. What finer things \n     could anyone leave behind?\n       The most fabulous things about Long were, first and \n     foremost, his awesome brilliance, and, second, his . . . his \n     what? The whole hilarious package of him: the Uncle Earl \n     stories; the Southernisms; the get-to-the-heart of it one \n     liners; the way he'd go red in the face and flail his arms \n     around when he spoke on the Senate floor and go worked up--\n     which was just about any time he gave a floor speech.\n       There was also the body bend. Long would start that arm a-\n     flailing. Maybe he'd pump a fist in the air. Then he'd start \n     pumping both arms up and down. Soon, he'd be pumping so hard \n     that he'd bend at the waist.\n       Like the chicken and the egg, who knows what came first--\n     the body bend or the baggy pants? Long was renowned for those \n     pants.\n       Rafael Bermudez, a former Long aide living in Baton Rouge, \n     tells a story of accompanying Long on a shopping trip. The \n     senator, he said, pulled a huge pair of pants off the rack, \n     put them on, went to a full-length mirror, and bent over to \n     make sure the pants were still comfortable in the toe-\n     touching position.\n       Indeed, Long was one of the Senate's greatest entertainers. \n     Yet it was hard to quote him. He would complete a virtuoso \n     performance, win every showdown in every amendment--and you'd \n     go back to your notes, and there'd be only fragments. Long \n     regularly dispensed with sentence structure. Free-associating \n     ideas and concepts would rush out of him, and it was obvious \n     that his nimble mind was racing way ahead of his tongue. \n     Often he'd be having so much fun that he'd start squeaking \n     and chortling, and he couldn't complete the thought.\n       And he'd stutter. Or mumble.\n       Cheryl Arvidson, a former news bureau chief and wire \n     service reporter, said this week, ``He often mumbled very \n     badly, deliberately at times I think.\n       She recalled that Steve Gerstel, UPI's legendary Senate \n     chief, ordered her to closely monitor the Senate whenever it \n     was nearing adjournment, and ``especially when Russell Long \n     walked out on the floor.'' Gerstel had warned that, ``Russell \n     will walk out, belch, and we'll have an entirely new tax \n     code.''\n       Long's rambling speech pattern was a poor indicator of his \n     coherent thought process. Long knew the most arcane of Senate \n     rules and was a genius at parliamentary maneuver. He seemed \n     to have total recall of the tax code and all IRS regulations \n     interpreting it.\n       In my three decades of reporting, Long is the only \n     politician whose intellect so intimidated me that I studied \n     late at night for his occasional briefings with the Louisiana \n     press corps. Any decent reporter tries to be well-grounded \n     for any interview. With Russell Long, it was more like panic \n     cramming for a college exam. You wanted the questions to do \n     justice to the intellect.\n       And you didn't want to be snookered. Russell Long could \n     snooker you.\n       Everybody knew that a Long tax bill would be chock-full of \n     provisions benefiting one or other Louisiana corporate \n     interest. Sugar and oil and gas were particular favorites, \n     but no Louisiana business was too insignificant for a tax \n     break.\n       Usually, these things were hidden in the fine print and \n     went undiscovered until after the bill had passed. A former \n     reporter, Eileen Shanahan, found one of these provisions \n     while a Long tax bill was still pending, and she wrote about \n     it in The New York Times--also explaining that the provision \n     could enhance the value of Long's own oil and gas holdings.\n       The Senator made a floor speech and (memory fails a \n     little), he either killed the provision or modified it to \n     exclude his family's interests. When Shanahan next came into \n     the Senate Press Gallery, she got an ovation from reporter \n     colleagues. Not being snookered by Russell Long was that \n     rare.\n       The Senator was unrepentant about legislation to help the \n     industry that made him rich. Anything that helped oil and gas \n     would help the Louisiana economy, he said.\n       Long said that he was proudest of authoring two tax code \n     provisions for wage earners. The first was the Earned Income \n     Tax Credit that pays cash to people who work but make too \n     little money to pay federal income taxes. If the federal \n     government subsidized welfare recipients who weren't \n     employed, it should also subsidize the ``working poor'' so \n     that welfare was not more generous than employment, Long \n     said.\n       His other pride was the Employee Stock Ownership Plan. ESOP \n     gives companies a tax break for helping employees buy shares \n     of company ownership.\n       Long was a Democrat, but--EITC and ESOP, notwithstanding--\n     liberals didn't find much to love about his work. He was a \n     defense hawk. He seldom met an environmental regulation that \n     he liked, especially one that curbed the practices of oil and \n     gas or agriculture. He seldom met a public works project that \n     he disliked. Highways, channel dredgings, flood control--he \n     supported them all.\n       But Long wasn't a conservative ideologue, either. Sometimes \n     he was a tax-cutter. But he also taxed-and-spent with the \n     most ardent liberal.\n       Somebody had to pay for Social Security and Medicare, he \n     thought. And he'd noticed that many anti-taxers and anti-\n     government business people lined up for government contracts, \n     or for bailouts when things went bad. Long ridiculed that \n     mind-set, reciting this ditty so often it should be chanted \n     at his funeral: ``Don't tax me. Don't tax thee. Tax that \n     fella behind the tree.''\n       My favorite Long body language was the neck wrap. He'd \n     throw out an arm, wrap it all the way around somebody's neck, \n     and pull 'em close to whisper in an ear. Sometimes, it was a \n     combination move--neck wrap followed by bear hug.\n       Years ago, former Vice President and late Sen. Hubert \n     Humphrey, D-Minn. visited the Senate floor. He was dying of \n     cancer, and everybody knew that this was his goodbye. Long \n     went to Humphrey and gave him the combination. If there was a \n     dry eye in the chamber, it wasn't mine. If anybody ever \n     practiced the Joy of Politics, it was Long. Today's bitter \n     politics could sorely use the palm of his joy.\n       Hopefully, The Advocate adequately reported during the \n     years on the facts of Long's legislating. My own journalism \n     failed him on a larger score. You just could not capture on \n     the written page the twinkle in the man's eye.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                        Senator Russell B. Long,\n\n       Former Senator Russell Billiu Long, who served Louisiana in \n     the United States Senate for 38 years, died on Friday, May 9, \n     2003, in Washington, DC. He was 84 years old. The son of Huey \n     Pierce Long and Rose McConnell Long, he was born in \n     Shreveport on November 3, 1918. He attended public schools in \n     Shreveport, Baton Rouge, and New Orleans and graduated from \n     Louisiana State University at Baton Rouge in 1939 and from \n     its law school in 1942. In 1938, he was elected LSU's Student \n     Body President. At LSU, he was a member of Delta Kappa \n     Epsilon fraternity. He was admitted to the Louisiana Bar in \n     1942 and began practicing law in Baton Rouge in 1946. During \n     the Second World War, he volunteered for and served in the \n     United States Navy from June 1942 until discharged as a \n     lieutenant in December 1945. As the commander of an LCT \n     (landing craft tank) vessel, he participated in Allied \n     invasions of North Africa, Sicily, Italy, and Southern \n     France. For his service to the United States of America, he \n     was awarded four Battle Stars.\n       He served as special counsel to Louisiana Governor Earl K. \n     Long in 1948. On November 2, 1948--the day before his 30th \n     birthday--he was elected to the United States Senate to fill \n     the vacancy created by the death of Senator John H. Overton \n     and took office on December 31, 1948. By large margins, the \n     people of Louisiana reelected him to the Senate in 1950, \n     1956, 1962, 1968, 1974, and again in 1980. He retired from \n     office on January 3, 1987, at the end of his seventh term.\n       He served as the Senate's Democratic Whip, or assistant \n     majority leader, from 1956 to 1969. During his years in the \n     Senate, he served on several committees, including Finance, \n     Armed Services, Foreign Relations, Commerce, Science and \n     Transportation, Joint Committee on Taxation, and Select \n     Committee on Ethics. He was chairman of the Senate Committee \n     on Finance from 1965 to 1981. He served as co-chairman of the \n     Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation from 1965 to \n     1967 and as chairman of the Joint Committee on Internal \n     Revenue Taxation from 1967 to 1977.\n       He was a fierce advocate of the interests of Louisiana and \n     its people. A tireless and effective champion for the poor, \n     the elderly and average workers, he was father of Employee \n     Stock Ownership Plans; these plans have given millions of \n     American workers a meaningful stake in the companies for \n     which they work. In 1956, he authored the first major \n     expansion of the Social Security system to include benefits \n     for the disabled. He was a primary architect of the Medicare \n     system, creator of the Earned Income Tax Credit (the \n     cornerstone of America's anti-poverty programs), and the \n     author of public financing of presidential campaigns.\n       After his retirement from the Senate, he practiced law in \n     Baton Rouge and Washington, D.C. Also, he served on the \n     boards of directors of several corporations: the New York \n     Stock Exchange, Metropolitan Life, Lowe's Companies, and the \n     Louisiana Land and Exploration Company.\n       He is survived by his wife Carolyn Bason Long of \n     Washington, D.C.; two daughters, Rita Katherine ``Kay'' Long \n     of Baton Rouge, and Pamela Long Wofford and son-in-law \n     Douglas Lloyd Wofford of Indio Hills, California; one \n     brother, Palmer Reid Long, and his wife, Louene Long of \n     Shreveport; and one sister, Rose Long McFarland, of Boulder, \n     Colorado.\n       Also surviving are his four grandchildren, Audra McCardell \n     Snider and husband Jeremy\n\n[[Page S6705]]\n\n     Snider of Rockville, Maryland, Katherine Barrett Mosely, \n     Russell Long Mosely and wife Erin Saporito Mosely, and Kirk \n     Meredith Mosely, all of Baton Rouge.

Over a month ago, our military achieved an impressive \nvictory in Iraq--a victory earned by the brave men and women of our \nArmed Forces, and a victory that serves as a testament to the \nbipartisan commitment to ensuring that our military remains the best in \nthe world. Through these efforts, we removed a brutal regime and helped \nliberate a people.\n  This victory also brought an enormous responsibility upon the United \nStates: to help the Iraqi people rebuild their lives in peace and \nprosperity. Meeting this challenge is a test of our leadership, a test \nof our commitment and resolve, and a test of our willingness to engage \nwith the rest of the world.\n  Unfortunately, the Bush administration has put us on a course to fail \nthese tests. Since that statue of Saddam Hussein came crashing down, \nAmerica's postwar policy has been confused and chaotic. The American-\nled civil administration is understaffed, underequipped and unprepared. \nAlready many of its senior leaders have come and gone. The \ninternational community has expressed a willingness to help, but has \nbeen kept on the sidelines. Baghdad and other key cities remain unsafe. \nThere has been widespread looting of hospitals, businesses, museums, \nand homes. Mass gravesites have not been protected. Refugees are \nfleeing to neighboring countries like Jordan. Radical clerics have \nbegun to fill the power vacuum. Saddam Hussein and many of his senior \nhenchmen are still at large. And most disturbing, nuclear, chemical and \nbiological facilities have been left unprotected and have been \nransacked--not only destroying possible evidence about Saddam's weapons \nof mass destruction, but presenting a real threat that such materials \nwill end up in the hands of terrorists.\n  Continuing on this path not only hurts the Iraqi people, who have \nsuffered enough and deserve better, but it squanders all that our \nmilitary achieved in Iraq, threatens our security, and undermines our \nstanding in the world.\n  I am concerned that we are about to repeat the same mistakes we have \nmade in Afghanistan, where this administration's efforts to win the \npeace have been ineffective and weak. The lack of American leadership \nhas left Afghanistan dangerously unstable. We cannot make the same \nmistake in Iraq.\n  Last fall, many of us who supported the use of military force in Iraq \nwarned President Bush about this problem. We argued that the United \nStates needed to put the same amount of energy, effort, and creativity \ninto planning for what to do after Saddam was gone.\n  We supported the use of force to ensure that Iraq complied with its \ncommitments to the international community. But we also called on the \nPresident to carefully plan for a new Iraq--a prosperous democracy at \npeace with itself and its neighbors.\n  The President obviously did not heed our advice. The administration \ndid not make adequate plans for the situation which now threatens the \nsuccess of our mission in Iraq--and in some instances, it apparently \ndid not plan at all. It now tries to explain away its failures as the \n``untidy'' realities of postwar Iraq. Rather than make excuses, the \nadministration must act before it undermines all that we have \naccomplished.\n  Because the administration failed to anticipate the consequences of \nvictory, we now face the prospect of an Iraq that descends into chaos. \nWe must take action now to stop this.\n  Almost 6 weeks ago, the day after Baghdad fell to U.S. forces, I \noutlined four clear and simple principles to guide U.S. policy in \npostwar Iraq.\n  First, the U.S. must bring other countries into this effort, as well \nas institutions like the United Nations and NATO. Including others will \nnot just increase the likelihood of success. It will help create a free \nIraqi government with legitimacy and authority in the region and the \nrest of the world. And by sharing the costs of this massive effort, \nincluding others will ease the burdens on the American people.\n  Second, the U.S. must do more to ensure the safety and security of \nthe Iraqi people. It makes no sense that we did not have enough \nmilitary forces on the ground to protect critical weapons sites or stop \nlooting from spinning out of control. Clearly, we should have had more \nforces ready to meet these challenges.\n  It is good that reinforcements are on the way, but I believe that the \nbest way to deal with this problem now would be to create a \nmultinational peacekeeping force, led by NATO. We all know that many \nNATO members were deeply divided over the issue of what to do about \nIraq. But now that the war is over, I believe that we have an \nopportunity to reaffirm NATO's importance and relevance--as well as \nAmerica's commitment to the alliance--by looking for ways to include \nNATO in providing security today in Iraq.\n  Third, we have to do better at ensuring that the Iraqi people, not \nsome puppet government, will shape Iraq's future. So far, our efforts \nto support an open political process have been unimpressive, raising \ndoubts about our commitment to giving the Iraqi people a voice in the \nprocess and a government that reflects their diversity. The \nadministration has not articulated a clear path to help the Iraqi \npeople achieve self-government, preserve basic freedoms, and uphold the \nrule of law. This process must be seen as legitimate. Therefore we \nshould act now to give the broader international community a role.\n  Fourth, we have to ensure that the Iraqi people can build a \nprosperous economy that is theirs alone. Iraq has enormous economic \npotential, and we have to help the Iraqi people tap into that potential \nand make clear that the oil is theirs and not for the U.S. or others to \nexploit. Many of the recent decisions about which companies will help \nrebuild Iraq have raised doubts around the world about our motives. We \nneed a transparent and open process to guarantee that the awarding of \ncontracts is fair.\n  While our national interest requires that we make this commitment to \nhelp rebuild Iraq, the American people deserve to know how much this is \ngoing to cost. This administration has consistently been unclear about \nthe duration and costs of our commitment in a post-Saddam Iraq. We must \nhave a better accounting. How much will it cost the American taxpayer? \nHow much will other countries contribute? What are the signposts for \nmeasuring success in a transition to an independent, democratic Iraqi \ngovernment?\n  It is in America's national interest to help build an Iraq at peace \nwith itself and its neighbors, because a democratic, tolerant, and \naccountable Iraq will be a peaceful regional partner. A free Iraq could \nserve as a model for the entire Arab world. And if done right--with \nhumility, patience, and cooperation--this effort to rebuild Iraq will \nbring the world together and return America to a place where it is \nrespected and admired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/20/senate-section/article/S6705-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. BAYH.

WEINER\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize Rabbi Martin S. Weiner, who is retiring after \n31 years of dedicated service to the community.\n  Rabbi Weiner, a San Francisco native, was educated in the city's \npublic\n\n[[Page S6706]]\n\nschools. He received his bachelor of arts degree from the University of \nCalifornia at Berkeley and his rabbinical training at the Hebrew Union \nCollege-Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati.\n  In 1964, Rabbi Weiner was ordained from the College-Institute, where \nhe earned a master of arts in Hebrew Letters with honors.\n  Rabbi Weiner came to Temple Sherith Israel in 1972, where he serves \nas the Senior Rabbi. Rabbi Weiner also is the immediate past president \nof the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the Reform movement's \nrabbinical union. In addition, Rabbi Weiner sits on the board of the \nReform Pension Plan and the Bay Area Chapter of the American Jewish \nCommittee.\n  Among his many accomplishments, Rabbi Weiner has served as president \nof the Pacific Association of Reform Rabbis and as chair of the San \nFrancisco Interfaith Council. He has also served as vice president, \ntreasurer, and a member of the Central Conference of American Rabbis \nExecutive Board, in addition to the Jewish Community Federation, the \nNational Commission on Reform Jewish Education, the San Francisco Human \nRights Commission, and the Jewish Family & Children's Service. Rabbi \nWeiner also bravely offered his services during the aftermath of the \nSeptember 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center. He comforted \nthose in need and aided several traumatized patients at New York City's \nBeth Israel Hospital.\n  Rabbi Weiner's service to the Jewish community, both in San Francisco \nand nationwide, is truly inspiring. I am confident that, even in \nretirement, Rabbi Martin Weiner will continue to inspire people with \nhis humanity and dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/20/senate-section/article/S6706-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/20/senate-section/article/S6706-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Forces.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/20/senate-section/article/S6706-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n 2003 COMPREHENSIVE REPORT ON U.S. TRADE AND INVESTMENT POLICY TOWARD \n    SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFRICAN GROWTH AND \n                         OPPORTUNITY ACT--PM 35\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with title I of the Trade and Development Act of 2000, I \nam providing a report prepared by my Administration entitled ``2003 \nComprehensive Report on U.S. Trade and Investment Policy for Sub-\nSaharan Africa and Implementation of the African Growth and Opportunity \nAct.''\n                                                      George W.

A bill to give States the flexibility to reduce bureaucracy \nby streamlining enrollment processes for the medicaid and State \nchildren's health insurance programs through better linkages with \nprograms providing nutrition and related assistance to low-income \nfamilies; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Children's \nExpress Lane to Health Coverage Act of 2003. This bill will give States \ngreater flexibility in the ways they can enroll uninsured children into \nMedicaid and SCHIP while at the same time increasing government \nefficiency. Furthermore, it will help States reduce bureaucracy and \nred-tape.\n  In 1999, 4.4 million low-income uninsured children were in families \nthat received benefits through Food Stamps, the National School Lunch \nProgram, or the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, \nInfants and Children, WIC. Recognizing this, I worked to include a \nprovision in the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000,\n\n[[Page S6709]]\n\nwhich allowed schools and school districts to share school lunch \ninformation with State health insurance agencies for outreach and \nenrollment activities.\n  The good news is that this provision has inspired numerous States to \nshare information with Medicaid and SCHIP for the purposes of \nenrollment and outreach. Some States and communities have gone even \nfurther and simplified the health insurance application process by \nutilizing information provided in another program application to make \nthe eligibility or renewal determination for Medicaid and or SCHIP.\n  Some States would like to go further still, and determine that a \nchild is income eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP based on the fact that \nthey have already been found eligible for a nutrition or other \ncomparable program that operates under similar financial guidelines. \nUnfortunately, they have found Federal law not flexible enough.\n  The Express Lane Act would give States the option of establishing \nthat their Medicaid or SCHIP financial eligibility rules are satisfied \nwhen a family presents proof that their child is already enrolled in \nanother public program with comparable income guidelines. Express lane \ndoes not affect other, non-income eligibility requirements and \nmaintains existing quality control measures.\n  If given the ability to adopt automatic income eligibility, as set \nout in The Children's Express Lane to Health Coverage Act of 2003, \nStates could reach a tangible population of uninsured children, build \nupon the initiative already taken by families, eliminate multi-agency \nduplicative efforts to collect and verify income and resource \neligibility, and at the same time maintain program integrity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 1084. A bill to establish formally the United States Military \nCancer Institute Center of Excellence, to provide for the maintenance \nof health in the military by enhancing cancer research and treatment, \nto provide for a study of the epidemiological causes of cancer among \nvarious ethnic groups for prevention efforts, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I introduce the United States \nMilitary Cancer Institute Center of Excellence Research Collaborative \nAct of 2003. This legislation seeks to formally establish the United \nStates Military Cancer Institute, Center of Excellence and seeks \nsupport for the collaborative augmentation of research efforts in \ncancer epidemiology, prevention, and control. The mission of the \nInstitute is to provide for the maintenance of health in the military \nby enhancing cancer research and treatment, and to study the \nepidemiological causes of cancer among various ethnic groups. By \nformally establishing the USMCI as a Center of Excellence it will \nbetter unite military research efforts with other cancer research \ncenters.\n  Cancer prevention and treatment for the military population is a \nsignificant issue, thus the USMCI was organized to coordinate the \nmilitary cancer assets already established. The USMCI has a \ncomprehensive database on its beneficiary population of 9 million \npeople. The military's nationwide tumor registry, the Automated Central \nTumor Registry, has acquired more than 180,000 cases in the last 14 \nyears, and a serum repository of 30 million specimens from military \npersonnel collected sequentially since 1987. This population is \npredominantly Caucasian, African-American, and Hispanic.\n  The Director of the USMCI, Dr. John Potter, is also a Professor of \nSurgery at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, \nUSUHS. A highly talented cancer epidemiologist, Dr. Kangmin Zhu, has \nalso been recruited to lead the USMCI Prevention and Control Programs.\n  The USMCI currently functions in the Washington, D.C. area, and its \ncomponents are located at the National Naval Medical Center, the \nMalcolm Grow Medical Center, the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, \nand the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute. Currently there \nare more than 70 research workers, both active duty and Department of \nDefense civilian scientists, in the USMCI.\n  The USMCI intends to expand its research activities to military \nmedical centers across the Nation. Special emphasis will be placed on \nthe study of genetic and environmental factors in carcinogenesis among \nthe entire population including Asian, Causasian, African-American and \nHispanic populations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1084\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

RESEARCH BY UNITED STATES MILITARY CANCER INSTITUTE \n                   CENTER OF EXCELLENCE.\n\n       (a) Formal Establishment of United States Military Cancer \n     Institute Center of Excellence.--(1) There is hereby \n     established the United States Military Cancer Institute \n     Center of Excellence in the Uniformed Services University of \n     the Health Sciences (USUHS).\n       (2) The Center shall consist of the United States Military \n     Cancer Institute (USMCI) and such other elements of the \n     Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences as the \n     President of the University considers appropriate.\n       (b) Research.--(1) The United States Military Cancer \n     Institute Center of Excellence shall carry out a research \n     study on the epidemiological causes of cancer among \n     populations of various ethnic origins, including an \n     assessment of the carcinogenic effect of various genetic and \n     environmental factors, and of disparities in health, inherent \n     or common among populations of various ethnic origins.\n       (2) The research study shall include complementary research \n     on oncologic nursing.\n       (c) Collaborative Research.--The United States Military \n     Cancer Institute Center of Excellence shall carry out the \n     research study required pursuant to subsection (b) in \n     collaboration with other cancer research organizations and \n     entities selected by the Center for purposes of the research \n     study and construction.\n       (d) Reports.--(1) Not later than one year after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the \n     Director of the United States Military Cancer Institute \n     Center of Excellence shall submit to the President of the \n     Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences a report \n     on the results of the research study required pursuant to \n     subsection (b).\n       (2) Not later than 60 days after the receipt of a report \n     under paragraph (1), the President of the University shall \n     transmit such report to Congress, together with such \n     additional information and recommendations as the President \n     of the University considers appropriate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. \n        Dorgan):\n  S. 1085. A bill to provide for a Bureau of Reclamation program to \nassist states and local communities in evaluating and developing rural \nand small community water supply systems, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nReclamation Rural and Small Community Water Enhancement Act, which is \nbeing co-sponsored by my colleagues, Senator Daschle, Senator Dorgan, \nand Senator Baucus.\n  In introducing this bill, let me note that the Economic Research \nService at the Agriculture Department estimates that 56 million \nAmericans--around 20 percent of the population--live in nonmetropolitan \nareas. In the arid west, this percentage is likely much higher. In my \nhome State of New Mexico, for example, over 50 percent of the \npopulation resides outside the four major metropolitan areas--clearly a \nsignificant number of people.\n  This bill is intended to address a critical issue facing many small \ntowns and rural areas--access to adequate water supplies to provide for \npresent and future needs. A stable and reliable water supply is the \nfoundation for the economic activity that sustains our communities. \nAddressing this most basic need, however, poses a challenge that many \nof these localities simply cannot meet on their own. The challenge is \nmagnified by the prolonged drought that many are predicting for the \narid West.\n  For a number of reasons, including limited access to water supplies \nand the requirements of the Federal Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water \nActs, many small communities in the western United States are taking a \nregional approach to water that involves the cooperative development of \nwater\n\n[[Page S6710]]\n\nprojects serving several communities over a large area. In New Mexico, \nthe State Water Trust Board prioritizes funding assistance to those \nprojects that represent a partnership of communities on a regional \nbasis. Currently, there are three such projects rapidly taking shape in \n1. Eastern New Mexico; 2. the Santa Fe Area; and 3. the Espanola \nValley.\n  In other areas of the country, this regional approach has already \ntaken root. Currently, the Bureau of Reclamation is authorized to \nconstruct seven rural water supply projects--most of these in the Great \nPlains region. The authorized cost of these projects is approximately \n$1.8 billion. In just two years, however, the administration has cut \nback the appropriations requests for authorized rural water projects by \n80 percent, or almost $60 million. This includes zeroing out the \nfunding for most of these projects--a policy choice severely impacting \nthose communities relying on this infrastructure.\n  The bill being introduced today is intended to ensure there exists an \nactive Federal program to address water needs in the rural West. It \ndoes so in a manner that respects the role of the States in water \nresources management and is fiscally responsible by requiring a \nfinancial partnership between Federal, State, and local entities. The \nbill utilizes the experience and expertise of the Bureau of Reclamation \nto implementation a rural water program that complements, not \nduplicates, existing Federal programs at the Environmental Protection \nAgency and the Department of Agriculture; ensures that existing \nprojects move towards full and timely implementation; and ensures that \nReclamation is fully authorized to provide assistance in evaluating all \nwater supply options if requested by rural communities.\n  I believe that this is a bill for which there should be strong \nbipartisan support. Having helped to reclaim the West during the 20th \ncentury, the Bureau of Reclamation should help sustain it in the 21st \ncentury. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation \nand, by that, support rural and small communities within our States.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                S. 1085\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Reclamation Rural and Small \n     Community Water Enhancement Act.''\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this Act:\n       (1) Federal reclamation laws.--The term ``Federal \n     reclamation laws'' means the Reclamation Act and Acts \n     amendatory thereof and supplementary thereto;\n       (2) Regional rural water supply system.--The term \n     ``regional rural water supply system'' means a water supply \n     system that serves multiple towns or communities in a rural \n     area (including Indian reservations) where such towns or \n     communities have a population for exceeding 40,000 persons.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n\n     SEC. 3.

APPRAISAL INVESTIGATIONS.\n\n       (a) Appraisal Investigations.--Based on evidence of local \n     interest and upon the request of a local sponsor, the \n     Secretary may undertake appraisal investigations to identify \n     opportunities for the construction of regional rural water \n     supply systems and the enhancement of existing rural water \n     supply systems for small communities and rural areas. Each \n     such investigation shall include recommendations as to the \n     preparation of a feasibility study of the potential system or \n     system enhancement.\n       (b) Considerations.--Appraisal investigations undertaken \n     pursuant to this Act shall consider, among other things--\n       (1) whether an established water supply exists for the \n     proposed regional water supply system;\n       (2) the need for the regional rural water supply system or \n     for enhancements to an existing rural water system, including \n     but not limited to, alternative water supply opportunities \n     and projected demand for water supply;\n       (3) environmental considerations relating to the regional \n     rural water supply system or rural water system enhancement;\n       (4) public health and safety considerations relating to the \n     regional rural water supply system or rural water system \n     enhancement;\n       (5) Indian trust responsibility considerations relating to \n     the regional rural water supply system or rural water system \n     enhancement; and\n       (6) the availability of other Federal authorities or \n     programs to address the water supply needs identified.\n       (c) Consultation and Cooperation.--The Secretary shall \n     consult and cooperate with appropriate Federal, state, \n     tribal, regional, and local authorities during the conduct of \n     each appraisal investigation conducted pursuant to this Act.\n       (d) Costs Nonreimbursable.--The costs of such appraisal \n     investigations shall be nonreimbursable.\n       (e) Public Availability.--The Secretary shall make \n     available to the public, upon request, the results of each \n     appraisal investigation undertaken pursuant to this Act, and \n     shall promptly publish in the Federal Register a notice of \n     the availability of those results.\n\n     SEC. 6. FEASIBILITY STUDIES.\n\n       (a) Feasibility Studies.--The Secretary is authorized to \n     participate with appropriate Federal, state, tribal, \n     regional, and local authorities in studies to determine the \n     feasibility of regional rural water supply systems and rural \n     water supply system enhancements where an appraisal \n     investigation so warrants. The Federal share of the costs of \n     such feasibility studies shall not exceed 50 percent of the \n     total, except that the Secretary may increase the Federal \n     share of the costs of such feasibility study if the Secretary \n     determines, based upon a demonstration of financial hardship, \n     that the non-Federal participant is unable to contribute at \n     least 50 percent of the costs of such study. The Secretary \n     may accept as part of the non-Federal cost share the \n     contribution of such in-kind services by the non-Federal \n     participant that the Secretary determines will contribute \n     substantially toward the conduct and completion of the study.\n       (b) Considerations.--In addition to the requirements of \n     other Federal laws, feasibility studies authorized under this \n     Act shall consider, among other things--\n       (1) whether an established water supply exists for the \n     proposed regional rural water supply system;\n\n[[Page S6711]]\n\n       (2) near- and long-term water demand and supplies in the \n     study area including any opportunities to treat and utilize \n     impaired water supplies through innovative and economically \n     viable treatment technologies;\n       (3) public health and safety and environmental quality \n     issues related to the regional rural water supply system or \n     rural water system enhancement;\n       (4) opportunities for water conservation in the study area \n     to reduce water use and water system costs;\n       (5) the construction costs and projected operation and \n     maintenance costs of the proposed regional rural water supply \n     system and an assessment of participating communities' \n     ability to pay 20 percent to 50 percent of the construction \n     costs and the full share of the system operation and \n     maintenance costs;\n       (6) opportunities for mitigation of fish and wildlife \n     losses incurred as a result of the construction of the \n     regional rural water supply system or rural water system \n     enhancement on an acre-for-acre basis, based on ecological \n     equivalency, concurrent with system construction; and\n       (7) the extent to which assistance for rural water supply \n     is available pursuant to other Federal authorities and the \n     likely effectiveness of efforts to coordinate assistance \n     provided by the Secretary with other available Federal \n     programs and assistance.\n       (c) Use of Other Reports.--In conducting a feasibility \n     study pursuant to this section, or an appraisal investigation \n     under section 5, the Secretary shall, to the maximum extent \n     practicable, utilize, in whole or in part, any engineering or \n     other relevant report submitted by a state, tribal, regional, \n     or local authority associated with the proposed regional \n     rural water supply system.\n       (d) Public Availability.--The Secretary shall make \n     available to the public, upon request, the results of each \n     feasibility study undertaken pursuant to this Act, and shall \n     promptly publish in the Federal Register a notice of the \n     availability of those results.\n       (e) Disclaimer.--Nothing contained in this section shall be \n     interpreted as requiring a feasibility study or imposing any \n     other new requirement for rural water projects or programs \n     that are already authorized.\n\n     SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION.\n\n       There are hereby authorized to be appropriated such sums as \n     may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Bingaman, in introducing the Reclamation Rural and Small \nCommunity Water Enhancement Act, S. 1085.\n  The Bureau of Reclamation has accomplished a great deal over the last \ncentury, starting with the early irrigation and water development \nprograms that opened the West to settlement and economic growth. Clean, \nabundant water supplies were integral to our Nation's westward \nexpansion. Without the vision and effort of the Bureau over the last \ncentury, the West would be a vastly different, and less hospitable, \nplace.\n  Though the role of the Bureau has changed over the years, it is still \nthe premier Federal water development agency. Today, one of its primary \nduties is the building of rural water projects in South Dakota and \nother Western States. Rural areas often lack the resources and \ninfrastructure necessary to provide stable water supplies to their \nresidents. Most families, farmers, and ranchers rely on inadequate \nwells, or live in areas where the water quality is so poor they are \nrequired to truck or haul water over long distances. Rural water \nprojects conducted by the Bureau have helped overcome these obstacles, \ntackling the problem on a regional level and vastly improving the \nquality of water and the quality of life in much of my State. Rural \nwater systems have become an indispensable lifeline to help deal with \nthe severe drought that has affected much my State.\n  The bill we are introducing today takes the next, logical step to \nbring the Bureau's rural water projects into the 21st century. The \nReclamation Rural and Small Community Water Enhancement Act will create \na new program within the Bureau of Reclamation to help rural and tribal \ncommunities develop water supply solutions, like rural water systems, \nto address regional water needs. The Bureau's experience in \nadministering other rural water systems will ensure this program \ncompliments existing Federal drinking water programs, like those \noperated by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of \nAgriculture, and provide rural communities with the tools they need to \nplan for the future.\n  As we look forward, however, it is equally important that we not \nignore those projects that have already received approval by Congress. \nIn South Dakota, the Mni Wiconi, Mid-Dakota, Perkins County, and Lewis \nand Clark rural water systems will serve thousands of families, farms, \nand businesses. Their timely completion is integral to the health, \nwelfare, and economic security of my State. Unfortunately, the \nadministration's fiscal year 2004 budget request drastically cuts \nfunding for these and other rural water projects throughout the country \nby more than 80 percent. This will lead to unnecessary delays in the \nprovision of drinking water to homes and families and will only serve \nto increase the cost of the projects.\n  That is why this legislation directs the Secretary of the Interior to \ntake all necessary steps to complete these and all other rural water \nprojects that have already received congressional authorization. The \nbill recognizes the hard work that has already gone into the \ndevelopment of these projects, and will help ensure that they are \ncompleted on schedule. At the same time, this new program will aid in \nthe development of future projects so that other communities can \nfinally realize the benefits that a well-run rural water system can \nprovide.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. \n        Lautenberg):\n  S. 1086. A bill to repeal provisions of the PROTECT Act that do not \nspecifically deal with the prevention of the exploitation of children; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues \nin introducing this legislation on fairness in our Federal sentencing \nsystem. The Judicial Use of Discretion to Guarantee Equity in \nSentencing Act, or the JUDGES Act, will repeal a number of \ncontroversial sentencing provisions that were added at the last moment \nto the recently enacted ``AMBER Alert law'' on missing, abducted, and \nexploited children.\n  These provisions--called the ``Feeney Amendment''--have nothing to do \nwith protecting children, and everything to do with handcuffing judges \nand eliminating fairness in our Federal sentencing system. As Chief \nJustice Rehnquist said, they ``do serious harm to the basic structure \nof the sentencing guidelines system and . . . seriously impair the \nability of courts to impose just and responsible sentences.''\n  The Judicial Conference of the United States, the American Bar \nAssociation, the U.S. Sentencing Commission, and many prosecutors, \ndefense attorneys, law professors, civil rights organizations, and \nbusiness groups vigorously opposed them. Now that the child-abduction \nlegislation has passed, it is the responsibility of Congress to repeal \nthese extraneous and ill-considered provisions and begin a serious and \nthorough review of the current sentencing guidelines system.\n  The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 was the result of extraordinary \nbipartisan cooperation. In the Senate Judiciary Committee, over a ten-\nyear period, Senator Thurmond, Senator Hatch, Senator Biden, and I \nworked with the Carter and Reagan administrations to strike the best \nbalance between the goal of consistent sentencing in Federal law and \nthe need to give Federal judges discretion to make the sentence fit the \ncrime in individual cases. There was also strong bipartisan cooperation \nin the House Judiciary Committee, and we worked together over several \nyears to enact a strong, balanced, and bipartisan bill.\n  Many judges think the 1984 Act went too far in limiting their \ndiscretion. Over the years, I have heard many Senators suggest that we \nshould give judges more authority to consider the circumstances of each \noffender and the facts of each offense. Enacted without hearings or \nmeaningful debate, the Feeney Amendment was a giant step in the wrong \ndirection.\n  The Feeney Amendment effectively strips Federal judges of discretion \nto impose individualized sentences, and transforms the longstanding \nsentencing guidelines system into a mandatory minimum sentencing \nsystem. It limits in several ways the ability of judges to depart \ndownwards from the guidelines. It overturns a unanimous 1996 Supreme \nCourt decision, Koon v. United States, which established a deferential \nstandard of review for departures from the guidelines based on the \nfacts of the case--thereby undermining what the Court described as the \n``traditional sentencing discretion'' of trial\n\n[[Page S6712]]\n\ncourts and the ``institutional advantage'' of Federal district courts \nover appellate courts to make fact-based sentencing determinations.\n  The Feeney Amendment also limits the number of judges who can serve \non the Sentencing Commission, and directs the Commission to amend the \nguidelines and policy statements under them ``to ensure that the \nincidence of downward departures are [sic] substantially reduced.'' It \nalso requires the Attorney General to establish a ``judicial \nblacklist'' by informing Congress whenever a district judge departs \ndownward from the guidelines. It imposes new, burdensome record-keeping \nand reporting requirements on Federal judges, and requires the \nSentencing Commission to disclose confidential court records to the \nHouse and Senate Judiciary Committees upon request. Earlier this month, \nChief Justice Rehnquist specifically criticized these record-keeping \nand reporting requirements as potentially amounting ``to an unwarranted \nand ill-considered effort to intimidate individual judges in the \nperformance of their judicial duties.''\n  It was an extreme step for Congress to insist that Federal judges--\nappointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate--should not have \ndiscretion to impose lower sentences in unusual cases, subject to \nappeal. It was even more extreme to pass such a sweeping proposal \nwithout the benefit of hearings and full debate in either House of \nCongress.\n  Because the Feeney Amendment was introduced at the last possible \nmoment, Congress was deprived of full and balanced information on \nwhether departure decisions are made in inappropriate instances. The \nJustice Department compounded that problem by submitting a highly \nmisleading letter on April 4th expressing its ``strong support'' for \nthe Amendment. The Department argued that the Amendment was justified \nbecause an epidemic of lenient sentences was undermining the Sentencing \nReform Act. It failed, however, to mention that the committee report \naccompanying the 1984 Act anticipated a departure rate of about 20 \npercent. Today, the rate at which judges depart from the guidelines \nover the objection of the government is slightly more than 10 percent--\nwell within acceptable rates.\n  The Department claimed that there are too many downward departures \nfrom the sentencing guidelines, but it failed to mention that, \naccording to the American Bar Association, almost 80 percent of these \ndepartures are requested by the Justice Department itself. In arguing \nfor the abrogation of the Supreme Court's ruling in Boon v. United \nStates, the Department also failed to mention that it wins 78 percent \nof all sentencing appeals, or that 85 percent of all defendants who \nreceive downward departures based on grounds other than cooperation \nwith the government nevertheless receive prison time.\n  Last week, I asked Michael Chertoff, a nominee to the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit, about his involvement in \ndrafting the Justice Department's letter of support for the Feeney \nAmendment. He said that he had ``no part in drafting'' the letter, and \nthat he did not review the letter before it was sent. In his current \nposition as Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal \nDivision in the Department, Mr. Chertoff is chiefly responsible for \nformulating criminal law enforcement policy and advising the Attorney \nGeneral and the White House on matters of criminal law. The fact that \nthe Department's leading authority on criminal law did not participate \nin writing its influential letter demonstrates the travesty of the \nprocess that led to the Feeney Amendment's enactment.\n  It is important for Congress to undo the damage done to the Federal \ncriminal justice system. The JUDGES Act, which we are introducing today \nand which Congressman Conyers is introducing in the House, repeals the \nprovisions of the Feeney Amendment that do not specifically involve sex \ncrimes or crimes against children--the purpose of the underlying child-\nabduction legislation to which it was attached. In the place of these \nill-advised changes to Federal sentencing law, the JUDGES Act directs \nthe Sentencing Commission to report to Congress within 180 days on the \nincidence of downward departures from the Sentencing Guidelines. The \nCommission's report will provide Congress with useful information to \nevaluate the need for reform, including information on rates of \ndepartures by district, circuit, offense, and departure ground. It will \nalso provide a review of departure appeals, an assessment of the extent \nto which departures affect the guideline system, and an assessment of \nvariations in the magnitude of departures and the frequency with which \nthe final sentences result in imprisonment, other conditions of \nconfinement, or release.\n  When completed, the Commission's report will provide a solid basis \nfor further action by Congress. We need to hold hearings; collect the \nrelevant data; consult with the judges, the Sentencing Commission, the \nJustice Department, the defense bar, and other authorities; and decide \nwhether legislation is needed to improve the sentencing guidelines. If \njudges are abusing their discretion, we should limit it. If more \ndiscretion is appropriate, we should provide it. In the words of Chief \nJustice Rehnquist, ``Before such legislation is enacted there should, \nat least, be a thorough and dispassionate inquiry into the consequences \nof such action.''\n  It was a serious mistake for Congress to enact the Feeney Amendment \nover the strong objections of the Chief Justice, the Judicial \nConference, the American Bar Association, the Sentencing Commission, \nand the overwhelming majority of prosecutors and defense attorneys who \ndeal with the guidelines on a daily basis. The JUDGES Act will correct \nthis mistake and set us on the right path to achieving any necessary \nreforms. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following letter from the Leadership \nConference on Civil Rights, the National Association of Criminal \nDefense Lawyers, the National Legal Aid and Defender Association, the \nNational Association of Federal Defenders, and Families Against \nMandatory Minimums be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                                     May 20, 2003.\n     The Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The undersigned organizations write \n     to express our strong support for the JUDGES Act. Under the \n     guise of addressing crimes against children, the recently \n     enacted PROTECT Act (S. 151) effected broad and ill-\n     considered changes to our federal sentencing system. In \n     repealing those provisions that are not limited to child-\n     related and sexual offenses, the JUDGES Act would help \n     restore judicial discretion to impose just sentences in most \n     federal cases.\n       Enacted without hearings or meaningful debate, Title IV of \n     the PROTECT Act (the ``Feeney Amendment'') represents the \n     most dramatic change to federal sentencing law since passage \n     of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. It threatens to deprive \n     judges of discretion to impose individualized sentences and \n     transform the federal sentencing guidelines into a near-\n     mandatory minimum sentencing systems. As with mandatory \n     sentences, Title IV will increase unwarranted sentencing \n     disparities and disproportionate sentences, and erode public \n     confidence in our federal justice system.\n       No reliable evidence was offered to justify this \n     curtailment of judicial discretion. On the contrary, \n     statistics indicate that the overwhelming majority of \n     sentences, other than those requested by the government to \n     reward defendants for assisting in the prosecution of others, \n     are within the range specified by the sentencing guidelines. \n     Significantly, nearly 80 percent of all downward departures \n     are requested by the government to reward assistance to the \n     government or to manage the high volume of immigration cases \n     in certain border districts.\n       These statistics solidly discredit title IV's most \n     disastrous provision--Section 401(m), which orders the \n     Sentencing Commission to amend the guidelines so as to \n     substantially reduce the number of departures. The JUDGES Act \n     repeals that provision in favor of a neutral study of \n     departures by the Sentencing Commission.\n       In carefully considering and enacting the Sentencing Reform \n     Act of 1984 and eventually approving the Sentencing \n     Guidelines, Congress struck a careful balance between \n     sentencing uniformity and judicial discretion. Title IV of \n     the PROTECT Act upsets this balance without justification and \n     without due consideration for the opposing views of the \n     federal judiciary, the Sentencing Commission, the bar and \n     many diverse groups from the left and right.\n       We appreciate your leadership in this area, and we look \n     forward to working with you in support of the JUDGES Act.\n         Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, National \n           Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, National Legal \n           Aid and\n\n[[Page S6713]]\n\n           Defender Association, National Association of Federal \n           Defenders, Families Against Mandatory Minimums.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts and Senators Feingold and Lautenberg in \nintroducing the Judicial Use of Discretion to Guarantee Equity in \nSentencing Act of 2003, or the JUDGES Act. This bill will restore \njudicial discretion in Federal criminal sentencing, a responsibility \nthat was all but stripped away in controversial, extraneous provisions \nthat were added to the AMBER Alert law enacted last month.\n  I was deeply disappointed when the Republicans took the bipartisan, \nnon-controversial AMBER Alert bill and added numerous unrelated and \nill-considered provisions. One set of provisions, collectively called \nthe Feeney Amendment, blithely overturned the basic structure of the \ncarefully crafted sentencing guideline system without any serious \nprocess in either the House or the Senate, and over the strong \nobjections of the Nation's most senior jurists. Speaking about the \noriginal Feeney Amendment, the Chief Justice of the United States \nwrote: ``This legislation, if enacted, would do serious harm to the \nbasic structure of the sentencing system and would seriously impair the \nability of courts to impose just and responsible sentences.'' I commend \nSenator Kennedy for trying to repair the harm done in the Feeney \nAmendment by introducing the JUDGES Act today.\n  Rather than directly address important measures to protect our \nchildren, the AMBER Alert conference committee effectively rewrote the \ncriminal code on the back of an envelope. First, the final language \nestablished one set of sentencing rules for child pornographers and a \nmore flexible set of sentencing rules for other Federal defendants, \nincluding terrorists, murderers, mobsters, civil rights violators, and \nwhite collar criminals. No one here believes that sex offenders deserve \nanything less than harsh sentences, but I cannot understand why we \nwould treat the terrorists better.\n  Second, the conference report overturned a unanimous Supreme Court \ndecision, Koon v. United States, by establishing a new standard of \nappellate review in all departure cases. This provision, like so many \nothers in the Feeney Amendment, is not limited to cases involving \nchildren. The Court in Koon interpreted the departure standard in a way \nthat limited departures but left some room for judicial discretion. By \ncontrast, the enacted provision appears to require appellate courts to \nconsider the merits of a departure before it can decide what standard \nof review to apply to the merits. This sloppy drafted, circular \nprovision is likely to tie up the courts in endless litigation, \ndraining already scarce judicial resources, and costing the taxpayers \nmoney.\n  In addition, the Feeney Amendment effectively created a ``black \nlist'' of judges that stray from the draconian mandates of the new law. \nThe enacted amendment attempt to intimate the Federal judiciary by \ncompiling a list of all judges who impose sentences that the Justice \nDepartment does not like. Again, this provision is not limited to \ncrimes against children, but applies in any type of criminal case. It \ntakes a sledge hammer to the concept of separation of powers.\n\n  In justifying this assault on Federal judges, my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle claimed that there was a ``crisis'' of downward \ndepartures in sentencing. In fact, downward departure rates are well \nbelow the range contemplated by Congress when it authorized the \nSentencing Guidelines, except for departures requested by the \ngovernment. The overwhelming majority of downward departures are \nrequested by federal prosecutors to reward cooperation by defendants or \nto manage the high volume of immigration cases in certain border \ndistricts. When the government does not like a specific downward \ndeparture, it can appeal that decision, and it often wins--\napproximately 80 percent of such appeals are successful. The Feeney \nAmendment, forced through Congress with virtually no debate, was a \nsolution in search of a problem.\n  The legislation that I join Senator Kennedy in introducing today will \nrepeal those provisions of the Feeney Amendment that veered from the \nunderlying purpose of the AMBER Alert bill. Specifically, it will annul \nthose sections that do not specifically involve crimes against children \nor sex crimes, effectively reversing the Feeney Amendment's attack on \njudicial discretion.\n  The JUDGES Act will provide accurate and complete information on the \nincidence of downward departures in sentencing--a set of data that we \nwere denied when the Feeney Amendment was adopted in the AMBER \nconference. This bill directs the Sentencing Commission to conduct a \ncomprehensive study on sentencing departures and report to Congress \nwithin 180 days. This is the type of review Chief Justice Rehnquist \ncalled for in his letter opposing the original Feeney language. He \nurged the Congress to engage in a ``thorough and dispassionate \ninquiry'' before changes were made to the Federal sentencing structure. \nThat request was dismissed by supporters of the Feeney Amendment, but \nstill deserves full consideration by the Congress.\n  Finally, the JUDGES Act will reverse a provision that goes beyond the \nFeeney Amendment, having been added to the AMBER Alert bill during the \nconference committee's one meeting. This provision limits the number of \nFederal judges who can serve on the Sentencing Commission. I, for one, \nbelieve that judges are extremely valuable members of the Commission. \nThey bring years of highly relevant experience, not to mention reasoned \njudgment, to the table. The Republicans apparently believe that their \nexpertise is of limited value.\n  The JUDGES Act is a reasoned correction to the far-reaching \nprovisions enacted in the Feeney Amendment. It will restore the \nintegrity of the Federal sentencing system by allowing judges to impose \njust and responsible sentences. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 1087. A bill to provide for uterine fibroid research and \neducation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Uterine Fibroid \nResearch and Education Act. This bill expands and coordinates research \non uterine fibroids at the National Institutes of Health, NIH, and \ncreates an education campaign to make sure women and their doctors have \nthe facts they need about this painful, chronic condition. I want to \nthank Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones for introducing this \nlegislation in the House of Representatives and Senator Clinton for \njoining me as an original cosponsor.\n  Uterine fibroids are a major health issue for American women. Three \nquarters of all reproductive age women, and an even greater number of \nAfrican American women, have uterine fibroids. Although many women with \nfibroids have few or no symptoms, it is estimated that a quarter of all \nwomen in their thirties and forties seek medical care for the abnormal \nor heavy bleeding, pain, infertility, or miscarriage that uterine \nfibroids cause.\n  Despite their prevalence, little is known about uterine fibroids, and \nfew good treatment options are available to women who suffer from them. \nRight now, hysterectomy--the surgical removal of the uterus--is the \nmost common treatment for uterine fibroids. More than 200,000 women \nundergo a hysterectomy each year to treat their uterine fibroids, which \nrequires a six week recovery, has a 20 to 40 percent risk of \ncomplications, and means a women can no longer bear children. Less \ninvasive treatment options, like drug regimes or fibroid embolyzation, \nare promising, but many have not undergone the rigorous testing that \nwomen expect. In fact, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality \nat the Department of Health and Human Services found ``a remarkable \nlack of high quality evidence supporting the effectiveness of most \ninterventions for symptomatic fibroids.''\n  Women deserve better. That's why I am introducing the uterine Fibroid \nResearch and Education Act--to find new and better ways to treat or \neven cure uterine fibroids.\n  This bill does three things. First, it expands research at the \nNational Institutes of Health, NIH, by doubling funding for uterine \nfibroids every year for the next five years. Despite a budget of\n\n[[Page S6714]]\n\nover $27 billion, NIH spent just $5 million on uterine fibroids \nresearch in 2002. This legislation authorizes $50 million over five \nyears to provide the investment needed to jumpstart basic research and \nlay the groundwork to find a cure.\n\n  This additional funding will help researchers find out why so many \nwomen get uterine fibroids, why African American women are \ndisproportionately affected, what tests women can take to prevent \nuterine fibroids, and what are the best ways to treat them.\n  Second, this legislation coordinates research on uterine fibroids \nthrough the Office of Research on Women's Health, ORWH. More than a \ndecade ago, I fought to create this Office at NIH to give women a seat \nat the table when decisions were made about funding priorities. This \nbill directs this Office to lead the Federal Government's research \neffort on uterine fibroids. A coordinated research effort is needed to \nmake the best use of limited resources and to give women a one-stop \nshop to find out what the Federal Government is doing to combat uterine \nfibroids.\n  Finally, this bill creates education campaigns for patients and \nhealth care providers. According to a 1999 survey conducted by the \nSociety for Women's Health Research, as many as one-third of women who \nhave hysterectomies do so without discussing potential alternatives \nwith their doctors. This bill will make sure women can count on their \ndoctors for information about the best possible treatment for uterine \nfibroids. It will also give women the facts they need to make good \nhealth care decisions and take control of their health.\n  Since my first days in Congress, I have been fighting to make sure \nwomen don't get left out or left behind when it comes to their health. \nFrom women's inclusion in clinical trials to quality standards for \nmammograms, I have led the way to make sure women's health needs are \ntreated fairly and taken seriously. This legislation builds on these \npast successes to address this silent epidemic among American women.\n  The Uterine Fibroid Research and Education Act is supported by the \nNational Uterine Fibroid Foundation, the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists, the National Medical Association, the \nAmerican Nurses Association, the Feminist Majority Foundation, the \nCenter for Uterine Fibroids at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the \nNational Urban League,, Delta Sigma Theta, and the Society for Women's \nHealth Research. I look forward to working with these advocates and my \ncolleagues to get this bill signed into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. By Mrs. BOXER.\n  S. 1088. A bill to enhance penalties for fraud in connection with \nidentification documents that facilitates an act of domestic terrorism; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill to \nincrease penalties for terrorists using false identification.\n  This legislation passed the Senate in the last Congress. It mandates \nprison time for anyone who produces, transfers, possesses, or uses a \nfake ID in connection with terrorism. Currently, in Federal law, there \nis no mandatory imprisonment for the production, transfer, possession, \nor use of a fake ID. This is true under any circumstances, even those \ninvolving terrorist acts. This, to me, seems wrong. If an individual at \nany time facilitates an act of terrorism by providing someone with a \nfake ID, making a fake ID, possessing a fake ID, or using that fake ID, \nthat person should go to jail. Period. My bill make sure that principle \nis reflected in Federal law.\n  Second, my bill closes the loophole that provides enhanced penalties \nfor fake IDs used in connection with acts of international terrorism, \nbut not domestic terrorism. My bill makes sure that fake ID offenses \nrelated to domestic terrorism get the same enhanced punishment as those \nrelating to international terrorism.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENSIGN:\n  S. 1089. A bill to encourage multilateral cooperation and authorize a \nprogram of assistance to facilitate a peaceful transition in Cuba, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. ENSIGN: Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nmy bill, the ``Cuba Transition Act of 2003,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1089\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I submit this resolution on my behalf and \nthat of Senator Ensign. Senator Ensign is not present on the floor \ntoday because, as I speak, he is in Florida. He will be the keynote \nspeaker in Florida at the Cuban Independence Day celebration. And it \nshould be a celebration.\n  Because today, Mr. President, a proud Cuban people should mark the \n101st anniversary of their independence. But they have not had that \nindependence for the last 44 years.\n  I applaud and commend my colleague from Nevada for taking the time \nand effort to be in Florida to be the spokesperson for those of us who \nhope for a truly independent Cuba--a Cuba free of the tyrant Fidel \nCastro.\n  I realize that another dictator is on the minds of many Americans \nthese days. Our troops continue to investigate the fate of that man--\nSaddam Hussein--and to search for his top henchmen. We must ensure that \nall these despicable figures are held accountable for their crimes \nagainst humanity. Under the direction of Hussein, the Iraqi leadership \nembarked upon one of history's most premeditated and brutal campaigns \nof theft, kidnapping, torture, and murder against the Iraqi, Kuwaiti, \nKurdish, and Iranian people. We are, as I speak, finding graves in Iraq \nwhere hundreds, if not thousands, of people are buried who have been \nmurdered by the henchmen of Saddam Hussein and his two sons. Some \n200,000 Iraqis are still missing, most taken from their homes under \ncover of darkness, never to be seen or heard from again.\n  In the modern era, such crimes cannot go unpunished. The United \nStates must assist the Iraqi people in bringing Hussein--if he is still \nalive--and all other responsible Iraqi officials to justice. The \nvictims of their crimes, including U.S. soldiers, deserve no less.\n  But closer to home, 90 miles from the shores of the United States, \nFidel Castro continues to wage a vicious assault against fundamental \nhuman rights and liberties. For more than 44 years, he has led a \ntyrannical regime in Cuba that systematically violates basic human \nrights, including freedoms of expression, association, assembly, and \nmovement.\n  Since 1959, more than 100,000 Cubans have been persecuted by Castro's \nregime, over 18,000 of whom have been killed or who have disappeared. \nNow, these are just ballpark figures. We do not know precisely how many \npeople have been executed by Castro and his henchmen, but we can \nidentify thousands of them by name. And Fidel Castro shows no sign of \nending his campaign of terror--none at all. In fact, this past March, \njust a couple months ago, he launched a massive crackdown on leaders of \nindependent labor unions. All they were doing was trying to organize, \nthat's all. He also continued a crackdown on leaders of opposition \nparties and the pro-democracy movement that led to the arrest of almost \n100 dissidents. Castro denied these detainees due process and subjected \nthem to secret trials, after which 50 of them received prison sentences \nof up to 28 years.\n  In April, last month, three Cubans hijacked a ferry in an atempt to \nflee Castro's repressive regime. The Cuban Government summarily tried \nthese men behind closed doors and then had them shot by firing squads.\n  Journalists have endured especially severe punishment from Castro. \nJust last year, his Government killed 25 journalists and threatened, \nharassed, or detained almost 1,500 more.\n  While I wish I could say I just told you about all the atrocities of \nhis regime, I have not even come close. The list goes on and on and on.\n  As I said earlier, today is the 101st observance of Cuban \nIndependence Day. It should be a celebration of freedom for the Cuban \npeople. Instead, their island has been hijacked by a cruel dictator \nwhose false promises of prosperity have given way to cowardly acts of \nintimidation. The sad truth is the Cuban people are still not free. \nCastro's regime is an insult to the legacy of the Cuban independence \nmovement. As long as he continues to stifle the will of the Cuban \npeople by denying them basic human liberties, any celebration\n\n[[Page S6716]]\n\nof Cuban Independence Day will ring hollow.\n  And so, Mr. President, today is a particularly appropriate day to \ndiscuss ways the United States and the international community can hold \nevil dictators accountable. Since the end of World War II, the United \nStates and other free nations of the world have agreed that individuals \nwho commit crimes against humanity must be held responsible for their \nactions. From Nuremburg to Bosnia to Rwanda, and now Iraq, the \ninternational community, under our leadership, has brought tyrants to \njustice. Why should we treat Fidel Castro any differently?\n  Today, with Senator Ensign, I am submitting a resolution that calls \nupon the State Department and the Organization of American States to \nconvene a tribunal that will try Fidel Castro and other political and \nmilitary leaders of Cuba who have committed crimes against humanity. We \ncannot allow Castro, Hussein, or other dying despots or their \nassociates to hide behind a phony claim of immunity. They have \nwillingly chosen to torture and kill their own people, and it is time \nto hold them accountable for that decision.\n  The Cuban people deserve justice. That includes the many Cuban \nAmericans who came to this country to escape Castro's regime. I have \ncome to know the Cuban-American community very well.\n  We have a large Cuban-American community in Las Vegas. Some of the \nleaders of our State are Cuban Americans. I can recite a long list of \nNevadans who were forced to leave Cuba, who gave up family fortunes, \nprofessional careers, men and women who worked by their hands, who were \nwilling to brave the 90-mile journey across the ocean to freedom. They \nleft their homeland because of Fidel Castro's oppression. Many of these \npeople have gone on to become leading figures in Nevada.\n  One of these people, who is like a father to Senator Ensign and is a \ndear friend of mine, is a man by the name of Tony Alamo. Tony Alamo \nstill speaks with an accent, even though he has been in this country \nfor a long time. That accent dignifies this great man. He is a person \nwho has achieved greatness in Nevada. But he started in Reno as a \njanitor. He worked his way up. He dealt cards. He educated himself. He \nis a man of letters. He understands important issues, and he is \nextremely engaged in global current events.\n  Today he is No. 3 in the hierarchy of one of the largest resort \ncompanies in the world, Mandalay Bay, a property that has tens of \nthousands of hotel rooms in Nevada. He has worked in the past as a \ncorporate officer in the MGM company. He is one of the leaders of the \nState's tourist society. He has two fine young children, a son, Tony, \nJr., who is a physician, and a daughter who also is well educated and \ninvolved in Nevada's business community.\n  Tony Alamo and his family are living examples of all the good Cuban \nAmericans have done for our country. But he still loves Cuba. Even \nthough he will never return there--he is an American through and \nthrough--he still loves his homeland and detests what Fidel Castro has \ndone to it.\n  I hope the Senate understands what an evil person Castro is, and what \nhorrible things he has done to the people of Cuba. I hope this \nresolution is taken to the Foreign Relations Committee, that hearings \nare held, and that it is reported out favorably so that we can vote on \nit on the Senate floor.\n  I again express my appreciation for the sacrifices made today by \nSenator Ensign. He has traveled to Florida to fulfill what both he and \nI believe is an extremely important responsibility--to represent the \nSenate on the 101st observance of Cuban Independence Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/20/senate-section/article/S6716-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 147--TO AUTHORIZE REPRESENTATION BY THE SENATE LEGAL \n            COUNSEL IN THE CASE OF JOHN JENKEL V.

DESIGNATION OF AMERICA'S NATIONAL WORLD WAR II \n                   MUSEUM.\n\n         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n         (1) The National D-Day Museum, operated in New Orleans, \n     Louisiana by an educational foundation, has been established \n     with the vision ``to celebrate the American Spirit''.\n         (2) The National D-Day Museum is the only museum in the \n     United States that exists for the exclusive purpose of \n     interpreting the American experience during the World War II \n     years (1939-1945) on both the battlefront and the home front \n     and, in doing so, covers all of the branches of the Armed \n     Forces and the Merchant Marine.\n         (3) The National D-Day Museum was founded by the \n     preeminent American historian, Stephen E. Ambrose, as a \n     result of a conversation with President Dwight D. Eisenhower \n     in 1963, when the President and former Supreme Commander, \n     Allied Expeditionary Forces in Europe, credited Andrew \n     Jackson Higgins, the chief executive officer of Higgins \n     Industries in New Orleans, as the ``man who won the war for \n     us'' because the 12,000 landing craft designed by Higgins \n     Industries made possible all of the amphibious invasions of \n     World War II and carried American soldiers into every theatre \n     of the war.\n         (4) The National D-Day Museum, since its grand opening on \n     June 6, 2000, the 56th anniversary of the D-Day invasion of \n     Normandy, has attracted nearly 1,000,000 visitors from around \n     the world, 85 percent of whom have been Americans from across \n     the country.\n         (5) American World War II veterans, called the ``greatest \n     generation'' of the Nation, are dying at the rapid rate of \n     more than 1,200 veterans each day, creating an urgent need to \n     preserve the stories, artifacts, and heroic achievements of \n     that generation.\n         (6) The United States has a need to preserve forever the \n     knowledge and history of the Nation's most decisive \n     achievement in the 20th century and to portray that history \n     to citizens, visitors, and school children for centuries to \n     come.\n         (7) Congress, recognizing the need to preserve this \n     knowledge and history, appropriated funds in 1992 to \n     authorize the design and construction of The National D-Day \n     Museum in New Orleans to commemorate the epic 1944 Normandy \n     invasion, and subsequently appropriated additional funds in \n     1998, 2000, 2001, and 2002, to help expand the exhibits in \n     the museum to include the D-Day invasions in the Pacific \n     Theatre of Operations and the other campaigns of World War \n     II.\n         (8) The State of Louisiana and thousands of donors and \n     foundations across the country have contributed millions of \n     dollars to help build this national institution.\n         (9) The Board of Trustees of The National D-Day Museum is \n     national in scope and diverse in its makeup.\n         (10) The World War II Memorial now under construction on \n     the National Mall in Washington, the District of Columbia, \n     will always be the memorial in our Nation where people come \n     to remember America's sacrifices in World War II, while The \n     National D-Day Museum will always be the museum of the \n     American experience in the World War II years (1939-1945), \n     where people come to learn about Americans' experiences \n     during that critical period, as well as a place where the \n     history of our Nation's monumental struggle against worldwide \n     aggression by would-be oppressors is preserved so that future \n     generations can understand the role the United States played \n     in the preservation and advancement of democracy and freedom \n     in the middle of the 20th century.\n         (11) The National D-Day Museum seeks to educate a diverse \n     group of audiences through its collection of artifacts, \n     photographs, letters, documents, and first-hand personal \n     accounts of the participants in the war and on the home front \n     during one of history's darkest hours.\n         (12) The National D-Day Museum is devoted to the combat \n     experience of United States citizen soldiers in all of the \n     theatres of World War II and to the heroic efforts of the men \n     and women on the home front who worked tirelessly to support \n     the troops and the war effort.\n         (13) The National D-Day Museum continues to add to and \n     maintain one of the largest personal history collections in \n     the United States of the men and women who fought in World \n     War II and who served on the home front.\n         (14) No other museum describes as well the volunteer \n     spirit that arose throughout the United States and united the \n     country during the World War II years.\n         (15) The National D-Day Museum is engaged in a 250,000 \n     square foot expansion to include the Center for the Study of \n     the American Spirit, an advanced format theatre, and a new \n     United States pavilion.\n         (16) The planned ``We're All in this Together'' exhibit \n     will describe the role every State, commonwealth, and \n     territory played in World War II, and the computer database \n     and software of The National D-Day Museum's educational \n     program will be made available to the teachers and school \n     children of every State, commonwealth, and territory.\n         (17) The National D-Day Museum is an official Smithsonian \n     affiliate institution with a formal agreement to borrow \n     Smithsonian artifacts for future exhibitions.\n         (18) Le Memorial de Caen in Normandy, France has formally \n     recognized The National D-Day Museum as its official partner \n     in a Patriotic Alliance signed on October 16, 2002, by both \n     museums.\n         (19) The official Battle of the Bulge museums in \n     Luxembourg and the American Battlefield Monuments Commission \n     are already collaborating with The National D-Day Museum on \n     World War II exhibitions.\n         (20) Congress made available $4,200,000 in fiscal year \n     2002 and $3,000,000 in fiscal year 2003 in Department of \n     Defense appropriations Acts for the purpose of planning the \n     expansion of The National D-Day Museum to tell the untold \n     stories from the campaigns of World War II, and to design new \n     exhibits on the war on land, at sea, and in the air, the \n     China-Burma-India theatre, the Japanese invasion of Alaska's \n     Aleutian Islands, the roles of women and African-Americans in \n     World War II, and other relevant subjects.\n         (21) For all of these reasons, it is appropriate to \n     designate The National D-Day Museum as ``America's National \n     World War II Museum''.\n         (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are, through \n     the designation of The National D-Day Museum as ``America's \n     National World War II Museum'', to express the United States \n     Government's support for--\n         (1) the continuing preservation, maintenance, and \n     interpretation of the artifacts, documents, images, and \n     history collected by the museum;\n         (2) the education of the American people as to the \n     American experience in combat and on the home front during \n     the World War II years, including the conduct of educational \n     outreach programs for teachers and students throughout the \n     United States;\n         (3) the operation of a premier facility for the public \n     display of artifacts, photographs, letters, documents, and \n     personal histories from the World War II years (1939-1945);\n         (4) the further expansion of the current European and \n     Pacific campaign exhibits in the museum, including the Center \n     for the Study of the American Spirit for education; and\n         (5) ensuring the understanding by all future generations \n     of the magnitude of the American contribution to the Allied \n     victory in World War II, the sacrifices made to preserve \n     freedom and democracy, and the benefits of peace for all \n     future generations in the 21st century and beyond.\n         (c) Designation of ``America's National World War II \n     Museum''.--The National D-Day Museum, New Orleans, Louisiana, \n     is designated as ``America's National World War II Museum''.\n

Retrospective adjustment.--The process \n     established under paragraph (1) shall allow for making \n     payments under this section for each quarter of fiscal year \n     2004 on the basis of advance estimates of expenditures \n     submitted by applicants for such payments and such other \n     investigation as the Secretary may find necessary, and for \n     making reductions or increases in the payments as necessary \n     to adjust for any overpayment or underpayment for prior \n     quarters of such fiscal year.\n       (e) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Hospital.--The term ``hospital'' has the meaning given \n     such term in section 1861(e) of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395x(e)).\n       (2) Indian tribe;

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON REPEALING THE 1993 TAX HIKE \n                   ON SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS SECTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--(1) The 1993 tax on social security benefits \n     was imposed as part of President Clinton's agenda to raise \n     taxes.\n       (2) The original 1993 tax hike on social security benefits \n     was to raise income taxes on social security retirees with as \n     little as $25,000 of income.\n       (3) Repeated efforts to repeal the 1993 tax hike on social \n     security benefits have failed.\n       (4) Seniors rely on social security benefits as well as \n     dividend income to fund their retirement and they should have \n     taxes reduced on both sources of income.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Senate Finance Committee should report out the \n     Social Security Benefits Tax Relief Act of 2003, S. 514, to \n     repeal the tax on seniors not later than July 31, 2003, and \n     the Senate shall consider such bill not later than September \n     30, 2003, in a manner consistent with the preservation of the \n     Medicare Trust Fund.\n\n     SEC. 530. FLAT TAX.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The current Internal Revenue Code, with its myriad \n     deductions, credits and schedules, and over 17,000 pages of \n     rules and regulations, is long overdue for an overhaul.\n       (2) The current Internal Revenue Code has over \n     6,900,000,000 words compared to the bible at 1,773,000 words, \n     the Declaration of Independence at 1,300 words, The \n     Gettysburg Address at 267 words, and the Pledge of Allegiance \n     at only 31 words.\n       (3) It is an unacceptable waste of our Nation's precious \n     resources when Americans spend more than 5,800,000,000 hours \n     every year compiling information and filling out Internal \n     Revenue Code tax forms. In addition, taxpayers spend \n     $194,000,000,000 each year in tax code compliance. America's \n     resources could be dedicated to far more productive pursuits.\n       (4) The primary goal of any tax reform is to promote growth \n     and remove the inefficiencies of the current tax code. The \n     flat tax will expand the economy by an estimated \n     $2,000,000,000,000 over seven years.\n       (5) Another important goal of the flat tax is to achieve \n     fairness, with a single low flat tax rate for all individuals \n     and businesses.\n       (6) Simplicity is another critically important goal of the \n     flat tax, and it is in the public interest to have a ten-\n     lined tax form that fits on a postcard and takes 10 minutes \n     to fill out.\n       (7) A comprehensive analyses of our tax structure has \n     concluded that a flat tax of 19 percent could be imposed upon \n     individuals and be revenue neutral.\n       (8) If the decision is made to include deductibility on \n     items such as interest on home mortgages and charitable \n     contributions, the flat tax would be raised from a 19 percent \n     to a 20 percent rate to accommodate the deductions and remain \n     revenue neutral.\n       (9) The flat tax would tax business at a 20 percent rate on \n     net profits and be revenue neutral and lead to investment \n     decisions being made on the basis of productivity rather than \n     for tax avoidance.\n\n[[Page S6772]]\n\n       (10) The flat tax would lead to the elimination of the \n     capital gains tax. This would become a powerful incentive for \n     savings and investment--which translates into economic growth \n     and expansion, more and better jobs, and raising the standard \n     of living for all Americans.\n       (11) The flat tax would lower the cost of capital by \n     allowing businesses to write off the cost of capital purchase \n     in the same year the purchase was made as opposed to \n     complying with complicated depreciation schedules.\n       (12) By eliminating the double tax on dividends, the flat \n     tax eliminates the distortions in the tax code favoring debt \n     over equity financing by businesses.\n       (13) The flat tax would eliminate the estate and gift tax. \n     With the elimination of the estate and gift tax, family-held \n     businesses will be much more stable under the flat tax \n     system.\n       (14) As tax loopholes are eliminated and the tax code is \n     simplified, there will be far less opportunity for tax \n     avoidance and fraud, which now amounts to over \n     $120,000,000,000 in uncollected revenue annually.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Economic \n     Committee should undertake a comprehensive analysis of \n     simplification including flat tax proposals, including \n     appropriate hearings and consider legislation providing for a \n     flat tax.\n\n     SEC. 531.
